Knott, against defendant-appellant and cross-appellee, Revolution Software, Inc. (\u201cRevSoft\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-16\">{\u00b6 2} The relevant factual and procedural history follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-17\">{\u00b6 3} This case concerns a stock-purchase agreement entered into between the parties on October 12, 2001. RevSoft is in the business of providing computer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>software development and consulting. RevSoft is owned by Richard Snide and Polly Clavijo. At the time the parties entered into the agreement, Knott was an employee of RevSoft in its PC division. The agreement was also signed by another PC division employee, Michael Ravagnani, a nonparty. The agreement was drafted by Ms. Clavijo\u2019s husband, Carlos Clavijo, a certified public accountant who performed consulting services for RevSoft.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">{\u00b6 4} On July 3, 2003, Knott was terminated for reasons unrelated to his work. Following termination, RevSoft refused to honor the agreement in any respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">{\u00b6 5} On November 4, 2003, Knott filed a complaint against RevSoft that stated a cause of action for breach of the contract and sought damages. The breach was based upon Knott\u2019s right to purchase shares of authorized and not-yet-issued stock, equal to the outstanding shares of RevSoft, at a time and price determined by the terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">{\u00b6 6} A trial on the issue of liability only was conducted before a magistrate on July 19, 2005. By decision dated July 29, 2005, the magistrate recommended that judgment be entered in favor of Knott on his claim for breach of contract, as RevSoft had failed to comply with the terms of the agreement. RevSoft filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. On May 10, 2006, the trial court overruled the objections and affirmed the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">{\u00b6 7} The trial court referred the matter to the magistrate to conduct a trial on the issue of damages. On June 1, 2007, the magistrate issued a decision finding that Knott was entitled to purchase 25 percent of the total stock of RevSoft and, as a result of RevSoft\u2019s breach, awarded Knott damages in the amount of $424,000. Both parties filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. On September 27, 2007, the trial court overruled the objections with the exception related to the magistrate\u2019s error in failing to find that RevSoft is a Subchapter S corporation. Thereupon, the trial court entered judgment in favor of Knott in the amount of $424,000. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">{\u00b6 8} Appellant raises three assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cI.

The decision below erred in failing to award Mr. Knott prejudgment interest on this contract damages. Mag. Dec. 6-1-07, R. 227, judg entry 9-27-07, R. 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cII. The decision below erred in determining Mr. Knott\u2019s damages based on a 25% ownership interest in Revsoft, rather than a 50% interest. Magistrate decision, June 1, 2007 (\u2018Mag Dec 6-1-07\u2019), R. 227; judgment entry sustaining in part and overruling in part plaintiffs objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision and overruling the defendant\u2019s objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision and judgment entry adopting in part the magistrate\u2019s decision, September 27, 2007 (\u2018Judg entry 9-27-07\u2019), R. 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cHI. The decision below erred by determining Mr. Knott\u2019s damages based on tax treatment as a Chapter C corporation, rather than a Subchapter S corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">{\u00b6 16} We begin with RevSoft\u2019s first assignment of error, in which RevSoft argues that the trial court erred in concluding that RevSoft breached the agreement. RevSoft contends that Knott failed to meet conditions precedent set forth in the agreement. Specifically, RevSoft asserts that Knott did not have a right to buy stock until conditions concerning employee and revenue targets for the PC division were met in each of five separate years (not necessarily consecutive) and then only if Knott tendered and fully paid a promissory note for the purchase price in an amount determined under a formula provided in the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">{\u00b6 17} It was undisputed by the parties that Knott met the established targets for three years: 1999, 2000, and 2002. RevSoft contends that the earliest Knott could have earned the right to purchase stock would have been the beginning of 2005 if the targets were met in both 2003 and 2004. However, Knott was terminated in mid-2003, so the targets in 2003 and 2004 were not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">{\u00b6 18} At trial and on appeal, the parties do not dispute that there was a contract between the parties; that Knott was terminated by RevSoft; that RevSoft informed Knott that he had no right to tender any cash or promissory note to RevSoft in exchange for the stock because he was no longer an employee; and that RevSoft abolished the PC division shortly after Knott\u2019s termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>{\u00b6 19} The trial court affirmed the magistrate\u2019s finding that Knott\u2019s employment was not a necessary condition, as the agreement did not specifically state that it was contingent upon Knott\u2019s employment and further, that the agreement required RevSoft to renegotiate the targets if an employee, including Knott, left RevSoft. There is also no dispute that RevSoft did not renegotiate the targets upon Knott\u2019s departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">{\u00b6 20} On appeal, RevSoft argues that the trial court erred in finding that RevSoft anticipatorily repudiated the contract and rendered performance by Knott impossible. The trial court characterized RevSoft\u2019s position that it did not incur any contractual obligation because the conditions precedent were not met as \u201cfeckless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">{\u00b6 21} We note that stock options are contractual rights that an employer grants as a benefit to an employee to provide compensation for services or to provide incentives. Generally, a stock option may be defined as a right to buy a designated stock at any time within a specified period at a determinable price if the holder of the option chooses. Since stock options are contracts, we apply contract law.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">{\u00b6 22} In <em>Suter v. Farmers Fertilizer Co. </em>(1919), 100 Ohio St. 403, 126 N.E. 304, the Ohio Supreme Court held that a party cannot avoid liability under a contract if that person has done some act that prevents the carrying out of the contract according to its terms. See also <em>Long v. Commodore Bank </em>(Jan. 15, 2002), 5th Dist. No. 01-CA-14, 2002 WL 109289.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cA repudiation or other total breach by one party enables the other to get a judgment for damages or for restitution without performing acts that would otherwise have been conditions precedent.\u201d <em>Stonehenge Land v. Beazer Homes Invests., </em>177 Ohio App.3d 7, 2008-Ohio-148, 893 N.E.2d 855, \u00b6 26, citing 5 Corbin on Contracts (1951) 920, 922, Section 977. \u201cOn this principle, Ohio courts have concluded that the \u2018renunciation of a contract by one of the parties constitutes a breach of contract which gives rise to a cause of action for damages, and in such a case notice, demand and tender are waived.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) Id. See also <em>White Hat Mgt., L.L.C. v. Ohio Farmers Ins. Co., </em>167 Ohio App.3d 663, 2006-Ohio-3280, 856 N.E.2d 991, \u00b6 22 (a repudiation relieves the other party of its duty to fulfill conditions precedent).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">{\u00b6 24} Furthermore, \u201cwhen the facts presented in a case are undisputed, whether they constitute performance or a breach of the contract, is a question of law for the court.\u201d <em>Luntz v. Stern </em>(1939) 135 Ohio St. 225, 237, 14 O.O. 62, 20 N.E.2d 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">{\u00b6 25} The trial court succinctly summarized the evidence of RevSoft\u2019s repudiation of the agreement as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>{\u00b6 26} \u201cAny voluntarily affirmative act, which renders substantial performance of the contractual duties apparently impossible amounts to an anticipatory repudiation. In this case, several acts could amount to such a voluntary act: the disbandment of the PC division, the failure to calculate the targets after Knott was fired, the failure to renegotiate the targets in good faith after Knott was fired, and Mr. Clavijo\u2019s e-mailed letter stating that Knott had no right to tender a promissory note in exchange for stock. Moreover, the testimony of Ms. Clavijo that the contract was no longer valid after the Plaintiff was fired is further evidence of the Defendant\u2019s repudiation.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">{\u00b6 27} RevSoft contends that by finding it repudiated the agreement, the trial court wrote a new contract, one without conditions. However, RevSoft concedes that the act of informing Knott that he had no right to tender a promissory note in exchange for stock may be an act of repudiation and that its failure to recalculate the targets after Knott was terminated could have been a breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">{\u00b6 28} RevSoft further argues no repudiation or act on its part contributed materially to the nonoccurrence of any condition precedent and that Knott did not prove his ability to perform his obligation of tendering and paying in full a promissory note.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">{\u00b6 29} Here, the evidence was unequivocal that RevSoft completely repudiated the agreement upon terminating Knott. Under Ohio law, this gives rise to a cause of action for damages. It further excused Knott from tendering and paying in full a promissory note. The evidence further reflects that RevSoft failed to make a good faith effort to perform under the terms of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">{\u00b6 30} Lastly, RevSoft contends that Knott failed to produce proof that he was ready, willing, and able to pay the purchase price. Interestingly, RevSoft objected to a question posed to Knott by his counsel on this very issue at trial. RevSoft argued that such testimony was irrelevant. Id. In addition, RevSoft did not raise this issue in its motion for dismissal at the end of the liability phase or its objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. Therefore, this court need not address this argument because RevSoft did not raise it at the trial court level. Nevertheless, we find that sufficient evidence was presented by Knott to demonstrate that he was ready to perform but that RevSoft made it clear it was not honoring the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">{\u00b6 31} Accordingly, RevSoft\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">II and III</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">{\u00b6 32} Because they are interrelated, we will address RevSoft\u2019s second and third assignments of error together.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>{\u00b6 33} In support of its second assignment of error, RevSoft contends that the trial court erred in denying its motions for directed verdict made at the end of the liability and damages phase. In its third assignment of error, it maintains that the trial court erred in permitting the plaintiffs expert testimony of Gary Moll to establish Knott\u2019s damages. Without this expert testimony, RevSoft argues, Knott has failed to establish damages, and it was entitled to a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">{\u00b6 34} As a motion for directed verdict lies only in a jury trial, we will treat this assignment of error as one arguing that the court erred in failing to grant a dismissal under Civ.R. 41(B)(2), which permits dismissal on the ground that \u201cupon the facts and the law the plaintiff has shown no right to relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">{\u00b6 35} With respect to the liability phase of the trial, RevSoft restates the arguments raised above, namely that Knott failed to present evidence that the targets were met or could have been met any year after he was terminated and that he had the ability to tender and pay in full a promissory note for the purchase price of the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">{\u00b6 36} We find that at the end of Knott\u2019s case-in-chief, sufficient evidence was introduced in support of the elements for breach of contract. These include the existence of a written contract between the parties, repudiation by RevSoft, and damage to Knott. Also, as stated earlier, repudiation of the agreement relieved Knott of its duty to fulfill conditions precedent. <em>White Hat Mgt, L.L.C., </em>167 Ohio App.3d 663, 2006-Ohio-3280, 856 N.E.2d 991, \u00b6 22. Therefore, the magistrate did not err in denying RevSoft\u2019s motion for a dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">{\u00b6 37} In regards to the damages phase, RevSoft contends in its third assignment of error that the testimony of Gary Moll was speculative, unreliable, and based upon inadequate foundation. Without this expert testimony, RevSoft argues, it was entitled to a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">{\u00b6 38} At trial, RevSoft moved to strike Moll\u2019s testimony as well as his reports because Moll\u2019s \u201centire report was premised on the assumption that the targets were met through December 31, 2004.\u201d RevSoft contends that this is an inaccurate assumption that violates Evid.R. 702(C) because an expert\u2019s report must be based upon reliable information. Secondly, RevSoft claims that Moll\u2019s inaccurate projections as to RevSoft\u2019s revenue, net income, assets, and capitalization were in error and grossly inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">{\u00b6 39} Evid.R. 702 provides that a witness may testify as an expert if all of the following apply:</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">{\u00b6 40} \u201c(A) The witness\u2019 testimony either relates to matters beyond the knowledge or experience possessed by lay persons or dispels a misconception common among lay persons;</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>{\u00b6 41} \u201c(B) The witness is qualified as an expert by specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony;</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">{\u00b6 42} \u201c(C) The witness\u2019 testimony is based on reliable scientific, technical, or other specialized information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">{\u00b6 43} Evid.R. 703 further provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cThe facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by the expert or admitted in evidence at the hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\"> {\u00b6 45} A trial court\u2019s role in determining whether an expert\u2019s testimony is admissible under Evid.R. 702(C) focuses on whether the opinion is based upon principles and methods that are reliable, not whether the expert\u2019s conclusions are correct or whether the testimony satisfies the proponent\u2019s burden of proof at trial. <em>Miller v. Bike Athletic Co. </em>(1998), 80 Ohio St.3d 607, 611, 687 N.E.2d 735. The decision remains with the trial court judge and will be overturned on appeal only for abuse of discretion. Id. at 616, 687 N.E.2d 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">{\u00b6 46} We also are mindful that this was a bench trial, not a jury trial, and we afford broad leeway to the trial court in deciding the reliability of particular expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">{\u00b6 47} As an initial matter, RevSoft does not challenge Moll\u2019s qualifications as a damages expert in this case. Moll, a certified public accountant and business valuator, testified as to the fair market value of RevSoft as of December 31, 2004, and the economic loss resulting to Knott from his inability to purchase an ownership interest in the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">{\u00b6 48} Moll\u2019s analysis determined that $3,600,000 would be a conservative fair market valuation of RevSoft. This was determined by using the discounted cash flow method based on the actual and forecasted cash flow of the company.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The fair market value was determined as \u201cthe price, in cash or equivalent, that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>buyer could reasonably be expected to pay, and a seller could reasonably be expected to accept, if the property were exposed for sale on the open market for a reasonable period of time, buyer and seller each being in possession of the pertinent facts, and neither being under a compulsion to act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">{\u00b6 49} He then offered two separate valuations of damages: \u201cmost reasonable methodology\u201d value ($599,900); and a \u201cmore conservative methodology\u201d value ($424,000). The difference between the two values related to a \u201clack of control discount\u201d and \u201clack of marketability discount\u201d which was utilized in the more conservative methodology.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">{\u00b6 50} The record reflects that Moll was subject to vigorous, thorough cross-examination, and RevSoft presented a differing view through its expert, J. Michael Nesser, also a certified public account.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">{\u00b6 51} The trial court found Moll\u2019s testimony credible and that RevSoft did not offer any credible evidence to contradict the testimony of Moll and his valuation of Knott\u2019s damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">{\u00b6 52} We recognize, as did the trial court, that Moll made projections based upon certain assumptions (i.e., Knott\u2019s remaining employed with RevSoft and Knott being able to purchase RevSoft stock after December 31, 2004), as opposed to RevSoft\u2019s actual financial data after Knott\u2019s termination and the disbandment of the PC division. However, we are not convinced that such an approach is inappropriate in a case of this nature, where one party repudiates a contract and the contract does not contain a liquidated-damages provision. Our research reveals support for the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">{\u00b6 53} In <em>Acoustic Marketing Research, Inc. v. Technics, L.L.C. </em>(Colo.2008), 198 P.3d 96, a case involving lost future royalties, the Colorado Supreme Court recently held:</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cIn a breach of contract action, the measure of damages is the amount it takes to place the plaintiff in the position it would have occupied had the breach not occurred. * * * However, damages are not recoverable for losses beyond an amount that can be established with reasonable certainty. * * * Recognizing the \u2018practical difficulties of proving future losses with precision,\u2019 we have held that a plaintiff seeking future damages must provide the trier of fact with \u2018(1) proof of the fact that damages will accrue in the future, and (2) sufficient admissible evidence which would enable the trier of fact to compute a fair approximation of the loss.\u2019 * * * In sum, as long as the fact of future loss is certain, the amount of damages awarded may be an approximation.\u201d Id. at 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">{\u00b6 55} Overall, in a case of this nature, we find that Moll\u2019s opinion on damages was not rendered unreliable by assumptions based upon a continuation, as opposed to a termination, of the agreement. Moll was able to make projec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>tions based upon several years of actual financial data regarding RevSoft\u2019s future revenue and value in 2003 and 2004. In addition, such projections were necessary due to RevSoft\u2019s repudiation of the agreement and subsequent acts such as the dissolution of the PC Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">{\u00b6 56} Our review of Moll\u2019s testimony shows that his methods were sufficiently reliable to meet the admissibility threshold. Any weakness in his data and methodologies were exposed upon cross-examination and went to the weight and credibility of his testimony, which was determined by the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">{\u00b6 57} Accordingly, RevSoft\u2019s second and third assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Cross-Appeal I</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">{\u00b6 58} We now move on to the first assignment of error raised by Knott. He claims that the trial court incorrectly denied him prejudgment interest on his contract damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">{\u00b6 59} A trial court\u2019s authority to award prejudgment interest on a breach-of-contract claim is governed by R.C. 1343.03(A), which provides that a creditor is entitled to interest at the statutory rate \u201cwhen money becomes due and payable upon any * * * instruments of writing * * * and upon all judgments * * * of any judicial tribunal for the payment of money arising out of * * * a contract or other transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">{\u00b6 60} The Ohio Supreme Court has held, \u201cThe award of prejudgment interest is compensation to the plaintiff for the period of time between the accrual of the claim and judgment, regardless of whether the judgment is based on a claim which was liquidated or unliquidated and even if the sum due was not capable of ascertainment until determined by the court.\u201d <em>Royal Elec. Constr. Corp. v. Ohio State Univ. </em>(1995) 73 Ohio St.3d 110, 117, 652 N.E.2d 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">{\u00b6 61} \u201c \u2018[O]nce a plaintiff receives judgment on a contract claim, the trial court has no discretion but to award prejudgment interest under R.C. 1343.03(A).\u2019 \u201d <em>Zeck v. Sokol, </em>9th Dist. No. 07CA0030-M, 2008-Ohio-727, 2008 WL 495481, at \u00b6 44, quoting <em>Zunshine v. Cott, </em>10th Dist. No. 06AP-868, 2007-Ohio-1475, 2007 WL 926969, at \u00b6 22. \u201cThe only issue for resolution by a trial court with respect to prejudgment interest under R.C. 1343.03(A) is how much interest is due.\u201d <em>Zunshine, </em>2007-Ohio-1475, 2007 WL 926969, at \u00b6 26. \u201cThus, the trial court\u2019s discretion with respect to an award of prejudgment interest on a contract claim extends only to the factual determinations of when interest commences to run and what interest rate applies.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>{\u00b6 62} As a matter of law, appellant was entitled to prejudgment interest. The trial court, therefore, erred when it concluded that Knott was not entitled to recover prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">{\u00b6 63} Knott\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">{\u00b6 64} In the second assignment of error, Knott contends that the trial court erred in determining Knott\u2019s damages based on a 25 percent, rather than a 50 percent, ownership interest, because Ravagnani did not pursue his 25 percent interest under the agreement. Knott contends that this court should reverse and direct entry of judgment doubling the damage award. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">{\u00b6 65} The agreement provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cThe following details the agreement between Pat Knott and Mike Ravagnani (New Owners) and Revolution Softward, Inc. (RevSoft). Rick Snide and Polly [Clavijo] (Original Owners), as owners of RevSoft, agree to the terms of this agreement. The New Owners wish to purchase, and RevSoft agrees to issue new shares of RevSoft stock on January 1, 2004 (or later, as described herein). The document describes the procedures for determining the timing and price.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">{\u00b6 67} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">{\u00b6 68} \u201cOnce the five yearly calculations are made, the New Owners and Original Owners agree that the New Owners may purchase restricted shares from RevSoft. They will purchase enough shares such that they will own 50% of the outstanding shares of RevSoft * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">{\u00b6 69} \u201cAll of the above has treated the New Owners as one. However, it is understood that there are two New Owners. All amounts and items referred to above will be separated by New Owner when and where appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">{\u00b6 70} The trial court found that this last provision indicates that all amounts would be separated by the new owners, Knott and Ravagnani. \u201cWhile it does not give a percentage breakdown for the separation, it is not an unreasonable inference, based upon the evidence presented and the totality of the circumstances of the case, that the Magistrate found that the Plaintiff was entitled only to 25% ownership interest. Given the terms of the contract and the circumstances, it is reasonable for the Magistrate to award 25% interest, where awarding 50% interest would entitle the Plaintiff to more interest in RevSoft than Mr. Snide and Ms. Clavijo individually hold, which was never the intent of the agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-13\">{\u00b6 71} In the field of contract interpretation, clear and unambiguous contractual language is applied without consideration of extrinsic evidence, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>such plain language is reviewed de novo. <em>Shifrin v. Forest City Ent., Inc. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 635, 638, 597 N.E.2d 499. If a contract is reasonably susceptible of more than one meaning, then it is ambiguous and extrinsic evidence of reasonableness or intent can be employed. Id. Words and phrases are given their common and ordinary meanings absent specific contractual definitions. <em>Steubenville v. Jefferson Cty., </em>7th Dist. No. 05JE23, 2005-Ohio-6596, 2005 WL 3370602, \u00b6 20, citing <em>King v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 208, 212, 519 N.E.2d 1380 (words in a contract are given their ordinary meaning unless manifest absurdity would result or an alternative meaning is clearly demonstrated in the contract).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">{\u00b6 72} Knott contends that the clear language of the agreement makes evident that he should be awarded a 50 percent share of RevSoft, as Ravagnani has not asserted any rights under the agreement and was dismissed from the underlying lawsuit at his insistence. Knott further contends that the agreement created a \u201cconveyance to a partnership\u201d or \u201ccreated a tenancy in common\u201d between Knott and Ravagnani.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">{\u00b6 73} We are not persuaded by Knott\u2019s arguments, although we agree the contract is not ambiguous and that its interpretation is a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">{\u00b6 74} Reading the contract as a whole, we find it clear that together Knott and Ravagnani were entitled to purchase a 50 percent stake in RevSoft; however, individually, each was entitled to only 25 percent. The agreement provided that \u201c[a]ll amounts and items referred to above will be separated by New Owner when and where appropriate.\u201d The contract language sets forth an understanding that the New Owners have separate rights under the agreement and that the exercise of those rights is to be treated separately. Furthermore, simply because Ravagnani did not exercise his contractual rights does not mean that Knott succeeded to those rights. We find no language in the agreement to support that intention, and in fact, the express language of the agreement negates that position. If the language of a contract is clear and unambiguous, courts must enforce the instrument as written. <em>Hybud Equip. Corp. v. Sphere Drake Ins. Co., Ltd. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 657, 665, 597 N.E.2d 1096.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">{\u00b6 75} Knott\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">{\u00b6 76} In his third assignment of error, Knott argues that Moll\u2019s valuation of RevSoft and his calculation of Knott\u2019s damages, which treated RevSoft as a Chapter C corporation, should have been recalculated by the trial court to reflect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>RevSoft\u2019s status as a Subchapter S corporation. The trial court declined to do so under the \u201cinvited error\u201d doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">{\u00b6 77} The record reflects that Knott did not raise the issue of whether RevSoft should be treated as a Chapter C or Subchapter S corporation for tax purposes either before or during trial. Knott initially raised this issue to the magistrate in his posttrial brief submitted after the damages hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">{\u00b6 78} At that time, Knott suggested to the magistrate that Moll\u2019s valuation of RevSoft, and subsequently his calculation of Knott\u2019s damages, would depend on the magistrate\u2019s ruling on three threshold legal issues: (1) whether RevSoft should be treated as a Subchapter S corporation or as a Chapter C corporation for purposes of taxing income, (2) whether minority and marketability discounts should be taken, and (3) whether a buy-in amount should be deducted from Knott\u2019s 50 percent ownership interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">{\u00b6 79} Attached to his brief, was a calculation of RevSoft\u2019s valuation as a Subchapter S corporation (no payment of income tax), which valued RevSoft at $6,200,000, as opposed to Moll\u2019s valuation of RevSoft as a Chapter C corporation at $3,600,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">{\u00b6 80} In his decision of June 1, 2007, the magistrate did not expressly rule upon the \u201clegal issues\u201d; rather, he accepted Moll\u2019s valuation and calculation of Knott\u2019s damages to be $424,000 which was determined based upon Chapter C taxation, a deduction for minority and marketability discounts, and deduction for a buy-in price.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">{\u00b6 81} Under the doctrine of \u201cinvited error,\u201d it is well settled that \u201ca party will not be permitted to take advantage of an error which [he himself] invited or induced the trial court to make.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Smith v. O\u2019Connor </em>(1995), 71 Ohio St.3d 660, 663, 646 N.E.2d 1115, citing <em>State ex rel. Fowler v. Smith </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 357, 359, 626 N.E.2d 950. See also <em>Lester v. Leuck </em>(1943), 142 Ohio St. 91, 26 O.O. 280, 50 N.E.2d 145, paragraph one of the syllabus. As the Ohio Supreme Court has stated: \u201c \u2018The law imposes upon every litigant the duty of vigilance in the trial of a case, and even where the trial court commits an error to his prejudice, he is required then and there to challenge the attention of the court to that error, by excepting thereto, and upon failure of the court to correct the same to cause his exceptions to be noted. It follows, therefore, that, for much graver reasons, a litigant cannot be permitted, either intentionally or unintentionally, to induce or mislead a court into the commission of an error and then procure a reversal of the judgment for an error for which he was actively responsible.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lester </em>at 92-93, 50 N.E.2d 145, quoting <em>State v. Kollar </em>(1915), 93 Ohio St. 89, 91, 112 N.E. 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">{\u00b6 82} The trial court applied the invited-error doctrine and ruled that Knott\u2019s subchapter S analysis \u201cwas never offered into evidence by the Plaintiffs expert or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>any other party during the trial to the Court,\u201d and therefore, \u201cthis theory is unsubstantiated by any expert or evidence before the Magistrate and was properly rejected by the Magistrate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">{\u00b6 88} Based upon our review of the record, we are persuaded that Knott should not be permitted to attempt to reform Moll\u2019s expert testimony. The status of RevSoft as a subchapter S corporation was clearly established at all pertinent times. However, Moll\u2019s expert opinion reports and testimony before the magistrate indicate that treating RevSoft as a Chapter C corporation for valuation purposes was conservative yet appropriate. Therefore, the magistrate was entitled to rely on this competent, credible evidence in reaching his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">{\u00b6 84} Accordingly, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s application of the invited-error doctrine in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">{\u00b6 85} Knott\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">{\u00b6 86} In summary, we overrule RevSoft\u2019s first, second, and third assignments of error; we sustain Knott\u2019s first assignment of error; and we overrule Knott\u2019s second and third assignments of error. We affirm in part and reverse in part the judgments of the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas, and this cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings relating only to the issue of prejudgment interest, consistent with this opinion and the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b566-9\">Farmer, P.J., and Edwajrds, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-12\">. In determining the fair market value, Moll made certain adjustment to RevSoft's earning stream \"in order to make the Company comparable to others in the industry and show the earning stream on a true economic basis.\" Moll stated: \"[W]e have calculated a normal level of taxes for the following reasons: The definition of \u2018fair market value\u2019 makes reference to a transaction between a 'willing buyer and a willing seller.' This definition implies that the universe of participants in this transaction are ALL -potential buyers and sellers. To assume that a buyer of the Company would have the power to maintain current tax structures of the Company would unnecessarily limit the universe of hypothetical willing buyers. The market information used to derive our capitalization is based on information derived from C-corporations, and thus are after consideration of federal taxes.\u201d Moll then \"assumed that the effective tax rate for federal and local taxes is 40.0 percent. The Company is an S-Corporation and taxes are paid by the owners of the business through their personal tax returns. The tax rates assumptions are based on corporate tax rates.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b564-11\">.
