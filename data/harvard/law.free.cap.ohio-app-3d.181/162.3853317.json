A hearing before a magistrate was held on April 24, 2008. By a decision filed April 25, 2008, the magistrate granted the request for forfeiture. A judgment entry and order of distribution affirming the magistrate\u2019s decision was filed on April 30, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>Appellant filed an appeal, and this matter is now before this court for consideration. The assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b195-16\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cThe trial court erred in granting a forfeiture of the money and property of the claimant, Christopher Davis, when the state of Ohio was unable to prove a nexus between property seized and any illegal activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>{\u00b6 4} Appellant claims that the trial court erred in granting the request for forfeiture of the items seized by the Canton Police Department, as the state failed to prove a \u201cnexus\u201d between the items seized and any criminal activity. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">{\u00b6 5} A judgment supported by some competent, credible evidence will not be reversed by a reviewing court as against the manifest weight of the evidence. <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578. A reviewing court must not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court when there exists some competent and credible evidence supporting the judgment rendered by the trial court. <em>Myers v. Garson </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 610, 614 N.E.2d 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">{\u00b6 6} The items seized were $765 in cash, a 2001 Dodge Stratus, a 2005 Chrysler 300, a 1998 Chrysler Sebring, a 1970 Oldsmobile Cutlass, and four tires with chrome rims. In her decision filed April 25, 2008, the magistrate, as affirmed by the trial court, specifically found that the items seized were \u201cderived directly or indirectly from, proceeds that were obtained directly or indirectly from the commission of a felony drug abuse offense, and/or [were] used or intended to be used in a manner to commit, or to facilitate the commission of a felony drug abuse offense.\u201d This conclusion was based upon the following three findings:</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c5. At all relevant times, Christopher Davis had an interest in the subject Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c6. At all relevant times, Christopher Davis had no legitimate source of income with which to purchase or obtain the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c7. Forfeiture of the property is neither excessive nor disproportionate to the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">{\u00b6 10} Although conceding the fact that a felony drug-abuse offense was not charged and that there was no evidence of a felony drug-abuse offense, the state argues that there was \u201cclear and convincing evidence that the property to be forfeited is instrumentality or proceeds of conduct that would constitute a felony drug offense.\u201d R.C. 2925.43.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">{\u00b6 11} R.C. 2981.02 governs property subject to forfeiture. Subsections (A)(2) and (3) and (B)(1), (2), and (3) state the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(A) The following property is subject to forfeiture to the state or a political subdivision under either the criminal or delinquency process in section 2981.04 of the Revised Code or the civil process in section 2981.05 of the Revised Code:</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>{\u00b6 13} \u201c(2) Proceeds derived from or acquired through the commission of an offense;</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(3) An instrumentality that is used in or intended to be used in the commission or facilitation of any of the following offenses when the use or intended use, consistent with division (B) of this section, is sufficient to warrant forfeiture under this chapter:</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(a) A felony;</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(b) A misdemeanor, when forfeiture is specifically authorized by a section of the Revised Code or by a municipal ordinance that creates the offense or sets forth its penalties;</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(c) An attempt to commit, complicity in committing, or a conspiracy to commit an offense of the type described in divisions (A)(3)(a) and (b) of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(B) In determining whether an alleged instrumentality was used in or was intended to be used in the commission or facilitation of an offense or an attempt, complicity, or conspiracy to commit an offense in a manner sufficient to warrant its forfeiture, the trier of fact shall consider the following factors the trier of fact determines are relevant:</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(1) Whether the offense could not have been committed or attempted but for the presence of the instrumentality;</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(2) Whether the primary purpose in using the instrumentality was to commit or attempt to commit the offense;</p>\n<p id=\"b197-12\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c(3) The extent to which the instrumentality furthered the commission of, or attempt to commit, the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-13\">{\u00b6 22} R.C. 2981.05 governs civil forfeiture. Subsection (D) states the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b197-14\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c(D) The court shall issue a civil forfeiture order if it determines that the prosecutor has proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the property is subject to forfeiture under section 2981.02 of the Revised Code, and, after a proportionality review under section 2981.09 of the Revised Code when relevant, the trier of fact specifically describes the extent of the property to be forfeited. A civil forfeiture order shall state that all interest in the property in question of the adult or juvenile who committed the act that is the basis of the order is forfeited to the state or political subdivision and shall make due provision for the interest in that property of any other person, when appropriate under this section. The court may issue any additional order to affect the forfeiture, including, but not limited to, one or more orders under section 2981.06 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>{\u00b6 24} R.C. 2981.09 governs value of property subject to forfeiture. Subsection (A) states the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c(A) Property may not be forfeited as an instrumentality under this chapter to the extent that the amount or value of the property is disproportionate to the severity of the offense. The owner of the property shall have the burden of going forward with the evidence and the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the amount or value of the property subject to forfeiture is disproportionate to the severity of the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">{\u00b6 26} The scope of our review in this case is limited to an examination of the evidence presented to see whether the evidence supports the finding that the items seized were the instrumentality or proceeds of conduct that would constitute a felony drug offense. In addition, our review is also subject to a proportionality review pursuant to R.C. 2981.09(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">{\u00b6 27} John Dittmore, former supervisor of the gang task force, testified that some six months prior to investigating appellant, he had contact with appellant and felt that some of appellant\u2019s activity was \u201csuspicious\u201d or \u201ca little odd.\u201d This suspicious or odd activity consisted of appellant\u2019s walking \u201cout to meet [them] outside of his residence. Immediately [locking] the doors to his truck.\u201d Thereafter, the gang task force received information that appellant was involved in drug activity. During the surveillance, Dittmore observed appellant at the residence of another person who was also involved in drug activity. After appellant returned to his residence, Dittmore observed the removal of a large trash bag from appellant\u2019s vehicle. Dittmore testified that he was \u201cunsure\u201d of what was going on, but said, \u201cWe heard Mr. Davis was involved with trafficking in marijuana, and marijuana is commonly placed in trash bags.\u201d Because appellant was a parolee through the Adult Parole Authority, his parole officer was called in. Appellant was stopped and arrested for a parole violation (not living at parole-approved address). Appellant \u201chad been smoking marijuana in the vehicle at the time.\u201d Thereafter, a search of appellant\u2019s residence disclosed \u201ca small amount of marijuana\u201d for \u201cpersonal use\u201d and \u201ctwo large big black bags with white residue inside the huge bags,\u201d which appeared to be \u201ccocaine residue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">{\u00b6 28} Police seized four motor vehicles, \u201ca set of brand new rims and maybe tires,\u201d and over $700 in cash that was found on appellant\u2019s person. When questioned about the source of the money and vehicles, appellant claimed that the vehicles had been purchased with gambling proceeds from a casino. The police were unable to substantiate that appellant had won some $90,000 to $100,000 at a casino. In fact, appellant \u201cwas unemployed and made statements [that] he had been unemployed for quite some time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">{\u00b6 29} Throughout Dittmore\u2019s testimony, appellant was linked to Michael (\u201cMickey\u201d) Miller. Miller has been the subject of investigations dating back to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>2001 and pleaded guilty in a high-profile case in federal court to numerous counts of money laundering. See also <em>United States v. Monea </em>(Mar. 17, 2008), N.D.Ohio No. 1:07CR30, 2008 WL 731100, fn. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">{\u00b6 30} We find that the magistrate\u2019s decision, as affirmed by the trial court, was a classic case of building an inference upon an inference. Those inferences were not supported by any direct evidence, but only by innuendo. Upon review, we conclude that the decision that the items seized were derived directly or indirectly from the commission of a felony was not supported by the evidence. Having so found, we find no issue relative to R.C. 2981.09(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">{\u00b6 31} The sole assignment of error is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">{\u00b6 32} The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Stark County, Ohio, is hereby reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b199-9\">Gwin and Wise, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
