Vitantonio and others contend that the Lake County Court of Common Pleas erred in dismissing their appeal from the Wickliffe Board of Zoning Appeals for lack of a final, appealable order. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment and remand the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">{\u00b6 2} On August 23, 2006, appellants were cited with multiple notices of property-maintenance violations issued by the city of Wickliffe\u2019s building commissioner. Each notice explained that the failure to come into compliance within ten days could result in the filing of a complaint and summons in the Willoughby Municipal Court. On September 15, 2006, appellants filed a notice of appeal with the Wickliffe Board of Zoning Appeals (\u201cBZA\u201d). The building commissioner subsequently filed four criminal complaints and summonses with the Willoughby Municipal Court on September 19, 2006. While these complaints were pending, on December 28, 2006, the BZA conducted a public hearing on appellants\u2019 notice of appeal. After the hearing, the BZA affirmed the building commissioner\u2019s issuances of violations. On January 24, 2007, appellants filed a notice of appeal to the Lake County Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">{\u00b6 3} On March 7, 2007, the city dismissed the criminal complaints without prejudice for failure of proper service. Subsequently, on March 20, 2007, the city re-filed the criminal complaints and perfected service upon all proper parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">{\u00b6 4} In the meantime, in the action before the court of common pleas, appellee moved to dismiss appellants\u2019 administrative appeal. In a judgment entry dated September 28, 2007, the lower court granted appellee\u2019s motion. The court first pointed out that it did not have jurisdiction to grant the relief sought by appellants, namely, a reversal of the BZA\u2019s determination with the goal of triggering a dismissal to the criminal charges. The trial court stated that the appellants could not use R.C. Chapter 2506 as a vehicle to appeal the issuance of criminal charges. The court further determined:</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c[T]he [BZA\u2019s] decision to sustain the Notices of Violations is not a final order, adjudication or decision of a political subdivision that is appealable under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>R.C. Chapter 2506 because the decision was issued preliminary to a criminal proceeding that is currently pending in the Willoughby Municipal Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">{\u00b6 6} Although it did not specifically rule on the issue, the trial court noted its doubts whether the BZA possessed jurisdiction under the city\u2019s codified ordinance to hear appellants\u2019 appeal. Appellants now appeal, asserting the following assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of plaintiffs-appellants in granting defendant-appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">{\u00b6 8} The grant or denial of a motion to dismiss is a legal conclusion, which an appellate court reviews de novo. <em>Jacobs v. Budak, </em>11th Dist. No. 2007-T-0033, 2008-Ohio-2756, 2008 WL 2332543, \u00b6 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">{\u00b6 9} Under their sole assignment of error, appellants argue that they followed the proper procedural channels for challenging the building commissioner\u2019s citations for property-maintenance violations and therefore the Lake County Court of Common Pleas erred in dismissing their appeal from the BZA\u2019s decision. Specifically, appellants maintain that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the BZA\u2019s decision was not a final, appealable order was error. Appellants\u2019 argument has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">{\u00b6 10} R.C. 2506.01, the statute governing appeals from decisions of any agency of a political subdivision, allows for the administrative appeal of any \u201cfinal order, adjudication, or decision.\u201d A final order, adjudication, or decision is defined as any \u201corder, adjudication, or decision that determines rights, duties, privileges, benefits, or legal relationships of a person, <em>but does not include </em>* * * <em>any order, adjudication, or decision that is issued preliminary to or as a result of a criminal proceeding.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) R.C. 2506.01(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">{\u00b6 11} Here, approximately one month after appellants were given notice of multiple building-maintenance violations, the building commissioner filed several criminal complaints and summonses in the Willoughby Municipal Court. The criminal proceedings had commenced at the time the BZA issued its decision affirming the building commissioner\u2019s citations on December 28, 2006. Consequently, as the criminal proceedings remained pending against appellants at the time of the BZA\u2019s decision, the trial court concluded that the BZA\u2019s decision was \u201cpreliminary\u201d to those proceedings, thus rendering that decision not final and appealable pursuant to R.C. 2506.01(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">{\u00b6 12} While the trial court\u2019s interpretation is understandable, we disagree that the final phrase of R.C. 2506.01(C) should be interpreted as a temporal mandate. Rather, we find it to be procedural. We believe that the exception from finality for administrative decisions \u201cissued preliminary to or as a result of a criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>proceeding\u201d applies to administrative decisions that are either <em>predicates </em>for a criminal proceeding or that arise as a <em>consequence </em>of the institution of criminal proceedings. If the prohibition against finality for administrative decisions set forth in the statute is read as a temporal injunction, then parties whose substantial rights have been determined by an administrative decision would have no timely recourse to appeal if the same subject matter has resulted in the institution of criminal proceedings \u2014 as herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">{\u00b6 13} Put another way, if an administrative decision results in criminal proceedings, or flows from criminal proceedings, it is not final and appealable until those proceedings are final and appealable. But that is not the situation presented by this appeal. The building commissioner could have proceeded simply by issuing the property-maintenance citations. He could have proceeded simply by filing the criminal complaints. He could do what he in fact did \u2014 file both. But the matters are not dependent on each other. They are simply separate arrows he may draw from his quiver when targeting perceived violations of Wickliffe\u2019s building code.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">{\u00b6 14} We further note that the BZA did have authority to hear appellants\u2019 appeal of the citations issued. The Wickliffe Building Commission is authorized to \u201cinterpret, administer and enforce the building, electrical and plumbing ordinances of the City and any other ordinances now in effect or hereafter created or passed relating to the construction of any building, of whatever character and for whatever purpose the same may be used, and <em>inteiypret and enforce the Zoning Ordinance of the City </em>* * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Wickliffe Ordinance 1105.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">{\u00b6 15} Further, Wickliffe Ordinance 1105.11 provides: <em>\" Any person </em>or the head of any department or division of the City <em>aggrieved by a decision of the Building Commissioner may appeal such decision to the Board of Zoning Appeals in the manner provided in Chapter 1335 of the Planning and Zoning Code.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">{\u00b6 16} Thus, the Wickliffe building commissioner is vested with authority to enforce the building and zoning codes, and decisions rendered under either code are appealable to the Board of Zoning Appeals as provided for in R.C. Chapter 1335. Cf. Wickliffe Ordinance 1335.30(a) (stating that the Board of Zoning Appeals is \u201c[t]o hear appeals on decisions made by the Building Commissioner\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">{\u00b6 17} For the reasons discussed above, appellants\u2019 sole assignment of error has merit, and the decision of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas is hereby reversed, and this matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>{\u00b6 18} It is the further order of this court that appellee is assessed costs herein taxed.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">{\u00b6 19} The court finds that there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b391-6\">Grendell, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b391-7\">Rice, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b391-8\">Cynthia Westcott Rice, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AIE\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">{\u00b6 20} I disagree with the majority\u2019s interpretation of the plain language of R.C. 2506.01(C) and therefore dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">{\u00b6 21} R.C. 2506.01 allows for the administrative appeal of any \u201cfinal order adjudication, or decision.\u201d Under subsection (C) of the statute, a final order, adjudication, or decision does not include any order, adjudication, or decision that is issued preliminary to or as a result of a criminal proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">{\u00b6 22} According to the majority, however, R.C. 2506.01(C) precludes appeals from only those administrative decisions that <em>result in </em>criminal proceedings or that <em>are a consequence of </em>criminal proceedings. In this case, the majority maintains that R.C. 2506.01(C) is not applicable, because the criminal proceedings were not predicated upon the BZA\u2019s decision. I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s unusual interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">{\u00b6 23} The plain statutory language does not, without some interpretational gymnastics, imply that a decision of the BZA must result in a criminal prosecution to trigger its operation. Quite generally, R.C. 2506.01(C) merely requires that the decision be \u201cpreliminary to\u201d a criminal proceeding. Using Occam\u2019s Razor, I would interpret this broad directive as a limitation on the appealability of <em>any </em>decision of the BZA addressing an issue that subsequently becomes the subject of a formal criminal complaint. Using this logic, any decision filed by the BZA relating to alleged violations that are the foundation for an eventual criminal prosecution is a decision \u201cpreliminary to\u201d that prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">{\u00b6 24} The majority worries that such an interpretation would be unfair because those whose rights have been affected by the BZA\u2019s decision would have no timely recourse to an appeal. This is a false alarm. Simply because the General Assembly has precluded pursuit of an administrative appeal under these circumstances does not imply that a criminal defendant has been stripped of his abilities to assert and/or defend his position. The criminal process entitles a criminal defendant to challenge the sufficiency and substance of the charges against him. Moreover, the criminal forum may give the defendant the procedur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>al advantage of requiring the city to prove its allegations beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, by prohibiting administrative appeals filed preliminary to criminal proceedings, R.C. 2506.01(C) neither unfairly limits nor compromises an individual\u2019s ability to fight an alleged violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">{\u00b6 25} Given the generality of the statutory language, I would hold that the phrase \u201cpreliminary to\u201d means \u201coccurring before.\u201d Thus, pursuant to R.C. 2506.01(C), I would hold that the BZA\u2019s decision was not a final, appealable order and that the trial court properly dismissed the matter.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
