For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">{\u00b6 2} The parties divorced on March 9, 2005. At the time of the divorce, the parties agreed to a shared-parenting plan, which the trial court adopted in a shared-parenting decree. The plan specified how the parties intended to care for their three children, M.M.R. (born June 27, 1993), M.E.R. (born May 16, 1996), and L.T.R. (born November 8, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">{\u00b6 3} Unfortunately, the shared-parenting plan proved unworkable due to the tensions between the two oldest children and their mother, L.R., as well as the absence of any constructive communication between H.R. and L.R. Seeking a more tenable parenting arrangement, H.R. filed a motion to terminate the shared-parenting decree, while L.R. filed two motions to modify the shared-parenting plan incorporated in the shared-parenting decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">{\u00b6 4} Over the course of three days, the trial court held a hearing on the parties\u2019 motions. During that hearing, both L.R. and H.R. testified. Additionally, H.R. presented the testimony of Dr. Jeffrey Smalldon, a forensic psychologist who completed court-ordered psychological evaluations of the parties during the divorce proceedings and immediately prior to the hearing. While conducting his updated psychological evaluation, Dr. Smalldon interviewed the parties, the children, and various counselors the parties and/or children had seen. In her two meetings with Dr. Smalldon, L.R. was \u201ccognitively very disorganized\u201d to the point that often \u201cher verbalizations were frankly incoherent.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">{\u00b6 5} Introduced into evidence, the report resulting from Dr. Smalldon\u2019s updated psychological evaluation included the following conclusions and recommendations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-10\">I view [L.R.] as having a serious mental disorder. It might very well be paranoid schizophrenia, but for now I\u2019m content to call it a Psychotic Disorder Not Otherwise Specified. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-11\">The shared parenting arrangement that is currently in place isn\u2019t working \u2014 by any criteria that I can think of. I am urging that the Court consider appointing [H.R.] to serve as the children\u2019s custodial and school placement parent. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>* * * I recommend against forcing [M.M.R.] to spend time with his mom at this point. However, I would hope that it will remain a goal of his counselor\u2014 and whoever [L.R.] ends up seeing \u2014 to move in the direction of a thaw [in the relationship between M.M.R. and L.R.].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-5\">Even though [M.E.R.] is several years younger than [M.M.R.], she can cite plenty of her own reasons for not wanting to spend time with her mom. I believe she\u2019s telling the truth when she describes [L.R.\u2019s] behavior as \u201cscary\u201d and often irrational. I don\u2019t believe that she should be forced to go with her mom now either. However, the final sentence in the preceding paragraph applies to her \u2014 and her counseling \u2014 as well. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-6\">As for [L.T.R.], I have serious concerns about her spending time alone with her mother. I want to urge the Court\u2019s consideration of an indefinite supervision requirement for [L.R.\u2019s] parenting time with her. There are just too many signs that point to the conclusion that [L.T.R.\u2019s] welfare could be in jeopardy without one. Of course the goal would be to have the supervision requirement lifted at a point where [L.R.\u2019s] treater \u2014 after seeing her for awhile and perhaps reading some reports about her behavior over time \u2014 concluded that she was stable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-7\">In my opinion, [L.R.] needs to be in treatment \u2014 preferably with a psychiatrist (and perhaps a \u201ccounselor\u201d as well). She has a serious mental illness * * *. Of course no one should judge her negatively because she has a mental illness \u2014 but until she develops at least a modicum of insight into her illness and its implications, and until she commits herself to obtaining the help that she needs, the symptoms of her illness are going to impact her behavior on the parenting front.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">{\u00b6 6} At the hearing, Dr. Smalldon testified about his conclusions and recommendations. Elaborating on his recommendation for supervised parenting time with regard to L.T.R., Dr. Smalldon stated that he \u201cthought long and hard about making that recommendation * * * [as] [t]hat [is] one of the stronger recommendations that you will find in a custody evaluation for me.\u201d Ultimately, he decided to recommend supervised parenting time because \u201cthere [are] serious safety-related issues where [L.T.R.] [is] concerned.\u201d Dr. Smalldon\u2019s concern over L.T.R.\u2019s safety arose from M.M.R. and M.E.R.\u2019s description of their mother\u2019s \u201cerratic driving [and] almost complete lack of supervision for [L.T.R.], times where she could just walk out the door and her mother wouldn\u2019t know she had gone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">{\u00b6 7} Additionally, Dr. Smalldon reiterated his opinion that the two older children should not be forced to spend time with their mother. He also stated that if the trial court required the two older children to visit with their mother, a therapist should monitor the parenting time.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>{\u00b6 8} Prior to issuing its decision on the parties\u2019 motions, the trial court interviewed the two older children and reviewed the guardian ad litem\u2019s final report. On June 13, 2008, the trial court issued a decision and entry that terminated the shared-parenting decree. Before setting the parameters of a new parenting arrangement, the trial court considered each applicable R.C. 3109.04(F)(1) factor to determine the children\u2019s best interests. As part of its consideration of the R.C. 3109.04(F)(1) factors, the trial court reviewed the evidence adduced regarding L.R.\u2019s mental health. After summarizing Dr. Small-don\u2019s updated report and testimony, the trial court stated that he \u201cha[d] somewhat missed the point with [L.R.].\u201d The trial court held that (1) \u201c[L.R.] has not been <em>specifically diagnosed </em>by an attending physician with any current illness or malady preventing her from successfully parenting\u201d and (2) \u201cno one has presented any <em>credible </em>evidence to substantiate an actual diagnosis which would prevent [L.R.] from successfully parenting.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">{\u00b6 9} Upon concluding its consideration of the children\u2019s best interests, the trial court (1) designated H.R. the children\u2019s residential parent and sole legal custodian, (2) awarded L.R. unsupervised parenting time with all three children pursuant to Loc.R. 27 of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Division of Domestic Relations, (3) relieved L.R. from the statutory obligation to pay child support, (4) allowed H.R. to claim the children for tax purposes, and (5) required H.R. to maintain health insurance for the children, with the parties paying any uncovered expenses equally.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">{\u00b6 10} H.R. now appeals from the trial court\u2019s June 13, 2008 judgment and assigns the following error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-7\">The trial court erred as a matter of law, and abused its discretion, in failing to find that defendant-appellee suffers from a psychotic condition that involves frank thought disorder and paranoid delusions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">{\u00b6 11} A trial court may terminate a shared-parenting decree that includes a jointly filed shared-parenting plan upon the request of one or both of the parents. R.C. 3109.04(E)(2)(c). After terminating the shared-parenting decree, the trial court must reallocate parental rights and responsibilities for the care of the children, taking into account the best interests of the children. R.C. 3109.04(E)(2)(d) (\u201cUpon the termination of a prior final shared parenting decree under division (E)(2)(c) of this section, the court shall proceed and issue a modified decree for the allocation of parental rights and responsibilities for the care of the children under the standards applicable under divisions (A), (B), and (C) of this section as if no decree for shared parenting had been granted and as if no request for shared parenting had ever been made\u201d); R.C. 3109.04(B)(1) (\u201cWhen making the allocation of the parental rights and responsibilities for the care of the children under this section in an original proceeding or in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>proceeding for modification of a prior order of the court making the allocation, the court shall take into account that which would be in the best interest of the children\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">{\u00b6 12} In the case at bar, H.R. does not challenge the trial court\u2019s termination of the shared-parenting decree. Instead, H.R. argues that the trial court erred when it reallocated his and L.R.\u2019s parental rights and responsibilities in a manner inconsistent with the children\u2019s best interests. H.R. specifically attacks the trial court\u2019s factual findings regarding L.R.\u2019s mental health and its rejection of Dr. Smalldon\u2019s uncontradicted expert opinion. Because the allocation of parental rights and responsibilities rests within the trial court\u2019s discretion, we find H.R.\u2019s argument unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\"> {\u00b6 13} Although a trial court must follow the dictates of R.C. 3109.04 in deciding child-custody matters, it enjoys broad discretion when determining the appropriate allocation of parental rights and responsibilities. <em>Miller v. Miller </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 71, 74, 523 N.E.2d 846; <em>Parker v. Parker, </em>10th Dist. No. 05AP-1171, 2006-Ohio-4110, 2006 WL 2300797, \u00b6 23. An appellate court must afford a trial court\u2019s child custody determinations the utmost respect, \u201c \u2018given the nature of the proceeding},] the impact the court\u2019s determination will have on the lives of the parties concerned}, and the fact that] [t]he knowledge a trial court gains through observing the witnesses and the parties in a custody proceeding cannot be conveyed to a reviewing court by a printed record.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pater v. Pater </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 393, 396, 588 N.E.2d 794, quoting <em>Miller </em>at 74, 523 N.E.2d 846. Therefore, an appellate court will only reverse a trial court\u2019s custody determination if the trial court abused its discretion. <em>Miller </em>at 74, 523 N.E.2d 846; <em>Parker </em>at \u00b6 23. \u201cThe term \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u201d <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">{\u00b6 14} As we stated above, any allocation of parental rights and responsibilities must include a consideration of the children\u2019s best interests. R.C. 3109.04(B)(1). When determining the best interest of a child, a trial court must consider multiple factors, including \u201c}t]he mental and physical health of all persons involved in the situation.\u201d R.C. 3109.04(F)(1)(e). Here, Dr. Smalldon opined that L.R. suffers from a serious mental illness that renders her unable to effectively parent her children. The trial court, however, rejected Dr. Smalldon\u2019s opinion and found that L.R. does not have a mental illness that would prevent her from successfully parenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">{\u00b6 15} In its role as fact finder, a trial court may choose to believe or disbelieve any witness, including an expert witness. <em>State v. White, </em>118 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>St.3d 12, 2008-Ohio-1623, 885 N.E.2d 905, \u00b6 71 (\u201cA trial court is not required to automatically accept expert opinions offered from the witness stand * * * on any * * * subject\u201d); <em>Stancourt v. Worthington City School Dish, </em>10th Dist. No. 07AP-835, 2008-Ohio-4548, 2008 WL 4151623, \u00b6 30 (\u201cas the trier of fact, the magistrate was free to believe or disbelieve any witness, including an expert witness\u201d). Thus, when an expert witness recommends supervised visitation, a trial court may accept or reject that opinion in the course of assessing the weight and credibility of the evidence. <em>Karales v. Karales, </em>10th Dist. No. 05AP-856, 2006-Ohio-2963, 2006 WL 1629005, \u00b6 7-8; <em>Jackson v. Jackson, </em>5th Dist. No. 03-CA-17, 2004-Ohio-816, 2004 WL 330083, \u00b6 21. However, \u201cexpert opinion \u2018may not be arbitrarily ignored, and some reason must be objectively present for ignoring expert opinion testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>White </em>at \u00b6 71, quoting <em>United States v. Hall </em>(C.A.5, 1978), 583 F.2d 1288, 1294. See also <em>Stancourt </em>at \u00b6 30 (even when expert testimony is not directly controverted, the jury is not obliged to believe the testimony as long as the record contains objectively discernable reasons for rejecting the expert\u2019s testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">{\u00b6 16} Here, the trial court enumerated multiple reasons for finding Dr. Smalldon\u2019s expert opinion unconvincing. First, the trial court concluded that Dr. Smalldon failed to appreciate that L.R. \u201cpresented] as \u2018crazy\u2019 \u201d in her sessions with him because \u201cshe simply [did] not respect the impact that [his] opinion could have on her parenting time schedule.\u201d Second, the trial court disregarded Dr. Smalldon\u2019s opinion because he is not L.R.\u2019s attending physician and only spent six and one-half hours with her before rendering his diagnosis. Third, the trial court found that Dr. Smalldon gave too much weight to the two oldest children\u2019s complaints regarding their mother when forming his opinion as to L.R.\u2019s ability to parent. Finally, the trial court discounted Dr. Smalldon\u2019s opinion that L.R.\u2019s mental illness jeopardized L.T.R.\u2019s safety because neither he nor any other mental-health, medical, or educational provider had reported their fears for L.T.R.\u2019s safety as mandated by R.C. 2151.421.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">{\u00b6 17} By itself, the first reason the trial court listed (i.e., L.R. acted \u201ccrazy\u201d because she did not realize the importance of Dr. Smalldon\u2019s evaluation) is not \u201cobjectively present\u201d in the record. L.R. never testified about her experience with Dr. Smalldon, so she never offered any explanation for the behavior that Dr. Smalldon witnessed and used to reach his diagnosis. Moreover, no other evidence supports the trial court\u2019s rationale for the incoherent and disorganized thinking that L.R. displayed in her sessions with Dr. Smalldon. Apparently, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>trial court merely speculated that lack of respect for Dr. Smalldon\u2019s role, not a mental illness, motivated L.R.\u2019s behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">{\u00b6 18} Nevertheless, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in disregarding Dr. Smalldon\u2019s opinion. Evidence introduced at the hearing supports the other three reasons the trial court gave for its decision to find Dr. Smalldon\u2019s testimony not credible. Although this court may have decided differently, \u201c[w]hen applying the abuse of discretion standard, a reviewing court is not free to merely substitute its judgment for that of the trial court.\u201d <em>In re Jane Doe 1 </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 135, 137-138, 566 N.E.2d 1181. Accordingly, we overrule H.R.\u2019s assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">(\u00b6 19} Having overruled H.R.\u2019s only assignment of error, we affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Division of Domestic Relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b876-8\">Bryant, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b876-9\">Sadler, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b871-12\">. According to the guardian ad litem, L.R. exhibited the same behavior when he met with her \u2014 she was \"unable to remain focused on the topic being discussed\u201d and \"unable to speak in complete and coherent sentences.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b875-7\">. R.C. 2151.421 requires certain persons who know or reasonably suspect that a child \"has suffered or faces a threat of suffering any physical or mental wound, injury, disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect\u201d to report their knowledge or reasonable suspicion to a public children services agency or law enforcement agency.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b876-10\">Sadler, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ame-\">concurring separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-11\">{\u00b6 20} The assignment of error does not challenge the trial court\u2019s decision as to the children\u2019s best interests, nor does it challenge any aspect of the trial court\u2019s order regarding custody and parenting time. Rather, the narrow issue presented by the assignment of error is whether the trial court erred in rejecting Dr. Smalldon\u2019s opinion that appellee suffers from a \u201cpsychotic disorder not otherwise specified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b876-12\">{\u00b6 21} It is clear from the reasons stated in its decision and entry that the court carefully considered and weighed the testimony of all of the witnesses at the three-day trial, including Dr. Smalldon, in making findings regarding each statutory best-interest factor, including the mental health of the parties. \u201c[T]he court is free to accept or reject, in whole or in part, the testimony or opinions of any witness, whether accepted as an expert or not and determine the weight and credibility to be given thereto.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Jackson, </em>5th Dist. No. 03-CA-17, 2004-Ohio-816, 2004 WL 330083, \u00b6 21, citing <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus (\u201cOn the trial of a case, either civil or criminal, the weight to be given the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are primarily for the trier of the facts\u201d); see also <em>Arena v. Arena </em>(Sept. 29, 1995), 10th Dist. No. 94APF09-1338, 1995 WL 571429. Accordingly, the trial court was within its discretion as the fact-finder to reject Dr. Smalldon\u2019s opinion that appellee suffers from a particular mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>{\u00b6 <em>22} </em>For the reasons stated above, I concur in overruling the single assignment of error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
