After a thorough review of the record, and for the reasons set forth below, we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">{\u00b6 2} On June 25, 2007, a Cuyahoga County Grand Jury indicted appellant on one count of theft under R.C. 2913.02(A)(2), a third-degree felony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On November 21, 2007, appellant filed a motion to dismiss based on the expiration of the statute of limitations. Appellant also filed a motion to suppress her statements to the police. On February 6, 2008, the trial court held a hearing on both motions, ultimately denying them. On that same date, appellant pleaded no contest, and the trial court found her guilty of theft. Thereafter, the trial court referred appellant for a presentence investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">{\u00b6 3} On March 5, 2008, the trial court sentenced appellant to four years in prison and ordered restitution of $100,471.73; however, the court\u2019s journal entry indicated that restitution would be in the amount of $107,000. On March 6, 2008, appellant filed a motion for reconsideration of the restitution order, which the trial court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">{\u00b6 4} The facts that gave rise to this appeal began in April 2007. Detective Sergeant Michael Gerl, of the Richmond Heights Police Department, testified that he began to investigate appellant after being contacted by Lita Weiss, representative of Associated Estates Realty Corporation (\u201cAssociated\u201d). Weiss informed Detective Gerl that appellant was Associated\u2019s payroll administrator and had been issuing herself \u201cadditional payroll service and fees\u201d between October 15, 1999, and April 4, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>{\u00b6 5} Detective Gerl testified that after he reviewed documents that Weiss had provided him, he decided to continue the investigation. On April 18, 2007, Detectives Gerl and Denise DeBiase went to appellant\u2019s home to speak with her about the allegations. Appellant allowed the police into her home and agreed to talk about Associated\u2019s accusations.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">{\u00b6 6} According to Detective Gerl, he provided appellant verbal and written <em>Miranda </em>warnings before discussing the case with her. Appellant stated that she understood her rights and signed the <em>Miranda </em>form. Detective Gerl asked appellant if she would discuss the case, and appellant stated that she would. Appellant told Detective Gerl that she had stolen the money because she needed it to pay for her daughter\u2019s chemical-dependency treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Review and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">{\u00b6 7} Appellant brings this timely appeal, asserting five assignments of error for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Motion to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cI. Defendant was denied due process of law when the court overruled defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss without hearing any of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">{\u00b6 9} Appellant argues that the trial court erred when it denied her motion to dismiss. More specifically, she alleges that the motion to dismiss should have been granted based on the statute of limitations. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\"> {\u00b6 10} We review a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss de novo. <em>Whitehall v. Khoury, </em>10th Dist. No. 07AP-711, 2008-Ohio-1376, 2008 WL 787670, at \u00b6 7, citing <em>Akron v. Molyneaux </em>(2001), 144 Ohio App.3d 421, 426, 760 N.E.2d 461. A de novo standard of review affords no deference to the trial court\u2019s decision, and we independently review the record. <em>Gilchrist v. Gonsor, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 88609, 2007-Ohio-3903, 2007 WL 2206701, at \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">{\u00b6 11} Crim.R. 12(C) provides that \u201cprior to trial, any party may raise by motion any defense, objection, evidentiary issue, or request that is capable of determination without the trial of the general issue. * * * Defenses and objections based on defects in the indictment * * * [must be raised before trial].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">{\u00b6 12} A motion to dismiss tests the sufficiency of the indictment, without regard to the quantity or quality of evidence that may be produced at trial. <em>State v. Patterson </em>(1989), 63 Ohio App.3d 91, 577 N.E.2d 1165. A pretrial motion must not involve a determination of the sufficiency of the evidence to support the indictment. If the indictment is valid on its face, a motion to dismiss should not be granted. See <em>State v. Eppinger, </em>162 Ohio App.3d 795, 2005-Ohio-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>4155, 835 N.E.2d 746, citing <em>State v. Varner </em>(1991), 81 Ohio App.3d 85, 86, 610 N.E.2d 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">{\u00b6 13} Under R.C. 2901.13(A)(1)(a), prosecution for a felony is barred unless it is commenced within six years. The July 25, 2007 indictment alleges a period of time between October 1999 and April 2007. Appellant argues that any allegation of theft for actions that occurred before April 2007 is barred by the statute of limitations. Appellant overlooks the application of R.C. 2913.61(C)(1) to her case and the fact that she engaged in a continuing course of conduct that did not end until Associated discovered the thefts in 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">R.C. 2913.61</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">{\u00b6 14} Under R.C. 2913.61(C)(1), \u201cWhen a series of offenses under section 2913.02 of the Revised Code * * * is committed by the offender in the offender\u2019s same employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses <em>shall be tried as a single offense. </em>The value of the property or services involved in the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value * * * is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the series.\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201cThe theft offenses of R.C. 2913.02 must be aggregated only when committed against one person or entity.\u201d <em>State v. Crish, </em>3d Dist. No. 1-08-13, 2008-Ohio-5196, 2008 WL 4455602, \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">{\u00b6 15} Under R.C. 2913.61(C)(1), appellant\u2019s theft offenses must be aggregated. In the case at bar, all of appellant\u2019s thefts occurred while she was working at Associated. Clearly, each theft occurred while she was in the same employment with Associated, who was the only victim. R.C. 2913.61(C)(1) requires that all of the thefts be aggregated into one count. See <em>Crish, </em>2008-Ohio-5196, 2008 WL 4455602.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">Continuing Course of Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">{\u00b6 16} R.C. 2901.13(D) states, \u201cAn offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct, the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or the accused\u2019s accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">{\u00b6 17} Appellant\u2019s theft offenses are clearly a continuing course of conduct. We note that appellant argues that <em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 89198, 2007-Ohio-6835, 2007 WL 4442746, applies in this case. In <em>Rodriguez, </em>this court held that each of \u201c17 counts of tampering with evidence was completed when Rodriguez submitted the application for that particular title using the fraudulent social security number.\u201d Accordingly, <em>Rodriguez </em>held that \u201c[t]he 17 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>counts of the indictment related to 17 different applications for a title to a motor vehicle. All 17 of these applications used the same fraudulent social security number. These 17 offenses were distinct, and each was completed when Rodriguez made the application for a title\u201d; therefore, the crimes did not constitute a continuing course of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">{\u00b6 18} The case at bar differs from <em>Rodriguez </em>for several reasons. In <em>Rodriguez, </em>the defendant was charged with separate counts of tampering with records, but here, appellant was charged with one count of theft, which was subject to R.C. 2913.61(C)(1). In <em>Rodriguez, </em>this court held that the 17 offenses were distinct, but here it is clear that the offenses were not distinct because of the application of R.C. 2913.61(C)(1). In <em>Rodriguez, </em>the defendant made 17 different applications for 17 different motor vehicles, but here, appellant engaged in a continuing course of conduct by repeatedly stealing money from the same business \u2014 Associated. Under R.C. 2901.13(D), the statute of limitations did not commence until the final theft in 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">{\u00b6 19} Because R.C. 2913.61(C)(1) requires that the thefts be aggregated, which evidences the fact that appellant engaged in a continuing course of conduct, we hold that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until the thefts were discovered in 2007. The indictment is valid on its face because it alleges a continuing course of conduct against the same entity; therefore, the trial court appropriately denied appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss. Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cII. Defendant was denied due process of law when the court overruled defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">{\u00b6 21} Appellant argues that the trial court erred when it overruled her motion to suppress. More specifically, she alleges that she did not waive her <em>Miranda </em>rights. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">{\u00b6 22} When we consider a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, this court\u2019s standard of review is divided into two parts. In <em>State v. Lloyd </em>(1998), 126 Ohio App.3d 95, 100, 709 N.E.2d 913, the court stated: \u201c[0]ur standard of review with respect to motions to suppress is whether the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by competent, credible evidence. <em>State v. Winand </em>(1996), 116 Ohio App.3d 286, 288, 688 N.E.2d 9, citing <em>Tallmadge v. McCoy </em>(1994), 96 Ohio App.3d 604, 608, 645 N.E.2d 802. * * * [T]his is the appropriate standard because \u2018 \u201cin a hearing on a motion to suppress evidence, the trial court assumes the role of trier of facts and is in the best position to resolve questions of fact and evaluate the credibility of witnesses.\u201d \u2019 <em>State v. Hopfer </em>(1996), 112 Ohio App.3d 521, 548, 679 N.E.2d 321, quoting <em>State v. Venham </em>(1994), 96 Ohio App.3d 649, 653, 645 N.E.2d 831. However, once we accept those facts as true, we must independently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>determine, as a matter of law and without deference to the trial court\u2019s conclusion, whether the trial court met the applicable legal standard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">{\u00b6 23} Pursuant to <em>Miranda v. Arizona </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 436, 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, statements \u201cstemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant\u201d must be suppressed unless the defendant had been informed of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights before being questioned. \u201cCustodial interrogation\u201d means \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Custodial Interrogation</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">{\u00b6 24} First, the police did not need to inform appellant of her Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights before she was questioned because no \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d took place. The entire interview took place in appellant\u2019s home. The interview was conducted by Detective Gerl, who testified that he and Detective DeBiase knocked on appellant\u2019s door, identified themselves as police officers, and told her that they wanted to question her about \u201cthe matter with regard to Associated Estates.\u201d Appellant allowed the detectives to come into her home. The detectives did not handcuff, restrain, or threaten appellant. Appellant did not attempt to end the interview or ask for an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">{\u00b6 25} The facts in this case are similar to those in <em>State v. Robinson, </em>Sixth Dist. No. L-06-1182, 2008-Ohio-3498, 2008 WL 2700002, at \u00b6 6, which held that the defendant was not \u201csubject to a custodial interrogation\u201d because \u201ca reasonable man in appellant\u2019s position would have understood that, during the interview, there was no formal arrest or restraint on his freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">Waiver of Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">{\u00b6 26} Even if we were to find that a custodial interrogation took place, it is clear that appellant waived her rights. \u201c[A]n individual must be advised prior to custodial interrogation \u2018that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed.\u2019 <em>Miranda </em>[384 U.S. at 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694]. These rights may be waived, however, provided the defendant makes the waiver knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. Id. The State bears the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights based on the totality of the circumstances surrounding the investigation. <em>State v. Gumm </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 413, 429, 653 N.E.2d 253.\u201d <em>State v. Williams, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 82094, 2003-Ohio-4811, 2003 WL 22100230, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>{\u00b6 27} In the case at bar, Detective Gerl testified that he provided appellant with verbal and written <em>Miranda </em>warnings before he spoke to her. \u201cAn express written or oral statement of waiver of the right to remain silent or of the right to counsel is usually strong proof of the validity of that waiver.\u201d <em>North Carolina v. Butler </em>(1979), 441 U.S. 369, 373, 99 S.Ct. 1755, 60 L.Ed.2d 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">{\u00b6 28} According to Detective Gerl, he told appellant \u201cthat she has the right to speak with an attorney, anything that she says can be used against her in a court of law, she can stop answering or doesn\u2019t have to answer until she gets advice from an attorney. She can stop answering at any time.\u201d He also testified, \u201cWe do read at the end to * * * make sure that she understands her rights.\u201d When asked if appellant said \u201cthat she understood those rights,\u201d Detective Gerl testified, \u2018Yes, she did.\u201d Additionally, the detective had appellant complete a written <em>Miranda </em>waiver form.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">{\u00b6 29} Based upon Detective Gerl\u2019s testimony, it is clear that appellant validly waived her <em>Miranda </em>rights. Additionally, we find that there is no evidence that appellant \u201cwas threatened, tricked, or cajoled into a waiver,\u201d which would show that the defendant did not voluntarily waive her rights. See <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 476, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694. Detectives Gerl and DeBiase arrived at appellant\u2019s home in the middle of the day, appellant invited them in, no threats were made, appellant was not physically restrained, and by the time appellant asked Detective Gerl if he thought she should get a lawyer, the interview had ended. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Restitution</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cHI. Defendant was denied due process of law when the court ordered restitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cIV. Defendant was denied due process of law when the court orally pronounced restitution and entered a different amount in its judgment entry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">{\u00b6 32} Appellant argues that the trial court\u2019s restitution amount of $100,471.73 could not be correct because she had already repaid $10,000 to the probation department. Appellant also takes issue with the discrepancy in the restitution amount stated at sentencing ($100,471.73) and the amount listed in the judgment entry ($107,000). We find merit in these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">{\u00b6 33} The standard of review for determining whether the trial court properly ordered restitution is abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Carrino </em>(May 11, 1995), Cuyahoga App. No. 67696, 1995 WL 277103. \u201cThe term \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u201d <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>{\u00b6 34} \u201cTo establish the amount of restitution within a reasonable certainty, there must be some competent, credible evidence.\u201d <em>Carrino, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 67696, 1995 WL 277103, citing <em>State v. Warner </em>(1990), 55 Ohio St.3d 31, 69, 564 N.E.2d 18. \u201cSufficient evidence of the amount of restitution may appear in the record.\u201d <em>Carrino, </em>citing <em>State v. Montes </em>(1993), 92 Ohio App.3d 539, 636 N.E.2d 378. \u201cWhere evidence of the appropriate amount of restitution does not appear in the record, an evidentiary hearing is required.\u201d <em>Carrino, </em>citing <em>State v. Wohlgemuth </em>(1990), 66 Ohio App.3d 195, 200, 583 N.E.2d 1076.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">{\u00b6 35} In the case at bar, at the sentencing hearing, the trial judge allowed Associated\u2019s representative, Carol Kraynak, to testify that the \u201ctotal amount of the loss\u201d was \u201caround $107,000.\u201d According to Kraynak, this amount included the specific amount that appellant stole, plus the amount Associated had to pay in taxes on behalf of the stolen money. Thereafter, the trial judge stated, \u201cI\u2019m going to find $100,471.73 \u2014 since that\u2019s the figure that has been associated with this case.\u201d Later, the court issued a judgment entry ordering appellant to pay $107,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cIf the court decides to impose restitution, the court shall hold a hearing on restitution if the offender, victim, or survivor disputes the amount.\u201d R.C. 2929.18(A)(1). Here, appellant disputes the amount, particularly the failure to account for the $10,000 she already repaid. Additionally, there is a discrepancy between the journal entry and the amount ordered in court. Finally, we find that it is suspect that the only evidence produced of loss is Kraynak\u2019s testimony of \u201caround $107,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">{\u00b6 37} We remand this case to the trial court so that it may conduct a hearing on restitution in order to hear evidence on, and determine, the appropriate amount owed. Appellant\u2019s third and fourth assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cV. Defendant was denied due process of law when the court sentenced defendant to a four (4) year term of imprisonment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">{\u00b6 39} Appellant argues that the trial court erred when it sentenced her to four years in prison. More specifically, she alleges that the amount of years is excessive. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">{\u00b6 40} An appellate court may not disturb an imposed sentence unless it finds by clear and convincing evidence that the sentence is not supported by the record or is \u201cotherwise contrary to law.\u201d R.C. 2953.08(G)(2); <em>State v. Moore, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 89779, 2008-Ohio-2365, 2008 WL 2058680; <em>State v. Donahue, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 89111, 2007-Ohio-6825, 2007 WL 4442669. Clear and convincing evidence is \u201cthat measure or degree of proof which is more than a mere \u2018preponderance of the evidence,\u2019 but not to the extent of such certainty as is required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>\u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 in criminal cases, and which will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to the facts sought to be established.\u201d <em>Cross v. Ledford </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 469, 53 O.O. 361, 120 N.E.2d 118, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">{\u00b6 41} In <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, the Ohio Supreme Court found several sections of the revised code unconstitutional, including R.C. 2929.14(B), and severed the offending portions from the statutes. As a result, trial courts now have full discretion to impose a prison sentence within the statutory range and are no longer required to make findings or state reasons for imposing more than the minimum sentences.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">{\u00b6 42} We do not find that the imposition of a four-year sentence for theft was excessive, unsupported by the record, or contrary to law. Appellant was convicted of theft under R.C. 2913.02(A)(2), a third-degree felony. Under R.C. 2929.14(A)(3), the sentencing range for third-degree felonies is between one and five years. Clearly, a four-year sentence is not contrary to law. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b149-8\">Gallagher, P.J., and Stewart, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b142-13\">.
