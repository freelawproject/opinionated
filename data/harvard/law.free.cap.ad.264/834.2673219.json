The decision in the rescission suit upon the basis of which respondent\u2019s motion for summary judgment was granted, is in apparent conflict with other decisions of courts c\u00a3 competent jurisdiction which tend to support appellant\u2019s claim of invalidity for fraud of the chattel mortgage and the promissory notes given as consideration for the lease. Where, as here, there have been two former actions in which the claim or demand, fact or matter sought to be relitigated has been decided contrarily, the rule, that it <em>\u201c </em>setteth the matter at large,\u201d has been applied in this State, and in such case both parties may assert their claims anew. <em>(Shaw </em>v. <em>Broadbent, </em>129 N. Y. 114, 125. See, also, 34 C. J. 749, \u00a7 1159.) Whether respondent had knowledge of the alleged fraud at the time of the assignment to it of the chattel mortgage and the notes, is an issue of fact. In this action to foreclose the lien of the chattel mortgage, summary judgment should not have been granted as there are issues which should be tried in the usual manner of a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>The judgment, and the order in so far as it grants plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment, should be reversed and plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Townley, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
