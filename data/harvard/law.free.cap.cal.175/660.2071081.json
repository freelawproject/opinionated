No judgment is thereby attempted to be given against any of them. The whole effect of the order is that the Southern Pacific Company is directed to enforce against them a certain paragraph of a certain rule of a certain tariff with reference to demurrage, and this, it is taken for granted, can only be done by the company by means of ordinary actions against the several petitioners in the courts of the state, where the question of liability will be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">The application for a writ of <em>certiorari </em>is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
