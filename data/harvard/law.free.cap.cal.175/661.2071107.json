The question of insufficiency of evidence to warrant conviction cannot be considered on <em>habeas corpus. </em>Subdivision 7 of section 1487 of the Penal Code, authorizing a discharge on <em>habeas corpus </em>\u201cwhere a party has been committed on a criminal charge without reasonable or probable cause, \u2019 \u2019 is applicable only where, a person has been committed <em>for trial by a magistrate </em>without reasonable or probable cause. The complaint in the police court sufficiently stated facts constituting the offense of petit larceny (Pen. Code, secs. 484 and 488). The words \u201cby trick and device\u201d do not impair their effect in this regard. The judgment shows a conviction of the crime of petit larceny. If the evidence adduced on the trial was not sufficient to show the guilt of the prisoner of that charge, his remedy was by appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">The application for a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
