That plaintiff thereafter immediately commenced the completion of the said contract and apartment house building, and continued so to do diligently and with all possible dispatch, and completed the same at the earliest possible date. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">The complaint also charged that after the construction of the building had progressed beyond the time provided in the contract for the second payment, \u201cthe contractor abandoned said building, said building contract and the construction of said building . . . and thereafter did nothing towards the completion or construction of said building; that prior to said abandonment by said defendant Tuman, said plaintiff delivered to said defendant,\u201d etc. The Fidelity and Guaranty Company in its answer denied this abandonment. The issue of abandonment was thus directly in the case. Moreover, the jury was specifically instructed upon the question of abandonment. Thus, \u201cYou are instructed that if you find from the evidence that the defendant Tuman abandoned his contract for the construction of the apartment house at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>any time before the completion thereof by him, you may return a verdict for the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Special interrogatories were submitted to the jury which, in addition to the answers thereto, returned its general verdict against both defendants. Because of the conceived inconsistency between the special verdicts and the general verdict, the court refused to enter judgment in favor of the plaintiff against the defendant bonding company and gave judgment against the contractor alone. The soundness of its ruling in this regard is the question presented on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">The special issues upon which the lower court gave judgment for the defendant corporation are the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">\u201cQuestion. Between October 24, 1911, and November 14, 1911, did Mr. Turnan have men working on the building every working day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-8\">\u201cAnswer. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-9\">\u201cQuestion. Did Mrs. Tremble or Mr. Reed take the job away from the defendant contractor and finish the building herself ? If so, when did she take over the job ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-10\">\u201cAnswer. Yes, November 14, 1911.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-11\">\u201cQuestion. Did Mr. Turnan or Mr. Graves agree with Mr. Reed that Mrs. Tremble or Mr. Reed might take the job out of their hands and complete it herself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-12\">\u201cAnswer. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-13\">There is no inconsistency between these special verdicts and the general verdict under which the jury held the bonding company liable. It is the rule that all inferences and intendments favor the general verdict, and this being so, the answers to special interrogatories cannot be enlarged by such inferences and intendments so as to vitiate the general verdict. (Clementson on Special Verdicts, pp. 134, 135.) This court has said: \u201cThe rule is that the general verdict imports a finding in favor of the plaintiff on all the averments of the complaint material to his recovery. <em>(Merritt </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>52 Cal. 238.) As we have said, abandonment was squarely in issue in the case. The general verdict is to be construed as a finding of such abandonment, and it is in the light of this finding that the special verdicts are to be read and reconciled with the general verdict if reasonably possible. It is not only reasonably possible, but no difficulty arises in so doing. In narrative form the special verdicts, read in connection with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>the general verdict, amount to this: For nearly a month before November 14, 1911, the contractor had ceased to work on the building. Then on November 14th, plaintiff holding that the contractor had thus abandoned his contract, decided to take over the work of construction. A conference was had between the plaintiff and her architect upon the one hand and the contractor on the other, and the contractor agreed to this. Such is not only the fair and reasonable construction of these special verdicts, but it is the most obvious one.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Wherefore, the judgment appealed from is reversed, with directions to the trial court to enter judgment in favor of appellant and against respondent, United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company, under the general verdict of the jury.'</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Melvin, J., Lorigan, J., Shaw, J., Sloss, J., Lawlor, J., and Angellotti, C. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
