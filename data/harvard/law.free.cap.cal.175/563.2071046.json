The circumstances, in brief, are that plaintiff at the conclusion of the testimony which he \u25a0 offered sought and obtained leave of court to file an amended complaint to conform to his proofs. This permission was granted and under it the amended complaint was filed. Discussion arose between court and counsel, the attorney for the defendant insisting that without regard to the sufficiency of the amended complaint no evidence had been introduced to sustain its material allegations. Appellant\u2019s attorney declared that these statements were \u201cmore like an argument for a nonsuit than a motion to strike out.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-4\">\u201cBy the Court (to Mr. Murphy): Do you move for a non-suit ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">\u201cBy Mr. Murphy: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">\u201cBy the Court: Motion to strike out amended complaint will be denied and motion for nonsuit will be granted. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Section 581 of the Code of Civil Procedure as amended in 1907 now declares that \u201cAn action may be dismissed, or a <em>judgment of nonsuit </em>entered in the following cases: . . . 5. By the court, upon motion of the defendant, when upon the trial the plaintiff fails to prove a sufficient case for the jury. . . . The dismissals mentioned in subdivisions three, four, and five of this section must be made by orders of the court entered upon the minutes thereof, <em>and are effective for all purposes when so entered.\u201d </em>The italicized words direct attention, first, to the fact that in terms our law recognizes \u201ca judgment of nonsuit\u201d as distinguished from a judgment of dismissal, and further declares that the order of nonsuit entered upon the minutes of the court constitutes this judgment of nonsuit, since the law declares that such an order so entered is \u201ceffective for all purposes.\u201d In the present state of the law, then, it would appear that such a judgment of nonsuit, as distinguished from a judgment of dismissal usually following an order of nonsuit, is appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">No change, however, has been worked in the uniform and settled law of this state that the party moving for a non-suit must state in his motion precisely the grounds upon which he relies. <em>(Sanchez </em>v. <em>Neary, </em>41 Cal. <em>487; Coffey </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number><em>Greenfield, </em>62 Cal. 608; <em>Shain </em>v. <em>Forbes, </em>82 Cal. 582, [23 Pac. 198]; <em>Bronzan </em>v. <em>Drobaz, </em>93 Cal. 650, [29 Pac. 254]; <em>Durfee </em>v. <em>Seale, </em>139 Cal. 607, [73 Pac. 435]; <em>Coghlan </em>v. <em>Quartararo, </em>15 Cal. App. 668, [115 Pac. 664].) This was not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The judgment of nonsuit is therefore reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The appeal from the court\u2019s order refusing to enter defendant\u2019s default requires but the briefest notice. It is hot an appealable order. It should be added that it is manifest that the trial court having both matters before it at the same time, and intending to grant the motion for a non-suit, through inadvertence only, made the ruling complained of. In any future proceeding had before that court it will grant permission to the defendant to answer the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Shaw, J., Sloss, J., Melvin, J., Lorigan, J., and Angellotti, C. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
