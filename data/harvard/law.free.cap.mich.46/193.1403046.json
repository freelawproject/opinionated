That section 31 of said act provides that \u201c the said company shall pay to the State an annual tax of one-lialf of one per cent, upon its capital stock paid in, including the live hundred thousand dollars of purchase money paid or to be paid to the State, until the first day of February, 1851, and thereafter an annual tax of three-fourths of one per cent, upon its capital stock paid in, including the five hundred thousand dollars of purchase money aforesaid, and also upon all loans made to said company for the purpose of constructing said railroad, or purchasing, constructing, chartering, or hiring of steamboats authorized by this act to be held by said company, which tax shall be paid in the last week in January in each year to the State Treasurer.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-9\">That by virtue of Act number 138 of the Laws of Michigan for 1855, said Michigan Southern Railroad Company on the 25th day of April, 1855, became consolidated with a corporation of the State of Indiana, known as the Northern Indiana Railroad Company, thereby forming a new corporation, known as the Michigan Southern and Northern Indiana Railroad Company. Section 3 of said act of consolidation provides that <em>\u201c </em>The said corporations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>to be organized by virtue of this act shall continue subject to the same rate of tax as though such consolidation snail not take place, and the amount of its capital and loans thereafter upon which such taxation shall be paid shall be such portion of the whole of its capital and loans as is actually employed within the State of Michigan, to be ascertained on or before the first day of January in each year by the Auditor General of this State from the annual reports of such corporation, or from such other reports on oath as he may deem necessary for such purpose to be ordered by him from the office of such corporation.\u201d That by virtue of two consolidations made under and in accordance with the feneral laws of the State of Michigan, one made the 6th ay of April, 1869, and the other the 22d day of June, 3879, the first between said Michigan Southern and Northern Indiana Railroad Company and the Lake Shore Railway Company, another corporation, forming a new corporation called the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway Company, the second between said Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway Company and the Buffalo and Erie ' Railroad Company, another corporation, forming by their anion the said corporation defendant hereto; said defendant became possessed of the railroad and all other property formerly belonging to said Michigan Southern Railroad Company, and received by said Michigan Southern and Northern Indiana Railroad Company from said Michigan Southern subject to the duty of paying taxes to the State of Michigan as provided in said ,act under which said Michigan Southern Railroad Company was organized, and as provided in said act by which said Michigan Southern and Northern Indiana Railroad Companies were consolidated, and subject also to all debts, liabilities, and duties of said Michigan Southern and Northern Indiana Railroad Company which existed prior to its said consolidation into said defendant. And said plaintiffs aver-that said Michigan Southern and Northern Indiana Railroad Company by virtue of its acceptance of said act, under which it was formed on said 25th of April, 1855, and in consideration of the rights it gained thereby, promised and was bound to pay to the State of Michigan a tax of three-fourths of one per cent, per annum on such portion of the whole of its capital and loans, as was actually employed in the State of Michigan ; and promised and was bound to report to the Auditor General of said State, yearly, the amount of its capital and loans which was employed in the said State. And said plaintiffs aver that said Michigan Southern and Northern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Indiana Railroad Company did not report to said Auditor General, from year to year, the frill amount of its capital and loans actually employed in the State of Michigan, and did not pay the whole amount of the required tax upon its capital and loans actually thus employed. On the contrary, in the year 1862, and every successive year thereafter, up to and including the year 1869, said Michigan Southern and Northern Indiana Railroad Company actually employed in the State of Michigan three million dollars of its capital, and three million dollars of loans which were never reported to the Auditor General of said State for taxation, and upon which it always neglected and refused to pay the tax due as aforesaid. In consequence of said premises, said Michigan Southern and Northern Indiana Railroad Company was, at the time its property and rights passed to defendant by said consolidation, indebted to the State of Michigan for said unpaid taxes and interest thereon, in the sum of five hundred thousand dollars, which said indebtedness defendant assumed and promised to pay in and by the law under which it was incorporated and became entitled to the property of said Michigan Southern and Northern Indiana Railroad Company, and in consideration of the rights it gained by said consolidation. And plaintiffs aver that defendant from and after the said consolidation of June 22, 1869, in consideration of the rights gained by such consolidation, promised and was bound to pay to the State of Michigan an annual tax of three-fourths of one per cent., upon such portion of its capital and loans as was actually employed in the State of Michigan, and for the same consideration promised and was bound to report to the Auditor General of said State, yearly, the amount of its capital and loans which was employed in said State. And said plaintiffs aver that said defendant has not reported to said Auditor General, from year to year, the full amount of its capital and loans actually employed in the State of Michigan, and has not paid the whole amount of the required tax upon its cajaital and loans actually thus employed.. <em>On the </em>contrary, in the year 1869, and every successive year thereafter, up to the time when this suit was begun, said defendant-actually employed five millions of its capital stock and four millions of its loans in the State of Michigan, which it has never reported to said Auditor General for taxation, and upon which it has constantly neglected and refused to pay the tax due as aforesaid, and the amount of the tax thus due from defendant arising since and including said year 1869, together with interest thereon, is the sum of five hundred thousand dol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>lars. And in consideration of said premises and its liabilities as hereinbefore stated on the first day of April, 1878, \u25a0said defendant faithfully promised said plaintiffs to pay them the full sum of one million dollars, due as aforesaid. Yet the said defendant has disregarded its said promises, and has not (although often requested so to do), paid said sum of money, or any part thereof, to the plaintiffs\u2019 damage, one million dollars, and therefore they bring suit, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-3\">OTTO KIRCHNER,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-4\">\n<em>Attorney General.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-5\">The cause was tried before a jury and evidence was given of which the substance was: 1.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AtN\">In many respects this case resembles the <em>Michigan Southern &amp; Northern Indiana R. R. Co. v. Auditor General </em>9 Mich. 448; and <em>People v. The Michigan Southern &amp; Northern Indiana R. R. Co. </em>4 Mich. 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Some prehminary questions have been raised, which it was claimed should dispose of the present controversy, without the necessity of passing upon what might be considered the merits, and these perhaps had better first be disposed of.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">As to the proceedings in the Wayne circuit court in chancery commenced in 1862 and in which a decree was rendered restraining the Auditor General from collecting taxes claimed to be due the State from the company for the years 1858 and 1861 inclusive, on account of the discounts and Jackson branch bonds hereinafter referred to, I am of opinion such proceedings are not <em>res ad/judicata </em>against the State in this case. If in the present case the State sought to recover the taxes for 1858-9-60 and \u201961 which were then in controversy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>and the collection of which was restrained by the decree rendered in that case, the company might well say the State was concluded, and the mere fact that the decision was acquiesced in by the State, from necessity, would be no answer. Such, however, is not the present case. This action was commenced in 1880 and the State was permitted to recover taxes for the years 1872 and subsequent thereto. The decree in the Wayne circuit would not prevent the State from claiming and seeking to recover taxes accruing subsequent to the years or taxes then passed upon. This is a new controversy, for a new cause of action, and in which some of the legal questions then passed upon are again raised, and the decision of the court thereon is of no importance except as a precedent. In this case it is not conclusive. Such was the view of Mr. Justice Campbell upon a similar question in the case in 9 Mich., already referred to, and as that case is reported there does not seem to have been any diversity of opinion on this point. The parties are bound in so far as regards the subject-matter then involved, but are at liberty to raise anew the same legal questions in a case arising subsequently, even although the facts may be substantially alike in other respects. The principle is that a party shall not be twice vexed for the same cause; but this is not the same cause but one arising since then, and the State is not in this case seeking to recover any portion of the taxes the collection of which was restrained in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The Auditor General having assessed the company upon the reports made by it, for the several years covered by this action, and such assessments having been paid, it is claimed that in the absence of fraud by the company the action of the Auditor was final.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The Auditor General is required to ascertain and estimate, from the annual report made by the company, the amount of the tax chargeable against it, and for this purpose he may require the company to make farther and additional reports. It is not claimed that there was any fraud practiced by the company, and the Auditor General seems <em>to </em>have been satisfied with the annual reports as made, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>lie did not call for anything farther. An examination of one of- the reports made, all being alike, shows that the company gave therein the aggregate amount upon which it claimed the State could tax it, but whether correct or not, or whether the company was not liable to pay a tax upon the items in controversy in this case the Auditor General from the report could not determine. The company did not set up or present the facts in its report concerning these disputed items and leave it to the Auditor General to exercise his judgment and make an assessment therefrom. Had the company done so and the Auditor made his assessment therefrom, or had he called for a further report, or in any way passed upon the facts and made an assessment accordingly, the question presented would have been very different. In this case the Auditor General seems to have accepted the conclusion of the company as to the amount upon which it was liable to pay taxes, and having done so the amount of the tax was a matter of computation, a merely ministerial act. The only discretion or judgment he exercised, if any, was to not call for a farther report, but this was not a discretion or judgment passed upon any facts, but if anything, simply that he would not ask for or look into the facts at all. The law declared that the company should pay a certain tax upon its capital and loans actually employed in this State. From this the Auditor General had no power to exempt or relieve the corporation, and if in making and filing its report the corporation did not set forth the correct amount, the neglect or failure of the Auditor General to perform his duty would not operate as a payment or discharge to the company. The State ought not to be concluded by the mere non-action of one of its officers. It is sufficient for the protection of all, to hold the State bound, where \u00e1n officer ascertains the facts and passes judgment thereon. The company made out its-report upon a mistaken basis, and if it thereby misled the Auditor the State should not be the loser.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-3\">A question was suggested whether, admitting the position taken by the State to be correct, any suit would he until the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Auditor General of Ms own motion or by <em>mandamus </em>bad charged the tax sought to be recovered. As I understood counsel for the railroad company, they did not wish to press this objection, if upon such assessment hereafter being made, a recovery could be had. The company desired, and the public interests demand, that the entire matter in dispute should be passed upon on the merits. In such cases courts do frequently pass upon the merits, where the objection does not go to the jurisdiction of the court. See <em>Youngblood v. Sexton </em>32 Mich. 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">It seems to. me, in any view that can be taken of this case, we must hold that the opinions in the cases referred to in 4 and 9 Mich, settle beyond all controversy the liability of the company to pay taxes on the stock items of $261,410 and $584,518. <em>We </em>must in my opinion directly overrule both those cases before we can arrive at a different conclusion, and this we are not prepared to do. Upon this part of the case it is not necessary to repeat wliat was there said.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">As to the item of $250,000 bonds issued and loaned to one Dwight. It appears that those bonds were issued to obtain money for constructing the road of the company, but before using them they were loaned to Dwight, he agreeing to return the same bonds at a time agreed upon, and giving as collateral thereto certain bonds of another railroad company.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Dwight failed to return the bonds as agreed, and the bonds received as collateral proved of no value. It is therefore evident that no sale or exchange of the company\u2019s bonds was made or contemplated, but an unauthorized loan not sanctioned by the charter of the company or any one acting under authority for it. Had these bonds been exchanged for material to be used in the construction of the road, I can well see that the company should be obliged to pay a tax thereon, even although the material had been lost or destroyed before it was actually used by the company. Here there was neither sale nor exchange, but a loan, and the specific bonds loaned were to be returned, and it was only upon the failure to make such return that the company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>endeavored to realize from the collaterals which it held. Even if the company had power to ratify the loan, this eonld not be considered simply as a ratification, but as an effort to protect itself from the injurious effects of an illegal transaction. The company was held liable to taxation upon this item in the case in 4 Mich., upon the facts as there presented, upon the presumption that the^ bonds received were the equivalent of those issued, but as was said in 9 Mich., no such presumption can here be indulged in, it affirmatively appearing that the bonds received were of no value.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\">The next item is that of $184,549.34, representing the aggregate amount of discounts allowed or paid by the company in making loans. This was expressly passed upon in 4 Mich., and it was there held the company was liable to taxar tion thereon. In my opinion the conclusion there arrived at should be adhered to. I think the popular understanding is that the amount of a loan is that represented by the face of the obligation and not the amount received, and this I think must have been the intent of the Legislature. This view avoids all danger and difficulties that might otherwise be raised in the sale and negotiation of bonds, growing out of the commissions paid, or because of the fixed rate of interest or otherwise the bonds sold above or below par.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">The court below permitted the State to recover interest, and this I think was erroneous. \"Whether the reports made by the company were correct or not, until an assessment or charge was made by the Auditor General and notice thereof given the company, it was not in fault for not paying. Some act by the. Auditor General was necessary before the tax became due and payable. Interest is allowed where money is withheld, either upon the ground of a promise express or implied to pay interest or as damages for default in retaining money due and owing another. But upon whatever ground it may be placed, in the absence of an express promise, until the principal becomes due, no promise to pay interest can be implied, or be awarded as damages.</p>\n<author id=\"b227-5\">Campbell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUH\">I feel reluctant to take any steps in this cause, because the action of the Auditor General cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>anticipated, or any step taken to enforce a tax that he has not levied. But as the questions do not differ materially from those which have arisen before, I am not disposed to withhold my views.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Upon all of the questions which have been up previously, I adhere to the views which I expressed in the case decided in 9 Mich. I think that a loan <em>made to </em>the company cannot include money not loaned to them; and that if they borrow a sum for which they give obligations beyond the amount received, there is no loan made to them for the excess. The statute is designed, as I think, by its terms, to tax their actual receipts in money or its equivalent in property, or some other value, and not to tax their liabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">I agree that the stock dividends and issues of stock proportioned to that previously held by shareholders must stand on the same footing with original stock, and should be taxed as far as it is considered paid in. The arrangements allowing consolidation very clearly, in my opinion, were intended by the law to leave the Michigan company, which is the only one over which this State has any actual power of enforcing its laws directly, in its original position as to stock and loans, and to annex to its capital and loans those additions which are made proportional to the original amounts. The Michigan investment can never be less than what it was in the first place, and if gains are made which take the form of paid-up stock, each dollar of stock thus divided must be treated as having earned its share. There is no other possible way to discriminate between the Michigan and foreign investments, for neither stock nor loans are very often expended specifically in one place more than in another.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">I am, therefore, of opinion that the items for bonds for which no equivalent was received, and the discount on bonds sold at less than par should not be taxed, but that the stock dividends to the amount reckoned as paid in should be taxed. No interest can be charged, because the tax has never been levied, and is not in default.</p>\n<judges id=\"b228-7\">Graves, J. concurred.</judges>\n<author id=\"b229-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Cooley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9Az\">having been of counsel for the people in a former litigation between the parlies as to a similar subject-matter, did not sit in the ease.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
