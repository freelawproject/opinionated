Kinney, averring in her declaration that as-such guardian, on October 8, 1870, she was possessed of certain described real estate, \u201c to which said above-described real estate the said plaintiff as such guardian aforesaid claims the right of possession. And she also claims that the title to said lands is in the said Arelia Kinney and Kittie L. Kinney, her said wards, in fee-simple,\u201d and that being so possessed the plaintiffs in error entered and unlawfully withhold, etc. To this declaration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>plea in bar was interposed, but on the trial the point was made \u2022that tbe guardian .could not maintain ejectment in her own name but must sue in the name of the wards. The point was not sustained, and the guardian recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">As guardianship in this State is a matter of statutory regulation, common-law rules will afford little aid in determining \"this question. It has been held that guardians in socage might bring ejectment in their own names; <em>(Wade v. Baker </em>Ld. Raym. 130; <em>Rex v. Inhab. of Oakley </em>10 East 491; <em>Byrne v. Van Hoesen </em>5 Johns. 66; Truss. <em>v. Old </em>6 Rand. 556 ; <em>Hughes' </em>Minors\u2019 <em>Appeal 53 </em>Penn. St. 500;) but this species of guardianship is not recognized in this State. Guardians for nurture it is clear have no such right; they have not even the right of possession. <em>Anderson v. Darby </em>1 Nott &amp; M. 369 ; <em>May v. Calder </em>2 Mass. 55; <em>Ross v. Cobb. </em>9 Yerg. 463; <em>Magruder v. Peter </em>4 G. <em>&amp; </em>J. 323. Guardians by appointment have the authority the statute confers.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">By the statute the guardian has \u201c the care and management of the estate of the minor.\u201d Oomp. L. \u00a7 4816. He is \u201cto dispose of and manage all such estate and effects \u2022according to law.\u201d Id. \u00a7 4811. He is to \u201c pay all just debts due from the ward out of his personal estate and the income \u25a0of his real estate, if .sufficient, and if not, then out of his real \u2022estate, upon obtaining license for the sale thereof, and disposing of the same in the manner provided by law.\u201d Id. \u00a7 \u25a04830. He would have authority under this provision to make leases of the real estate during the minority, and to \u25a0transfer the possession to the lessee. He is to \u201c appear for \u2022and represent his ward, in all. legal suits and proceedings, unless where another person is appointed for that purpose as \u00a1guardian or next friend.\u201d Id. \u00a7 4831. He may \u201c dispose of the personal estate of the ward,\u201d (Id. \u00a7 4834); but except when licensed by the judge of probate to sell the real estate, \u2022or to mortgage the same, (Id. \u00a7 4625), his power over it is limited to leasing it and to the reception of the rents and profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">If ejectment were purely a possessory action there would be reason for holding that the guardian might sue in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>own name. But in this State ejectment determines the title. The plaintiff in his declaration \u201c shall state* whether he claims in fee, or whether he claims for his own life, or for the life of another, or for a term of years, or otherwise, specifying such lives, or the duration of such term.\u201d Comp. L. \u00a7 6213. The verdict must also \u201c specify the estate or right which shall have been established on the trial, by the plaintiff in whose favor it shall be rendered.\u201d It is plain that these provisions\u2019 do not contemplate that one person shall sue in the right of another who has the legal title. There are many cases in which one may recover on showing a mere right to <em>possession; </em>but they are cases in which this right is evidence, as against the defendant, that the plaintiff has a legal estate of some description in the land: <em>Gamble v. Horr </em>40 Mich. 561. A landlord, for example, may recover against his tenant, when the tenancy has expired, without making any other showing than that recognition of title which is always implied in tenancy; but this proves an existing estate until met by evidence that it has been terminated. <em>Niles v. Ransford, 1 </em>Mich. 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The suit being improperly planted, the judgment must be reversed with costs of this court. But the objection we have noticed ought to have been taken by demurrer, that the plaintiff might have gone out of court before the expense of preparation for trial had been incurred. And as the guardian is only a nominal party, and the title claimed by the wards is fully set out in the declaration, I think the court in its discretion might have permitted an amendment. The record will therefore be remanded to give opportunity for a motion now.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">There was an objection to a variance in a deed between the names of <em>Kenney </em>and <em>Kinney; </em>but this is immaterial. It is, as they are commonly spoken, <em>idem sonans.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b106-7\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
