J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ax1\">The plaintiff in error was sued upon a promissory note given by it in its corporate name. The principal defence relied upon was that the company, by mistake, was not, at the time of giving the note, properly organized under any law of this State; that afterwards, upon ascertaining this fact, the corporation was dissolved and a new corporation formed under a different name. This corporation was one that could have been legally organized under laws existing at the time of its formation. The business for which it was organized, that of manufacturing, was one authorized, and having attempted to organize in good faith, and having, in the course of its business, given negotiable paper in its corporate name, it could not afterwards repudiate the transaction or evade responsibility when sued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>thereon, by setting up its own mistake, affecting its original organization. <em>Merchants' etc., Bank v. Stone </em>38 Mich. <em>779.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The dissolution would not deprive the creditors of still following and looking to the old organization for payment. Our statute allows three years after dissolution, for certain purposes, in winding up the affairs. 1 Oomp. Laws \u00a7 3435.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">The execution of the note sued upon was not denied at the time of joining issue, but it was still insisted that this did not admit or dispense with proof of the endorsements' thereon. Proof of the endorsements was given and the only question relates to the sufficiency of the same. The evidence introduced was competent for such purpose.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> A more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>stringent rule, is not required for the protection of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">As we discover no error in the record the judgment must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b501-5\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b500-7\">And the attorney for the plaintiff then called Abram S.
