Sarah M. Monroe was assignee of a replevin bond to Jane Sterling, upon which Standish <em>&amp; </em>Freeman were sureties for Heintzman, the plaintiff in replevin. The suit began before a justice, and was taken on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number><em>certiorari </em>to the circuit from which it was removed on writ of error to the Supreme Court, where the defendant prevailed, and the judgments below, both of which had been in favor of the plaintiff, were reversed, <em>with costs of all the courts: Stirling v. Heintzman </em>42 Mich. 449. The assignee of the bond recites these facts in her declaration, and claims to be entitled to recover the costs adjudged against Heintzman. Defendant Standish demurred to the declaration on the ground, among others, that he was not liable for costs of the Supreme or circuit court. The case was heard on demurrer, and judgment given thereon for the defendant. Plaintiff brings error.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AFc\">Reversed.</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b29-4\"><em>James H.
