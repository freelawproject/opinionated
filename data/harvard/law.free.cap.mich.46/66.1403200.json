The circuit judge was of opinion that the case was not made out, and dismissed the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">The ev dence in the record is not such that any court can feel entirely confident what decree ought to be made; but the circuit judge had better opportunities than we have to judge of the relative credibility of witnesses-; and we are not inclined under such circumstances to reverse his decree in a case, of doubt. And we are the less disposed in this case for the reason that the evidence which bears most strongly against defendant is of occurrences which took place several years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">The decree will therefore be affirmed, but without costs or other allowances.</p>\n<judges id=\"b83-10\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
