Goodsell had treated the injury as a fracture of the humerus, but after two or three weeks it was discovered that there was a dislocation at the elbow, and another physician was called in, by whom the dislocation was properly treated. There was a fair question on the evidence whether Goodsell had been laboring under any mistake in his treatment; whether the fracture for which he treated the child had not existed in fact, and whether the child had not caused the dislocation by engaging in rough and violent sports while her arm was progressing favorably under the physician\u2019s treatment. The jury, however, found against him, and he brings error.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">The printed record contains upwards of two hundred pages. Many exceptions are taken, some to the admission or rejection of evidence, but the majority to the instructions given or refused. I find no error in the rulings on evidence. The defendant offered in writing a number of requests for instructions, all of which were refused and the judge gave instructions which he evidently meant should cover the whole case. I think it proper to copy from the bill of exceptions the whole of these instructions, with the exceptions that were taken to them as there set forth:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number><em>\u201c </em>The said circuit judge then on his own motion instructed the jury as follows, to-wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-4\">\u201c There is no question made, in fact it is conceded, that the defendant was a professed and practicing physician and surgeon and that he held himself out to his neighbors and the country round about as a physician and surgeon.

Then there was an implied promise on the part of the doctor that he himself possessed that reasonable degree of learning, skill and experience which is ordinarily possessed by members of the medical profession, and which is-ordinarily regarded by the community and by those conversant with the profession as necessary and sufficient to-qualify him to engage in the business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-11\">\u201c To which opinion and instruction the counsel for the-defendant did then and there except.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-12\">\u201c The said circuit judge further instructed the said jury :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5e6\">\u201c 2d.

Yet indiscriminately they are all excepted to, and errors of law are assigned upon them. Thus excepted to they become \u25a0a part of the printed record from which the defendant in \u2022error is to hunt out the faults which he may infer or guess the plaintiff in error will rely upon. The judges also, when they receive such a record, must guess out as best they may what it is in the rulings of the court that is supposed to constitute substantial error. Thus the purpose of the exceptions and assignments of error, which is to bring distinctly to the mind of counsel and court the supposed faults, is wholly defeated. And if the court in charging the jury inadvertently fell into error, this method of indiscriminate \u25a0objection was well calculated to prevent his making the discovery. The practice is unfair to the trial judge and to the opposing counsel, and imposes unnecessary labor upon the appellate court. I do not think the plaintiff in error is \u2022entitled to any further benefit of such exceptions than he would have been from one general exception to the whole \u2022charge; and in such a case if any part of the charge is correct the exception fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The judge, however, did commit an error subsequent to the charge, of which the plaintiff in error is at liberty to take advantage. The record states that after the jury had been absent for a time they came in and stated <em>\u201c\u25a0 </em>they had not agreed, but stood eleven to one and divided on $200.\u201d The judge in reply told them \u201c If that is the only difference it would be better for the county and the parties on both \u25a0sides that one or both sides yield so as to come together. It would be unfortunate for all to have a disagreement when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>the difference is so small,\u201d and he asked them to get together if possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">It is no doubt true that juries often compromise in the way here suggested, and that by \u201csplitting differences,\u201d they sometimes return verdicts with which the judgment of no one of them is satisfied. But this is an abuse. The law contemplates that they shall,, by their discussions, harmonize their views if possible, but not that they shall compromise, divide and yield for the mere purpose of an agreement. The sentiment or notion which permits this tends to bring jury trial into discredit and to convert it into a lottery. It was no doubt very desirable to the public and to the parties that the jurors should agree if they could do so without sacrificing what any one of them believed were the just rights of the parties; but not otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The judgment must be reversed, with costs, and a new trial ordered. The condition of the record is such that we feel warranted in directing that, in taxing the costs, only one-half the cost of printing the record shall be allowed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b646-6\">&gt; The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
