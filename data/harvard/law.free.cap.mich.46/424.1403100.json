And if any surety denies its execution on oath and testifies that his supposed signature is a forgery, and the justification of the sureties a fraud, the plaintiff is under stronger obligation to show that defendant signed and delivered the bond with full knowledge of the facts.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b440-8\">In an action on a bond evidence tending to show that its execution is fraudulent is for the jury, especially if the fact is not conceded or beyond dispute.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b440-9\">A trial judge cannot deprive the jury of its right of judgment even though the evidence submitted is positive and in part uncontradicted.

Probate Judge </em>42 Mich. 501; it is for the jury to determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>the evidence fairly tends to establish facts essential to admitting the bond in evidence: <em>Ortmann v. Merchants' Bank </em>41 Mich. 482.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b441-4\">Cooley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Abj\">In the circuit court the judge directed the jury to return a verdict for the plaintiff; and the writ of \u25a0error raises the question whether he could rightfully do this on the ease as it stood.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The respondent in the circuit court was the estate of Albert Staley. The claimant was Sarah M. Durfee, as administratrix on the estate of James F. Durfee, deceased. The claim was made upon a bond, which, with the justification of sureties and approval of the probate judge, is given in the margin.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> No question is made that the jurisdictional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>facts essential to the giving of a valid bond existed, bnt it was denied that the bond in controversy was ever so executed as to make it a binding obligation of Staley.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">It will be observed that Solomon Kittridge is named in the bond as one of the sureties, but he does not sign it. It must be assumed that the other sureties when they signed contemplated that he would join in the execution; and the absence of his name makes it incumbent upon the claimant to give some explanation before she can be in position to demand judgment against Staley and Savage. <em>Johnston v. Kimball </em>39 Mich. 187; <em>Hall v. Parker </em>id. 287. But Savage denied under oath the execution of the bond by himself, and gave strong evidence tending to show that his alleged signature was a forgery and the pretended justification a. fraud. This showing added to the necessity that the claimant should give such evidence as should affirmatively establish the fact that Staley signed and delivered the bond with full knowledge of all the. facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The claimant undertook to give such evidence, and <em>we </em>take from the brief of her counsel a statement of what is supposed to have been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Tbe bond was drawn by it. P. Eldridge, wbo was attorney for Gardner M. Durfee in tbe probate appeal. Durfee signed it Saturday evening, October 27, 1877. The next day it was taken to Staley\u2019s bouse and signed by bim. In tbe subsequent proceedings Staley appears as tbe actor. Kittridge was at Staley\u2019s bouse that forenoon, but refused to sign tbe bond. Staley sent for Savage, and Savage signed it, on being assured by Staley that tbe bond was bad and that be would protect Savage against all barm. Staley afterwards got Abram Maxon to sign tbe bond as a witness, and then went without being accompanied by Savage to the bouse of Hart, tbe justice, and induced bim to sign tbe certificate of justification. Tbe next day tbe bond was sent to the county seat and delivered to tbe judge of probate.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">The most of these facts tbe claimant insists are entirely undisputed on tbe evidence; and she claims that they establish beyond question tbe liabibty of Staley on tbe bond, and that tbe judge was at liberty to so instruct the jury. But tbe difficulty is that tbe facts were not conceded or beyond dispute: there was evidence of them which probably ought to have satisfied any one to whom it was addressed; but evidence is for tbe jury, and the trial judge cannot draw conclusions for them. It is said that on some points there was no evidence of a conflicting nature; but that does not aid tbe claimant. A jury may disbelieve tbe most positive evidence, even when it stands uncontradicted; and tbe judge cannot take from them their right of judgment. If they return what be thinks is a perverse verdict, be may set it aside and order a new trial; but be cannot take upon himself their functions as was done here.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Tbe judgment must be reversed, with costs, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b443-6\">Tbe other Justices concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b441-6\">\n<em> State of Michigan, County of Macomb, \u2014ss. :</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">In probate court for said county.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">In the Matter oe the Estate oe James S.
