Miller </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQAu\">Where former conviction is to be proved the identity of the convict must be shown: <em>McCarthy's Case </em>42 Mich. 71; the courts of Michigan have no judicial knowledge <em>of </em>the statute law of Illinois: <em>Thomas v. Robinson </em>3 Wend. 267; a judgment of another court cannot be treated as valid unless it appears that the court had jurisdiction: <em>McEwam v. Zimmer </em>38 Mich. 765; delegated powers cannot be made a basis for a judgment until it appears that they were delegated actually: <em>Hebert v. Bulte </em>42 Mich. 491; <em>Goodrich v. Burdick </em>26 Mich. 39.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b336-10\"><em>Douglass &amp; Bowen </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b336-11\">Cooley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATmR\">The assignments of error in this case are frivolous. The suit was brought upon a judgment rendered by a justice of the peace in the State of Illinois, and the transcript showed personal service and a personal appearance. The objections to a recovery upon the judgment there rendered <em>are </em>\u2014 Ewst, that no proof is given of the identity of the party now sued with the party sued in Illinois; and second, that the laws of Illinois are not put in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>evidence to show that the justice in that State had jurisdiction of the case. The first finds no support in <em>Bennett v. Libhart </em>27 Mich. 489, to which our attention was called, for the name of the party sued here was identical with that of the party against whom the judgment was recovered,, which was not the case there. The second is answered by the statute, Comp. L. \u00a7 5933, which makes the transcript: properly certified sufficient evidence. No defect was pointed* out in the certificates here.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">The judgment must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b337-5\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
