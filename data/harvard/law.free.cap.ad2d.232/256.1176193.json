The record shows that defendant, although given ample opportunity to speak, did not elaborate upon his conclusory accusations against his attorney, and no reason appears why the findings of the trial court, which \"was in the best position to determine the genuineness of the defendant\u2019s objection to his counsel\u201d <em>(People v Smith, </em>192 AD2d 310, 312, <em>affd </em>82 NY2d 731), that counsel was competent, had been working hard on defendant\u2019s behalf, and had made all the appropriate motions in terms of advancing defendant\u2019s interests, should be disturbed. We would also note that the timing of the application, made after the <em>Sandoval </em>hearing and just prior to jury selection, strongly suggests that it was a delaying tactic <em>(People v Gaines, </em>212 AD2d 727, 728, <em>lv denied </em>85 NY2d 938).
