Ulster County Department of Social Services, Respondent; Gail FF., Appellant.</parties>\n<p data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"A5Pd\">[\u2014 NYS2d \u2014]</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Af8r\">Spain, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6Gu\">Appeal from an order of the Family Court of Ulster <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>County (Mizel, J.), entered March 21, 1995, which granted petitioner\u2019s application, in a proceeding pursuant to Family Court Act article 10, to extend the placement of respondent\u2019s children with petitioner for a period of one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">In late 1991, two of respondent\u2019s children, Anthony (born in 1986) and Jamie (born in 1983), were adjudicated neglected and placed with petitioner in the same foster home; extensions of said placement occurred annually. During the summer of 1994, Jamie\u2019s biological father petitioned for custody; petitioner opposed the petition and sought extension of the placement of both children until December 19,1995. Upon completion of the custody trial Family Court reserved decision, and after a subsequent trial regarding petitioner\u2019s request for an extension of placement Family Court, by order dated March 21, 1995, extended the placement until December 19, 1995 with Jamie\u2019s placement subject to the court\u2019s decision regarding custody. Respondent now appeals from the order of extension. Significantly, after the notice of appeal was filed Family Court awarded custody of Jamie to her biological father and, in December 1995, an order on consent was made returning Anthony to respondent\u2019s care as of December 8, 1995 with continued supervision of respondent until June 19, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">We dismiss the instant appeal as moot. Respondent does not challenge the original determination of neglect in the instant appeal but, rather, directs her appeal only at the now-expired March 1995 determination extending placement. Respondent\u2019s appeal is therefore moot and is hereby dismissed <em>(see, Matter of Randy SS., </em>226 AD2d 799; <em>Matter of Tabitha LL., </em>216 AD2d 651, <em>affd </em>87 NY2d 1009). Furthermore, respondent\u2019s contention that appellate review is warranted because the extension \"represents a finding of continued neglect\u201d is misplaced <em>(see generally, Matter of Matthew C., </em>227 AD2d 679, 680-681). The March 1995 court order is not a finding of continued neglect but, rather, is an order reflecting Family Court\u2019s determination that extension of the placement is in the best interests of the children <em>(see, </em>Family Ct Act \u00a7 1055 [b] [iv] [B]).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">Cardona, P. J., Mercure, Casey and Carpinello, JJ., concur. Ordered that the appeal is dismissed, as moot, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
