The appeal is taken on the judgment roll alone and the appellant asks this court to grant a divorce and make a distribution of the property on the basis of the findings of the trial court which she contends do not support the judgment but compel the contrary judgment which she seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">The trial court found: \u201cThat all of the allegations of paragraphs I, II, III, IV, V, VI and VII of plaintiff\u2019s complaint to be true, but in this behalf the Court finds that said acts of wrongdoing herein are such in the judgment of the Court as not to constitute nor amount to extreme cruelty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">The allegations of the complaint found to be true, which are material to this appeal, read as follows: \u201cVI That since the marriage of plaintiff and defendant, the defendant has been guilty of extreme cruelty to plaintiff, which conduct has destroyed the peace of mind and happiness of plaintiff and has caused her grievous mental suffering, and has seriously impaired plaintiff\u2019s health; that defendant has thereby wrongfully inflicted upon plaintiff grievous mental suffering without any excuse or without any cause or provocation on the part of plaintiff; that thereby plaintiff\u2019s happiness has been destroyed, and her life has been rendered miserable and unendurable. That plaintiff specifies some of said acts of extreme cruelty as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-7\">\u201c(a) That on a number of occasions defendant struck plaintiff and used physical violence on her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-8\">\u201c(b) That defendant frequently accused plaintiff of infidelity and threatened to publicly destroy her reputation for chastity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-9\">\u201c(e) That frequently when plaintiff was ill and received medical care, defendant would untruthfully and maliciously accuse her of having had an abortion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-10\">\u201c(d) That in a former action for divorce brought by plaintiff against defendant, which has since been dismissed without prejudice, defendant through his attorney in open Court on the trial of said action, both plaintiff and defendant and their counsel and the officers of the Court being present, charged plaintiff with infidelity and asked leave of the Hon. John J. Van Nostrand, the Judge presiding at said trial, for leave to file an amended answer alleging infidelity by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>plaintiff. That the Hon. John J. Van Nostrand refused such permission unless defendant agreed to name a co-respondent in said pleading, which the defendant refused or was unable to do. That said charge was wholly false and known by defendant to be false, and was in execution of a threat that defendant would attack the reputation of plaintiff unless she withdrew all property demands against him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-6\">\u201c (e) That for a period of fourteen years, plaintiff worked as an employee of defendant in his restaurant above mentioned [alleged to be separate property in a prior paragraph found by the trial court to be true] in various capacities whether as waitress, cook or cashier under an agreement with defendant for payment to her of the same wages that would be received by a- stranger. That plaintiff never received payment therefor in whole or in part, although defendant frequently promised payment. That the moneys so earned by plaintiff were used by defendant in the promotion of his restaurant business and the protection of his real estate and plaintiff thereby acquired a right of reimbursement for her community interest through the diversion of community funds by defendant to the advantage of his separate estate. That the amount of money so diverted by defendant over said period of fourteen years totaled the sum of $13,650.00. That plaintiff was afraid to insist on reimbursement of said sum through fear of physical violence and slanderous public attacks upon her reputation by defendant, who violently threatened plaintiff whenever she mentioned such reimbursement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-7\">\u201c(f) That for a period of ten years, plaintiff received from the estate of her deceased father the sum of $60.00 per month, which defendant either compelled her to turn over to him or compelled her to spend for household expenses, through threats of physical violence or slanderous public attacks upon her reputation for chastity. That through such enforced contributions to the community funds, defendant was enabled to build up his restaurant business and protect his separate property. That plaintiff thereby acquired a right of reimbursement for her community interest, which defendant has refused to recognize. That the amount of money so acquired by defendant from plaintiff for the advantage of his separate estate over said period of ten years totaled the sum of $7200.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>\u201cVII</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-5\">\u201cThat plaintiff is without means to pay her attorneys for the institution and prosecution of this action and that she has incurred expenses therefor, and will incur further expense therefor; that a reasonable sum should be allowed plaintiff as and for her attorneys\u2019 fees incurred and to be incurred by bringing and prosecuting this action and for the costs thereof; that a reasonable sum should be allowed plaintiff as alimony for her support pending this action and as permanent alimony; that defendant should be ordered to refund to plaintiff the sums of money hereinabove alleged as having been taken by defendant out of the community to the advantage of his separate estate amounting to the sum of $20,850.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-6\">To recapitulate, these alleged facts found to be true the trial court found did not \u201cconstitute nor amount to extreme cruelty. \u201d It is to be noted that there are no allegations with respect to community property except those above quoted which are contained in the portion of the complaint charging the acts constituting extreme cruelty. For the purposes of this opinion it is pertinent also to note that the prayer in respect to a division of property reads: \u201cThat this Court order and decree that plaintiff have and recover of and from defendant the sum of $20,850.00 in reimbursement of the community interest of plaintiff for moneys of plaintiff used to the advantage of the separate property of defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">Inasmuch as this is an appeal on the judgment roll alone, it must be presumed that there is evidence in the record to support the findings of the trial court. <em>(Carlin </em>v. <em>Carlin, </em>114 Cal.App. 186, 189 [299 P. 543].) \u201c. . . We have not before us a transcript of the testimony taken at the trial, but, every intendment being in favor of the findings made, the statement is not unwarranted that sufficient evidence, properly corroborated, must have been adduced by the appellant in support of the allegations in his complaint charging cruelty, for, as already indicated, the trial court found that these several allegations were true. . . . The allegations of the complaint being sustained by the findings, and keeping in view that the allegations of cruelty in respondent\u2019s cross-complaint were found to be untrue, it merely remains to determine whether the several alleged acts of cruelty charged in the complaint, if proved, would warrant the granting of an interlocutory decree [of divorce].\u201d <em>(Harman </em>v. <em>Harman, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>198 Cal. 695, 697 [247 P. 194].)  Although this is the general rule with respect to findings and is applicable in an appeal on the judgment roll, there is the further rute that all findings will be liberally construed to support the judgment when the appeal is on the judgment roll. <em>(Anderson </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>68 Cal.App. 218, 221 [228 P. 715]; <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>15 Cal.2d 234, 236 [100 P.2d 773].)  Here the trial court purported also to find that the acts found to have occurred did not constitute extreme cruelty. In this connection it should be noted that one of the allegations in the complaint found to be true was \u201cThat since the marriage of plaintiff and defendant, the defendant has been guilty of extreme cruelty to plaintiff, which conduct has destroyed the peace of mind and happiness of plaintiff and has caused her grievous mental suffering, and has seriously impaired plaintiff\u2019s health.\u201d This supposed finding of fact is in irreconcilable conflict with the finding that \u201csaid acts of wrongdoing herein are such in the judgment of the Court as not to constitute nor amount to extreme cruelty.\u201d  However, a finding concerning extreme cruelty in general terms is a conclusion of law. (9 Cal.Jur. 705, 725; <em>Bilger </em>v. <em>Bilger, </em>54 Cal.App.2d 739, 741 [129 P.2d 752]; and see <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>140 Cal. 607, 608 [74 P. 155].)</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">Section 92 of the Civil Code provides that \u201cextreme cruelty\u201d is a ground for divorce. Section 94 of the Civil Code defines \u201cextreme cruelty\u201d to be \u201cthe wrongful infliction of grievous bodily injury, or grievous mental suffering, upon the other by one party to the marriage.\u201d In effect the trial court here found that the conduct relied upon in the the complaint and expressly found to have occurred, inflicted grievous mental suffering and grievous physical injury but that in his judgment such conduct did not constitute extreme cruelty.  Standing alone, a conclusion that a certain unspecified course of conduct inflicted grievous mental or physical suffering is a conclusion of law which will not support a judgment of divorce. This is the result the courts have reached because, although such finding is necessary and is the ultimate fact to be found under section 94, unless the course of conduct causing the result is specifically found, the right to a review of the trial court's actions would be vitiated. <em>(Franklin </em>v. <em>Franklin, supra.) </em> However, when such course of conduct is specifically found, the question of injury from that course of conduct is purely factual inasmuch as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>individual differences in personality make for different results from the same course of conduct. There are no findings in conflict with the affirmative fact that the specified conduct did inflict the injuries provided for in section 94 of the Civil Code. These injuries\u2014grievous bodily injury or grievous mental suffering\u2014are the ultimate facts from which the conclusion of law that the particular ground for divorce\u2014extreme cruelty\u2014exists is to be drawn. <em>(Polk </em>v. <em>Polk, </em>50 Cal.App.2d 653, 657 [123 P.2d 550]; <em>Ungemach </em>v. <em>Ungemach, </em>61 Cal.App.2d 29, 39 [142 P.2d 99]; <em>Scheibe </em>v. <em>Scheibe, </em>57 Cal.App.2d 336, 340 [134 P.2d 835]; <em>Keener </em>v. <em>Keener, </em>18 Cal.2d 445, 447 [116 P.2d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">However, if it could be said that the finding \u201cthat said acts of wrongdoing herein are such ... as not to constitute nor amount to extreme cruelty\u201d were one of ultimate fact \u201ca reversal of the judgment is nonetheless required, for the case is brought within the rule that \u2018where it clearly appears that the ultimate fact found is based upon and adduced from the findings of probative facts, and it is plain that the latter do not justify or support the ultimate fact found, the findings of probative facts will control . . . and so deprive the judgment of support. \u2019 \u201d <em>(Noble </em>v. <em>Beach, </em>21 Cal.2d 91, 99 [130 P.2d 426]; <em>Ungemach </em>v. <em>Ungemach, supra, </em>p. 40.) Impugning publicly the reputation of one\u2019s wife for chastity with knowledge of the falsity of such charge, beating one\u2019s wife, and taking money from her through threats of violence would ordinarily cause both grievous mental and grievous physical suffering and this course of conduct and result the court found to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">Once a cause of action for divorce has been established there is no discretion in the trial court to deny a divorce in California. <em>(Harman </em>v. <em>Harman, supra; Kirkpatrick </em>v. <em>Kirkpatrick, </em>152 Cal. 316 [92 P. 853]; <em>Bilger </em>v. <em>Bilger, supra; </em>Ann. discretion as to denial of divorce or separation where statutory grounds are established, 74 A.L.R. 271.) Although this court \u201cis particularly reluctant to disturb the findings of the trial court in divorce cases, inasmuch as a proper decision depends to such a large extent, in this type of proceeding, upon the credibility to be accorded the testimony of witnesses\u201d (III Nelson, Divorce and Annulment (2d ed.), p. 261), in view of the presumptions in favor of the evidence in the record in support of these findings, and in the absence of \u201ca transcript of the testimony\u201d <em>(Harman </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>v. <em>Harman, </em>supra) this court must reverse the judgment denying the divorce. It should be noted, however, that the defendant, respondent here, may appeal from the judgment of divorce necessitated by this conclusion in the event the record of the evidence does not support the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Appellant\u2019s second contention that the findings necessitate an adjudication by this court that she is entitled to $20,850 plus the $150 per month for her support and maintenance\u2014must be denied. Preliminarily, it must be noted that the trial court\u2019s purported finding \u201cthat defendant should be ordered to refund to plaintiff the sums of money hereinabove alleged as having been taken by defendant out of the community to the advantage of his separate estate amounting to the sum of $20,850.00\u201d is but a conclusion from the preceding allegations and is mere surplusage. Prom subdivisions (e) and (f) of paragraph VI of the complaint it is impossible to ascertain first, whether the appellant seeks only her half of the community property represented by her wages which were used to the advantage of defendant\u2019s separate estate ; second, whether her separate property is now part of the community property or part of his separate property and consequently, to what extent she should be reimbursed; and third, to what extent, if at all, the separate estate was enhanced by the use of the moneys. The prayer of the complaint seems to seek recovery on a civil suit basis rather than for a division of the community property interests. These ambiguities as to theories and facts are carried into the findings. In this state of the findings, in the absence of any evidence, and in view of the discretion of the trial court under section 146 of the Civil Code, this court cannot undertake to settle the property rights of the parties. <em>{Bailey </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>60 Cal.App.2d 291, 296 [140 P.2d 693].)</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">Although the court in the event of a denial of divorce would have the power to grant support and maintenance, even though no cause for divorce existed and there would be no division of the property (Civ. Code, \u00a7 136; <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>100 Cal.App. 28, 30 [279 P. 458]; <em>Parnay </em>v. <em>Parnay, </em>55 Cal.App.2d 703, 706 [131 P.2d 562]), the award of support and maintenance must be reversed also. That award was made when the court considered it was not affecting the property rights and that the marriage relationship would still exist. This award was not given in lieu of community property rights, but it comes within the principles of nonsepara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>bility considered in <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Bailey, supra, </em>page 293. Sections 139, 140, 142, 143 and 146 of the Civil Code state many factors which must be considered by the court in determining the amount of an award for permanent support and maintenance, some of which are the separate property of the spouses and the division of the community property which is made upon the dissolution of a marriage.  Where on appeal it is determined that the trial court erroneously refused a divorce and the cause must be returned to the lower court for a determination of the property rights of the parties, the whole of the judgment must be reversed so that the trial court may exercise its discretion in the matter of support and maintenance in contemplation of a complete severance of the marital relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">For the foregoing reasons the judgment appealed from is reversed with directions to the trial court to strike out from its findings all statements that the alleged acts of wrongdoing which resulted in the infliction of grievous mental suffering and grievous physical injury \u201cdid not constitute extreme crjielty\u201d and to enter an interlocutory decree of divorce on the ground of extreme cruelty in favor of plaintiff and appellant and to make such provision for the support and maintenance of the plaintiff as seems just after it has retried the issues as to the community property, exercising its discretion under section 146 and making specific findings with respect to the issues tendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">Schottky, J., pro tem., and Peters, P. J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied October 3, 1946, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied October 31, 1946.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
