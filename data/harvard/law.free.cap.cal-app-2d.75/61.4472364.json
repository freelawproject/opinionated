Plaintiff\u2019s original complaint for injunctive relief relied on an allegation that on or about August 15,1942, plaintiff adopted a system of business wherein written contracts were entered into in order to maintain minimum retail prices on the above commodity. \u25a0 (Bus. <em>&amp; </em>Prof. Code, \u00a716902, formerly \u00a7 1 of the Fair Trade Act.) A copy of the contract was attached to the complaint.' It was further alleged that defendants refused to execute the contract. Plaintiff was permitted to file an amendment to the complaint to allege that contracts were entered into on or about January 1, 1939, and the written agreement attached to the original complaint was omitted. Only one paragraph of the original complaint was materially amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">Briefly, the facts, which are free from conflict, are as follows: Plaintiff owns the rights to conduct the business of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>selling the pills in California. In this state he is the representative of the producers. The product is a registered trade mark commodity. Since its inception in 1929, in conducting the business, the practice has been to accompany the goods with an invoice whereon appear the words \u201cstop price.\u201d It was plaintiff's testimony that \u201cstop price\u201d is a term in trade usage and created an agreement that the product would not be sold for less than the respective sums specified after the words \u201cstop price.\u201d Many of these invoices were sent and received prior to March, 1942. It is admitted that during this period (1939, 1940 and 1941) defendants sold the 100 size for $3 and the 27 size for $1.09, prices which were below the \u201cstop price.\u201d On April 11, 1939, plaintiff sent a letter to defendants, calling attention to their violation of the \u201cCalifornia Fair Trade Act\u201d which included the following sentence: \u201cWe do operate within the meaning of the California Fair Trades Act and therefore recommend that you change your prices immediately.\u201d At some time subsequent to the last invoice in 1941, after a personal telephone call from plaintiff to defendants, plaintiff ceased selling his product to defendants and thereafter defendants secured the pills from jobbers. In July, 1942, plaintiff\u2019s product was added to the retail druggists\u2019 list of drugs with minimum resale prices. At that time plaintiff prepared the formal written contracts heretofore referred to in the original complaint. There is no definite evidence that any of these contracts was ever signed by any of the retailers, though there is evidence with reference to the meaning of \u201cstop prices\u201d and evidence that one drug company with stores throughout the state had been notified that the product was \u201cfair traded\u201d and the drug company needed no further notice but immediately discontinued cutting the price of the pills.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">On the basis of these facts and pleadings the trial court found that \u201con or about the 1st day \u201cof January, 1939, plaintiff . . . did adopt a system of doing business . . . [whereby] written contracts were entered into between plaintiff and his wholesale and jobbing distributors, . . . that defendants declined to execute said contracts . . . [and] That on the 9 day of July, 1942, defendants received notice of the fact that plaintiff was operating his business under the terms of the Fair Trades Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Preliminarily it must be noted that any rights which plaintiff has must be predicated on rights accruing prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>March, 1942. A federal bureau known as the Office of Price Administration, fixed the maximum prices for commodities and services as the highest price charged to a purchaser of the same class by the seller during March, 1942. The federal law is controlling and all merchants are required during the existence of the OPA to continue the particular price in vogue in 1942 unless exception is made. However, there is no evidence that the OPA has operated or been administered with any purpose of interfering with a Fair Trade Act. Amendment 62, adopted June 3, 1944, to the General Maximum Price Regulation under the heading \u201cAdjustment of Maximum Prices\u201d provides for an upward adjustment of prices \u201c(d) In the ease of any seller at retail who shows: (1) That his maximum price for any commodity established under this Regulation is less than the minimum price in effect for such commodity during March 1942 pursuant to a contract entered into in accordance with a Fair Trade Act of any state; ...\u201d It appears that one who had sold products unlawfully, that is, contrary to the provision of a fair trade act, should, under the OPA rules, have the prices correctly adjusted. Consequently there is no merit in appellants \u2019 contention that if this injunction is sustained they will be unable to sell plaintiff\u2019s products. Respondent\u2019s position\u2014that even though his rights under the Fair Trade Act accrued after March, 1942, he is entitled to their protection\u2014is not well taken. To protect minimum prices fixed after the General Maximum Price Regulation would defeat the purpose of the federal law, which during the period of the emergency is paramount. To permit injunctions against the sale of articles at less than minimum prices fixed after the General Maximum Price Regulation would raise the price of particular articles beyond the maximum prices of March, 1942. Those sellers whose maximum price was less than the minimum price could no longer sell the article, and hence only the channels-with the higher price would be open, thereby raising the price to the ultimate consumer beyond the March, 1942, levels. To the extent that the purpose of the Office of Price Administration would be defeated, it must be considered to have superseded the Fair Trade Acts of the state. Therefore, the basic issues to be decided concern whether the facts proved give plaintiff any rights under the Fair Trade Act (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 16900-16905) prior to March, 1942, and if so, has the trial court so found.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-3\">The pertinent provisions of the Business and Professions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Code, upon which this action is based read: \u201cSection 16902 . . . (a) No contract relating to the sale or resale of a commodity which bears, or the label or container of which bears, the trade-mark, brand, or name of the producer or owner of such commodity and which is in fair and open competition with commodities of the same general class produced by others violates any law of this State by reason of any of the following provisions which may be contained in such contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-4\">\u201c (1) That the buyer will not resell such commodity except at the price stipulated by the vendor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\">\u201c(2) That the vendee or producer require the person to whom he may resell such commodity to agree that he will not, in turn, resell except at the price stipulated by such vendor or by such vendee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">\u201c(b) Such provisions in any contract imply conditions that such commodity may be resold without reference to such agreement in the following cases:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">\u201c(1) In closing out the owner\u2019s stock for the purpose of discontinuing delivering any such commodity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">\u201c (2) When the goods are damaged or deteriorated in quality, -and notice is given to the public thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-9\">\u201c (3) By any officer acting under the orders of any court.\u201d Section 16904 of the Business and Professions Code provides : \u201cWilfully and knowingly advertising, offering for sale or selling any commodity at less than the price stipulated in any contract entered into pursuant to this chapter, whether the person so advertising, offering for sale or selling is or is not a party to such contract, is unfair competition and is actionable at the suit of any person damaged thereby.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">Certain general principles must be noted with respect to these sections. There is no provision therein that the contract shall be in writing. There may be a violation of the Pair Trade Act by one who \u201cis or is not a party to such contract.\u201d (\u00a7 16904.) If a producer has an agreement with some of his vendees, written or oral, formal or informal, that a specified product, assuming it meets all necessary classification requirements of section 16902, be not resold for less than a minimum price, and another vendee has <em>knowledge </em>of such agreement, though there is no agreement with that vendee, and sells the product for less than the price specified in the agreement, then he has subjected himself to suit under the act. In <em>Dr. Miles Cal. Co. </em>v. <em>Sontag C. Stores Co., </em>8 Cal.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>2d 178 [64 P.2d 726], the court said (pp. 178-179) : \u201cThe action was brought to restrain defendant from selling plaintiff\u2019s trademarked articles at cut-rate prices, and in violation of a system of <em>contracts, of which defendant had knowledge, </em>between plaintiff and its distributors, both wholesale and retail, fixing the resale price of plaintiff\u2019s products. The complaint alleges that defendant was tendered such a contract but refused to execute it. The activities of defendant are described in detail, and it is alleged that such tactics have been indulged in for the purpose of inducing other distributors to break their contracts with plaintiff. The relief prayed for is that defendant be enjoined from selling plaintiff\u2019s trademarked articles at prices less than the resale price fixed by plaintiff in its contracts with other distributors.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-3\">\u201cThe amended complaint was filed in August, 1932, and judgment of dismissal was entered in January, 1933. Subsequent to the rendition of the judgment herein, the legislature amended the Pair Trade Act (Stats. 1931, p. 583) by adding thereto section <em>iy2 </em>(Stats. 1933, p. 793). This amendment prohibits the selling ef any trademarked commodity at less than the price stipulated in resale contracts such as are_ described in the complaint \u2018whether the person so . . . selling is or is not a party to such contract\u2019., and defines such activities as unfair competition, and permits injunctive relief.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Many years prior to the adoption of the Pair Trade Act, the California Supreme Court in <em>D. Ghirardelli Co. </em>v. <em>Hunsicker, </em>164 Cal. 355 [128 P. 1041], held that a minimum resale price attached to a <em>case </em>of chocolate, if defendant\u2019s attention was called thereto at the time of purchase, could be the basis of an action for breach of contract. (See, also, <em>Grogan </em>v. <em>Chaffee, </em>156 Cal. 611 [105 P. 745, 27 L.B.A.N.S. 395].) Under the Pair Trade Act the delivery of a product with an accompanying notice of a minimum price, and the receipt of the product by the vendee, are prima facie evidence that the vendee accepts under the specifications set forth in the notice. <em>(Ingersoll &amp; Bro. </em>v. <em>Hahne &amp; Co., </em>88 N.J.Eq. 222 [101 A. 1030], <em>Id., </em>89 N.J.Eq. 332 [108 A. 128], cited with approval in <em>Max Factor &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Kunsman, </em>5 Cal.2d 446 [55 P.2d 177].) The eases dealing with anti-trust laws hold that it is a question of fact in view of all the circumstances whether contracts are entered into when notice of minimum retail prices are given. (7 A.L.R. 449; 19:926; 103:1331; 104:1452.) There is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>practical difference in the question of mutual assent necessary to form a contract whether the Fair Trade Act or the antitrust laws are involved. It is a question of fact whether contracts are entered into when notice of minimum retail prices are given.  There is no merit in the appellants \u2019 contention that invoices may not be contracts under the provisions of the Fair Trade Act or evidence of the conditions upon which products are delivered inasmuch as the statute requires no particular formality. A California ease cited in support of their position is <em>Universal C. Co. </em>v. <em>M. C. Gale, Inc., </em>40 Cal.App.2d 796 [105 P.2d 1003], wherein, considering an invoice, the court stated (p. 800) : \u201c. . . that standing alone an invoice is not regarded as evidence of title. It is neither a bill of sale nor evidence of a sale, and does not transfer the title, and it is as appropriate to a bailment as to a sale.\u201d That language is not pertinent to the question here involved. Respondent asserts that the invoices were contracts indicating the terms of the sale according to business custom and that no specific form of contract is required under the code. It is unnecessary to decide whether the invoices standing alone would constitute a contract. The invoices, when taken in connection with plaintiff\u2019s testimony concerning the meaning of \u2018\u2018stop price,\u201d and the plaintiff\u2019s conduct, as evidenced by the letter and his actions, are sufficient to support the finding that plaintiff entered into contracts. That part of the finding concerning written contracts is immaterial, except insofar as it shows the confusion in the findings based upon the first complaint under which no relief could have been given because of the federal laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">The vital question in this ease concerns the appellants\u2019 knowledge of the contracts at the time they sold for less than the minimum price. The respondent\u2019s right under the statute is incomplete unless the vendee sells with knowledge. The following facts prove that prior to March, 1942, defendants-had knowledge that \u2018\u2018Yon\u2019s Pink Tablets\u201d should not be sold at a retail price lower than that designated by plaintiff: (a) The invoices read as follows: \u201c1 dozen Yon\u2019s Pink Tablets 100s $28.00 dz Discount 7%% $25.90 Stop Prices : 27s\u2014$1.25 100s\u2014$3.50.\u201d (b) There was uncontradicted testimony that \u2018\u2018stop price\u201d is a term of trade usage, meaning that the commodity should not be sold for a sum less than that specified in the invoice, (c) There is evidence to show that defendants were notified by telephone communications monthly that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>there was a violation of the Fair Trade Act. (d) In 1939 plaintiff forwarded a letter to defendants reading: \u201cWe have again investigated the prices you are asking for Yon\u2019s Pink Tablets and again your sales people quoted $1.19 and $3.39 instead of $1.25 plus State Sales Tax and $3.50 plus State Sales Tax. <em>This as you know is a direct violation of the California Fair Trades Act. </em>We <em>do </em>operate within the meaning of the California Fair Trades Act and therefore recommend that you change your prices immediately.\u201d (Emphasis added.) (e) The plaintiff refused to supply the pills to defendants after a certain telephone call, and defendants\u2019 action in obtaining the commodity from jobbers. Defendants testified that a conversation was held relative to the price at which the items were sold, (f) The defendants stated that the price was reduced \u2018 \u2018to make a lead. \u201d (g) Defendants testified that they knew each bottle carried the retail price, (h) Defendants testified that \u201cFair Traded\u201d articles are recognized from contracts or \u201cby the fact that there is a universal knowledge in the business that they are \u2018 Fair Traded. \u2019 \u2019 \u2019 The foregoing evidence called for a finding that defendants had knowledge prior to March, 1942, and continued to sell below the minimum price; but despite such evidence the trial court found only that on the 9th day of July, 1942, defendants received notice of the fact that plaintiff was operating his business under the terms of the Fair Trade Act. The date so specified was evidently taken from the original complaint. In order to support a judgment in plaintiff\u2019s favor, because of the General Maximum Price Regulation, it was essential that the trial court find that defendants had knowledge prior to March, 1942. Therefore, in order that there be a finding which will conform to the evidence in the case, this court, exercising the authority conferred by article YI, section 4% of the Constitution, and by section 956a of the Code of Civil Procedure, does hereby find that defendants had knowledge that the product, Yo\u00f1\u2019s Pink Tablets, was subject to contracts requiring retail minimum prices under the Fair Trade Act prior to March, 1942, and sold said product prior to March, 1942, at less than those minimum prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\">A minor question arises as to whether any right of plaintiff is barred by the statute of limitations or laches. In pleading the statute of limitations it is necessary to refer to the \u201csection and <em>subdivision </em>thereof\u201d relied upon. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7458.) (Emphasis added.) Defendants failed to</p>\n<p id=\"AMW\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>plead the statute of limitations properly.  There is no finding called to our attention covering the plea of laches. It must he assumed that if there was such a finding it would be adverse to appellants. In the defense of laches, it is necessary to show that the party taking advantage of the defense has suffered some injury as the result of delay. <em>(Maguire </em>v. <em>Hibernia S. &amp; L. Soc., </em>23 Cal.2d 719 [146 P.2d 673,151 A.L.R. 1062]; <em>Zakaessian </em>v. <em>Zakaessian, </em>70 Cal.App.2d 721 [161 P.2d 677].) In the present case no prejudice to defendants has been shown. If they desire now to obey the Pair Trade Act it is an easy matter to adjust with OPA. (OPA GMPR Arndt 62 to Commodities and Service, Part 1499; <em>Schreier </em>v. <em>Siegel, </em>265 App.Div. 36 [37 N.Y.S.2d 624]; <em>Helena Rubenstein, Inc. </em>v. <em>Charline\u2019s Cut Rate, Inc., </em>135 N.J.Eq. 145 [36 A.2d 910].)</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The findings are modified as herein indicated. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Peters, P. J., and Knight, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
