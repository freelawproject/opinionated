Appellant agreed that he would not compete with respondents for a period of five years after the date of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-14\">In their complaint, which was filed on October 11, 1945, respondents alleged that appellant was doing and threatening to do various acts which, in violation of the agreement, would be in competition with respondents\u2019 activities in the use of the device at race tracks throughout the world.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-15\">Upon respondents\u2019 application, and after a hearing at which affidavits were presented by both parties, the court issued a preliminary injunction on November 16, 1945, restraining ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>pellant \u201cpending the final determination of this action\u201d from doing any of the acts complained of by respondents, from which order defendant has appealed.
