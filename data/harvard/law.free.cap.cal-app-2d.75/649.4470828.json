Social Security investigators the prediction was freely made that the activities would go on under cover.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-8\">\u201cThe particular women involved might leave the city but others would come in to take their places (it was said) and many times the others would be more liable to spread disease because they would be handicapped by clandestine surroundings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-9\">\u201cThe early morning raids Monday by the sheriff\u2019s office would seem to give a certain amount of weight to these predictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-10\">\u201cCertainly the activities imputed to the \u2018House of the Brown Gables\u2019 would give substance to such predictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-11\">\u201cThe thing that is lacking for a logical comparison of the two situations are figures on the prevalence of venereal disease. It is on the venereal disease ground alone that steps to curb promiscuous prostitution have been taken in military areas\u2014 these steps being taken elsewhere as well as in Vallejo.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-12\">\u201cIf the figures would show a decline in venereal disease rates since the brothels, the justification for the tight restrictions would be made fully, but, on the other hand, if the rates show an increase, it would indicate that places of the reputation imputed to the \u2018House of the Brown Gables\u2019 are doing an even bigger disservice to the nation\u2019s war effort than the Georgia Street places ever were.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-13\">Count four alleges that on or about February 7,1944, plaintiff was charged, among other things, by complaint filed in the Justice\u2019s Court of Vallejo Township, with a violation of section 316 of the Penal Code; that on March 8th and 9th she was tried before said court and found not guilty of said charge; that nevertheless on Sunday, March 12, 1944, defendants published in the Times-Herald, and readers thereof saw and read, the following libelous article:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-14\">\u201cBrown Gables Guilty Verdict Mother, Son Freed on 1 Count,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-15\">Found Guilty on 2 Others. \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-16\">\u201cThe infamous Brown Gables case\u2014which opened last February 6 when sheriff\u2019s deputies raided the premises and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>arrested seven unmarried couples who were occupying bedrooms there\u2014ended in justice court yesterday with convictions against the operators on two counts of violation of the county zoning ordinance and a not guilty verdict on the charges of operating a disorderly house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-5\">\u201cThe findings by Judge John J.

Lynch had tackled one of the most difficult charges in the Penal Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-18\">\u201cSumming up the case against the Glenns on this count, Judge Bradley on two occasions pointed out that in most cases of disorderly houses, the only possible conviction is on circumstantial evidence. This conviction must be, however, on proof that shows guilt \u2018beyond any reasonable doubt.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-19\">\u201cFurther analyzing the ease against the Brown Gables, the court pointed out that the one instance of operation was the night of February 6, when the sheriff\u2019s office, in a raid, trapped 14 unmarried men and women occupying rooms at the premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>\n<em>\u201cNot Enough Evidence</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">\u2018 \u2018 This isolated instance, the judge pointed out, did not constitute sufficient circumstantial evidence; there was no proof that the Glenns had knowledge that the couples were unmarried ; there was no evidence that such conditions had been continued over a period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-7\">\"Only a neighbor testified to (continued on page 2, col. 3)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-8\"><em>\u201cHugh Glenn, Mother Guilty in Brown Gables Searing </em>(continued from Page 1)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARh\">specific instances of disorderly conduct at the premises and this single testimony was not sufficient to base a conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-10\">\u201cThe court felt that there was evidence pointing to the probability that the premises had been operated as a disorderly house, but that the amount of evidence presented was not sufficient nor complete enough to justify the conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-11\">\n<em>\u201cNo Doubt on Others</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-12\">\u201cJudge Bradley said further there was no question on the matter of operating a hotel without a license\u2014that Glenn himself in his testimony had admitted that he was operating the premises as a hotel. Neither was there any question that the operations were being conducted without a use permit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-13\">\u201cIn connection with the use permit, however, the court established that the violation was against the owner of the premises\u2014in this case Mrs. Glenn\u2014and not against the son.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-14\">\u201cJudge Bradley also took occasion to comment on the matter of venereal disease allegedly contracted by enlisted men in the Navy after visits to the Brown Gables.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-15\">\u201c \u2018We have an unusual situation in this community/ the court commented. \u2018 There is a large number of naval personnel here, and policing is a big job carried on diligently with a minimum amount of help. It seems to me that the court\u2019s duty in this community is not only to sit in judgment but also to determine the best possible policy to follow in connection with our local situation. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-16\">\n<em>\u201cOthers Do the Same</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-17\">\u2018 \u2018 Certainly if the defendants are guilty of operating a disorderly house, Judge Bradley continued, other hotels in this community must be equally guilty. They sent couples to the Brown Gables when they were unable to handle them, and \u2018clerks from these establishments were here to testify that they never transferred anyone to the Brown Gables that they would not have accepted in their own premises. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>\u201cHolding the civil authorities are at a disadvantage in the matter of dealing with enlisted men, the court suggested that if the naval authorities were truly anxious on the score of venereal disease, they had it within their power to halt the entrance of service men into such premises as the Brown Gables.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-5\">\u201c \u2018The naval authority\u2019s shore patrol, if placed at such places as the Brown Gables, can go to an enlisted man and ask him what he is doing there and get a full explanation from him, \u2019 the court said. \u2018If the Brown Gables has been a source of infection of enlisted personnel, the naval authorities have it within their power to eliminate it in five minutes. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-6\">\n<em>\u201cCan Use Patrol</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-7\">\u201c \u2018The naval authorities can place a patrol in front of every hotel in this community where enlisted men are contracting venereal disease and eliminate it immediately,\u2019 the court continued.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-8\">\u201cJudge Bradley pointed out that the civilian law enforcement agencies have no right to stop a man and woman and question them as to their marital status if they have every outward appearance and claim to be man and wife. There is no civilian law which will discourage the situation, but naval authorities do have that power, he asserted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-9\">\u201cJudge Bradley also castigated the \u2018tie-up of convenience\u2019 between hotels in Vallejo and the Brown Gables, and referred again to the testimony of the hotel clerks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-10\">\n<em>\u201cMrs. Glenn Testifies</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-11\">\u201cYesterday\u2019s session opened with Mrs. Glenn on the stand under cross-examination by District Attorney Lynch. She testified that she makes all the beds and does all the cleaning at the premises and that the tenants are not expected to do the housework about their rooms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-12\">\u201cFor rebuttal witnesses, District Attorney Lynch called Mrs. O\u2019Reilly, the next-door neighbor; Mrs. E. C. Valentine, who lives at the end of the block; Mrs. R. W. Hooper, Mrs. Harriett Scott; Fred J. Shortridge, Solano county sanitary inspector; Stanley Gravea, deputy sheriff, and Walter Hahn, Jr., secretary-advisor of the Solano County Planning Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-13\">\u201cAll testified that the Brown Gables, to their knowledge, had the reputation of being a disorderly premises.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-14\">In addition to the foregoing matter, the complaint alleges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>that by certain designated language defendants charged and were understood as charging that plaintiff was morally corrupt and vile in character and guilty of keeping and operating a disorderly house upon said premises, and that by said malicious act plaintiff was exposed to hatred, contempt, ridicule and obloquy. It is also alleged that by reason of the publications plaintiff was injured in her reputation and good name and experienced great mental suffering, to her damage in specified amounts; and that by reason of said publications plaintiff\u2019s business of operating an auto court has been completely destroyed and the reputation and good will of her place of business has been so publicly maligned that the public no longer patronizes the same, to the further damage of plaintiff in a stated amount. Additionally, and in relation to the headlines of the article of March 12th, in count four it is alleged that \u201cthe sub-headline in said publication was absolutely false in that plaintiff\u2019s son, Hugh Glenn, was found guilty on only one count of said complaint, which had to do only with a county zoning ordinance, and not on two counts, as charged in said publication. \u2019'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Although in her opening brief on appeal plaintiff has failed to comply with rule 15a of Rules on Appeal, in not setting forth separately each point therein, it indirectly appears that she attacks the order of the trial court on the following grounds: That the complaint sufficiently alleges the falsity of the articles published, and that said articles are not privileged, or, if they were, then malice was sufficiently alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">By section 45 of the Civil Code, libel is defined as a \u201cfalse and unprivileged publication by writing, printing, picture, effigy, or other fixed representation to the eye, which exposes any person to hatred, contempt, ridicule or obloquy, or which causes him to be shunned or avoided, or which has a tendency to injure him in his occupation. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">It is readily apparent from a reading of said section that the falsity of the publication is an essential ingredient of the wrong complained of. Therefore, if on the face of the complaint the gist or sting of the libel is shown to be true, or a truthful report of the proceedings which the publisher purports to recount, no action lies, and the demurrer was properly sustained. <em>(Chavez </em>v. <em>Times-Mirror Co., </em>185 Cal. 20, 21 [195 P. 666]; <em>Mortensen </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Examiner, </em>112 Cal.App. 194, 205 [296 P. 927].)</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">While the complaint herein does not present as clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>a case as that in <em>Chavez </em>v. <em>Times-Mirror Co., supra, </em>nevertheless it is conspicuously evident that nowhere in the complaint herein is there a denial of the truth of the matters charged, either direct or indirect, other than the very limited one contained in count four. Here, as in the Mortensen case, the only portion of the published charges which the complaint denies is a nondamaging statement contained in the subhead-lines: \u201cMother, Son Freed on 1 Count, Found Guilty on 2 Others.\u201d The basis for this denial is the fact that, as shown in the body of the article, plaintiff\u2019s son was freed on two counts and found guilty on only one. However, Hugh Glenn is not a party to this proceeding nor is plaintiff suing on his behalf. Obviously therefore, the statement, even if it contained defamatory implication as to him, would not constitute a libel upon plaintiff. <em>(Skrocki </em>v. <em>Stahl, </em>14 Cal.App 1, 4-5 [110 P. 957].) Such denial does not meet the requirements 'of the rule that \u201cthe allegations of the falsity of the charge must be as broad as the charge itself.\u201d <em>(Mortensen </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Examiner, supra, </em>at page 202.)</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">In the comparatively recent case of <em>Emde </em>v. <em>San Joaquin County etc. Council, </em>23 Cal.2d 146, 160 [143 P.2d 20, 150 A.L.R. 916], a further amplification of the rule applicable to plaintiff\u2019s charge of falsity made in connection with said sub-headlines has been stated thus :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-6\">\u201cIt is generally agreed that it is not necessary to prove the literal truth of an allegedly libelous accusation in every detail, so long as the imputation is substantially true so as to justify the \u2018gist\u2019 or \u2018sting\u2019 of the remark. <em>(Heame </em>v. <em>DeYoung, </em>119 Cal. 670 [52 P. 150, 499]; <em>Kurata </em>v. <em>Los Angeles News Pub. Co., </em>4 Cal.App.2d 224, 227 [40 P.2d 520]; <em>Mortensen </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Examiner, </em>112 Cal.App. 194, 203 [296 P. 927]; <em>Skrocki </em>v. <em>Stahl, </em>14 Cal.App. 1, 5 [110 P. 957]; 3 Rest., Torts, sec. 582, comment e; Prosser on Torts, sec. 95, pp. 855, 856.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">In seeking to sustain the sufficiency of the complaint, plaintiff relies on the allegation that \u201cby reason of said publication . . . plaintiff was injured in her reputation and good name,\u201d and from this premise argues that \u201cIt would follow that true statements could not affect her reputation and good name and thus an issue has been created as to whether the statements made by respondent were true or false, the pleader indirectly charging that they are false. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">We do not agree with the conclusion that \u201ctrue statements could not affect her reputation and good name.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>injurious character of a publication is to be gauged by the effect it would have on persons unacquainted with the plaintiff and hearing of him for the first time. <em>(Ervin </em>v. <em>Record Publishing Co., </em>154 Cal. 79, 82 [97 P. 21, 18 L.R.A.N.S. 622].) On such persons, obviously, a truthful accusation and a false accusation masquerading as the truth would have the same effect, as far as their conduct toward or regard for the accused person was concerned. Moreover, plaintiff\u2019s reputation and good name are not in issue; the averment relied upon by plaintiff no more than reaffirms that which is presumed, and being mere surplusage cannot take the place of an essential allegation. <em>(Draper </em>v. <em>Hellman etc. Bank, </em>203 Cal. 26, 42-43 [263 P. 240]; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Hearst, </em>160 Cal. 143, 186 [116 P. 530] ; 36 C.J. \u00a7200, p. 1236; 33 Am.Jur. \u00a7236, p. 214.) '</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Irrespective of questions relating to the pleading of falsity, it is readily apparent that the complaint herein is further fatally defective in that it discloses a case of qualified privilege yet fails to allege malice in such a manner as to overcome the case thus disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">In the first place, the complaint shows that the articles were published during times of war in a community where extensive war activities were being conducted, both civilian and military, and where the welfare of those engaged therein was a matter of vital concern to every right-thinking person. It would thus appear that the complaint on its face shows that said publications came within the meaning of subdivision 3 of section 47 of the Civil Code, which, prior to its amendment in 1945, and as it read at the time when the right of action herein, if any, arose, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-8\"><em>\u201cA </em>privileged publication is one made\u2014 ... 3. In a communication, without malice, to a person interested therein, (1) by one who is also interested, or (2) by one who stands in such relation to the person interested as to afford a reasonable ground for supposing the motive for the communication innocent, or (3) who is requested by the person interested to give the information.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">Particularly applicable to the situation thus disclosed is the rule enunciated in 3 Restatement, Torts, section 598, wherein it is said in part that : <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>The rule stated in this Section is applicable when any recognized interest of the public is in danger, including the interest in the prevention of crime and the apprehension of criminals, the interest in the honest discharge of their duties by public officers, and the interest in obtaining legislative relief from socially recognized evils.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>\u201cAn occasion is conditionally privileged when the circumstances induce a correct or reasonable belief that (a) facts exist which affect a sufficiently important public interest. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>The complaint discloses a further situation where the communications in question, if without malice, would be qualifiedly privileged under the provisions of subdivision 4 of section 47 of the Civil Code, relating to reports of judicial proceedings. Said section reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\">\u201cA privileged communication is one made ... 4. By a fair and true report, without malice, in a public journal, of (1) a judicial, (2) legislative, or (3) other public official proceeding, or (4) of anything said in the course thereof, or (5) of a verified charge or complaint made by any person to a public official, upon which complaint a warrant shall have been issued.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">That the articles of which plaintiff complains come within this category likewise seem to be clear. They are shown to comprise a history of the proceedings which, according to plaintiff\u2019s own recital set out in count four, were' instituted by the filing of a criminal complaint in the justice\u2019s court of the proper township \u201con or about February 7th, 1944,\u201d the date of the first article, and culminated in court proceedings on March 8 and 9, 1944, which were reported in the alleged libelous article published March 12, 1944. The privileged character of reports of this kind has been recognized in numerous decisions by various courts. <em>(McClure </em>v. <em>Review Pub. Co., </em>38 Wash. 160 [80 P. 303, 305]; <em>Kilgore </em>v. <em>Koen, </em>133 Ore. 1 [288 P. 192, 194-195]; <em>Sherwood </em>v. <em>Evening News Assn., </em>256 Mich. 318 [239 N.W. 305, 306-308].) In determining the scope of the term \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d within the purview of the rule, the courts of this state seem to take a comparatively broad view of the question. <em>(Kurata </em>v. <em>Los Angeles News Pub. Co., </em>4 Cal.App.2d 224, 228 [40 P.2d 520].)</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">It follows that, as the complaint herein discloses the existence of the aforementioned qualified occasions, it remains to be seen only if their effectiveness as a complete bar to the action has been undermined by a sufficient showing of malice; for, in the case of a qualified privilege \u201cmalice is not inferred from the communication or publication\u201d (Civ. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>Code, \u00a7 48), and hence, \u201cwhere the complaint discloses a case of qualified privilege, no malice is presumed and in order to state a cause of action the pleading must contain affirmative allegations of malice in fact.\u201d <em>(Locke </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>7 Cal.2d 599, 602 [61 P.2d 922].)</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The case last cited furnishes a definite answer to this question. The language of the pleading therein is in general similar to that contained in the complaint before us, wherein, as has been seen, it is alleged that \u201cby such malicious act the plaintiff was exposed to hatred, contempt, ridicule and obloquy.\u201d In said case the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-7\">\u201cThe pleading, of course, does use the words \u2018malicious\u2019 and \u2018maliciously, \u2019 but these words, standing alone, are not sufficient to charge malice in fact. The rule as stated in <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Moberly, </em>6 Ind.App. 490 [33 N.E. 981, 983, 984], is as follows : . . . \u2018When the complaint discloses that the occasion was privileged, the allegation that the language was false and malicious is not sufficient, but in such case the complaint must further show that the defendant acted maliciously in publishing it.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Loche </em>v. <em>Mitchell, supra, </em>at <em>page </em>603.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">With respect to plaintiff\u2019s argument that the headline \u201cBrown Gables Guilty Verdict\u201d would be understood as implying that plaintiff had been found guilty of a morals charge, \u201csince defendant\u2019s newspapers for several days had been stressing only the morals charges against plaintiff,\u201d it is pertinent to point out that in none of the articles preceding the one carrying said headline was plaintiff\u2019s name or identity in any way mentioned, and therefore a person reading it would have no reason to associate plaintiff with the case unless or until he had read the succeeding subject matter which explains in detail the exact meaning of the headline. Furthermore, it appears that the statement contained in said headline is literally and essentially true. The cases cited by plaintiff in support of her argument, namely, <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Hearst, </em>160 Cal. 143 [116 P. 530], <em>Commercial Pub. Co. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>(C.C.A. 6) 149 F. 704 [79 C.C.A. 410], and <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Pioneer Press Co., </em>30 Minn. 41 [14 N.W. 62], which holds that a libelous headline may make the publication actionable if it goes beyond the subject matter contained in the body of the publication, are not in point. In the Davis case the headline read: \u201cExposures Found to be True\u201d; but the text following the headline showed that only one of the derogatory charges was found to be true. In the Commercial Publishing Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>pany ease, the headline was \u201cMurderer Arrested,\u201d although from the body of the article it appeared that the person arrested was only a suspect. In the Pratt ease, it was held that the heading \u201cCulpable Neglect,\u201d in reference to the activities of a physician, might constitute actionable defamation where none of the acts described in the article necessarily justified the charge; \u201cFor,\u201d said the court, \u201call the facts stated in the body of the article might be true, and not constitute culpable neglect on the part of the plaintiff.\u201d In the present case, if the facts stated in the body of the article are true, they necessarily show a \u201cBrown Gables Guilty Verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Finally, it may be observed that, insofar as the article in question states that plaintiff has been found guilty of operating a hotel in a residential district and without a use permit, it is not libelous <em>per se </em>or at all. (3 Rest., Torts, \u00a7 569.) Whatever opprobrium would attach to the violation of the ordinances in question would be injurious only insofar as it had a tendency to injure plaintiff in her occupation. But since plaintiff\u2019s occupation is unlawful she would not be entitled to recover for such an injury. <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Simonton, </em>43 Cal 242, 249-250.) Indeed, it is doubtful if plaintiff may complain of anything said about the business she is found to have been conducting, and which she does not deny conducting unlawfully. \u201cAnd it thus appearing that the alleged libels were only in respect of an unlawful business carried on by the plaintiff, it results that the action cannot be maintained, \u2018for I think (said Best, Ch.J.) that where a man complains of a libel written respecting an illegal transaction in which he is engaged, the illegality of that transaction is an answer to his complaints.\u2019 (3 Bing, 440; see, also, Hilliard on Torts, 278Townsend on Libel and Slander, 197-8, and cases there cited.) \u201d <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Simonton, supra, </em>at pages 249-250.)</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">The order and judgment are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Adams, P. J., and Thompson, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
