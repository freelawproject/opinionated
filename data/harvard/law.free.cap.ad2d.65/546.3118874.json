Judgment affirmed insofar as appealed from, without costs or disbursements. The petitioner has lived in her project apartment for 20 years. She has three sons, aged 16, 18 and 20, and a 9-year-old daughter. Ten of the 11 offenses which culminated in the housing authority\u2019s finding of nondesirability were committed by the petitioner\u2019s three sons, none of whom currently reside with her. The eleventh offense was allegedly committed by the petitioner\u2019s boyfriend. Since neither the petitioner nor her daughter committed any of the offenses, termination of her tenancy was so disproportionate to the offenses as to be shocking to one\u2019s sense of fairness, and Special Term did not exceed its authority in modifying the penalty (see <em>Matter of Butterly &amp; Green v Lomenzo, </em>36 NY2d 250, 256; <em>Matter of Pell v Board of Educ., </em>34 NY2d 222, 233). Damiani, J. P., Suozzi, Shapiro and Cohalan, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
