In considering alternatives to imprisonment the court shall examine the sentencing criteria contained in \u00a7 46-18-225, MCA. If the offender is subsequently sentenced to the state prison or a women\u2019s correctional facility, the court shall state its reasons why alternatives to imprisonment were not selected, based on the criteria contained in 46-18-225.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\"><em>See State v.
