We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">The following issues are presented on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Craig\u2019s request for new counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">2. Did the District Court deny Craig his constitutional right to the assistance of counsel by refusing to substitute court-appointed counsel and thereby giving Craig the option of proceeding to trial with court-appointed counsel or appearing <em>pro </em>se?</p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">3. Did the District Court deny Craig his right to represent himself by permitting \u201cstandby\u201d counsel to become involved in the defense?</p>\n<p id=\"b165-13\">4. Did the District Court err in instructing the jury as to \u201cadmissions\u201d and \u201cconfessions?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-14\">On June 15, 1994, the State charged Craig with the robbery of the Ralph and Rose Formal Wear Shop in Butte, Montana. At the time of the robbery, Craig was on parole and was a resident of the Butte Pre-Release Center. Public Defender Pat McGee (McGee) was appointed to represent Craig. At his arraignment, Craig pled not guilty and the court set the trial for September 6,1994; the court later rescheduled the trial for October 18, 1994. On September 26, Craig filed a motion to remove McGee as bis counsel. In his motion, Craig stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b165-15\">Said motion is based upon all of the files, records and proceedings herein, and more particularly upon the grounds that such representation of the Defendant by Mr. Pat McGee constitutes a distinct violation of the Defendant\u2019s protected rights to have effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>assistance of Counsel for his defense, and presents a conflict of interest prejudicial to the Defendant\u2019s entire case.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">The District Court denied Craig\u2019s motion for substitution of counsel and offered the following explanation for its ruling:</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Based on the pleadings and the record, the Court finds that the Defendant has failed to allege any facts in support of his motion that would entitle him to the requested relief. Section 46-13-101(4), MCA, requires the moving party to \u201cstate with particularity the grounds for the motion\u201d and to provide a statement of the \u201crelevant facts upon which the motion is being made.\u201d Defendant\u2019s vague allegation that continued representation of him by the public defender \u201cconstitutes a distinct violation of the Defendant\u2019s protected rights\u201d is insufficient to show any facts in support of his request for substitution of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">After the court denied Craig\u2019s motion, McGee informed the court that Craig refused to discuss his defense with him. As a result, the court conducted a hearing to give Craig the opportunity to explain on the record why his public defender should be replaced. At the hearing, Craig stated that there was \u201cno communication between me and my public defender.\u201d Additionally, Craig recited a litany of problems he had with McGee including: McGee refused to move for either discovery or change of venue; McGee failed to interview a witness and failed to suppress evidence; McGee advised him to enter a plea agreement; and, McGee had seen him only one time.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The deputy county attorney responded to Craig\u2019s allegations, as did McGee. Subsequently, the District Court found that McGee was providing effective assistance and denied Craig\u2019s motion to substitute counsel. The court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">As with any other defendant, you are entitled to hire any attorney you wish. Since you\u2019re obviously indigent, the Court appointed Mr. McGee for you. You do have the right in that circumstance for a court-appointed counsel, but you do not have the right to choose your own attorney. So I\u2019m just telling you now that you also have the right to represent yourself for your trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">Mr. McGee is going to stay on your case. I\u2019m going to deny your motion to replace him with any other public defender. It\u2019s too late, among other things. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been any ineffectiveness on his part in preparing this case for trial. Nevertheless, he\u2019ll be here in court the morning of the trial, and if you don\u2019t want to use him, that\u2019s fine. You go ahead and represent yourself or bring another attorney. If you want to make some arrangements other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>wise, that\u2019s open for you. We\u2019re not going to change anything. The trial is going to go on as scheduled. Mr. McGee is going to be here as scheduled, and you\u2019re going to be here as scheduled. If you have a defense, we\u2019d like to hear it from you that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">Craig was given a copy of his file and trial began as scheduled. The first day of trial, before voir dire and in the presence of the prospective jurors, Craig told the court he was having problems with McGee acting as counsel. In response, the court asked him \u201cdo you intend to try the case yourself? You\u2019re entitled to do that.\u201d Craig replied: \u201cI can\u2019t, Your Honor. I\u2019m not a lawyer.\u201d The following colloquy took place concerning Craig\u2019s right to counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">THE COURT: You have a lawyer appointed for you. You don\u2019t have a lawyer of your choice when you\u2019re indigent, but we do appoint an experienced attorney for you. We\u2019ve done that. Your attorney, Mr. McGee, has worked on this case since its inception. He\u2019s submitted, by the way, instructions as to the law of this case as I\u2019ve requested all attorneys to do. He\u2019s going to be here in court, and we\u2019re going to proceed with this matter, and he\u2019s there for you to seek counsel from. You can ask for his help any time you wish, or you can remain mute if you wish. I don\u2019t care what you do. But you\u2019re here in court for a trial, and we\u2019re going to go ahead with this trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">THE DEFENDANT: Like I said, Your Honor, we had that meeting on Friday. I told you there was no communication between me and this lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">THE COURT: This is the lawyer you got from the Court, from the county. This is the lawyer we\u2019re paying for you. He\u2019s on retainer for the year. You asked for change of counsel last week. That\u2019s too late to be asking for changes of counsel. But you, at any time, could hire your own attorney. I told you that. You can also act as your own attorney. In the meanwhile, this is your court-appointed attorney. You can use him if you wish. He\u2019s going to be here through the remainder of this trial. He\u2019ll be subject to your need for assistance if and so you do need assistance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">During voir dire, the court explained to Craig that he could examine the jurors or defer to McGee. The court suggested that, unless he objected, Craig should let McGee conduct the voir dire. Craig responded: \u201cI can\u2019t pick them. I don\u2019t know nothing about them. ... I haven\u2019t been in this town long enough. There\u2019s nothing I can do, you know.\u201d The court replied: \u201cMr. Craig, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve appointed one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>of the public defenders on your behalf.\u201d The court then directed McGee to conduct voir dire and he did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">After conducting voir dire, McGee advised Craig that he was entitled to six peremptory challenges. Craig responded: \u201cI can\u2019t pick them,\u201d refused to accept McGee\u2019s offers of assistance, and waived his peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">After the prosecutor gave his opening statement and it was Craig\u2019s opportunity to do so, the court told Craig that he could make his opening statement, waive it, have McGee give it, or he could reserve his opening statement until the end of the State\u2019s case-in-chief. Craig responded: \u201cWell, as far as I\u2019m concerned, Pat McGee is not my attorney. He gave up that Friday.\u201d The following discussion then took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">THE COURT: He\u2019s still an attorney here from the Court\u2019s viewpoint. You can use him any time you wish. You can change your thinking on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">THE DEFENDANT: I\u2019m not an attorney, so I guess there won\u2019t be no defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">THE COURT: Well, what does that mean? Do you want Mr. McGee to make an attempt here to make a statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\">THE DEFENDANT: That means there would be no defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-10\">THE COURT: I didn\u2019t hear that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-11\">THE DEFENDANT: I\u2019m not a lawyer, so I can\u2019t defend myself, so there would be no defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-12\">THE COURT: Mr. McGee, do you want to make a statement now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOf\">MR. McGEE: Your Honor, I\u2019m under limited disability given the circumstances of what went on. I\u2019ll reserve any opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-13\">The court found that Craig reserved his opening statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-14\">During its case-in-chief, the State called seven witnesses and offered twelve exhibits. Neither Craig nor McGee cross-examined any witnesses nor objected to any exhibits. When the court asked Craig if he wished to cross-examine witnesses, Craig\u2019s response was silence, \u201cno,\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t, I\u2019m not a lawyer.\u201d When the court asked McGee if he wished to cross-examine the State\u2019s first witness, McGee responded: \u201cAgain, he relates that I\u2019m not his attorney. So I guess there will be no cross-examination, Your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-15\">McGee participated in the settlement of jury instructions. During settlement of instructions but prior to the conclusion of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, the court instructed Craig concerning his right to present evidence on his behalf and his right to testify.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>THE COURT: So you make your own decision, and you can either tell the Court at the appropriate time or have Mr. McGee tell me that you do or do not wish to testify. If you wish to call any other witness, you may do so. That\u2019s going to happen after the plaintiff rests his case in chief. So if you have nothing to put on, for instance, that will be the end of the case, and we\u2019ll submit the case to the jury by me reading the instructions and sending the jury out to deliberate. Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">After the State rested its case, the court again explained to Craig his rights to testify, present witnesses on his behalf, and reminded him of his right to make an opening statement. At that point, the following dialogue ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">THE DEFENDANT: All right. For the record I\u2019d like to state that I\u2019m not able to present a defense because I\u2019m not represented by a lawyer, and I\u2019m not a lawyer so, you know, without a defense I move for a mistrial. And that\u2019s all I got to say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">THE COURT: I\u2019ll consider that a motion for a mistrial. Do you want - to say why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">THE DEFENDANT: Hmm?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-8\">THE COURT: Do you want to explain why you think you should have a mistrial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">THE DEFENDANT: No defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-10\">THE COURT: Whose fault is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-11\">THE DEFENDANT: I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-12\">THE COURT: Do you wish to add anything, Mr. Canty, or should I make a ruling?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-13\">MR. CANTY: You can rule, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-14\">THE COURT: You\u2019ve got nothing to base that upon, Mr. Craig. Your counsel has been court appointed. He\u2019s been here with you. He\u2019s worked on this case prior. He\u2019s consulted with you on numerous occasions. He\u2019s submitted instructions on your behalf. He\u2019s been here in case you needed his assistance. You didn\u2019t indicate at any time that you wanted help from him. I don\u2019t feel that\u2019s his problem nor Mr. Canty\u2019s problem nor my problem. That was your call.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-15\">THE DEFENDANT: I motioned for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-16\">THE COURT: Now for you to say you want a mistrial because you feel you didn\u2019t have an attorney does not have any merit to it. That motion is denied. Now, do you wish to add anything else, present any other defense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>THE DEFENDANT: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">As the parties settled the remaining instructions, McGee objected to an instruction offered by the State concerning admissions or confessions made by Craig. The court gave the instruction over McGee\u2019s objection. Craig declined to give a closing statement; the jury subsequently found him guilty of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">On November 7, Craig <em>filed,pro se, </em>a Motion for Substitute Counsel to File For a New Trial. Pursuant to \u00a7 46-8-104, MCA, Craig asked the court to appoint new counsel \u201cfor the purposes of preparing and filing a motion for a new trial on his behalf and to represent him throughout these criminal proceedings which remain pending in the above-entitled action.\u201d During the hearing on the motion, the court told Craig that he could not switch attorneys whenever he wanted to, and denied the motion. The court proceeded to hold a sentencing hearing and impose judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">This case presents a predicament in that Craig did not request to proceed <em>pro se, </em>did not expressly waive his right to counsel, and yet failed to cooperate with his court-appointed attorney. Apparently, Craig\u2019s intent was to manipulate and to frustrate the criminal proceedings. The fact that Craig did not seek to proceed <em>pro se, </em>did not expressly waive his right to counsel, and did not cooperate with his court-appointed attorney, raises a number of issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Craig\u2019s request for new counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">The question of whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying Craig\u2019s motion for new counsel is pivotal to the determination of the rest of Craig\u2019s claims. The Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution guarantee the fundamental right to assistance of counsel. <em>State v. Langford </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 95, 99, 882 P.2d 490, 492, <em>cert. denied, </em>_U.S. 115 S.Ct. 1128, 130 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1995). Since <em>Gideon v. Wainwright </em>(1963), 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799, an indigent defendant in a state criminal prosecution is entitled to representation by appointed counsel at public expense. <em>State v. Pepperling </em>(1978), 177 Mont. 464, 472, 582 P.2d 341, 345; <em>State v. Enright </em>(1988), 233 Mont. 225, 228, 758 P.2d. 779, 781. The indigent\u2019s right to counsel includes the right to have \u201ceffective assistance\u201d of counsel. <em>Pepperling, </em>582 P.2d at 345 (quoting <em>State v. McElveen </em>(1975), 168 Mont. 500, 503, 544 P.2d 820, 821).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">If appointed counsel renders effective assistance, the defendant may not demand his appointed counsel\u2019s dismissal or substitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>tion, nor may the defendant demand that certain counsel be appointed. <em>Pepperling, </em>582 P.2d at 346. In other words, the right to assistance of counsel does not grant defendants the right to counsel of their choice. <em>State v. Colt </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 399, 404, 843 P.2d 747, 750. It is well settled in Montana that when appointed counsel is rendering effective assistance, \u201cthe defendant has the choice of (1) continuing with counsel so appointed, or (2) having his counsel dismissed and proceeding on defendant\u2019s own, <em>pro se.\u201d Pepperling, </em>582 P.2d at 346, <em>see also State v. Lange </em>(1987), 226 Mont. 9, 13, 733 P.2d 846, 849; <em>Enright, </em>758 P.2d at 781-82; <em>State v. Zackuse </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 385, 386, 833 P.2d 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">Nonetheless, if a defendant presents a seemingly substantial complaint about effective assistance of counsel, the district court should conduct a hearing to determine the validity of defendant\u2019s request for substitution of counsel. <em>Enright, </em>758 P.2d at 782. Subsequently, upon a proper showing that failure to replace appointed counsel would substantially impair or deny the right to assistance of counsel, the district court should substitute appointed counsel. <em>State v. Long </em>(1983), 206 Mont. 40, 44, 669 P.2d 1068, 1071; <em>Enright, </em>758 P.2d at 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">It is within the discretion of the district court to consider requests to appoint new counsel and the court\u2019s determination will be sustained absent an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Morrison </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 282, 284, 848 P.2d 514, 516; <em>Long, </em>669 P.2d at 1071.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">In <em>Enright, </em>we held that the district court\u2019s failure to consider Enright\u2019s \u201cseemingly substantial complaints\u201d regarding the effectiveness of counsel was reversible error. <em>Enright, </em>758 P.2d at 782. If a district court does not address a defendant\u2019s complaints regarding effectiveness of counsel, the court may place a defendant in the untenable position of choosing between proceeding with ineffective counsel or proceeding <em>pro se: </em>\u201cSuch a set of options is in essence no choice at all <em>.\u2019\u2019Enright, </em>758 P.2d at 782. In the instant case, the District Court did not place Craig in such a position.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Craig\u2019s first attempt to remove McGee as counsel was properly denied by the court. In response to Craig\u2019s motion to remove McGee as counsel, the court found that Craig had failed to allege any facts in support of his motion that would entitle him to relief, as required by \u00a7 46-13-101(4), MCA. Since Craig\u2019s motion failed to raise a seemingly substantial complaint about McGee\u2019s performance, no hearing on the motion was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">Subsequently, McGee informed the court that Craig refused to cooperate in his defense and the court conducted a hearing to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Craig the opportunity to present his request for substitution of counsel. In support of his position, Craig stated that there was \u201cno communication between me and my public defender.\u201d In addition, he alleged that: McGee refused to move for either discovery or change of venue; McGee failed to interview a witness and failed to suppress evidence; McGee advised him to enter a plea agreement; and, McGee had seen him only one time.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">In a similar situation where a defendant refused to cooperate and communicate with his appointed counsel and later claimed he had been denied assistance of counsel, we held that \u201c[1] ack of communication between defendant and defense counsel is not of itself basis for reversal on grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Long, </em>669 P.2d at 1072. In cases where the defendant refuses to cooperate in his own defense, we apply the general rule that \u201ca party who participates in or contributes to an error cannot complain of it.\u201d <em>Long, </em>669 P.2d at 1072 (quoting <em>State v. Lopez </em>(1980), 185 Mont. 187, 193, 605 P.2d 178, 181). Thus, a defendant who refuses to cooperate in his own defense cannot complain of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>State v. Strand-berg </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 132, 136, 724 P.2d 710, 713; <em>Long, </em>669 P.2d at 1072; <em>State v. Miller </em>(1977), 173 Mont. 453, 457, 568 P.2d 130, 132-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">At the substitution of counsel hearing, the deputy county attorney and McGee responded to Craig\u2019s allegations. Regarding Craig\u2019s assertion that McGee should move to suppress evidence, specifically a jacket seized from Craig\u2019s room at the Butte Pre-Release Center, the deputy county attorney explained that as a prison inmate and resident of the Pre-Release Center, Craig did not have an expectation of privacy to prevent a search. Additionally, Craig signed a document consenting to searches as a provision of his discharge to the Pre-Release Center. McGee had told Craig that filing a motion to suppress the admission of the jacket would be frivolous and would be rejected by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">As to the witness Craig believed should be interviewed on his behalf, McGee pointed out that she had already given a statement to the police department which included the facts that Craig felt were important. Regarding discovery, the deputy county attorney responded that pursuant to the State\u2019s open file policy, McGee had been given the entire investigative file. Regarding McGee\u2019s visits with Craig, McGee testified that he had met with Craig at the county jail and also for an extensive visit at the State Prison. McGee stated that he discussed with Craig everything in his file and went over the strong and weak points of the case including the physical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Craig\u2019s other allegations were likewise explained and countered by the deputy county attorney and McGee, resulting in the District Court\u2019s finding that McGee was providing effective assistance of counsel. Considering the court\u2019s inquiry into Craig\u2019s claims of ineffective counsel and Craig\u2019s lack of cooperation with counsel, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion and, therefore, was correct in refusing to substitute counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">2. Did the District Court deny Craig his constitutional right to the assistance of counsel by refusing to substitute his court-appointed attorney and thereby giving Craig the option of proceeding to trial with court-appointed counsel or appearing <em>pro sel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">When the District Court correctly denied Craig\u2019s request to substitute appointed counsel, Craig was left with the choice of: (1) continuing with appointed counsel, or (2) having his counsel dismissed and proceeding on his <em>own,pro se. Pepperling, </em>582 P.2d at 346; <em>State v. Lange </em>(1987), 226 Mont. 9, 13, 733 P.2d 846, 849; <em>Enright, </em>758 P.2d 781-82. He chose neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution has been interpreted to include a defendant\u2019s right to represent himself, <em>pro se. Faretta v. California </em>(1975), 422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562. Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution also provides defendants the right to proceed <em>pro se. Colt, </em>843 P.2d at 749; <em>Langford, </em>882 P.2d at 492. Pursuant to \u00a7 46-8-102, MCA, a defendant may waive the right to counsel when the court ascertains that the waiver is made knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently. In <em>Langford, </em>we specifically adopted the additional criterion that the request to represent oneself must be unequivocal. <em>Langford, </em>882 P.2d at 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">In the instant case, we agree with Craig that he did not unequivocally request permission to proceed <em>pro se. </em>Craig requested a change of counsel, which was correctly denied. We decline to adopt the State\u2019s position that Craig\u2019s rejection of McGee\u2019s representation constituted an unequivocal request to proceed <em>pro se </em>and a valid waiver of his right to counsel. Craig\u2019s situation does not meet the unequivocal request standard established by <em>Langford, </em>882 P.2d 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">Craig seeks to fault the District Court for failing to advise him of the dangers inherent in proceeding without counsel. This argument is disingenuous. Obviously any such advice would have made no difference to Craig\u2019s state of mind or the outcome of the proceeding since Craig made it abundantly clear that he was not opting to proceed <em>pro se. </em>Rather, his ploy was to circumvent the court\u2019s adverse ruling on his motion to remove McGee and force appointment of new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>counsel. Craig did not seek permission to proceed <em>pro se. </em>He consistently and repeatedly reiterated that he was not qualified to conduct voir dire, cross-examine witnesses or present a defense and, in fact, he was not representing himself. His candid admissions of his own shortcomings relative to experienced counsel suggest that he was well aware of the advantages of representation by counsel. Thus, despite any inadequacies in the District Court\u2019s inquiry, Craig understood the importance of counsel and the dangers and disadvantages of proceeding without counsel or refusing to cooperate with court-appointed counsel. <em>United States v. Sandles </em>(7th Cir. 1994), 23 F.3d 1121, 1128.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">The court did not leave Craig without counsel. On the contrary, it clearly insisted on leaving McGee in as counsel. The District Court continually referred to McGee as Craig\u2019s court-appointed attorney: \u201cThis is your court-appointed attorney. You can use him if you wish.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">A defendant may waive his right to counsel altogether. <em>Faretta, </em>422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525. Accordingly, \u201cat some point a criminal defendant can be deemed to have waived to a certain extent his constitutional right to effective assistance by virtue of his unreasonable refusal to communicate with his attorney.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Wainwright </em>(11th Cir. 1985), 767 F.2d 738, 743, <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1031, 106 S.Ct. 1241, 89 L.Ed.2d 349 (1986). The <em>Thomas </em>court stated that a \u201cpersistent unreasonable demand for dismissal of counsel [is] the functional equivalent of a knowing and voluntary waiver of counsel.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>767 F.2d at 743 (citing <em>United States v. Moore </em>(5th Cir. 1983), 706 F.2d 538, <em>540, cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 859, 104 S.Ct. 183, 78 L.Ed.2d 163 (1983)). In <em>Thomas, </em>the Eleventh Circuit found that Thomas had unreasonably chosen to remain silent and had refused to communicate with his counsel or the court, yet this behavior did not establish that his attorney failed to provide reasonably effective assistance of counsel. <em>Thomas, </em>767 F.2d at 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">In the present case, Craig was provided with counsel. With a clear understanding of the dangers of proceeding without counsel, Craig, instead of cooperating with his appointed counsel, chose to present no defense. Craig\u2019s choice to present no defense, like Thomas\u2019 choice to remain silent, effectively waived any right to more effective counsel than was possible under the circumstances. <em>Thomas, </em>767 F.2d at 743. All the court can do is appoint competent counsel. Whether that counsel is effective depends to a great extent upon whether the defendant cooperates with counsel. If the defendant chooses to hamstring the counsel through lack of cooperation, the counsel\u2019s effectiveness will, of course, be compromised accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>In refusing to cooperate with his appointed counsel and, at the same time insisting that he was not asking to proceed <em>pro se, </em>Craig was attempting to force the appointment of new counsel. This Court cannot countenance such dilatory and manipulative tactics at the expense of the efficient administration of justice. In <em>United States v. Kelm </em>(9th Cir. 1987), 827 F.2d 1319, defendant Kelm refused to accept an appointed attorney and also refused to waive his right to counsel, saying that he wished to hire counsel of his own choosing. Despite Kelm\u2019s failure to appear at hearings concerning his right to counsel, the court granted three continuances in order for him to obtain counsel. The court refused to grant any further continuances and, as a result, Kelm was left without counsel at trial. Kelm argued that the court failed to advise him regarding his right to counsel and that any waiver of that right was therefore not knowing and intelligent. The Ninth Circuit held that, reading the record as a whole, it was fair to conclude that Kelm understood the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation. \u201cHe knew he was entitled to counsel, yet the record establishes that he elected to defend himself with his \u2018eyes open <em>\u2019\u2019\u2019Kelm, </em>827 F.2d at 1322. The court noted that cotuts must be wary against the \u201cright to counsel\u201d being used as a ploy to gain time or effect delay. <em>Kelm, </em>827 F.2d at 1322 (citing <em>United States v. Lustig </em>(9th Cir. 1977), 555 F.2d 737, 744, <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1045, 98 S.Ct. 889, 54 L.Ed.2d 795 (1978)). The Ninth Circuit concluded that Kelm was manipulating his constitutional right to counsel in an effort to effect delay and that this tactic resulted in a waiver of his right to counsel of his choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">Where a defendant\u2019s conduct is \u201cdilatory and hinders the efficient administration of justice,\u201d a court may deny a continuance even if it results in the defendant\u2019s being unrepresented at trial. <em>United States v. Leavitt </em>(9th Cir. 1979), 608 F.2d 1290, 1293. Like Kelm, Craig manipulated his right to counsel in an effort to force appointment of new counsel despite the existence of no seemingly substantial basis for such a replacement.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Craig contends that he was not manipulative because he did not seek appointment of a particular counsel and did not seek continuances or delays. However, Craig\u2019s tactic of asserting his right to counsel while rejecting McGee presented the court with a Hobson\u2019s choice: either you give me counsel to my liking, or I will refuse to cooperate with the court-appointed counsel and then argue denial of my Sixth Amendment rights. The court provided Craig with competent counsel. The fact that McGee\u2019s effectiveness as counsel was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>compromised by Craig\u2019s lack of cooperation was Craig\u2019s own doing. <em>Long, </em>669 P.2d at 1072.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Craig\u2019s decision to reject McGee\u2019s assistance did not, as the State argues, leave him only one option \u2014 to proceed <em>pro se. </em>Instead, he chose to neither cooperate with his court-appointed counsel, nor to present any defense. The inevitable result of his \u201cno defense\u201d strategy was a one-sided, prosecutorial presentation to the jury. We hold that the District Court did not deny Craig his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">3. Did the District Court deny Craig his right to represent himself by permitting \u201cstandby\u201d counsel to become involved in the defense?</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Craig alleges that by allowing McGee to participate in the trial as standby counsel, the District Court destroyed \u201cthe jury\u2019s perception that the defendant is representing himself.\u201d <em>McKaskle v. Wiggins </em>(1984), 465 U.S. 168, 177, 104 S.Ct. 944, 951, 79 L.Ed.2d 122. This claim fails because we have held that Craig did not unequivocally assert his right to represent himself. Throughout the trial, neither the court, the prosecutor, McGee himself, nor Craig ever referred to McGee as standby counsel. Instead he was referred to by the court and the prosecutor as Craig\u2019s attorney. McGee performed an extensive voir dire resulting in one juror excusing herself because she was not sure she could be fair to Craig. Even after voir dire and the State\u2019s opening statement, when Craig stated McGee was not his attorney as far as he was concerned, the court continued to view McGee as the attorney available for Craig\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">The option of proceeding <em>pro se </em>was left open to Craig throughout the trial. However, Craig did not seek permission to proceed <em>pro se. </em>Thus, the jury did not have the perception that Craig was representing himself. After the State\u2019s opening statement, McGee\u2019s participation in the trial was very limited due to Craig\u2019s non-cooperation. This may have left the jury confused as to why Craig would choose to block his attorney\u2019s assistance, but at no point were the jurors led to believe by the court, Craig, McGee, or the State that Craig was proceeding <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">Outside the presence of the jury, Judge Sullivan, the prosecutor, and McGee, with Craig present, settled the jury instructions. Throughout this procedure Craig did not participate nor did he object to McGee\u2019s participation. Judge Sullivan continually consulted with McGee but acknowledged that McGee\u2019s participation was limited by Craig\u2019s wishes. Judge Sullivan stated: \u201cHe\u2019s calling the shots.\u201d This did not signify that Craig was proceeding <em>pro se, </em>but that, as for all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>clients, Craig determined his own defense. Craig did not assert his right to proceed <em>pro se </em>and he did not object to McGee\u2019s limited participation in the trial. Furthermore, Craig does not suggest that McGee\u2019s participation in any way conflicted with his \u201cactual control over the case he chooses to present to the jury.\u201d <em>McKaskle, </em>465 U.S. at 178, 104 S.Ct. at 951. Since the jury was never given the impression that Craig was proceeding <em>pro se, </em>it cannot be said that McGee\u2019s participation \u201cdestroyed the jury\u2019s perception that the defendant is representing himself.\u201d <em>McKaskle, </em>465 U.S. at 177, 104 S.Ct. at 950. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not deny Craig\u2019s right to represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">In sum, our holding in this case is narrowly tailored to the unique situation Craig presents. By not cooperating with his court-appointed attorney and not proceeding <em>pro se, </em>Craig attempted to manipulate the court into appointing new counsel. However, as the District Court found, McGee did provide effective assistance of counsel. It was only Craig\u2019s noncooperation that compromised McGee\u2019s representation. Although Craig\u2019s tactics resulted in a self-defeating and unwise defense, we cannot countenance manipulation of the Sixth Amendment in order to sabotage the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">4. Did the District Court err in instructing the jury as to \u201cadmissions\u201d and \u201cconfessions?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Craig asserts that the District Court improperly instructed the jury on admissions and confessions by giving Jury Instruction No. 7. Jury Instruction No. 7 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">A statement made by a defendant other than at this trial may be an admission or a confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">A confession, as applied in criminal law, is a statement by a person made after the offense was committed that he committed or participated in the commission of a crime. An admission is a statement made by the accused, direct or implied, of facts pertinent to the issue, and tending, in connection with proof of other facts, to prove his guilt. A conviction cannot be based on an admission or confession alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">The circumstances under which the statement was made may be considered in determining its credibility or weight. You are the exclusive judges as to whether an admission or a confession was made by the defendant, and if so, whether such statement is true in whole or in part. If you should find that any such statement is entirely untrue, you must reject it. If you find it is true in part, you may consider that part which you find to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Evidence of an oral admission or oral confession of the defendant should be viewed with caution.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Craig alleges that he made neither a confession, nor an admission. Craig\u2019s statements in question were made to Detective Green after the robbery. When questioned by Detective Green about the robbery, Craig stated: \u201cI want it to be known that I did not have a gun.\u201d He also told Detective Green that he could not \u201cmake it\u201d in the outside world.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">In <em>State v. Thompson, </em>we stated: \u201cAn \u2018admission\u2019 is defined as an avowal or acknowledgement of a fact or of circumstances from which, together with other facts, guilt may be inferred.... An admission does not acknowledge guilt; rather, it tends to establish guilt.\u201d <em>State v. Thompson </em>(1993), 263 Mont. 17, 25, 865 P.2d 1125, 1130 (citing <em>State v. Goltz </em>(1982), 197 Mont. 361, 369, 642 P.2d 1079, 1084 (other citations omitted)). Thompson argued that the court erred in characterizing statements he made at his omnibus hearing as admissions and erred in charging the jury with the same instruction that was used in the present case. This Court concluded that Thompson\u2019s statement was inconsistent with his theory of innocence and that the district court was correct in instructing the jury on possible admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">In the present case, the District Court correctly presented the jury with the instruction concerning admissions and confessions. Although Craig questions whether his statements were admissions or confessions, the jury may have construed them as inconsistent with innocence and thus treated them as admissions. Accordingly, the court properly apprised the jury of the difference between an admission and a confession; instructed the jury that a conviction cannot be based on an admission or confession alone; informed the jury that it alone was to determine if an admission had been made; and advised the jury that an admission should be viewed with caution. This instruction was to Craig\u2019s benefit. It ensured that the jury did not overvalue Craig\u2019s statements. This Court will uphold a district court if the instructions given, viewed as a whole, fully and fairly instruct the jury on the law applicable to the case. <em>Thompson, </em>865 P.2d at 1131 (citing <em>State v. Lundblade </em>(1981), 191 Mont. 526, 529, 625 P.2d 545, 548). The instruction given by the District Court is a correct statement of the law, therefore, we hold that the District Court did not err in instructing the jury on the law applicable to admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b178-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, ERDMANN and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
