The District Court concluded that SRS had no clear duty to disburse the funds, and that Cobbs\u2019 exclusive remedy was provided by law. Therefore, the court denied her application. Cobbs appeals from the order and judgment of the District Court. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">The issue on appeal is:</p>\n<p id=\"b181-13\">Does the State Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services owe a clear legal duty to distribute funds from the Industrial Accident Rehabilitation Account when the Montana Department of Labor authorizes the distribution pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-2001, MCA (1993)?</p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>\n<em>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Celia Cobbs is an injured worker entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits. She is unable to return to her former job because of a work-related injury. She had a dispute with her employer\u2019s insurer over her right to rehabilitation benefits and filed a petition in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court to resolve that dispute. After a trial, she settled her claim by agreeing upon a rehabilitation plan with her employer\u2019s insurer. The plan called for payment from the IAR Account in the amount of $680.75 for tuition and fees, together with $250.00 per semester for books and materials during a two-year course of study at Flathead Valley Community College. The State Department of Labor, Employment Relations Division, and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court approved the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">On January 13, 1994, the Department of Labor wrote to SRS and authorized the expenditure of funds from the IAR Account for the tuition, books, and materials described in the rehabilitation plan. The authorization specified that it was for expenditure of funds and that Cobbs was not seeking rehabilitation services. SRS, however, refused to disburse funds from the IAR Account based on its conclusion that Cobbs did not qualify for that Department\u2019s rehabilitation services.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Cobbs then applied to the District Court in Lincoln County for a peremptory Writ of Mandate to compel the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services to distribute funds pursuant to her rehabilitation plan. Cobbs contended in District Court that the IAR Account was established exclusively for workers\u2019 compensation claimants and that while the funds may be used to provide rehabilitation services through SRS pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-1003, MCA, the funds could also be used pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-2001(l)(d), MCA (1993), when the Department of Labor authorizes use of the funds for expenses related to a private rehabilitation plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The District Court concluded that the IAR Account is statutorily dedicated to payment for rehabilitation services for injured workers provided by the State of Montana\u2019s vocational rehabilitation program, and that because Cobbs was not a client of that program she was prohibited from receiving funds from the Account. The District Corut also held that \u00a7 39-71-1003, MCA, provides that \u00a7 53-7-106, MCA, is Cobbs\u2019 exclusive remedy for denial of SRS services.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">On appeal, Cobbs points out that she did not seek rehabilitation services or payments pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-1003, MCA. She agrees that she does not qualify for those services, but contends that she is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>entitled to rehabilitation expenses which are related to her privately developed plan pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-2001(l)(d), MCA (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Does the State Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services owe a clear legal duty to distribute funds from the Industrial Accident Rehabilitation Account when the Montana Department of Labor authorizes the distribution pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-2001, MCA (1993)?</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The issuance or denial of a writ of mandate is a matter of legal interpretation which we will review to determine whether the district court\u2019s legal interpretation is correct. <em>Phillips v. City of Livingston </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 156, 161, 885 P.2d 528, 531. A two-part standard applies to the issuance of a writ of mandate. <em>State ex rel. Chisholm v. District Court </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 441, 443, 731 P.2d 324, 325. The writ is available when the party who requests it is entitled to the performance of a clear legal duty by the party against whom the writ is sought, and where no speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law is available. Section 27-26-102, MCA; <em>see State ex rel. Galloway v. City of Great Falls </em>(1984), 211 Mont. 354, 358, 684 P.2d 495, 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">A negative answer to the first question bars the issuance of the writ, and, irrespective of the answer to that question, an affirmative answer to the second, divests the court of authority to issue it.</p>\n<p id=\"AqX\"><em>Chisholm, </em>731 P.2d at 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">On appeal, Cobbs contends that the District Court\u2019s denial of her application was incorrect on both grounds. First, Cobbs contends that SRS has a clear legal duty to disburse the funds from the IAR Account. Second, Cobbs asserts that the SRS appeal process pursuant to \u00a7 53-7-106, MCA, is inapplicable because she did not seek SRS services.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">Cobbs contends that SRS has a clear legal duty to disburse funds pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-2001, MCA (1993), which authorizes privately developed rehabilitation plans, and therefore, that the District Court abused its discretion when it failed to find a clear legal duty on the part of SRS and denied the writ. SRS asserts that application for SRS services pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-1003, MCA, is the only route to the IAR funds, and therefore, that all recipients of IAR Account monies must independently be eligible clients of SRS rehabilitation programs. We conclude that SRS\u2019s position, which was adopted by the District Court, is inconsistent with statutory law.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>The SRS is statutorily required to provide \u201cvocational rehabilitation\u201d and \u201cvocational rehabilitation services\u201d pursuant to the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973.29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-796. These services must be provided to anyone who qualifies pursuant to SRS criteria found at \u00a7 53-7-105, MCA. Vocational rehabilitation must also be provided by workers\u2019 compensation insurers to claimants who, by virtue of a work-related injury, are \u201cphysically unable to work at the job the worker held at the time of injury.\u201d Section 39-71-2001(l)(b), MCA (1993). This is a different standard than the standard by which eligibility for SRS services is determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">The IAR Account is provided for at \u00a7 39-71-1004, MCA. It is funded by self-insured employers, Plan II insurers, and the Department of Labor. Its purpose is to pay rehabilitation expenses of injured workers. Subsection (4) specifically provides that \u201c[n]o part of the funds ... shall be used in payment of administrative expenses of the department or department of social and rehabilitation services.\u201d Section 39-71-1004(4), MCA (1993). When we construe a statute, \u201cthe office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. The Court is to effectuate the intent of the Legislature, and if the Legislature\u2019s intent can be determined from the plain meaning of the words used in a statute, the courts may not go further and apply any other means of interpretation. <em>Clarke v. Massey </em>(1995), [271 Mont. 412], 897 P.2d 1085, 1088, (citing <em>Tongue River Elec. Co-op. v. Montana Power Co. </em>(1981), 195 Mont. 511, 515, 636 P.2d 862, 864).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Section 39-71-2001(1)(b), MCA (1993), provides that an injured worker who \u201cis physically unable to work at the job the worker held at the time of the injury\u201d is eligible for rehabilitation benefits. The Legislature enacted \u00a7 39-71-2001, MCA, in 1991 when it amended the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act by passing HB 837 which, among other changes, enacted Title 39, Chapter 71, Part 20, \u201cRehabilitation Benefits.\u201d Section -2001(l)(d) of the newly enacted part further provides that:</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">(1) An injured worker is eligible for rehabilitation benefits if:</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">(d) a rehabilitation plan between the injured worker and the insurer is filed with the department [of Labor and Industry]. If the plan calls for the expenditure of funds under 39-71-1004 [the Industrial Accident Rehabilitation Account], <em>the department shall </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number><em>authorize the department of social and rehabilitation services to use the funds.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">Section 39-71-2001(l)(d), MCA (1993) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">This statute explicitly provides for the development of a rehabilitation plan which may call for \u201cthe expenditure of funds\u201d from the LAR Account. Section 39-71-2001(1)(d), MCA (1993), also specifically directs that the \u201cdepartment shall authorize\u201d the use of the funds for the rehabilitation plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">SRS\u2019s argument to the contrary assumes that only its agency can provide rehabilitation services to injured workers. However, the plain language of \u00a7 39-71-1014, MCA, indicates that vocational services, including the development of a formal rehabilitation plan, may be delivered exclusively by a private rehabilitation provider. For example, that statute provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">(1) Rehabilitation services are required for disabled workers and may be initiated by:</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">(a)an insurer by designating a rehabilitation provider and notifying the department;</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">(2) Rehabilitation services provided under this part [of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act] must be delivered:</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">(a) <em>through a rehabilitation counselor certified by the board of rehabilitation certification;</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">(b) by a vocational rehabilitation counselor employed by the department of social and rehabilitation services; <em>or</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">(c) <em>by both.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">Section 39-71-1014, MCA (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-14\">The plain language of \u00a7 39-71-1014, MCA, allows workers\u2019 compensation claimants to receive vocational rehabilitation from certified private rehabilitation providers instead of, or in addition to, SRS services. Moreover, rehabilitation provider is defined as:</p>\n<p id=\"b185-15\"><em>[A] rehabilitation counselor certified by the board for rehabilitation certification and designated by the insurer to the department </em>or a department of social and rehabilitation services counselor when a worker has been certified by the department of social and rehabilitation services under 39-71-1003.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-16\">Section 39-71-1011(5), MCA (1993) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-17\">A \u201crehabilitation counselor certified by the board for rehabilitation certification\u201d is not necessarily an SRS counselor, but may be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>private counselor. <em>See </em>\u00a7 39-71-1011(1), MCA (defining board of rehabilitation certification).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Thus, the plain language of \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-1011(5) and -1014, MCA, establishes that an injured worker may receive vocational rehabilitation solely from a private provider, without using SRS counselors. Furthermore, there is no requirement that injured workers seek services from SRS \u2014 although vocational services may be provided to injured workers\u2019 compensation claimants by SRS. Therefore, \u00a7\u00a7 -1011(5), -1014, and -2001, when read together, require the conclusion that funds from the IAR Account are available for rehabilitation expenses when a \u201crehabilitation plan\u201d has been developed by the insurer, claimant, and rehabilitation provider and filed with the Department of Labor, not just when SRS \u201cservices\u201d are provided. Privately developed rehabilitation plans, as authorized by \u00a7 39-71-2001, MCA (1993), would be rendered meaningless and impossible if this Court was to interpret \u00a7 39-71-2001, MCA (1993), in a way that gave SRS a right to deny benefits to workers based on criteria other than those listed in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. If approval was required, whether or not the insurer and the claimant agreed to a \u201crehabilitation plan,\u201d the expenses could not be paid unless the claimant also developed a rehabilitation plan as a client of SRS. The filing of the rehabilitation plan with the Department of Labor would be a useless exercise if the worker was required to reapply for services as an SRS client and develop a new rehabilitation plan through SRS\u2019s rehabilitation \u201cservices.\u201d Moreover, the Department of Labor\u2019s \u201cauthorization\u201d of the expenditure of funds from the IAR Account would have no meaning if, regardless of such authority, the claimant was still required to apply for rehabilitation services through SRS. Finally, the IAR Account would serve no function for workers\u2019 compensation employers, insurers, and claimants if it was solely utilized for clients of SRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The Legislature does not perform useless acts. <em>Kish v. Montana State Prison </em>(1973), 161 Mont. 297, 301, 505 P.2d 891, 893. Therefore, we conclude that \u00a7 39-71-2001, MCA (1993), does afford independent access to the IAR Account for payment of expenses related to a worker\u2019s rehabilitation plan developed by the insurer, claimant, and private rehabilitation provider and filed with the Department of Labor. This access is in addition to, and independent from, the payment of expenses pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-1003, MCA. Furthermore, the Department of Labor\u2019s authorization, pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-2001, MCA (1993), creates a clear legal duty on the part of SRS to disburse those funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>We conclude that Cobbs also meets the second requirement for a writ of mandate because no speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law was available to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">The District Court concluded that Cobbs had a remedy in the ordinary course of law based on the language of \u00a7 39-71-1003(2), MCA, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The appeal process provided for in 53-7-106 is the exclusive remedy for an injured worker aggrieved in the receipt of vocational rehabilitation services provided by the department of social and rehabilitation services.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">However, \u00a7 39-71-1003, MCA, pertains only to relief for a party actually applying for services which are provided by SRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Entitlement to rehabilitation benefits sought pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-2001, MCA (1993), is determined by the worker, the insurer, the private \u201crehabilitation provider,\u201d the Department of Labor and, in the event of a dispute, the workers\u2019 compensation mediator and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. The procedures related to the denial of SRS services simply do not apply. Therefore, \u00a7 53-7-106, MCA, does not preclude the proper issuance of a writ of mandate in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">For these reasons, we reverse the District Court\u2019s order which denied Cobbs\u2019 application for a writ of mandate, and remand to the District Court for entry of the appropriate writ consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b187-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, GRAY and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
