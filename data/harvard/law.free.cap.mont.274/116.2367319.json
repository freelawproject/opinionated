He appeals from an order of the District Court denying his motion for a new trial and request for discovery. We affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of Gollehon\u2019s motion for new trial; we do not address the trial corut\u2019s ruling on his request for discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Gollehon raises on appeal the issue of whether the State failed to timely disclose information that he could have used as mitigating evidence at his sentencing hearing and whether that failure justifies reversal of the death sentence that was imposed in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">We restate the issue as whether Gollehon\u2019s raising this issue in the context of an untimely motion for new trial bars our consideration of the merits of his claim. We hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">In October 1991, Gollehon was convicted of deliberate homicide by accountability and sentenced to death for his participation in the beating death of fellow prison inmate, Gerald Pileggi. This Court upheld that conviction and sentence in <em>State v. Gollehon </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 1, 864 P.2d 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">On March 11, 1994, Gollehon petitioned the United States Supreme Court for certiorari. That Court declined to accept Gollehon\u2019s case for review in an order published October 3, 1994. <em>Gollehon v. Montana </em>(1994),_U.S._, 115 S.Ct. 95, 130 L.Ed.2d 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">The State then moved the District Court for a hearing to reset Gollehon\u2019s execution date since the previous execution date had expired during the direct appeal process. At the March 24, 1995 hearing, Gollehon moved the District Court for an order requiring the State to produce any pretrial or posttrial promises or agreements with two eyewitnesses who testified at Gollehon\u2019s trial. Gollehon argued that this information, had it been disclosed, could have been used as impeachment evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">The District Court granted Gollehon\u2019s request for discovery of pretrial agreements between the State and the eyewitnesses and ordered further briefing on the issue of whether Gollehon was entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>to any posttrial agreements. The District Court reset Gollehon\u2019s execution for June 11, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">On March 29, 1995, Gollehon moved for a new trial and a stay of execution. The State responded that the motion for new trial was untimely and should be summarily dismissed on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The District Court held a hearing on Gollehon\u2019s motions on June 7, 1995, just four days prior to Gollehon\u2019s scheduled execution date. At the hearing, the court determined that Gollehon\u2019s motion for a new trial was untimely. In addition, the court denied Gollehon\u2019s request for discovery of the State\u2019s post-trial arrangements with the witnesses, finding that any evidence regarding posttrial agreements would be irrelevant at sentencing as it was not the court\u2019s function to reweigh the jury\u2019s determination of witness credibility in a capital sentencing proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Gollehon appeals the order of the District Court denying his motion for a new trial and his request for discovery. Because of the proximity of Gollehon\u2019s execution date, the District Court issued a stay of execution pending Gollehon\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Gollehon maintains that his appeal \u201cconcerns the State\u2019s duty to disclose material information that would have aided [him] in convincing this Court that the balance of aggravating and mitigating factors demanded the imposition of a non-death sentence.\u201d Gollehon argues that the State violated its obligations under <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>(1963), 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215, and under 46-15-322(1)(e), MCA, in failing to disclose the 1992 commutation of the sentence of State\u2019s witness Armstrong and his 1993 parole. Armstrong was one of the eyewitnesses who testified against Gollehon at his homicide trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">We decline to reach the merits of Gollehon\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim, however, in the procedural context in which the claim is raised. Specifically, Gollehon is appealing from the District Court\u2019s denial of his out-of-time motion for new trial. While Gollehon focuses on his substantive <em>Brady </em>claim, our initial inquiry is whether his claim, brought in the context of an untimely motion for new trial, should even be entertained. We conclude that it should not.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">Section 46-16-702(2), MCA, provides that a motion for a new trial \u201cmust be filed by the defendant within 30 days following a verdict or finding of guilty....\u201d There is no provision in the statute for extending that time period. Gollehon\u2019s time for filing his new trial motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>expired November 7, 1991, 30 days from entry of the verdict on October 7, 1991. Accordingly, his new trial motion, filed some three and one-half years after the entry of the verdict, is clearly untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">While Gollehon relies on past decisions of this Court (two of which were written by the author of this opinion) to avoid the plain and unambiguous requirements of the statute and to reach the merits, we are now persuaded that we originally started down this shaky staircase in error and that our judicially created exceptions to the statute are fast becoming the rule. With that premise in mind, it is appropriate to re-examine our prior decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\"><em>State v. Best </em>(1972), 161 Mont. 20, 503 P.2d 997, is cited as the seminal authority for the argument that evidence newly discovered posttrial provides an exception to the 30-day filing requirement for a new trial motion under our present statutory scheme. In that case the defendant filed in this Court his new trial motion during the pendency of his direct appeal. We noted that the motion was both untimely and filed in the wrong court under \u00a7 95-2101, RCM (1947), the predecessor to \u00a7 46-16-702, MCA. <em>Best, </em>503 P.2d at 1000. In that conclusion we were correct, and we should have simply refused to entertain the defendant\u2019s motion on that basis. We needlessly went further, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">In dicta, citing <em>State v. Nicks </em>(1957), 131 Mont. 567, 312 P.2d 519, we stated that,</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">[ijf the grounds for seeking a new trial do not arise until after expiration of the 30 day period or until after the appeal is filed, the proper procedure is to stay the appeal, remand the case to the district court, file the motion, secure the district court\u2019s decision thereon, and continue with the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\"><em>Best, </em>503 P.2d at 1001.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">Unfortunately, under \u00a7 95-2101, RCM (1947) \u2014 the new trial statute in effect when we decided <em>Best </em>\u2014 Nicks was not authority either for the referred to \u201cprocedure\u201d or for an exception to the 30-day filing requirement. Rather, <em>Nicks </em>involved \u00a7 94-7604, RCM (1947), which was repealed in 1967 and \u00a7 95-2101, RCM (1947), was adopted. Section 94-7604, RCM (1947), allowed a new trial motion to be filed \u201cwithin thirty days after the discovery of the facts upon which the party relies in support of his motion [and] in all other cases ... within ten days after the rendition of the verdict.\u201d Section 94-7604, RCM (1947); <em>Nicks, </em>312 P.2d at 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">While we reached the right result in <em>Best, </em>we erred in stating that we lacked jurisdiction to entertain the new trial motion at issue there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>because of the defendant\u2019s \u201cfailure to follow [the <em>Nicks] </em>procedure.\u201d <em>Best, </em>503 P.2d at 1001. While that procedure may have been available to Nicks under the statute governing his case, it was not available to Best under the different statute applicable in that case. The result in <em>Best </em>was correct because the defendant\u2019s motion for new trial was not timely filed \u2014 not for the reason we articulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">In State <em>v. Perry </em>(1988), 232 Mont. 455, 758 P.2d 268, the defendant filed a motion for new trial following the recantation of the State\u2019s eyewitness some 15 years after Perry\u2019s murder conviction. <em>Perry, </em>758 P.2d at 269-70. We rejected the State\u2019s argument that the motion, though denoted a motion for new trial, was actually a petition for post-conviction relief which was procedurally barred pursuant to the five year statute of limitations imposed by \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA. <em>Perry, </em>758 P.2d at 272. Moreover, we declined to treat Perry\u2019s motion as a petition for writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>although we noted that his claim, nevertheless, sounded in the nature of that relief. <em>Perry, </em>758 P.2d at 273. With no statutory posttrial remedies available, we finally concluded that we must, nevertheless, reach the merits of Perry\u2019s claim because he had no other avenue of relief and that to deprive him of a method of redress regardless of his diligence or the justness of his claim would be inconsistent with the intent of the legislature and with Art. II, sec. 17, of Montana\u2019s 1972 Constitution. <em>Perry, </em>758 P.2d at 272-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\"><em>Perry </em>is unique on its facts. That case does not stand for the general proposition that a motion for new trial may be entertained beyond the 30-day filing requirement of \u00a7 46-16-702, MCA, and it is a misapplication of our decision in that case to argue that its analysis should be extended beyond other cases with like facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\"><em>State v. Redcrow </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 254, 790 P.2d 449, involved the defendant\u2019s motion for new trial filed approximately two months following her conviction of deliberate homicide. <em>Redcrow, </em>790 P.2d at 451. The district court, while noting the untimeliness of Redcrow\u2019s motion in its order, nevertheless ruled on the merits of her motion because it was filed \u201cwithin a reasonable period of time\u201d after the verdict and \u201cbecause of the serious nature of the offense.\u201d <em>Redcrow, </em>790 P.2d at 452. Citing <em>Best, </em>we acknowledged the 30-day time limit imposed by the statute and noted that the factors considered by the trial court did not <em>require </em>that it entertain Redcrow\u2019s motion. Nonetheless, we addressed the merits of Redcrow\u2019s claim because \u201cof the extensive consideration of the motion by the District Court.\u201d <em>Redcrow, </em>790 P.2d at 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Similarly, in <em>State v. Moore </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 20, 885 P.2d 457, in an opinion written by the author of this opinion, we cited <em>Redcrow </em>as precedent and followed its rationale \u2014 i.e., motion filed within a reasonable time after verdict; extensive consideration of the out-of-time motion for new trial by the district court; and seriousness of the case \u2014 in reaching the merits of Moore\u2019s motion for new trial, filed approximately two months following his conviction of deliberate homicide. <em>Moore, </em>885 P.2d at 464, 479, 480-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">In <em>Redcrow </em>we improperly reached the merits of the defendant\u2019s untimely motion for new trial notwithstanding that the trial court gave \u201cextensive consideration\u201d to the motion. There are no \u201creasonable time\u201d or \u201cserious case\u201d exceptions to the 30-day filing requirement under \u00a7 46-16-702, MCA, and, as we pointed out in both <em>Red-crow </em>and <em>Moore, </em>those factors do not <em>require </em>the district court to entertain an out-of-time motion for new trial. <em>Redcrow, </em>790 P.2d at 452; <em>Moore, </em>885 P.2d at 480-81; \u00a7 46-16-702, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Unfortunately, <em>in Redcrow, </em>by judicial fiat, we created those exceptions from whole cloth for the purpose of reaching the merits. Moreover, as pointed out above, <em>Best </em>was not properly cited as authority for an exception to the 30-day filing requirement because the statement in that case supporting that argument was dicta, and flawed dicta, at that. Finally, neither the problem addressed in <em>Perry </em>nor that addressed in <em>State v. Barrack </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 154, 882 P.2d 1028, (discussed below), were at issue in <em>Redcrow.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Likewise, <em>Moore </em>suffers from the same deficits, and we were wrong to rely on <em>Redcrow </em>as precedent for reaching the merits of the new trial issue. Moore\u2019s untimely motion for new trial should have simply been denied on the basis of the procedural bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Finally, it is necessary to discuss our resolution of the out-of-time motion for new trial issue in <em>Barrack, </em>the other decision written by the author of this opinion. Like <em>Perry, </em>the circumstances of that case are unique. <em>Barrack, </em>882 P.2d at 1032. In <em>Barrack, </em>the defendant was convicted of aggravated assault on June 30,1992, and his first motion for new trial was heard and sentence was pronounced on August 5, 1992. Final judgment was filed August 21, 1992. <em>Barrack, </em>882 P.2d at 1030. Barrack filed a second motion for new trial on August 26, 1992. <em>Barrack, </em>882 P.2d at 1031. At a posttrial hearing on October 14, 1992, the trial court determined to treat Barrack\u2019s out-of-time motion as a petition for post-conviction relief under a writ of <em>coram nobis </em>pursuant to \u00a7 46-21-101(1), MCA. Ultimately, after a hearing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>December 1992, the district court denied the defendant\u2019s motion (petition) on the merits. <em>Barrack, </em>882 P.2d at 1031.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Citing \u00a7 46-16-702, MCA, the State argued that Barrack\u2019s motion was untimely and that it was improper for the trial court to treat the motion as one for post-conviction relief. We agreed. <em>Barrack, </em>882 P.2d at 1031-32. Nevertheless, we noted that Barrack had a right to appeal his conviction and that his appeal time had expired on October 21, 1992. Importantly, we concluded that the trial court erred when, on October 14, 1992, it determined to treat Barrack\u2019s untimely motion for new trial as one for post-conviction relief, with the result that the court \u201cmay have effectively curtailed any attempt Barrack may have made to appeal within the remaining statutory time .... [And, thus] possibly lulled the defendant into a position where he did not timely pursue his appeal rights. <em>...\u2019\u2019Barrack, </em>882 P.2d at 1032.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">It was for that reason only that we determined to address the district court\u2019s decision on the merits of Barrack\u2019s untimely motion. Notwithstanding, as we noted in concluding our analysis:</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">[W]e wish to emphasize, however, that our decision here is not in any way to be read as enlarging the scope of post-conviction relief <em>or as diminishing a defendant\u2019s obligation to timely file a motion for a new trial </em>and a petition for post-conviction relief or appeal in accordance with the applicable statutes. [Emphasis added.]</p>\n<p id=\"Abz\"><em>Barrack, </em>882 P.2d at 1032.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Given the above case analyses, we hold that neither <em>Best, Redcrow </em>nor <em>Moore, </em>should henceforth be cited as authority for the proposition that either this Court or the district court may entertain a motion for new trial not timely filed in accordance with \u00a7 46-16-702, MCA. Furthermore, as to the new trial issue, we remain convinced that <em>Perry </em>and <em>Barrack </em>were correctly decided given their unique facts and procedural circumstances, and we reaffirm our decisions in those cases. We leave those cases \u2014 limited to their facts \u2014 standing as two judicially created exceptions to \u00a7 46-16-702, MCA, solely because the constitutional due process implications in each transcend the otherwise clear and unambiguous requirements of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">With that frame of reference in mind, we hold that Gollehon\u2019s motion for new trial, filed three and one-half years post-verdict, is barred as being not timely filed and that neither the <em>Perry </em>nor the <em>Barrack </em>exceptions are applicable in the instant case. Unlike <em>Barrack, </em>Gollehon has had a direct appeal of his case, and he has not been lulled into the waiver of any posttrial remedy through error of the trial court. Unlike <em>Perry, </em>Gollehon has the vehicle to raise his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>post-verdict claims through a petition for post-conviction relief. He may still timely file such a petition under \u00a7 46-21-101, MCA; to date, he has simply <em>chosen </em>not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">Accordingly, while we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Gollehon\u2019s motion for new trial as being time-barred, we decline to address the merits of the defendant\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim brought in the context of his untimely new trial motion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b145-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, ERDMANN, HUNT, LEAPHART and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
