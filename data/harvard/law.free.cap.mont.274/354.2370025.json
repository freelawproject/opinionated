Jankes alleged for their counterclaim that Swenson failed to provide necessary services and attempted to evict them in retaliation for a notice of problems they had sent him. Swenson\u2019s claim was dismissed after he failed to appear, and by stipulation, Jankes were awarded attorney fees. Swenson appealed to the District Court for the Eighteenth Judicial District in Gallatin County. After <em>de novo </em>consideration of the parties\u2019 claims, the District Court dismissed Swenson\u2019s claims and held that Swenson failed to provide necessary services and that his attempt to evict was in retaliation for Jankes\u2019 notice and for participation in a tenants\u2019 association. The District Court awarded Jankes three months\u2019 rent as damages, and awarded them their attorney fees. Swenson appeals that decision. We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">1. Was the District Court\u2019s finding of retaliatory conduct clearly erroneous?</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">2. Did the District Court err when it awarded damages equal to three months\u2019rent pursuant to \u00a7 70-24-311, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">3. Was Swenson entitled to terminate Jankes\u2019 tenancy without cause pursuant to \u00a7 70-24-441, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b378-13\">4. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it awarded $4775 to Jankes for their attorney fees?</p>\n<p id=\"b378-14\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b378-15\">In February 1993, Swenson, the operator of Lexley Acres Mobile Park in Belgrade, Montana, served Jankes with a \u201cNotice to Quit and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Notice Terminating Tenancy\u201d in an effort to evict them from the mobile home pad they had rented from him on a month-to-month basis since 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Jankes, however, alleged that prior to receipt of the notice they had endured various illegal conditions on the premises, including an inadequate water supply, an overflowing garbage receptacle, raw sewage underneath their mobile home and on the ground adjacent to their mobile home, and a \u201cburn pile\u201d next to their mobile home which created a smoky and unsafe condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">On July 8, 1992, Jankes had notified Swenson of the above conditions pursuant to \u00a7 70-24-406, MCA. In the notice, they stated that because of the conditions, Swenson was in violation of \u00a7 70-24-303, MCA, which requires landlords to maintain their premises. They also demanded that he remedy the problems within fourteen days from the date of the notice, however, they allege that he failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">In November 1992, Jankes joined a tenants\u2019 association, and in January 1993, Alice Janke, as a member of the tenants\u2019 association for Swenson\u2019s mobile home park, appeared before the legislature and testified in support of an amendment to the Landlord and Tenant Act which related to the operation of mobile home parks. The amendment, which subsequently became law, limited the ability of landlords to evict tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">On February 4, 1993, approximately two weeks after the hearing which Alice Janke and Swenson attended, Swenson attempted to retake possession of Jankes\u2019 space and terminate their tenancy. He served a notice of termination followed by a complaint in Justice Court after they failed to vacate. In his complaint, he alleged that they were unlawfully in possession of the property they leased from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Jankes counterclaimed and asserted that Swenson violated the Landlord and Tenant Act when he failed to provide necessary services and when he took retaliatory action. They requested attorney fees and damages equal to the greater of three months\u2019 rent or treble damages. They also requested dismissal of his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">Iri Justice Court, the parties stipulated that a judgment would be entered against Swenson for Jankes\u2019 attorney fees in the amount of $350, and that Swenson would be allowed a <em>de novo </em>appeal to the District Court. Following the appeal to and a nonjury trial in the District Court, that court dismissed Swenson\u2019s claims in their entirety and held that Swenson failed to provide necessary services in violation of Montana law and health department regulations and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>his action to terminate Jankes\u2019 tenancy was in retaliation for their notice of July 8,1992, and for Alice Janke\u2019s participation in a tenants\u2019 association. The court awarded Jankes $540 in damages \u2014 the equivalent of three months\u2019 rent \u2014 and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Was the District Court\u2019s finding of retaliatory conduct clearly erroneous?</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Whether a landlord has engaged in retaliatory conduct prohibited by statute is a question of fact. Section 70-24-431, MCA, commissioner\u2019s comments. The standard of review for the District Court\u2019s findings of fact is whether they are clearly erroneous. Rule 52(a), M.R.Civ.R; <em>Brown v. Tintinger </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 373, 377, 801 P.2d 607, 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">The District Court found that Swenson\u2019s actions were retaliatory because he initiated efforts to retake possession of the property before he rectified the problems in Jankes\u2019 complaint. The court therefore concluded that Swenson violated \u00a7 70-24-431, MCA. On appeal, Swenson contends that the court\u2019s finding of retaliation was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Section 70-24-431(1), MCA, prohibits retaliatory conduct by a landlord and provides that:</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">Except as provided in this section, a landlord may not retaliate by increasing rent, decreasing services, or by bringing or threatening to bring an action for possession after the tenant:</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">(a) has complained of a violation applicable to the premises materially affecting health and safety to a governmental agency charged with responsibility for enforcement of a building or housing code;</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">(b) has complained to the landlord in writing of a violation under 70-24-303; or</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">(c) has organized or become a member of a tenant\u2019s union, mobile home park tenant association, or similar organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-13\">In a letter written on July 8,1992, Jankes complained to Swenson about several problems. They informed Swenson that he failed to \u201cmaintain in a good and safe working order electrical, plumbing and sanitary facilities\u201d and that the \u201cplumbing and sanitary facilities ... are broken and are in need of repair.\u201d The letter also notified Swenson that he failed to provide and maintain appropriate garbage receptacles and failed to supply running water to their home.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>At trial, Jankes testified that they joined a tenants\u2019 association in November 1992 and that Alice Janke, as a member of that tenant\u2019s association, appeared before the 1993 Session of the Montana Legislature and testified in support of an amendment to the Landlord and Tenant Act. The amendment, which related to the operation of mobile home parks and limited the ability of landlords to evict tenants, passed and became law. Swenson attended the hearing at which Alice Janke spoke.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">Both Jankes\u2019 complaint to Swenson, and Alice Janke\u2019s testimony on behalf of the tenant\u2019s association occurred prior to Swenson\u2019s February 4, 1993, attempt to retake possession of Jankes\u2019 space and terminate their tenancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Jankes\u2019 complaints to Swenson within months of his eviction notice, Swenson\u2019s failure to address those complaints, Jankes\u2019 membership in the tenants\u2019 association and activities on behalf of that association, and Swenson\u2019s disapproval of those activities, provided substantial evidence in support of the District Court\u2019s finding of retaliatory conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">For these reasons, we hold that substantial credible evidence supports the District Court\u2019s finding that Swenson\u2019s actions were retaliatory and that the court\u2019s finding of retaliatory conduct was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">Did the District Court err when it awarded damages equal to three months\u2019 rent pursuant to \u00a7 70-24-311, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine if the court\u2019s application of the law is correct. <em>Carbon County v. Union Reserve Coal Co. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 459, 898 P.2d 680, 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">The court concluded that pursuant to \u00a7 70-24-411, MCA, Jankes were entitled to an award of damages equal to three months rent. However, Swenson claims that \u00a7 -411 required Jankes to prove purposeful conduct, which they did not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">Section 70-24-411, MCA, provides in part that:</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">If a landlord unlawfully removes or excludes the tenant from the premises or <em>purposefully </em>diminishes services to the tenant by interrupting or causing the interruption of heat, running water, hot water, electricity, gas, or other essential services, the tenant may recover possession or terminate the rental agreement and, in either case, <em>recover an amount not more than 3 months\u2019 periodic rent or treble damages, whichever is greater.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-13\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>While on its face \u00a7 70-24-411, MCA, does require purposeful conduct, the retaliatory conduct statute allows remedies pursuant to \u00a7 -411 for retaliatory conduct. Specifically, subsection (2) of the statute provides that \u201c[i]f the landlord acts in violation of subsection (1) of this section, the tenant is entitled to the remedies provided in 70-24-411 ...\u201d Section 70-24-431(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Here, the court, as discussed in Issue 1, found that Swenson acted in retaliation and concluded that he violated \u00a7 70-24-431, MCA. Accordingly, Jankes were entitled to \u201crecover an amount not more than 3 months\u2019 periodic rent or treble damages, whichever is greater.\u201d Section 70-24-411, MCA. Therefore, we need not discuss whether Swenson acted purposefully to conclude that the District Court correctly awarded damages pursuant to \u00a7 70-24-411, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Was Swenson entitled to terminate Jankes\u2019 tenancy without cause pursuant to \u00a7 70-24-441, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">We next consider Swenson\u2019s allegation that as a landlord he is entitled to terminate a tenancy without reason pursuant to \u00a7 70-24-441(2), MCA, and is entitled to bring an action for possession if the tenant does not remove himself from the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Section 70-24-441(2), MCA, does allow a landlord to terminate a tenancy, however, the retaliatory conduct statute discussed above provides that \u201c[i]f the landlord acts in violation of subsection (1) of this section, the tenant ... has a defense in any retaliatory action against him for possession.\u201d Section 70-24-431(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">Here, the District Court found that Swenson acted in retaliation and correctly concluded that such conduct violated \u00a7 70-24-431, MCA. Therefore, we conclude that Swenson\u2019s violation was a defense to Swenson\u2019s action to regain possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">ISSUE 4</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it awarded $4775 to Jankes for their attorney fees?</p>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">A district court\u2019s award of reasonable attorney fees is a discretionary act. <em>Ihler v. Chisholm </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 240, 246, 855 P.2d 1009, 1013. Therefore, we will not reverse the district court absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Ihler, </em>855 P.2d at 1013; <em>see May v. First Nat\u2019l Pawn Brokers </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 132, 134, 890 P.2d 386, 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-13\">After trial, the court entered judgment in favor of Jankes and awarded damages, attorney fees, and costs. Later, the court held a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>hearing to determine the amount of the attorney fees, and afterward, awarded Jankes $4775. Swenson does not contend that attorney fees should have been denied, but contends that the amount of attorney fees awarded was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">We have stated that in determining what constitutes reasonable attorney fees, the following factors should be considered as guidelines: (1) the amount and character of the services rendered; (2) the labor, time, and trouble involved; (3) the character and importance of the litigation in which the services were rendered; (4) the amount of money or the value of the property to be affected; (5) the professional skill and experience called for; (6) the attorneys\u2019 character and standing in their profession; and (7) the result secured by the services of the attorneys. <em>Majers v. Shining Mountains </em>(1988), 230 Mont. 373, 379-80, 750 P.2d 449, 453; <em>see also Carkeek v. Ayer </em>(1980), 188 Mont. 345, 347, 613 P.2d 1013, 1015; <em>First Security Bank of Bozeman v. Tholkes </em>(1976), 169 Mont. 422, 429-30, 547 P.2d 1328, 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">A review of the record reveals not only that Jankes\u2019 witness testified to each of the seven factors, but also that Swenson neither objected to nor rebutted this testimony. In fact, at the hearing, counsel for Swenson stated that:</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">I\u2019m not questioning the number of hours that Mr. Penwell spent or the $100 fee either. I request that it\u2019s more than legitimate for a man of his experience. So any reference to that in my brief should be withdrawn, Your Honor, as to the number of hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Therefore, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it awarded fees in the amount of $4775.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">Additionally, Jankes have incurred attorney fees because of Swenson\u2019s appeal to this Court, and request an additional award. Section 70-24-442, MCA, provides that reasonable attorney fees and costs may be awarded to the prevailing party in an action pursuant to the Residential Landlord and Tenant Act of 1977. Therefore, we conclude that Jankes are entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees for this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">For these reasons, we affirm the order of the District Court and remand to the District Court for further proceedings to determine a reasonable attorney fee award for services rendered to the respondents on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b383-10\">JUSTICES GRAY, HUNT, NELSON and ERDMANN concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
