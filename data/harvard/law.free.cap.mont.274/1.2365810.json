He was sentenced to 40 years in the Montana State Prison plus an additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>ten years for the use of a dangerous weapon, the ten years to be served consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">A petitioner may file a petition for post conviction relief with this Court under \u00a7 46-21-101, MCA, if he believes his conviction is invalid due to substantive or procedural error. But, \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, provides that such petitions must be filed \u201cwithin 5 years of the date of the conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">The post-conviction statute of limitation is a jurisdictional limit on litigation and its waiver may only be justified by a clear miscarriage of justice, one so obvious that the judgment is rendered a complete nullity. See, <em>State v. Perry </em>(1988), 232 Mont. 455, 758 P.2d 268; <em>Smittie v. Lockhart </em>(8th Cir. 1988), 843 F.2d 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">Nine years have elapsed since Petitioner was convicted. Because his petition is untimely under \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, Petitioner asks this Court to grant him leave to proceed with his petition beyond the five year limitation. Petitioner\u2019s claim that he was ignorant of the law for several years and needed time to familiarize himself with the law in order to present a pro se defense, is not an adequate reason to set aside the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-8\">Petitioner\u2019s petition was not timely filed and is clearly barred under \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, and should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-9\">IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Petitioner\u2019s petition for post conviction relief is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-10\">DATED this 19th day of September, 1995.</p>\n<judges id=\"b24-11\">J.
