Defendants Nick Lombardi and Doctor\u2019s Associates, Inc., (DAI) moved the District Court for an order dismissing plaintiffs\u2019complaint, or in the alternative, staying further judicial proceedings pending arbitration of plaintiffs\u2019 claims pursuant to a provision in DATs franchise agreement with plaintiffs which required that disputes \u201carising out of or relating to\u201d that contract be settled by arbitration. The District Court granted defendants\u2019 motion, and ordered that further judicial proceedings be stayed until arbitration proceedings were completed in accordance with the terms of the parties\u2019 agreement. Plaintiffs appealed from that order, and on December 15, 1994, we reversed the order of the District Court and remanded this case to that court for further proceedings. <em>Casarotto v. Lombardi </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 369, 886 P.2d 931. Following this Court\u2019s decision, the defendants petitioned the Supreme Court of the United States for a writ of certiorari. That petition was granted, and on June 12, 1995, the United States Supreme Court ordered that the December 15, 1994, judgment of this Court be vacated, and remanded this case to the Supreme Court of Montana for further consideration in light of that Court\u2019s decision in <em>Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson </em>(1995), 513 U.S._, 115 S. Ct. 834, 130 L. Ed. 2d 753. Having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>further considered our prior decision in light of Dobson, we now reaffirm and reinstate our prior opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">\n<em>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">Paul and Pamela Casarotto entered into a franchise agreement with DAI which allowed them to open a Subway Sandwich Shop in Great Falls, Montana. DAI\u2019s franchise agreement included on page nine a provision which required that controversies or claims related to the contract shall be settled by arbitration in Bridgeport, Connecticut. However, the franchise agreement did not include notice on the front page to the effect that the contract was subject to arbitration, as required by \u00a7 27-5-114(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">The Casarottos filed this action in the District Court based on their allegations that DAI breached its agreement with them, defrauded them, and engaged in other tortious conduct, all of which resulted in loss of business and the resulting damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">DAI moved to dismiss the Casarottos\u2019 claim or to stay further judicial proceedings pending arbitration pursuant to the arbitration provision in its franchise agreement. The District Court granted DATs motion to stay further judicial proceedings pursuant to 9 U.S. C. \u00a7 3, which is part of the Federal Arbitration Act found at 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-15 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">On appeal from the District Court\u2019s order, we considered whether Montana\u2019s notice requirement was preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act in light of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior University </em>(1989), 489 U.S. 468, 109 S. Ct. 1248, 103 L. Ed. 2d 488. In that case, the Supreme Court stated that:</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">The FAA contains no express pre-emptive provision, nor does it reflect a congressional intent to occupy the entire field of arbitration. But even when Congress has not completely displaced state regulation in an area, state law may nonetheless be pre-empted to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law \u2014 that is, to the extent that it \u201cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d <em>Hines v. </em>Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 67, 61 S.Ct. 399, 404, 85 L.Ed.2d 581 (1941). <em>The question before us, therefore, is whether application of Cal.Civ.Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7 1281.2(c) to stay arbitration under this contract in interstate commerce, in accordance with the terms of the arbitration agreement itself, would undermine the goals and policies of the FAA. We conclude that it would not.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b28-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number><em>Volt, </em>489 U.S. at 477-78, 109 S. Ct. at 1255 (citation omitted; emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">Based on the cited language from <em>Volt, </em>we concluded that the nature of our inquiry was whether Montana\u2019s notice requirement found at \u00a7 27-5-114(4), MCA, would \u201cundermine the goals and policies of the FAA.\u201d We concluded that it does not. <em>Casarotto, </em>886 P.2d at 931. We explained our conclusion as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">Our conclusion that Montana\u2019s notice requirement does not undermine the policies of the FAA is based on the Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion that it was never Congress\u2019s intent when it enacted the FAA to preempt the entire field of arbitration, and its further conclusion that the FAA does not require parties to arbitrate when they have not agreed to do so. That Court held that the purpose of the FAA is simply to enforce arbitration agreements into which parties had entered, and acknowledged that the interpretation of contracts is ordinarily a question of state law. <em>Volt, </em>489 U.S. at 474, 109 S.Ct. at 1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">Presumably, therefore, the Supreme Court would not find it a threat to the policies of the Federal Arbitration Act for a state to require that before arbitration agreements are enforceable, they be entered knowingly. To hold otherwise would be to infer that arbitration is so onerous as a means of dispute resolution that it can only be foisted upon the uninformed. That would be inconsistent with the conclusion that the parties to the contract are free to decide how their disputes should be resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">Montana\u2019s notice requirement does not preclude parties from knowingly entering into arbitration agreements, nor do our courts decline to enforce arbitration agreements which are entered into knowingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">Therefore, we conclude that Montana\u2019s notice statute found at \u00a7 27-5-114(4), MCA, would not undermine the goals and policies of the FAA, and is not preempted by 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\"><em>Casarotto, </em>886 P.2d at 938-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">On January 18, 1995, subsequent to our decision in this case, the U.S. Supreme Court decided <em>Dobson. </em>On June 12, 1995, the same Court vacated our prior <em>Casarotto </em>decision and remanded the matter to this Court for further consideration in light of the <em>Dobson </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-11\">In <em>Dobson, </em>the plaintiffs were the assignees of a contract with Terminix for life-time protection against termites. They sued Terminix in Alabama state court when they found their house \u201cswarming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>with termites.\u201d Terminix moved the court for a stay pursuant to \u00a7 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (1988)) so that arbitration could proceed pursuant to a provision for arbitration in the termite protection plan. The stay was denied. The Supreme Court of Alabama upheld the denial on the basis of Ala. Code \u00a7 8-1-41(3) (1993), which made written, predispute arbitration agreements invalid and unenforceable. The Alabama court concluded that its state statute was not preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act because the connection between the termite contract and interstate commerce was too slight.</p>\n<p id=\"AU\">In the court\u2019s view, the Act applies to a contract only if \u201c \u2018at the time [the parties entered into the contract] and accepted the arbitration clause, they <em>contemplated </em>substantial interstate activity.\u2019 \u201d Despite some interstate activities <em>(e.g., </em>Allied-Bruce, like Tbrminix, is a multistate firm and shipped treatment and repair material from out of state), the court found that the parties \u201ccontemplated\u201d a transaction that was primarily local and not \u201csubstantially\u201d interstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\"><em>Dobson, </em>513 U.S. at_, 115 S. Ct. at 837 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Before addressing the issue presented, the <em>Dobson </em>majority reiterated its conclusion that the purpose of the Federal Arbitration Act was to \u201covercome judicial hostility to arbitration agreements and that applies in both federal and state courts.\u201d <em>Dobson, </em>115 S. Ct. at 835. The Court then went on to conclude that the language in \u00a7 2 of the Act which applied its provisions to any \u201ccontract evidencing a transaction involving commerce\u201d had broader significance than the words of art \u201cin commerce,\u201d and therefore, covered more than persons or activities \u201cwithin the flow\u201d of interstate commerce. <em>Dobson, </em>115 S. Ct. at 839. The Court held that the word \u201cinvolving,\u201d like \u201caffecting,\u201d signaled an intent on the part of Congress \u201cto exercise Congress\u2019s commerce power to the full,\u201d <em>Dobson, </em>115 S. Ct. at 841, and secondly that the Act\u2019s preemptive force applies to transactions which, in fact, involve interstate commerce, even though a connection to interstate commerce may not have been contemplated by the parties at the time they entered into the agreement. For these reasons, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama was reversed. <em>Dobson, </em>115 S. Ct. at 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">After careful review, we can find nothing in the <em>Dobson </em>decision which relates to the issues presented to this Court in this case. Our prior <em>Casarotto </em>decision did not involve state law which made arbitration agreements invalid and unenforceable. Our state law simply requires that the parties be adequately informed of what they are doing before they enter into an arbitration agreement. Our decision did not involve an analysis of what was meant by \u201cinvolving com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>merce\u201d or \u201caffecting commerce\u201d or \u201cin commerce.\u201d We assumed, in the <em>Casarotto </em>decision, that the transaction with which we were concerned involved interstate commerce, and that any state law which frustrated the purposes of the Federal Arbitration Act would be preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">Finally, there is no suggestion in the <em>Dobson </em>decision that the principles from <em>Volt </em>on which we relied have been modified in any way. To our knowledge, it is still the law, therefore, that state law is only preempted to the extent that it \u201cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d <em>Volt, </em>489 U.S. at 477, 109 S. Ct. at 1255 (citing <em>Hines v. Davidowitz </em>(1941), 312 U.S. 52, 67, 61 S. Ct. 399, 404, 85 L. Ed. 2d 581).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">While the <em>Dobson </em>decision does include a discussion extolling the virtues of arbitration as a \u201cless expensive alternative to litigation,\u201d <em>Dobson, </em>513 U.S. at_, 115 S. Ct. at 843 (apparently based on input from the American Arbitration Association), and while that conclusion is at odds with facts set forth in Justice Trieweiler\u2019s concurring opinion to our earlier decision, the concurring opinion was not the basis for our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">For these reasons, we conclude, after thorough review of our earlier decision in light of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dobson, </em>that the decisions are not inconsistent, and therefore, that there is no basis for modifying or reversing our earlier opinion. We reaffirm and reinstate our opinion dated December 15, 1994, in the above matter, and remand this case to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b30-9\">JUSTICES NELSON, HUNT and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b30-10\">JUSTICE LEAPHART,</author>\n<p id=\"AO\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-11\">Justice John C. Harrison was in the majority in this Court\u2019s initial decision in <em>Casarotto v. Lombardi </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 369, 886 P.2d 931. Justice Harrison has since retired. As the successor to Justice Harrison, it is incumbent on me to review that decision in light of the remand from the United States Supreme Court. Having reviewed the <em>Casarotto </em>decision, I specially concur with the Court\u2019s conclusion that Montana\u2019s notice requirement in \u00a7 27-5-114(4), MCA, does not undermine the goals and policies of the FAA and is not preempted by 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (1988). I have also reviewed the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson </em>(1995), 513 U.S._, 115 S.Ct. 834, 130 L.Ed.2d 753, and I see no reason why the principles enunciated in that decision should have any effect upon this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Casarotto.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b31-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>In <em>Dobson, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the FAA preempts anti-arbitration state statutes which invalidate arbitration agreements. Section 27-5-114(4), MCA, cannot be characterized as anti-arbitration nor does it invalidate arbitration agreements. On the contrary, it is one section of Montana\u2019s Uniform Arbitration Act which specifically recognizes arbitration agreements: \u201cA written agreement to submit an existing controversy to arbitration is valid and enforceable except upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of a contract.\u201d Section 27-5-114(1), MCA. The notice requirement of subsection (4) merely protects the consumer by requiring that notice of an arbitration provision be conspicuously placed on the front page of the contract. This does not undermine the pro-arbitration policy of the FAA. Rather, it furthers the policy of meaningftd and consensual arbitration by helping ensure that the consumer who signs what is most often a nonnegotiated, form contract, knowingly agrees to arbitration in the event of a dispute. I see no inconsistency between <em>Dobson </em>and our decision in <em>Casarotto </em>and I specially concur in the Court\u2019s decision to reaffirm and reinstate its December 15,1994 opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b31-4\">JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"Az\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">I dissent from the Court\u2019s opinion and order and its reinstatement of its prior opinion in this case. My dissent is based on the procedures used by the Court in addressing the United States Supreme Court\u2019s vacating of our earlier opinion and remanding for our reconsideration based on its decision in <em>Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson </em>(1995), 513 U.S._, 115 S.Ct. 834, 130 L.Ed.2d 753. I also dissent from the Court\u2019s conclusion that nothing in the <em>Dobson </em>case relates to the issues presented to this Court. In dissenting, I also reaffirm and reinstate my earlier dissent in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">A remand for reconsideration to this Court from the United States Supreme Court is an uncommon occurrence for which we have no procedural rules or practices in place. Counsel for the parties were left without guidance as to how they should proceed in order to be heard during this phase of the case. Counsel for the defendants/respondents requested the opportunity to brief the issues raised by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s remand and to present oral argument. Without so much as a mention of this request, the Court apparently denies it. While one can only speculate on the reasons for such an implicit decision, one must assume that the Court is simply unwilling to consider any analysis that would require a change in the result it remains determined to reach. I cannot join in such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>arrogant and cavalier approach to this important case on remand from the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">More importantly, I disagree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that nothing in <em>Dobson </em>relates to the issues before us. While I agree that the substantive issue addressed at length in <em>Dobson </em>is not before us here, I read more importance into the early language in <em>Dobson </em>than does the Court. In <em>Dobson, </em>the United States Supreme Court reiterates the fundamental premise of the Federal Arbitration Act by citing to <em>Volt, </em>the very case which this Court erroneously interprets and on which it premises its erroneous decision, for the proposition that \u201cthe basic purpose of the Federal Arbitration Act is to overcome courts\u2019 refusals to enforce agreements to arbitrate.\u201d <em>Dobson, </em>513 U.S. at_, 115 S.Ct. at 838; citing <em>Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ. </em>(1989), 489 U.S. 468, 474, 109 S.Ct. 1248, 1253, 103 L.Ed.2d 488. The Supreme Court goes on to say that \u201c[n]othing significant has changed in the 10 years subsequent to <em>Southland; </em>no later cases have eroded <em>Southland\u2019s </em>authority[.]\u201d <em>Dobson, </em>513 U.S. at_, 115 S.Ct. at 839. It is this latter statement on which I believe we must focus in reconsidering our decision here. The Court refuses to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">I continue to believe that this Court erroneously interprets <em>Volt, </em>which was decided by the Supreme Court five years after <em>Southland. Volt </em>is clearly distinguishable on its facts from the case before this Court and cannot properly serve as a basis for the result the Court reaches. <em>Volt </em>is neither inconsistent with, nor a retrenchment from, <em>Southland, </em>as this Court suggested in its earlier opinion and suggests again today. This is the message I take from the Supreme Court\u2019s statement in <em>Dobson </em>that \u201cno later cases have eroded <em>Southland\u2019s </em>authority;\u201d this is the portion of this Court\u2019s earlier opinion to which I believe the Supreme Court was directing our attention on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">For the reasons stated in my earlier dissent, it is my view that application of Montana\u2019s notice statute is preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act in this case because application of that statute undercuts, undermines and renders unenforceable the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate. This view is entirely consistent both with <em>Southland </em>and with a proper interpretation of <em>Volt. </em>Therefore, I dissent from the Court\u2019s opinion and order and reinstate my prior dissent in this case.</p>\n<judges id=\"b32-11\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE and JUSTICE WEBER join in the foregoing dissent of JUSTICE GRAY.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
