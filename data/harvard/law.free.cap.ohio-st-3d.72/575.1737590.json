While claimant seeks to compel an award of permanent total disability compensation pursuant to <em>State ex rel. Gay v. Mihm </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 315, 626 N.E.2d 666, the commission seeks to reinstate its decision. For the reasons to follow, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">Two of claimant\u2019s objections fall quickly. First, the commission\u2019s alleged lack of permanent total disability guidelines does not violate due process. <em>State ex rel. Blake v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 453, 605 N.E.2d 23. Second, contrary to claimant\u2019s representation, the commission did not ignore Dr. Riccio\u2019s vocational report. The order specifies that the report was reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">Claimant also proposes that Dr. Edelstein\u2019s reports are entitled to enhanced weight because he was claimant\u2019s attending physician. We disagree. The commission has exclusive authority to evaluate evidentiary weight and credibility. <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936. Claimant\u2019s proposal infringes on that authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">Claimant alternatively asserts that the reports of Industrial Commission physicians warrant heightened deference. Apparently, however, the proposed precept applies only to those doctors with opinions favorable to claimant, for claimant, in the next breath, criticizes the commission for relying on its other specialists \u2014 Drs. Koppenhoefer, Louis and Howard. The flaws in this argument are obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-12\">Claimant also suggests that, henceforth, <em>all </em>commission orders be made to set forth the reasons for finding one report more persuasive than another. Claimant\u2019s argument, as a broad proposition, is weakened by <em>State ex rel. Mitchell v. Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc. </em>(1984), 6 Ohio St.3d 481, 6 OBR 531, 453 N.E.2d 721, and <em>Noll, supra. Noll </em>requires only a brief explanation of the commission\u2019s reasoning. <em>Mitchell </em>instructs the commission to list in its orders the evidence on which it relied. Moreover, later decisions have stressed that a reviewing court is not aided by a recitation of evidence that was considered but not found persuasive. See, <em>e.g., State ex rel. DeMint v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 19, 550 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>N.E.2d 174. Logic dictates that if the identity of rejected evidence is irrelevant, so is the reason for rejection.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">We recognize that each permanent total disability case is unique and, as such, a more detailed explanation for <em>all </em>commission orders is not necessary. In this case, the most glaring deficiency in the commission\u2019s order arises from its failure to adequately explain its nonmedical analysis. The commission\u2019s discussion is a bare recitation of data without elaboration as to how the cited factors combined to make claimant work-amenable. <em>State ex rel. Jarrett v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 127, 630 N.E.2d 699, has declared such a recitation to be unacceptable under <em>Noll.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">While we agree, therefore, that the commission\u2019s order falls short of <em>Noll, </em>we disagree with claimant\u2019s contention that the order\u2019s shortcomings compel the issuance of a full writ pursuant to <em>Gay. </em>We note that neither claimant\u2019s medical nor nonmedical profile presents the requisite one-sidedness necessary to sustain a claim for <em>Gay </em>relief. As to the latter, claimant\u2019s nonmedical profile does not clearly suggest <em>Gay </em>relief. Claimant was only fifty-nine when permanent total disability compensation was denied. He was a high school graduate with specialized mechanics training. This is in contrast to, for example, a sixty-eight-year-old English illiterate with no skills and a sixth grade education. See <em>State ex rel. Soto v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 146, 630 N.E.2d 714 <em>(Gay </em>relief awarded).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">We turn finally to the commission\u2019s claim that claimant\u2019s inability to work is a result of claimant\u2019s voluntary refusal to work. The commission\u2019s assertion is based on the following passage from Dr. Nizny\u2019s report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-7\">\u201cMr. Bell himself seems to have accepted the doctor\u2019s statement that he is completely and forevermore impaired and has not [himself] sought rehabilitation or other gainful employment. As he said to me, \u2018You don\u2019t fight the man with the pencil.\u2019 In this regard he has regressed from employment to a dependent state where he views himself as totally impaired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-8\">\u201cIt is clear to me that Mr. Bell does have some residual of the previous described Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder of feeling terrified to resume work as a bus driver and because of his rage at his employer and his distrust of them now states that he would refuse any work offered by Metro.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">We reject the commission\u2019s argument for two reasons. First, it essentially penalizes the claimant for heeding his attending physician\u2019s instructions. Dr. Edelstein said that, medically, claimant could not work. Second, claimant\u2019s reported refusal to return to SORTA ignores that his industrial injury removed him from his job before the statement was ever made. We do not, therefore, find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>that claimant has voluntarily forfeited eligibility for further consideration of his application for permanent total disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b691-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E.
