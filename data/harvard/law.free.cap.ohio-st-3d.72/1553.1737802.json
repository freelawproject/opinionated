This cause originated in this court on the filing of a complaint for a writ of mandamus. It appears from the records of this court that relator has not filed a merit brief, due June 26, 1995, in compliance with the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court, and, therefore, has failed to prosecute this cause with the requisite diligence. Upon consideration thereof,</p>\n<p id=\"b891-20\">IT IS ORDERED by the court that this cause be, and hereby is, dismissed <em>sua sponte, </em>effective June 29, 1995.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
