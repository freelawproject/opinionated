We agree. Moreover, we note that the reason appellant did not include the affidavit required by App.R. 26(B)(2)(d) may be that most of the issues raised in his application to reopen were in fact previously raised in either his direct appeal or in the appeal of the denial of his petition for postconviction relief, thereby precluding compliance with App.R. 26(B)(2)(c) and (d). In <em>State v. Reddick </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 88, 90-91, 647 N.E.2d 784, 786, we stated that \u201cApp.R. 26(B) was [not] intended as an open invitation for persons sentenced to long periods of incarceration to concoct new theories of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel in order to have a new round of appeals.\u201d App.R. 26(B)(2)(c) and (d) should make it obvious that the rule is also not an invitation to raise old issues previously adjudicated. Accordingly, we find appellant\u2019s appeal to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b487-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E.
