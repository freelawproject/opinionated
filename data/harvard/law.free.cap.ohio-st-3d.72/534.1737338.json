We initially note that the General Assembly did not specifically provide a statute of limitations for product liability actions. See R.C. 2305.01 through 2305.22 and R.C. 2307.71 through 2307.80. As a result, R.C. 2305.03 directs us to apply one of the general statutes of limitations contained in R.C. 2305.04 through 2305.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-11\">The court of appeals concluded that McAuliffe\u2019s product liability action brought pursuant to R.C. 2307.73 is \u201can action * * * upon a liability created by statute\u201d and therefore governed by the six-year limitations period provided in former R.C. 2305.07,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which stated: \u201cExcept as provided in section 1302.98 of the Revised Code, an action upon a contract not in writing, express or implied, or upon a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>liability created by statute other than a forfeiture or penalty, shall be brought within six years after the cause thereof accrued.\u201d 129 Ohio Laws 176. The court of appeals reached that conclusion by applying what it believed was the appropriate test for determining whether a codified common-law cause of action is \u201can action * * * upon a liability created by statute\u201d: \u201c[W]hether the statutes modified, altered or conditioned the common law product liability cause of action so as to create essentially a new concept of liability.\u201d The court of appeals found that the General Assembly, by codifying the common law of product liability, had substantially modified the common-law cause of action, thereby transforming common-law product liability into \u201ca liability created by statute.\u201d Specifically, the court of appeals based its finding on the perception that the General Assembly had expanded the availability of economic loss damages in R.C. 2307.79, eliminated a cause of action based upon express warranty in R.C. 2309.01, and raised the standard of proof necessary to sustain an award of punitive damages in R.C. 2307.80.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Western States and <em>amici curiae </em>argue that the court of appeals applied the wrong test in concluding that an action brought pursuant to R.C. 2307.73 is \u201can action * * * upon a liability created by statute.\u201d Instead of focusing on whether the statute created a new \u201cconcept of liability,\u201d Western States and <em>amici </em>argue that the proper test is more narrow \u2014 whether the statute created a <em>cause of action </em>not available at common law. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The court of appeals based its analysis on our decision in <em>Bora v. Kerchelich </em>(1983), 2 Ohio St.3d 146, 2 OBR 692, 443 N.E.2d 509. However, <em>Bora </em>does not stand for the proposition that any statutory modification of a common-law cause of action transforms that cause of action into \u201can action * * * upon a liability created by statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">In <em>Bora </em>we held that R.C. 955.28, which provides that an owner of a dog is liable for any damage or injury caused by the dog, is \u201ca liability created by statute.\u201d At common law, the owner of a dog could be liable for a plaintiffs injuries only if the plaintiff could show that the owner knew of the dog\u2019s \u201cvicious propensities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 147, 2 OBR at 693, 443 N.E.2d at 510. We noted that R.C. 955.28 removed the knowledge element and that the plaintiff had not pled the knowledge of the dog\u2019s owner. Under the common law, the plaintiffs complaint would not have stated a valid cause of action. However, his pleading was sufficient under R.C. 955.28. Because R.C. 955.28, by eliminating the knowledge element necessary for a common-law cause of action, provided the plaintiff with a cause of action not available to him at common law, we held that it was \u201ca liability created by statute\u201d and governed by R.C. 2305.07.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Our analysis in <em>Bora </em>is consistent with our opinion in <em>Hawkins v. Furnace Co. </em>(1884), 40 Ohio St. 507, 515, where we interpreted a predecessor of R.C. 2305.07: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>\u201cWe therefore interpret the phrase, \u2018a liability created by statute,\u2019 to mean a liability which would not exist but for the statute.\u201d Although decided over a century ago, we believe that the interpretation set forth in <em>Hawkins </em>accurately relates the plain meaning of R.C. 2305.07 and, therefore, we reaffirm our support for the use of the \u201cbut for\u201d test. In order for a statutory cause of action to be \u201can action * * * upon a liability created by statute\u201d under R.C. 2305.07, that cause of action must be one that would not exist but for the statute. Any statutory \u201cmodification, alteration or conditioning\u201d of a common-law cause of action which falls short of creating a previously unavailable cause of action does not transform that cause of action into \u201can action * * * upon a liability created by statute.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Now that we have confirmed that the \u201cbut for\u201d test is the appropriate test for determining when R.C. 2305.07 applies, we must now consider whether McAuliffe\u2019s cause of action is an action that would not exist but for the Ohio Product Liability Act. The first step in applying the \u201cbut for\u201d test is to identify the cause or causes of action asserted by the plaintiff. McAuliffe\u2019s lawsuit against Western States actually includes four separate causes of action, based upon the four potential grounds for liability set forth in R.C. 2307.73(A)(1): the mountain bike was defectively manufactured (R.C. 2307.74), the mountain bike was defectively designed (R.C. 2307.75), the mountain bike was defective because of inadequate warning (R.C. 2307.76), and the mountain bike was defective because it failed to conform to a representation made by the manufacturer (R.C. 2307.77).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The second step in applying the \u201cbut for\u201d test is to determine whether the cause or causes of action asserted by the plaintiff were available at common law. Prior to the enactment of the Ohio Product Liability Act, the courts in Ohio had developed an extensive common law of strict product liability. In <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 4 O.O.3d 466, 364 N.E.2d 267, this court adopted Section 402A of the Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1965).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Section 402A states the general rule that a manufacturer, retail dealer or distributor is strictly liable for injuries caused by its defective products. More important, prior to the enactment of R.C. 2307.73, this court had already provided a cause of action for strict product liability for each of the four grounds listed in R.C. 2307.73(A)(1) and set forth in McAuliffe\u2019s complaint. See, <em>e.g., Lonzrick v. Republic Steel Corp. </em>(1966), 6 Ohio St.2d 227, 35 O.O.2d 404, 218 N.E.2d 185 (defective manufacture); <em>Cremeans v. Internatl. Harvester Co. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 232, 6 OBR 302, 452 N.E.2d 1281 (defective design); <em>Crislip v. TCH Liquidating Co. </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 251, 556 N.E.2d 1177 (inadequate warning); <em>Rogers v. Toni Home Permanent Co. </em>(1958), 167 Ohio St. 244, 4 O.O.2d 291, 147 N.E.2d 612 (failure to conform to representation). As a result, R.C. 2307.73 does not provide a cause of action that would not exist but for the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">The three statutory \u201cmodifications\u201d of common-law product liability noted by the court of appeals do not transform R.C. 2307.73 into \u201ca liability created by statute.\u201d In fact, two of the \u201cmodifications\u201d noted by the court of appeals do not actually modify the common law. First, the court of appeals incorrectly concluded that R.C. 2307.79 expanded the availability of economic loss damages. That statute allows economic loss damages only if the \u201cclaimant is entitled to recover compensatory damages for <em>harm </em>* * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2307.79(A). \u201cHarm,\u201d as defined in R.C. 2307.71(G), includes physical injury to a person or damage to property. Therefore, R.C. 2307.79 is consistent with and not a modification of the common-law rule that injury to person or property is a prerequisite to recovery of economic loss damages. See <em>Chemtrol Adhesives, Inc. v. Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 40, 51, 537 N.E.2d 624, 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Second, the court of appeals incorrectly concluded that R.C. 2309.01, which defines \u201ctort action\u201d as excluding breach of contract claims, \u201celiminated the theory of recovery pursuant to an express warranty.\u201d R.C. 2307.77 provides that a product is defective if it fails to conform to a \u201crepresentation\u201d made by the manufacturer. As our opinion in <em>Rogers, supra, </em>makes clear, the concepts of \u201cexpress warranty\u201d and \u201crepresentation\u201d are identical in the product liability context. See <em>Rogers, supra, </em>167 Ohio St. 244, 4 O.O.2d 291, 147 N.E.2d 612, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>paragraphs two and three of the syllabus. As a result, the court of appeals incorrectly concluded that the General Assembly eliminated the \u201cexpress warranty\u201d cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">With respect to the third \u201cmodification,\u201d the court of appeals was correct in noting that the General Assembly raised the standard of proof for punitive damages in R.C. 2307.80. However, the effect of raising the standard of proof for punitive damages is to <em>restrict </em>the availability of punitive damages otherwise available at common law. Even if the Ohio Product Liability Act provided a lower, instead of a higher, standard of proof for punitive damages, R.C. 2307.73 would still not qualify as a \u201cliability created by statute.\u201d That is because changing the standard of proof for a type of damages already available would not create a <em>cause of action.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">As we noted above, the common law already provided a cause of action for each of the four grounds of liability provided in R.C. 2307.73(A)(1). Because R.C. 2307.73 does not provide a cause of action that would not exist but for the statute, causes of action brought pursuant to R.C. 2307.73 are not governed by the six-year statute of limitations provided in R.C. 2305.07.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Because the six-year statute of limitations in R.C. 2305.07 does not apply, the applicable statute of limitations is the one that governed common-law product liability causes of action. Since McAuliffe\u2019s action is for bodily injury, the two-year statute of limitations in R.C. 2305.10 governs his claim. <em>Andrianos v. Community Traction Co. </em>(1951), 155 Ohio St. 47, 44 O.O. 72, 97 N.E.2d 549.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b652-9\">Moyer, C.J., Pfeifer and Cook, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b652-10\">Douglas, Resnick and F.E.

We note that courts in other jurisdictions have also held that R.C. 2305.07 and similar limitations provisions govern statutory causes of action only if the statute imposes a liability that would not exist but for the statute.

Western States also argues that <em>Andrianos, supra, </em>independently requires that McAuliffe\u2019s product liability claim be governed by R.C. 2305.10: \u201cSince \u00a7 2305.10 relates to the \u2018essential character\u2019 and \u2018specific subject matter\u2019 of the Complaint, it controls over the more general statute of limitations provision contained in \u00a7 2305.07 for \u2018a liability created by statute.\u2019 \u201d We disagree. The \u201creal purpose\u201d test of <em>Andrianos, supra, </em>is not applicable to causes of action which are \u201caction[s] * ** * upon a liability created by statute.\u201d See <em>Mehl, supra, </em>593 F.Supp. at 162. In terms of statutory causes of action, the test in <em>Andrianos, supra, </em>only applies where the liability imposed by the statute is not \u201ca liability created by statute.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b652-11\">Francis E. Sweeney, Sr., J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AxUq\">dissenting. I respectfully dissent. I believe a products liability action brought pursuant to R.C. 2307.71 through 2307.80 is an action upon a \u201cliability created by statute\u201d and is therefore governed by the six-year statute of limitations of R.C. 2305.07 rather than R.C. 2305.10, the two-year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>statute of limitations for bodily injuries. Consequently, for the following reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">According to the majority, in order for a liability to be \u201ccreated by statute\u201d the liability must be based on a new cause of action that would not exist but for the statute. See <em>Hawkins v. Furnace Co. </em>(1884), 40 Ohio St. 507, 515. Rather than apply this restrictive test, I would follow the court of appeals\u2019 approach and hold that an action becomes a \u201cliability created by statute\u201d and is subject to R.C. 2305.07 when the statute modifies or alters the common law and creates a new concept of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">I believe this test is in line with our more recent decision of <em>Bora v. Kerchelich </em>(1983), 2 Ohio St.3d 146, 2 OBR 692, 443 N.E.2d 509, where we applied the six-year statute of limitations to injuries caused by a dog. The <em>Bora </em>opinion, which made no mention of <em>Hawkins, supra, </em>was decided on the ground that the \u201ccontemporary version of the [dog-bite] statute * * * gives rise to the cause of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 147, 2 OBR at 693, 443 N.E.2d at 510. Thus, the enactment of this statute, which made a dog owner strictly liable for injuries caused by his or her dog, changed or refined the common law so that the cause of action became a \u201cliability created by statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Likewise, R.C. 2307.71 <em>et seq., </em>the Product Liability Act, which was passed in 1987 as part of the General Assembly\u2019s \u201ctort reform\u201d package, changed the common law so that a products liability action is now a \u201cliability created by statute.\u201d The Act defines exactly who is amenable to suit and under what circumstances a cause of action exists. Further, the General Assembly has substantively changed the common law by eliminating certain traditional theories of recovery (including implied warranty of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and by eliminating the proof necessary for the recovery of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The majority downplays or ignores these changes. However, I believe these changes are substantial and are proof that a products liability claim is created by statute and governed by R.C. 2305.07 for purposes of the statute of limitations. For instance, the elevation of the standard of proof (from preponderance of the evidence to clear and convincing standard) is clearly a departure from the common law and is significant, since it seriously affects a claimant\u2019s ability to recover punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Therefore, although there existed a common law of products liability, the General Assembly, by statutorily defining products liability claims and refining the theories of proof and recovery, altered the common law to such a degree that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>a products liability action brought under R.C. 2307.71 to 2307.80 has become a \u201cliability created by statute.\u201d Because of these changes, I would hold that a products liability claim is an action upon a \u201cliability created by statute\u201d and is governed by the six-year statute of limitations found in R.C. 2305.07.</p>\n<judges id=\"b654-5\">Douglas and Resnick, JJ., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b653-9\">. R.C. 2307.71(M)(3) and 2307.71(N) define \u201cproduct liability claim\u201d in terms of an express representation of material fact rather than in terms of an implied warranty theory.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
