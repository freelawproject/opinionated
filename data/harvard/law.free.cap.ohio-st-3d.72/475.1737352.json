The answer to this query is \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">R.C. 4101.11 states: \u201cEvery employer * * * shall furnish a place of employment which shall be safe for the employees therein <em>and for frequenters thereof </em>shall furnish and use safety devices and safeguards, * * * and shall do every other thing reasonably necessary to protect the life, health, safety, and welfare of such employees <em>and frequenters.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) R.C. 4101.12 similarly imposes a duty upon an employer to provide employees and frequenters with a safe place of employment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As used in these two sections, \u201cfrequenter\u201d means \u201cevery person, other than an employee, who may go in or be in a place of employment under circumstances which render him other than a trespasser.\u201d R.C. 4101.01(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The question in this case is whether Ford was an \u201cemployer\u201d as to Michaels within the meaning of the frequenter statutes. Ford owed Michaels a duty to provide a safe place of employment only if it was an \u201cemployer\u201d under the frequenter statutes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If Ford was not an \u201cemployer,\u201d the frequenter statutes simply do not apply. See <em>Comerford v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp. </em>(1959), 170 Ohio St. 117, 10 O.O.2d 11, 162 N.E.2d 861, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">R.C. 4101.01(C) defines \u201cemployer\u201d as \u201cevery person, firm, corporation, agent, manager, representative, or other person <em>having control or custody </em>of any employment, place of employment, or employee.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is undisputed that Ford did not have custody or control of Michaels or his employment. Therefore, the only remaining issue is whether Michaels was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>frequenter of a place of employment that was under the custody or control of Ford.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">On a case-by-case basis, this court has articulated the legal principles governing whether an owner (or a general contractor)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> owes a duty of care under the frequenter statutes because it has custody or control of the employee, employment, or place of employment. In <em>Wellman v. E. Ohio Gas Co. </em>(1953), 160 Ohio St. 103, 51 O.O. 27, 113 N.E.2d 629, paragraph one of the syllabus, we held: \u201cWhere an independent contractor undertakes to do work for another in the very doing of which there are elements of real or potential danger and one of such contractor\u2019s employees is injured as an incident to the performance of the work, no liability for such injury ordinarily attaches to the one who engaged the services of the independent contractor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">In <em>Hirschbach v. Cincinnati Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 206, 6 OBR 259, 452 N.E.2d 326, syllabus, we created an exception to the general rule: \u201cOne who engages the services of an independent contractor, and who <em>actually participates </em>in the job operation performed by such contractor and thereby fails to eliminate a hazard which he, in the exercise of ordinary care, could have eliminated, can be held responsible for the injury or death of an employee of the independent contractor.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In <em>Hirschbach, </em>we concluded that the jury could reasonably find the owner liable for the death of an independent contractor\u2019s employee because the owner \u201cinterfered with the <em>mode </em>of the job operation,\u201d <em>\u201cactually participated in the job operation by dictating the manner and mode </em>in which the winching phase of the job was to be performed,\u201d and \u201chad sole control over the safety features necessary to eliminate the hazard.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id </em>at 208, 6 OBR at 261, 452 N.E.2d at 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">In <em>Cafferkey v. Turner Constr. Co. </em>(1986), 21 Ohio St.3d 110, 21 OBR 416, 488 N.E.2d 189, this court refined the <em>Hirschbach </em>exception and held in the syllabus that \u201c[a] general contractor who has not <em>actively participated </em>in the subcontractor\u2019s work, does not, merely by virtue of its supervisory capacity, owe a duty of care to employees of the subcontractor who are injured while engaged in inherently dangerous work.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) In <em>Cafferkey, </em>we concluded that the general contractor did not owe a duty of care to two employees of a subcontractor who were injured at the construction site. We explained that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>although the general contractor had retained the ability to coordinate the activities of the subcontractor in order to ensure compliance with contract specifications, the general contractor did not <em>\u201ccontrol the means or manned' </em>of the subcontractor\u2019s performance. (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 113, 21 OBR at 418, 488 N.E.2d at 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Most recently, in <em>Bond v. Howard Corp. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 332, 650 N.E.2d 416, syllabus, this court held that the term \u201cactively participated\u201d means \u201cdirected the activity which resulted in the injury- and/or gave or denied permission for the critical acts that led to the employee\u2019s injury, rather than merely exercising a general supervisory role over the project.\u201d We explained that the distinguishing factor between <em>Wellman </em>and <em>Hirschbach </em>was that \u201cthe party who hired the independent contractor in <em>Wellman </em>had inspectors at the job site, but only to ensure that the job was completed according to specifications.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 335, 650 N.E.2d at 419. In <em>Bond, </em>we also emphasized that a party\u2019s \u201cretention of the authority to monitor and coordinate activities\u201d does not constitute \u201cactive participation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 337, 650 N.E.2d at 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">In the case before us, Ford exercised its proper supervisory role by monitoring work progress at the construction site, interpreting plans and specifications, and ensuring that construction was completed according to required specifications. As part of its supervision, Ford directed Lathrop, the general contractor, to cut floor openings as required by contract specifications. Applying the <em>Bond </em>definition of \u201cactively participated,\u201d the \u201cactivity which resulted in the injury\u201d to Michaels and the \u201ccritical act\u201d that led. to Michaels\u2019 injury was the failure to adequately safeguard the hole through which Michaels fell. Ford neither directed Lathrop as to the manner in which the latter should safeguard the floor opening nor gave or denied permission with regard to the way in which the hole was covered. Much to the contrary, Ford retained no custody or control over the area where Lathrop cut the hole through which Michaels subsequently fell. Nor did Ford retain control over the means or manner of Lathrop\u2019s or Doane Electric\u2019s performance of any of their duties at the construction site. Cf. <em>Hirschbach, supra </em>(where the owner directed the manner in which an independent contractor performed an inherently dangerous job).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">\u201cSupervision of a construction job, <em>i.e., </em>coordinating work and directing contractors to perform tasks in accordance with contract specifications, has never constituted \u2018active participation\u2019 in the work of an independent contractor. The very nature of the construction business requires a general contractor or the owner of a construction site to \u2018supervise\u2019 a construction job.\u201d <em>Bond, </em>at 339, 650 N.E.2d at 422 (Wright, J., concurring). An owner of a construction site who merely directs an independent contractor to perform a task required by contract specifications but does not retain control over the means or manner in which that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>task is performed does not owe a duty of care to an employee of a subcontractor who is subsequently injured as a result of the other contractor\u2019s performance of the task in an unsafe manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">As a matter of law, Ford owed no duty of care to Michaels under the frequenter statutes. Accordingly, the trial court and the court of appeals properly concluded that Ford was entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b592-7\">Moyer, C.J., and Cook, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b592-8\">F.E. Sweeney, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"ArQO\">Douglas, Resnick and Pfeifer, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b589-8\">. That section provides: \u201cNo employer shall require, permit, or suffer any employee to go or be in any employment or place of employment which is not safe, and no such employer shall fail to furnish, provide, and use safety devices and safeguards, or fail to obey and follow orders or to adopt and use methods and processes reasonably adequate to render such employment and place of employment safe. No employer shall fail to do every other thing reasonably necessary to protect the life, health, safety, and welfare of such employees or frequenters. No such employer or other person shall construct, occupy, or maintain any place of employment that is not safe.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b589-9\">. If Ford did not owe Michaels a duty of care under the frequenter statutes, it did not owe him a common-law duty of care because the frequenter statutes impose essentially the same duty of care upon an owner or occupier of property as that imposed at common law. See <em>Eicher v. United States Steel Corp. </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 248, 249, 512 N.E.2d 1165, 1167; <em>Westwood </em>v. <em>Thrifty Boy Super Markets, Inc. </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St.2d 84, 58 O.O.2d 154, 278 N.E.2d 673, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b590-7\">. As is evident from our cases, when determining if a duty of care is owed pursuant to the frequenter statutes, the legal test is the same for owners and general contractors: Did the party have custody or control of the injured employee, the employment, or the place of employment? The answer to this question obviously depends upon the specific circumstances of each case, not the general status of the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b590-8\">. As we previously have noted, a subcontractor who works at a construction site is engaged in inherently dangerous work.
