The BTA rejected these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">Under former R.C. 5739.01(B), \u201csales\u201d include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\"><em>ii </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">\u201call of the following transactions for a consideration in any manner * * *:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\"><em>tl </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">\u201c(3) All transactions by which:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\">\u00ab * sic *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-10\">\u201c(e) Automatic data processing and computer services are or are to be provided for use in business when the true object of the transaction is the receipt by the consumer of automatic data processing or computer services rather than the receipt of personal or professional services to which automatic data processing or computer services are incidental or supplemental. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-11\">U \u2021 \u2021 \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-12\">\u201c(5) * * * Other than as provided in this section, \u2018sale\u2019 and \u2018selling\u2019 do not include professional * * * or personal service transactions which involve the transfer of tangible personal property as an inconsequential element, for which no separate charges are made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-13\">In the fourth paragraph of the syllabus of <em>Emery Industries, supra, </em>we construed R.C. 5739.01(B) and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-14\">\u201cIn a professional * * * or personal service transaction in which the charge for the services is not separated from the charge for the property, if the overriding purpose of the purchaser is to obtain tangible personal property produced by the service, the transfer of the property is a consequential element of the transaction and the entire transaction is taxable. If the purchaser\u2019s overriding purpose is to receive the service, the transfer of the personal property is an inconsequential element of the transaction, and the entire transaction is not taxable. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-15\">In <em>Emery Industries, supra, </em>at 139, 539 N.E.2d at 613, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-16\">\u201cThe true object test seeks the essential reason the buyer enters the transaction \u2014 either to obtain the service or the property produced by the service.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-17\">After noting certain examples, which we said illustrated the correct application of the true object test, we concluded that \u201cif the overriding purpose of the purchaser is to obtain tangible personal property produced by the service, the transfer of the property is a consequential element of the transaction and the entire transaction is taxable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-18\">Amerestate\u2019s transactions involve no separate charges. Further, the BTA found the overriding purpose of Amerestate\u2019s customers was to obtain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>reports. We hold this finding to be reasonable and lawful. Thus, the transactions were taxable.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">As to the automatic data processing and computer services, \u201cPaceNet,\u201d R.C. 5739.01(Y)(1) specifically taxes transactions which provide access to computer equipment for the purpose of examining or acquiring data stored in or accessible to such computer equipment. See <em>Quotron Systems, Inc., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">R.C. 5739.01(Y)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">\u201c \u2018Automatic data processing and computer services\u2019 means: * * * providing access to computer equipment for the purpose of processing data or examining or acquiring data stored in or accessible to such computer equipment * * *. \u2018Automatic data processing and computer services\u2019 shall not include personal or professional services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">That provision is precise and determinative. The BTA found that \u201c * * * It is the providing of customer access to and the acquisition of Amerestate\u2019s compiled objective information * * * that the customer primarily seeks and is the essential reason the buyer enters the transaction with -Amerestate, not Amerestate\u2019s interpretation or analysis of that information * * We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">The BTA\u2019s decision was not unreasonable or unlawful, and it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b336-10\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E.
