This cause originated in this court on the filing of a complaint for a writ of mandamus. It appears from the records of this court that relator has not filed evidence or a merit brief in compliance with the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court and therefore has failed to prosecute this cause with the requisite diligence. Upon consideration thereof,</p>\n<p id=\"b884-21\">IT IS ORDERED by the court that this cause be, and hereby is, dismissed <em>sua sponte, </em>effective June 23, 1995.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
