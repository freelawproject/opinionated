A contrary view, however, is apparent from paragraph one of the syllabus of <em>State v. Post </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 380, 513 N.E.2d 754, which reads: \u201c[a] client\u2019s disclosure to a third party of communications made pursuant to the attorney-client privilege breaches the confidentiality underlying the privilege, and constitutes a waiver thereof.\u201d Due to what we now judge to be its overbreadth, we modify, as far as it is inconsistent with our opinion today, the waiver proposition of the <em>Post </em>syllabus. Instead, we follow <em>Swetland v. Miles </em>(1920), 101 Ohio St. 501, 504, 130 N.E. 22, 23, where this court held that the Ohio statute on privileged communication (now R.C. 2317.02) evinced the sole criteria for waiving the privilege: (1) the client expressly consents, or (2) the client voluntarily testifies on the same subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">In <em>Swetland, </em>this court analyzed G.C. 11494, the predecessor to R.C. 2317.02. The appellant requested that the court judicially extend the statute to provide for an additional waiver of the testimonial privilege. Although that statute provided only two circumstances by which the client could waive the privilege, the client\u2019s express consent or the client\u2019s testifying on the same subject, the appellant urged the court to adopt the further exception of allowing the client\u2019s personal representative or heirs to waive the privilege when the client is deceased. As the language of the statute was comprehensive, this court ruled that the General Assembly may broaden the statutory exceptions which constituted waiver of the privileged communications but that the courts should not augment the enumerat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>ed waivers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cThe argument addressed to this court might be addressed to the legislature with persuasive power * * * but it is not for this court to make such an amendment.\u201d <em>Id., </em>101 Ohio St. at 504-505, 130 N.E. at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The General Assembly has plainly and distinctly stated that the privileges of R.C. 2317.02 are to be given effect absent specific statutory exceptions. <em>State v. Smorgala </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 222, 223, 553 N.E.2d 672, 674. See, also, <em>State ex rel. Lambdin v. Brenton </em>(1970), 21 Ohio St.2d 21, 24, 50 O.O.2d 44, 46, 254 N.E.2d 681, 683. We believe that the reasoning in <em>Swetland </em>applies equally well to the state\u2019s contention in this case. The state, however, contends that it is our decision in <em>Post </em>which controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">In <em>Post, </em>an attorney employed a polygraph examiner as his agent. The client of the attorney submitted to a polygraph examination without his attorney present, and in the course of the examination, confessed in writing to a crime. The client later told a third party about his confession to the polygraph examiner. The trial court ruled that the written statement as well as the polygraph examiner\u2019s testimony was admissible because the client\u2019s disclosure to the third party waived any privilege. The client appealed, asserting that the polygraph examiner\u2019s testimony should not have been allowed into evidence. This court found the client\u2019s discussion with the polygraph examiner privileged but also found that privilege waived when the client revealed the content of the privileged communication to a third party. At common law, the attorney-client privilege could be waived either expressly or by conduct implying waiver. See 8 Wigmore, Evidence (McNaughton Rev.1961), Section 2327.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">The statute that controls the case before us is R.C. 2317.02(A), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-9\">\u201cThe following persons shall not testify in certain respects:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-10\">\u201c(A) An <em>attorney, </em>concerning a communication made to him by his client in that relation or his advice to his client, except that the attorney may testify by express consent of the client * * * and except that, if the client voluntarily testifies * * * the attorney may be compelled to testify on the same subject.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">In <em>Weis v. Weis </em>(1947), 147 Ohio St. 416, 34 O.O. 350, 72 N.E.2d 245, paragraph four of the syllabus, we held that G.C. 11494 (the predecessor to R.C. 2317.02) affords \u201cprotection only to those relationships which are specifically named therein.\u201d After that decision, the General Assembly adopted R.C. 2317.021, which defines the term \u201cclient,\u201d as used in the privilege statute, to include the client\u2019s \u201cagent, employee, or representative.\u201d The definition of the term \u201cattorney\u201d has not been amended to include an agent, employee, or representative of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>the attorney. While communications directly between the client and attorney fall squarely within R.C. 2317.02(A), communications between a client and an agent of the attorney are not protected by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">We, therefore, distinguish <em>Post </em>from the present case. In the case before us, Attorney Lawrence refused to testify based on R.C. 2317.02(A) because here the discussions were directly between the attorney and the client. <em>Post, </em>however, involved the agent of an attorney, a polygrapher. When the client confessed to the polygrapher, the attorney was not present.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The <em>Post </em>court, therefore, recognized a judicially created attorney-client privilege where, without the presence of the attorney, the communications between the client and the polygrapher, the attorney\u2019s agent, were deemed privileged. The court then properly decided how that common-law attorney-client privilege could be waived. The circumstances of waiver recognized in that case have no relationship to communications that fall squarely within the statutory privilege based on direct communications between attorneys and clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">To the extent that paragraph one of the syllabus of <em>Post </em>is overbroad and would affect the statutory attorney-client privilege by adding a waiver not enumerated in R.C. 2317.02(A), we modify it. The syllabus of a Supreme Court opinion is not to be construed as being broader than the facts of that specific case warrant. <em>Williamson Heater Co. v. Radich </em>(1934), 128 Ohio St. 124, 126, 190 N.E. 403, 404; <em>DeLozier v. Sommer </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St.2d 268, 271, 67 O.O.2d 335, 337, 313 N.E.2d 386, 389. The decision in <em>Post, </em>however, remains a valid judgment of this court despite our limiting of paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">As we decline to add a judicially created waiver to the statutorily created privilege, we hold that R.C. 2317.02(A) provides the exclusive means by which privileged communications directly between an attorney and a client can be waived. Lawrence\u2019s act of refusing to testify was not contemptuous because McDermott had not waived the attorney-client privilege \u2014 he neither expressly consented to Lawrence\u2019s testifying nor did he voluntarily testify on the same subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b686-10\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, Fain and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>F.E.

While this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Post </em>does not clearly indicate whether the defendant\u2019s attorney was present at this confession, the defendant\u2019s brief to this court in <em>Post </em>stated that the attorney was not present.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
