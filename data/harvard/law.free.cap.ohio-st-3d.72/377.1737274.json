Braswell v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 61, 63, 25 OBR 83, 85-86, 494 N.E.2d 1147, 1149-1150.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>In vacating the commission\u2019s order, the appellate court ruled that Dr. Dobrowski\u2019s report did not satisfy <em>Braswell. </em>We disagree, noting that the report specifically indicates that the doctor knew that claimant was a construction laborer.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Claimant responds that \u201cconstruction worker\u201d is too general a term, claiming that it encompasses many different duties entailing many different levels of physical exertion. While this may be true, there is no evidence that Dr. Dobrowski misperceived claimant\u2019s duties to the detriment of any interested party. There is no indication that Dr. Dobrowski based his conclusion on the erroneous belief that claimant\u2019s occupation consisted of sedentary, light or medium work. To the contrary, Dr. Dobrowski noted that claimant was injured while pushing an air compressor \u2014 a heavy piece of machinery. Accordingly, we find that the report was \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Ironically, the same \u201cdeficiencies\u201d that allegedly invalidate Dr. Dobrowski\u2019s report permeate all of claimant\u2019s supporting disability evidence as well. Dr. Lee, who certified temporary total disability from June 16, 1988 to June 30, 1989, consistently declined to identify claimant\u2019s former position of employment or duties on four C84s. Dr. Lee, therefore, demonstrates no knowledge of claimant\u2019s duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">So, too, with Dr. Corn. His 1990 report describes claimant as a \u201cconstruction laborer\u201d and recites, almost identically, the description of injuries set forth by Dr. Dobrowski. Dr. Corn\u2019s 1991 report also refers to claimant\u2019s former position of employment as \u201cconstruction laborer\u201d with no other elaboration. Finally, on Dr. Corn\u2019s sole C84, he again lists claimant\u2019s duties as \u201cconstruction laborer\u201d and claimant\u2019s former position of employment as \u201cHorvitz Construction.\u201d Claimant\u2019s proposition does not, therefore, advance his claimed entitlement to compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">The judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b492-10\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, F.E.
