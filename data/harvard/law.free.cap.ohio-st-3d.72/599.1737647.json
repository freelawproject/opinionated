First, the AWW must do substantial justice to the claimant. Second, it should not provide a windfall. * * * \u201d (Citations omitted.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number><em>State ex rel. Wireman v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 286, 287, 551 N.E.2d 1265, 1266-1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Former R.C. 4123.61 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-6\">\u201c * * * [Claimant\u2019s * * average weekly wage for the year preceding the injury * * * shall be the weekly wage upon which compensation shall be based. In ascertaining the average weekly wage for the year previous to the injury * * * any period of unemployment due to sickness, industrial depression, strike, lockout, or other cause beyond the employee\u2019s control shall be eliminated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-7\">\u201cIn cases where there are special circumstances under which the average weekly wage cannot justly be determined by applying this section, the commission, in determining the average weekly wage in such cases, shall use such method as will enable it to do substantial justice to the claimants.\u201d (128 Ohio Laws 743, 764-765.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">At issue are periods of alleged unemployment and part-time employment. Under former R.C. 4123.61, periods of unemployment that were found to be beyond claimant\u2019s control were excluded from the calculation. Consistent with this directive, the commission excluded thirteen weeks from the denominator. This exclusion was based on OBES records that documented payments of unemployment compensation from April 27,1989 to May 11,1989 and September 28, 1989 to November 22, 1989. Because OBES benefits hinge on both unemployment and an ongoing effort to find work, payment of these benefits may be interpreted as evidence that claimant\u2019s unemployment was due to circumstances beyond his control, and exclusion was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">Claimant also claims that he was unemployed from November 23,1989 to April 6, 1990, and criticizes the commission for failing to exclude those weeks from the formula. This allegation is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">Claimant corroborated his allegation of unemployment from April 27, 1989 to May 11, 1989 and September 28, 1989 to November 11, 1989 with OBES records. Similar substantiation is conspicuously absent for the periods from May 11, 1989 to June 3,1989 and November 23, 1989 to April 6, 1990. The commission, in the exercise of its evidentiary prerogative, did not err in finding that the lack of independent verification rendered claimant\u2019s allegation of unemployment over the disputed periods unconvincing. The commission, therefore, did not err in refusing to exclude those disputed weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">We also reject claimant\u2019s entreaty to exclude his weeks of part-time work. Part-time work is not listed among those situations that R.C. 4123.61 decreed must be excluded from the AWW computation. Elimination, therefore, can be accomplished only through the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d provision of R.C. 4123.61. While part-time employment is not per <em>se </em>a \u201cspecial circumstance,\u201d in some part-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>time situations \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d may indeed exist. <em>State ex rel. Wireman, swpra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">We do not find \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d in this case. Claimant does not dispute the district hearing officer\u2019s finding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-5\">\u201c[F]rom 6/3/89 \u2014 9/6/89 claimant worked at Genesis earning $5058.28. It is found that claimant was employed by Beulah Park <em>also </em>over this period as it is a seasonal summer job.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Claimant\u2019s part-time job was not due to reasons beyond his control. Instead, his part-time status was due to claimant\u2019s contemporaneous full-time job with Genesis that precluded more hours at Beulah. Accordingly, the commission\u2019s decision to include this period in the AWW was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b714-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E.
