Reid </em>(1986), 32 Ohio App.3d 7, 513 N.E.2d 351, upon the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>\u201c[Wjhether or not the exclusionary rule is applicable as a sanction for violation of R.C. 2935.20.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">This court answers the certified question in the negative. The judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded to it for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b458-6\">Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney and Cook, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b458-7\">Moyer, C.J., Wright and Pfeifer, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b458-8\">Wright, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AxfX\">dissenting. The issue certified to this court is \u201cwhether or not the exclusionary rule is applicable as a sanction for violation of R.C. Section 2935.20.\u201d Although I do not agree that every violation of R.C. 2935.20 requires suppression of evidence obtained as a result of the violation, I agree with both lower courts that the breathalyzer test results should be excluded in this case. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">It is well settled in Ohio that courts ordinarily will not apply the exclusionary rule to evidence that is the product of a statutory violation falling short of a constitutional violation, unless the legislature specifically mandates such exclusion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Kettering v. Hollen </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 232, 235, 18 O.O.3d 435, 437, 416 N.E.2d 598, 600; <em>State v. Unger </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 65, 69-70, 21 O.O.3d 41, 44-45, 423 N.E.2d 1078, 1081. However, in this case, the breathalyzer test results should be excluded because they were the product of police misconduct which not only denied Mattachione her rights under R.C. 2935.20, but also denied her due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">The federal Due Process Clause prohibits states from depriving \u201cany person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d In the case before us, there is no doubt that Mattachione\u2019s liberty interests were at stake. If she submitted to the test and her breath contained an impermissible concentration of alcohol, her license would be revoked and she would likely face imprisonment and fines. See R.C. 4511.191(D)(1)(a); R.C. 4511.99.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">When the police asked Mattachione whether she would submit to a breathalyzer test, she responded on three separate occasions that she did not want to take the test until her attorney was present. As soon as her husband arrived at the police station, he told the police dispatcher, \u201cMy wife is not to take any test. I\u2019ve got an attorney coming.\u201d Instead of conveying that message to his wife, an officer told Mattachione, \u201cthere\u2019s no attorney coming.\u201d There is no evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Mattachione\u2019s husband or anyone else told any officer or dispatcher that an attorney would not be coming to the police station. Believing the officer\u2019s false assertion that no attorney was coming, Mattachione finally agreed to take the breathalyzer test.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">From these facts, it is clear that Mattachione agreed to take the breathalyzer test before she was required by law to do so only because the police misled her. As such, the police not only disregarded appellee\u2019s statutory right to confer with counsel, but also intentionally deceived her into prematurely abandoning that right. Such police misconduct denies the appellee her due process rights because it offends a sense of justice and reflects poorly upon the fundamental fairness of the police procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">I agree with the general proposition that whether a driver who seeks to communicate with an attorney has been deprived of her due process rights depends upon the facts of each case. One must consider the totality of the circumstances. If police violate an individual\u2019s constitutional rights and the individual submits to a chemical test through police duplicity, the only effective sanction is to exclude the test results that are adverse to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b459-9\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, J., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b458-12\">. R.C. 2935.20 does not provide for the application of the exclusionary rule for the violation of its provisions. Those who violate that section are subject to a maximum fine of $100 and/or imprisonment of not more than thirty days.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
