Rather, we see only the report of a psychiatrist, to whom respondent was referred by relator in 1992, that describes respondent\u2019s prior drug and alcohol addictions as being \u201cin remission\u201d and concludes that \u201c[h]e does not have any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>other mental illness, such as a depressive disorder or affective disorder, anxiety disorder, or psychosis.\u201d The motion to strike is, therefore, overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">Respondent\u2019s violations of the cited Disciplinary Rules, on the other hand, are amply supported by the evidence, and we share the board\u2019s anxiety over his attempts at intimidation. We, thus, completely agree with the recommendation to impose our harshest penalty for this misconduct. Respondent is hereby ordered permanently disbarred from the practice of law in Ohio. Costs taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b457-6\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
