Movant alleged that respondent had appeared as counsel of record in approximately 70 cases after he had been suspended from the practice of law by this court\u2019s May 9, 1994 order. Movant further alleged that respondent was not an attorney in good standing with the court because he had not registered for the 1989-1991, 1991-1993, or 1993-1995 attorney registration biennia.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">On April 6, 1995, this court granted the motion and ordered respondent to show cause by filing a written response on or before April 26,1995, setting forth why he should not be found in contempt for failure to comply with this court\u2019s May 9, 1994 order.

Respondent appeared in person before the court on the scheduled date.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">Upon consideration thereof, this court finds that respondent has failed to show cause why further sanctions should not be imposed. Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">IT IS ORDERED by the court that respondent fully comply with this court\u2019s May 9, 1994 order, including all of the Continuing Legal Education requirements of Gov.Bar R. X. It is further ordered that respondent\u2019s suspension from the practice of law remains in effect until he fully complies with the May 9, 1994 order and this court reinstates him pursuant to Gov.Bar R. X(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED by the court that respondent be imprisoned for ninety days, with eighty-seven days of the sentence being suspended. It is further ordered that the suspended portion of respondent\u2019s sentence will be imposed if respondent practices law prior to an order of this court reinstating him to the practice of law.</p>\n<judges id=\"b881-11\">Douglas, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b881-12\">Resnick, J., not participating.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
