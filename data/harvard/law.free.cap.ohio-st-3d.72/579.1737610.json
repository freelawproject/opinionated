Sweeney, Sr., J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3qR\">We are asked to determine whether appellant is entitled to those records pertaining to his criminal trial and those of his co-defendants. Appellee argues that it need not release these records because they are contained within the prosecutor\u2019s litigation file and are exempt from release under R.C. 149.43(A)(1) as \u201ctrial preparation records.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">Not every record contained within a prosecutor\u2019s file is an exempt \u201ctrial preparation record.\u201d Documents discoverable under Crim.R. 16(B) or other records, such as routine office and indictment reports, fall outside the definition of \u201ctrial preparation record\u201d and are always subject to disclosure upon request by the criminal defendant. See <em>State ex rel. Steckman v. Jackson </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 420, 435, 639 N.E.2d 83, 94. These non-exempt records do not become \u201ctrial preparation records\u201d simply because they are contained within a prosecutor\u2019s file. Within that file, there can be both \u201ctrial preparation records,\u201d which are exempt, and other records, which must be disclosed. If a criminal defendant can obtain a record under Crim.R. 16(B), that record is subject to immediate release to that defendant regardless of whether it is contained within a prosecutor\u2019s file and combined with \u201ctrial preparation records.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">Under Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(a), any relevant written or recorded statements by a defendant or co-defendant, written summaries of oral statements by a defendant or co-defendant, or the recorded testimony of a defendant or co-defendant before a grand jury is discoverable to a criminal defendant. Clearly, these records, which are discoverable under Crim.R. 16(B)(1), are subject to immediate release upon request by a criminal defendant even though they are contained within the prosecutor\u2019s file.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">Accordingly, we find that appellant is entitled to those records pertaining to his criminal trial and those of his co-defendants which are discoverable under Crim.R. 16(B). As to the other records that appellant seeks, which are not discoverable under Crim.R. 16(B) and which the prosecutor compiled in anticipation of appellant\u2019s underlying criminal case, these records are considered \u201ctrial preparation records\u201d and were properly exempt under <em>State ex rel. Steckman, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b693-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>The judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and the writ sought by appellant is granted in part and denied in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">\n<em>Judgment reversed; writ granted in part and denied in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b693-5\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, Resnick and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b693-6\">Cook, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b693-7\">Cook, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ayq\">concurring in judgment. I respectfully concur only in the judgment and write to voice my concern that the majority\u2019s holding may be interpreted too broadly.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">The present case is one where the relator has been convicted and his convictions upheld upon appeal. I agree that under the circumstances of this case if a document is discoverable under Crim.R; 16 then it does not qualify as a \u201ctrial preparation record\u201d under R.C. 149.43(A)(4). To say this, however, is not the same as equating documents discoverable under Crim.R. 16 with public records. The statute defining \u201cpublic record\u201d includes many exceptions, only one of which is trial preparation records. R.C. 149.43(A). My concern is that <em>State ex rel. Steckman v. Jackson </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 420, 639 N.E.2d 83, not be interpreted to mean that every record discoverable under Crim.R. 16 is thereby deemed a public record.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">Thus, for the foregoing reasons, I respectfully concur in the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
