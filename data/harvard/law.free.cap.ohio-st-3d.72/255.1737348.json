The commission has since made such a finding. Among the objections to that determination is claimant\u2019s assertion that the finding is unsupported by \u201csome evidence.\u201d Upon review, we concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">Claimant\u2019s cessation of permanent total disability compensation was premised on the reports of five physicians. Because the commission relied on the reports of Drs. Moorstein, Vamvas and Steurer in support of its original permanent total disability award, those three reports cannot now be \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting its denial of further benefits. <em>State ex rel. Zamora v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 17, 543 N.E.2d 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">With the removal of these three reports, only the reports of Drs. Katz and DiDomenico remain. These two doctors, however, limited their opinions to claimant\u2019s orthopedic conditions. There is no indication that the commission factored in claimant\u2019s serious psychiatric condition before disallowing permanent total disability compensation. Because the commission cannot discontinue permanent total disability compensation without considering all allowed conditions, the commission erred in stopping permanent total disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">Accordingly, the writ of mandamus is allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-13\">\n<em>Writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.

Hardened by some of the results obtained of late in this class of cases, I am merely puzzled by the outcome in this matter. However, I would suspect that the Industrial Commission\u2019s posture will be a bit stronger than a sense of bewilderment.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">In <em>State ex rel. Didiano v. Beshara </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 256, 602 N.E.2d 1157 <em>(\u201cDidiano </em>I\u201d), this court <em>unanimously </em>granted a writ of mandamus indicating that a peremptory discontinuation of this claimant\u2019s permanent total disability benefits without a finding that \u201cclaimant was not permanently and totally disabled\u201d was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">In <em>Didiano I, </em>we stated that R.C. 4123.58 \u201cestablishes a claimant\u2019s right to uninterrupted compensation once permanent total disability is found.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 257, 602 N.E.2d at 1157. However, we indicated without reservation that such a finding \u201cmay be changed under the commission\u2019s continuing jurisdiction under R.C. 4123.52,\u201d <em>id., </em>citing <em>State ex rel. Brewer v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1984), <em>12 </em>Ohio St.3d 23, 12 OBR 20, 465 N.E.2d 389. <em>Brewer, </em>as stated in <em>Didiano I, </em>involved an order very similar to the one in this case. In <em>Brewer, </em>the commission had originally determined that the claimant was permanently and totally disabled, but limited the award to a specific time period. The commission subsequently issued an order finding the claimant was no longer permanently and totally disabled and terminated compensation. We upheld the commission\u2019s action, finding, <em>inter alia, </em>that the second order constituted a proper exercise of continuing jurisdiction because the limited award clearly indicated that the commission\u2019s order was provisional and subject to change and clearly evinced the commission\u2019s intent to review further the appellant\u2019s claim. <em>Id. </em>at 25, 12 OBR at 21, 465 N.E.2d at 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">In this ease, the commission\u2019s original order awarding permanent total disability compensation also was expressly limited to a specific time period, thus indicating the provisional nature of its award. In <em>Didiano I, </em>we appropriately <em>returned </em>the cause for further proceedings, per <em>Brewer. </em>These proceedings most certainly took place. Didiano was reexamined by Drs. Gary I. Katz and Joseph A. DiDomenico, both of whom made clear-cut findings that claimant\u2019s back condition did not preclude sustained remunerative employment. Dr. Katz found <em>no </em>objective symptoms to support Didiano\u2019s subjective complaints and determined that claimant could return to his former position of employment. The commission, considering the previous findings of Drs. Moorstein, Steurer, and Vamvas, along with those of Drs. Katz and DiDomenico, discontinued permanent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>total disability benefits for Didiano.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Citing <em>State ex rel. Zamora v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 17, 543 N.E.2d 87; the majority states that the reports of Drs. Moorstein, Vamvas, and Steurer cannot constitute \u201csome evidence\u201d to support the denial of a permanent total disability award. However, the <em>Zamora </em>case simply does not apply to the circumstances of this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We have held repeatedly that the commission has continuing jurisdiction in cases such as the one before us. We ordered the commission to make a finding similar in character to the one before us. Surely the findings of Dr. Katz and his colleague constitute \u201csome evidence\u201d to support the commission\u2019s decision. <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936, syllabus. The commission exercised its expertise and granted an appropriate amount of permanent total disability compensation in this matter, and the commission\u2019s decision in this matter surely should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b370-6\">Cook, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b370-7\">. Dr. Paul A. Steurer\u2019s report concluded: \u201cBased on my history and physical examination, based on reasonable medical probability and certainty, and using the AMA guidelines of impairment, Mr. Didiano is not totally permanently prohibited from all sustained remunerative employment due strictly to his orthopedic problem. I feel that he has a 30% permanent partial impairment with respect to the whole man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">Dr. Benjamin Moorstein\u2019s report stated: \u201cAt this time Mr. Didiano is estimated to have a partial psychological impairment of 25% to the body as a whole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">Dr. Katz\u2019s report opined: \u201cI feel this represents a cervical and thoracic myofascitis secondary to the injury in 1982. There are no objective findings in this case. I feel [Mr. Didiano] is able to work as a janitor as he previously did with no restrictions. He does not require rehabilitation and I feel he has reached maximum medical improvement. He does not require any more medications or physical therapy treatments. In view of the findings at this time, I feel he is entitled to a permanent partial impairment of 20% (twenty percent) of the body as a whole based on my exam and on reasonable medical probability and certainty and using the AMA guidelines.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b370-10\">. In <em>Zamora, supra, </em>the regional board had concluded that the claimant was permanently and totally disabled, implicitly rejecting Dr. Kogut\u2019s report, which stated that the claimant had a moderate mental impairment of \u201c40-55%.\u201d The commission, however, denied the claimant a permanent total disability award, expressly relying on Dr. Kogut\u2019s report. This court held that Dr. Kogut\u2019s report could not constitute \u201csome evidence\u201d against a finding of a permanent and total disability because \u201cit would be inconsistent to permit the commission to reject the Kogut report at one level, for whatever reason, and rely on it at another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19, 543 N.E.2d at 89. In stark contrast, this case does not involve inconsistencies between different <em>levels </em>of review by the commission. Expressly maintaining its continuing jurisdiction, the commission merely changed its position in light of new medical evidence submitted <em>in combination with </em>the medical evidence that existed at the time of the commission\u2019s original order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
