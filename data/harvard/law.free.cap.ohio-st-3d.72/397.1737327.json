For the reasons to follow, we find that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">The appellate court\u2019s decision was precipitated by the commission\u2019s failure to specify evidence on which it relied. The commission responds that the appellate court misunderstood the basis for the denial of compensation. Wage loss was not denied to claimant because the commission affirmatively relied on any evidence\u2014 <em>ie., </em>\u201csome evidence.\u201d It was denied because, in the commission\u2019s view, there was no evidence on which the commission could rely to make an award. The commission asserts that it cannot specify evidentiary reliance where there was none.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-14\">The commission\u2019s position makes sense, theoretically, but its argument, on closer review, is undermined by the order\u2019s ambiguity. The order\u2019s reference to \u201cinsufficient medical proof\u2019 implies that the wage-loss denial was indeed premised on \u201cno evidence.\u201d Conversely, its emphasis on claimant\u2019s ability to return to her former job and citation to evidence that specifically so states, suggest that the commission indeed relied on \u201csome evidence\u201d that was not expressly designated as such. Generally, such a lack of clarity would justify a return of the cause to the commission for further consideration and amended order.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>We decline, however, to return the cause because of the nature of the evidence before us. The lack of \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the denial of compensation is not automatically \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting its award. <em>State ex rel. Lampkins v. Dayton Malleable, Inc. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 14, 542 N.E.2d 1105. In this case, further consideration is pointless, since <em>none </em>of the medical evidence could support a wage-loss award.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Dr. Gonzalez\u2019s report does not support a wage-loss award because he attributes claimant\u2019s physical problems to congenital conditions unrelated to the industrial injury. Dr. Yamvas\u2019s assessment of claimant\u2019s physical abilities cannot further claimant\u2019s position, since Dr. Vamvas\u2019s conclusions were inherently rejected when the commission discontinued temporary total disability compensation. <em>State ex rel. Zamora v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 17, 543 N.E.2d 87. <em>Zamora </em>also prohibits reliance on Dr. Graneto\u2019s 1990 report.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Dr. Graneto\u2019s 1991 report is also insufficient to support a wage-loss payment. While the report states that claimant can do sedentary work, it does not state that she is <em>restricted </em>to such work. Without such a declaration, Dr. Graneto does not substantiate the existence of any medical impairment because his report does not eliminate the possibility that claimant can do more strenuous work. If claimant, for example, is now able to do everything that she did before the injury, her assertion of an injury-related impairment lacks persuasiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b512-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, Pfeifer and Cook, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b512-10\">Resnick and F.E.

The majority opinion makes it crystal clear why the judgment of the court of appeals should be affirmed. The majority states that \u201c[t]he commission\u2019s position makes sense, theoretically, but its argument, on closer review, is undermined by the order\u2019s ambiguity.\u201d That is the precise reason that the court of appeals deemed it necessary for the writ to be granted so that the commission may issue an amended order. Thus, for all the reasons put forth by the court of appeals and the majority, it is imperative that this matter be returned to the commission for clarification of its order. I would, therefore, affirm the judgment of the court of appeals in its entirety.</p>\n<judges id=\"b512-12\">F.E.
