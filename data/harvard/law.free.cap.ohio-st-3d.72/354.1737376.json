(See Appendix, <em>infra.) </em>We have carefully considered each of appellant\u2019s propositions of law, independently weighed the aggravating circumstances against the evidence presented in mitigation, and reviewed the death penalty for appropriateness and proportionality. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals and uphold appellant\u2019s death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">R.C. 2929.05 requires this court to review capital cases in a certain manner. However, as we have held on a number of previous occasions, R.C. 2929.05 does not require this court to address and discuss, in opinion form, each and every proposition of law raised by the parties. See, <em>e.g., State v. Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 3, 520 N.E.2d 568, 570; <em>State v. Bonnell </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 179, 181, 573 N.E.2d 1082, 1085; <em>State v. Hawkins </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 339, 342, 612 N.E.2d 1227, 1230; and <em>State v. Scudder </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 263, 267, 643 N.E.2d 524, 528. We adhere to that position today. Upon a careful review of the record and the governing law, we fail to detect any errors that would undermine our confidence in the integrity and reliability of the trial court\u2019s findings. We address, in opinion form, only those issues that warrant some discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">Appellant was examined before trial by the defense\u2019s court-appointed clinical psychologist, Dr. Robert W. Goldberg. From Goldberg\u2019s examination of appellant, Goldberg determined that appellant was sane at the time of the killing arid was competent to stand trial. Accordingly, prior to trial, defense counsel never raised the issue of appellant\u2019s competency or the defense of not guilty by reason of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">The mitigation phase of appellant\u2019s trial commenced on July 30, 1990. That morning, defense counsel moved for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence to pursue a defense of not guilty by reason of insanity. In doing so, defense counsel raised, for the first time, the issue of appellant\u2019s competency to stand trial. Specifically, the defense claimed that it had recently acquired information indicating that Mitroff had nearly hit appellant\u2019s sister and niece with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>a delivery van sometime prior to appellant\u2019s employment at the bakery. That information had come from appellant\u2019s sister, Elaine Quigley. Counsel told the court that appellant had previously withheld this information from the defense and that appellant was now claiming that the incident motivated him to kill Mitroff. According to defense counsel, appellant had previously maintained that he killed Mitroff for \u201cno reason.\u201d Defense counsel claimed that appellant\u2019s act of withholding information as to a possible motive raised a question regarding appellant\u2019s sanity. Additionally, defense counsel indicated that the newly discovered evidence had led Dr. Goldberg to suggest that appellant might not be sane enough to proceed with the mitigation phase. The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial and did not order a competency hearing. The case then proceeded to conclusion without appellant having ever been adjudicated competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">In his third proposition of law, appellant contends that the trial court erred by proceeding to the mitigation phase without conducting a mid-trial hearing on the issue of his competence. Appellant suggests that such a hearing was constitutionally required and/or statutorily mandated. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Fundamental principles of due process require that a criminal defendant who is legally incompetent shall not be subjected to trial. See <em>Pate v. Robinson </em>(1966), 383 U.S. 375, 86 S.Ct. 836, 15 L.Ed.2d 815; and <em>Drope v. Missouri </em>(1975), 420 U.S. 162, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103. In <em>Pate, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the failure to observe procedures adequate to protect a defendant\u2019s right not to be tried or convicted while incompetent to stand trial deprives the defendant of the right to a fair trial. In <em>Dusky v. United States </em>(1960), 362 U.S. 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 789, 4 L.Ed.2d 824, 825, the United States Supreme Court set forth the test to determine whether a defendant is competent to stand trial, stating that \u201c * * * the \u2018test must be whether he has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding \u2014 and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u2019 \u201d See, also, <em>Drope, supra, </em>420 U.S. at 172, 95 S.Ct. at 904, 43 L.Ed.2d at 113. The right to a hearing on the issue of competency rises to the level of a constitutional guarantee where the record contains \u201csufficient indicia of incompetence,\u201d such that an inquiry into the defendant\u2019s competency is necessary to ensure the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. See <em>Drope, supra, </em>420 U.S. 162, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103; <em>Pate, supra, </em>383 U.S. 375, 86 S.Ct. 836, 15 L.Ed.2d 815; and <em>State v. Bock </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 108, 110, 28 OBR 207, 209, 502 N.E.2d 1016, 1018-1019.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">In Ohio, R.C. 2945.37 protects the right of a criminal defendant not to be tried or convicted while incompetent. R.C. 2945.37(A) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>\u201cIn a criminal action in a court of common pleas or municipal court, the court, prosecutor, or defense may raise the issue of the defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial. If the issue is raised before trial, the court shall hold a hearing on the issue as provided in this section. <em>If the issue is raised after trial has begun, the court shall hold a hearing on the issue only for good cause shown.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">\u201cA defendant is presumed competent to stand trial, unless it is proved by a preponderance of the evidence in a hearing under this section that because of his present mental condition he is incapable of understanding the nature and objective of the proceedings against him or of presently assisting in his defense.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">R.C. 2945.37(A) requires a trial court to hold <em>a mid-trial hearing </em>on the issue of competency \u201conly for good cause shown.\u201d The statutory requirement mandating a showing of \u201cgood cause\u201d has been construed in accordance with the general principles set forth in <em>Drope </em>and <em>Pate, supra. </em>See <em>State v. Chapin </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 437, 21 O.O.3d 273, 424 N.E.2d 317. Pursuant to R.C. 2945.37(A), the issue of competency may be raised by the prosecution, the defense, or on the court\u2019s own motion. The determination whether to conduct a mid-trial competency hearing is normally a matter committed to the sound discretion of the trial court. See <em>State v. Rahman </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 146, 156, 23 OBR 315, 323, 492 N.E.2d 401, 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Here, the issue of competency was raised mid-trial, <em>i.e., </em>after the guilt phase, but immediately before the commencement of the mitigation phase. Thus, R.C. 2945.37(A) mandated a hearing on the issue only for \u201cgood cause shown.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, upon a review of the record, we find no \u201csufficient indicia of incompetency\u201d or \u201cgood cause shown\u201d that would have entitled appellant to a competency hearing at the time the issue was raised. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in proceeding with the mitigation phase without conducting a hearing as to appellant\u2019s competency to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">At the time the issue of appellant\u2019s competency was raised, the trial court was made aware of defense counsel\u2019s representations that (1) appellant may have intentionally withheld information regarding a possible motive for the killing, (2) appellant wanted to die and intended to inform the jury of his wishes, (3) appellant had not cooperated in his defense, and (4) appellant\u2019s court-appointed psychologist had recently developed \u201csome strong feelings\u201d that there was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>possibility that appellant was not sane enough to be executed or to proceed with the mitigation hearing. Additionally, defense counsel informed the court of his belief that appellant was \u201csick\u201d because appellant had withheld information regarding an alleged motive for the killing. However, we find that none of these matters, taken singularly or together, constitutes sufficient indicia of incompetency raising any doubt as to appellant\u2019s competency to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">The information concerning a possible motive for the slaying was inherently suspect. As the trial court stated to defense counsel, \u201c * * * I think you can\u2019t discount the fact all of these things you are telling me are your client\u2019s self-serving statements or the self-serving statements of his family.\u201d Similarly, the court of appeals stated that \u201c[t]he information withheld reasonably could be viewed as a last-minute attempt by the defendant to somehow justify his actions.\u201d We agree with this assessment of the issue. However, we do not completely dismiss this evidence as having no bearing on the issue whether the record, as a whole, warranted a mid-trial competency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">As to appellant\u2019s expressed preference for the death penalty, such a sentence could be deemed preferential to life imprisonment for this appellant. A professed wish for the death penalty (as opposed to a lifelong term of imprisonment) does not, by itself, call the defendant\u2019s competence into question. Similarly, appellant\u2019s failure to cooperate with counsel does not indicate that appellant was incapable of assisting in his defense. Indeed, a review of the record demonstrates that appellant understood the nature and objective of the proceedings against him and, in fact, offered a lengthy and coherent unsworn statement during the mitigation phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">With respect to defense counsel\u2019s representations that appellant\u2019s court-appointed psychologist had some \u201cstrong feelings\u201d that appellant was possibly not competent to proceed in the mitigation phase, we note that when defense counsel raised this issue he specifically acknowledged that appellant understood the role of the court and jury. Additionally, the psychologist\u2019s beliefs were based on the possibility that, due to appellant\u2019s psychological condition, appellant may have singled Mitroff out as the victim because Mitroff had almost accidentally hit appellant\u2019s sister and niece with a delivery van. The psychologist\u2019s hypothesis was based upon a series of assumptions and was only as good as the information initially supplied to him by appellant and appellant\u2019s family. Moreover, we note that appellant was twice examined by the court-appointed psychologist prior to trial. Although the reports of the examinations are not contained in the record, the record does indicate that the psychologist found appellant to be sane at the time of the murder and competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Moreover, we find that defense counsel\u2019s statement that appellant was \u201csick\u201d for withholding information concerning a possible motive for the killing was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>particularly persuasive evidence indicating that appellant was incompetent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">In addition to these various factors, appellant points out that during a pretrial hearing the court threatened to remove appellant from the courtroom for disrupting the proceedings. However, a review of the record reveals that this incident was relatively minor and was the only one of its kind during the entire course of the proceedings. Appellant also points to his willingness to speak with police as evidence indicating incompetence and/or insanity, but we are not persuaded that this in any way reflected poorly on appellant\u2019s competence to stand trial. Additionally, appellant notes that even the prosecuting attorney admitted during argument on the motion for a new trial that appellant had some \u201cmental illness.\u201d Nevertheless, the term \u201cmental illness\u201d does not necessarily equate with the definition of legal incompetency. Legal incompetency has a specific meaning as we have set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Appellant also relies upon the evidence presented during the mitigation phase as proof that he was legally incompetent. However, these matters were obviously not before the trial judge at the tim\u00e9 the issue of competency arose. Further, the mitigating evidence was offered for the sole purpose of mitigation and did not in any way indicate that appellant was incapable of understanding the nature and objective of the proceedings or of assisting in his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Reviewing the record as a whole, and carefully considering the totality of the evidence bearing on the question, we are convinced that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to order a mid-trial competency hearing. Moreover, in our judgment, the record indicates that at all times appellant knew the nature and objective of the proceedings against him and was perfectly capable of participating in his defense if and when he chose to do so. Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s third proposition of law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">In his fourth proposition of law, appellant contends that he did not receive the effective assistance of counsel \u201cdue to trial counsel\u2019s deficient and prejudicial representation for failing to bring Mr. Berry\u2019s lack of competency to the trial court\u2019s attention at the suppression hearing and prior to the beginning of the trial phase.\u201d However, we find that appellant has failed to meet his burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>establishing ineffective assistance of counsel under the standards set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Furthermore, a number of appellant's assertions in this proposition are wholly unsupported by law or fact. For instance appellant suggests that his admissions to jailers Carter and Moran and his confession to Detective Rolfsen were unconstitutionally obtained and resulted from improper coercion and overreaching. The evidence simply does not support appellant\u2019s contentions in this regard. Additionally, a number of the issues and arguments raised in this proposition of law are repetitive of the matters we addressed in our discussion in Part II, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Accordingly, appellant\u2019s fourth proposition of law is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">Having considered appellant\u2019s propositions of law, we must now review appellant\u2019s death sentence for appropriateness (also raised in appellant\u2019s first proposition of law) and proportionality (also raised in appellant\u2019s second proposition of law). Appellant planned Mitroffs death and shot Mitroff in the head during the commission of an aggravated robbery and an aggravated burglary. Again, we find that the aggravating circumstances for which appellant was found guilty, both of which are set forth in R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), were proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">In mitigation, appellant presented the testimony of a variety of witnesses. Ginny Renee Franklin, appellant\u2019s mother, testified that appellant was born in September 1962. According to Franklin, appellant\u2019s father left her and was committed to a mental hospital when appellant was an infant. During appellant\u2019s childhood, appellant suffered from a speech impediment and had trouble with his eyes. Franklin testified that appellant had a number of physical ailments as a child, including seizures and lung problems. Franklin stated that she had read books concerning the occult and had once participated in a seance. She claimed that appellant sometimes spoke of \u201cthe lady in black,\u201d and that appellant thought that this imaginary character was trying to kill him. Franklin stated that appellant, at age seven, was involved in fights with other children. On one occasion, a neighborhood boy paid other children to physically beat appellant. Franklin testified that appellant ran away from home on two occasions when he was approximately fourteen years of age. He was eventually sent to the Boys\u2019 Village, a residential treatment center for boys with severe behavior and emotional problems. Franklin told of an incident in appellant\u2019s childhood in which appellant came home one evening wearing no clothes. She also indicated that appellant may have been the victim of sexual advances by a man in the Big Brothers program. Franklin testified that appellant had once been arrested in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Texas for car theft, and that he had attempted to commit suicide while serving a sentence for that offense. Franklin also testified that sometime prior to the murder, appellant or possibly someone else had burned several marks in her kitchen floor. According to Franklin, the pattern of the marks was consistent with a symbol used in witchcraft or devil worship.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Elaine Quigley, appellant\u2019s sister, testified that her father spent time in a number of mental institutions. She stated that her father died in 1979 of an aneurysm. She testified that, according to her father\u2019s family, her father had been diagnosed at sixteen years of age with a condition causing the deterioration of the brain. Quigley also testified that appellant\u2019s speech impediment as a child was so severe that no one other than Quigley could really understand him. Quigley testified that appellant, as a child, had told her about the \u201clady in black,\u201d and that appellant claimed to have heard voices in his head. Quigley testified further that Mitroff had almost accidentally hit her with the bakery van prior to appellant\u2019s employment at the bakery. According to Quigley, she told appellant of this incident when appellant accepted the job at the bakery.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Appellant also presented the testimony of Ralph Buterbaugh, a psychologist who evaluated appellant at Boys\u2019 Village in 1978 and 1979. Appellant was fifteen years old at the time of the 1978 evaluation. The results of the 1978 evaluation indicate that appellant was a very troubled youth. In that evaluation, Buterbaugh said that appellant was \u201cseriously unstable and maladjusted.\u201d Buterbaugh testified in mitigation that he had noted in the report that appellant had \u201cschizoid symptoms\u201d and a very high hostility level. The 1978 report indicates that appellant thought that he was a condemned person with evil spirits commanding him at times. The 1978 report concludes by stating, among other things, that \u201c[t]he severity of Will\u2019s present emotional condition and his marked lack of coping skills * * * dictate a prolonged treatment period. * * * His high hostility level and strong acting-out potential is an additional danger signal that corroborates Will\u2019s mother\u2019s fear that he might someday kill someone.\u201d However, Buterbaugh\u2019s 1979 evaluation of appellant demonstrates that appellant had improved \u201cquite markedly\u201d by that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Stephen Malich, a counselor at .Boys\u2019 Village, also testified in mitigation. Malich had prepared a diagnostic profile of appellant in 1978, and concluded, at that time, that appellant had a poor self-image, resented authority figures, and perceived the world and his environment as threatening.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">Additionally, appellant presented the testimony of Dr. Goldberg, appellant\u2019s court-appointed psychologist. Goldberg had examined appellant several months before trial and found him to be suffering from \u201cconsiderable emotional disturbance.\u201d As a result of the initial tests performed on appellant, Goldberg had concluded, at that time, that appellant could be considered \u201ctechnically chronical<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>ly borderline schizoid or maybe even schizophrenic.\u201d Goldberg next tested appellant on June 21, 1990, just a few days before trial, and observed more symptoms of psychosis which were attributable to stress. Goldberg testified that appellant claimed to have been sexually molested by baby-sitters in his youth. According to Goldberg, appellant heard voices (auditory hallucinations) and believed in the supernatural. Goldberg diagnosed appellant as suffering from a \u201cpsychotic disorder not otherwise specified, a typical psychosis.\u201d Goldberg also diagnosed appellant as suffering from \u201ca personality disorder mixed with what are called schizotypal, borderline, and anti-social features.\u201d Goldberg explained to the jury that because appellant\u2019s father was mentally ill, there was \u201cprobably a genetic component\u201d to appellant\u2019s psychological problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">According to Goldberg, Quigley told him about the incident in which Mitroff had accidentally almost hit her with the delivery van. Goldberg testified that when he questioned appellant about the incident, appellant claimed that the incident \u201csingled Mr. Mitroff out\u201d as the victim. Goldberg theorized that \u201cthis killing, in part, was because, I think, he perceived Mr. Mitroff, rightly or not, I mean his perception of it was \u2014 I don\u2019t know what the man\u2019s real characteristics were, but he perceived Mr. Mitroff as another authority figure, another parent-type that just doesn\u2019t care about people, whether that was true or not.\u201d Goldberg testified that the incident provided appellant with \u201ca possible motive\u201d for the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Finally, appellant gave an unsworn statement in which he related certain events of his childhood. These events included alleged molestations by babysitters, beatings inflicted upon him by his mother, beatings suffered at the hands of other children, and his various childhood health problems. Appellant claimed that he had been raped while serving a six-year prison term in Texas. Appellant stated that he was in California during an earthquake. Appellant told of his volunteer efforts to help victims of the quake. Appellant stated that he had a mental problem and that he would not receive appropriate care in jail. He requested that the jury recommend the death penalty rather than a sentence of twenty or thirty years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Upon review of the evidence presented in mitigation, it is clear to us that appellant had a troubled and difficult childhood. We find that appellant\u2019s troubled childhood, his history of psychological problems, and his general history and background are entitled to some weight in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The nature and circumstances of the offense do not reveal any matter of mitigating value. Further, we find that appellant did not establish the existence of the R.C. 2929.04(B)(1) and (2) mitigating factors by a preponderance of the evidence. Specifically, Mitroff did not in any way induce or facilitate the murder (R.C. 2929.04[B][1]), and there exists no credible evidence indicating that appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>lant was acting under duress, coercion, or strong provocation (R.C. 2929.04[B][2]).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Appellant introduced evidence on the R.C. 2929.04(B)(3) mitigating factor that he lacked a substantial capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law because of a mental disease or defect. We find that appellant did not demonstrate the existence of this mitigating factor by a preponderance of the evidence. Goldberg diagnosed appellant as suffering from psychosis. Goldberg testified that the incident in which Mitroff allegedly almost had hit appellant\u2019s sister with the delivery van was a <em>possible </em>motive for the killing, given appellant\u2019s psychological condition. However, in our judgment, no credible evidence was presented by appellant to establish that the murder was, in fact, the product of appellant\u2019s psychological condition. Nevertheless, we find that appellant\u2019s psychosis and personality disorder testified to by Goldberg is entitled to some weight in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">We have considered the youth of the offender (appellant was twenty-seven years old at the time of the offense) and conclude that this R.C. 2929.04(B)(4) factor is entitled to no weight in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Appellant has a prior theft conviction and a juvenile record. However, we find that the R.C. 2929.04(B)(5) mitigating factor that appellant lacked a <em>significant </em>history of prior criminal convictions and delinquency adjudications is entitled to some, but very little, weight in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">The R.C. 2929.04(B)(6) mitigating factor is not applicable here, since appellant was the principal offender. Moreover, the evidence is overwhelming that appellant planned the murder, orchestrated the killing, fired the fatal shot into the victim\u2019s head, actively concealed the evidence of the murder, and then fled to escape apprehension for the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">We have considered the evidence that appellant does well in a controlled institutionalized setting, but we find that this evidence is rebutted by other evidence in the record. However, we do find that the evidence of appellant\u2019s volunteer services for victims of the California earthquake is entitled to some, but very minimal, weight in mitigation. We reject appellant\u2019s contentions that there exists some \u201cresidual doubt\u201d whether he was the principal offender; that his wish to be executed should be given some weight in mitigation; and that we should consider, as mitigation, that Lozar was given a life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">Weighing the aggravated circumstances against the evidence presented in mitigation, we find that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">As a final matter, we have undertaken a comparison of the sentence imposed in this case to those in which we have previously imposed the death penalty. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>find that appellant\u2019s death sentence is neither excessive nor disproportionate. See, <em>e.g., State v. Holloway </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 239, 527 N.E.2d 831; <em>State v. Slagle </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 597, 605 N.E.2d 916; <em>State v. Clark </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 252, 527 N.E.2d 844; and <em>State v. Bonnell </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 179, 573 N.E.2d 1082.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b479-7\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.

In this proposition, appellant suggests R.C. 2945.37(A) required that a competency hearing be held without a showing of good cause since the issue of appellant\u2019s competency was raised \u201cbefore trial,\u201d <em>ie., </em>before what appellant calls the \u201cpenalty trial.\u201d However, appellant fails to grasp that his trial was actually composed of two distinct <em>phases </em>\u2014 the guilt <em>phase </em>and the mitigation/penalty <em>phase. </em>Appellant raised the issue of competency before the commencement of the second phase of his trial. The issue was not raised \u201cbefore trial\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2945.37(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b474-9\">. In this proposition, appellant also contends that the trial court erred by finding that the motion raised by appellant prior to the commencement of the penalty phase was \u201cuntimely.\u201d Appellant correctly observes that pursuant to R.C. 2945.37(A), the issue of competency can be raised during trial. However, the trial court\u2019s comment concerning the timeliness of appellant\u2019s motion most likely dealt with appellant\u2019s request for a new trial in order to present a defense of not guilty by reason of insanity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b479-9\">Wright, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AlL\">dissenting. Some years ago I expressed the view that an individual with an intelligence quotient of a ten year old should not be subject to the death penalty. <em>State v.

Similarly, I cannot sanction the penalty of death for a person who appears to be mentally ill.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">Dr. Goldberg, a court-appointed clinical psychologist, opined that appellant was a chronically borderline schizoid and potentially schizophrenic.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This diagnosis, which appears to be undisputed, goes far beyond an opinion that would suggest emotional illness or a mere mental defect. The majority even acknowledges the seriousness of appellant\u2019s mental illness: \u201c[The] appellant\u2019s psychosis and personality disorder testified to by Goldberg is entitled to some weight in mitigation.\u201d However, the majority goes on to reach what I believe is an untenable result of affirming appellant\u2019s death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">The majority\u2019s decision to affirm appellant\u2019s death penalty is untenable in light of the fact that the Supreme Court of the United States has clearly held that execution of one who is insane violates the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution: \u201c[T]he natural abhorrence civilized societies feel at killing one who has no capacity to come to grips with his own conscience or deity is still vivid today. And the intuition that such an execution simply offends humanity is evidently shared across this Nation. Faced with such widespread evidence of a restriction upon sovereign power, this Court is compelled to conclude that the Eighth Amendment prohibits a State from carrying out a sentence of death upon a prisoner who is insane.\u201d <em>Ford v. Wainwright </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 399, 409-410, 106 S.Ct. 2595, 2602, 91 L.Ed.2d 335, 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>It is my view that appellant currently belongs in an institution for the criminally insane.

a violation of substantive and procedural due process as guaranteed by the Eighth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, as well as Article I, Sections 1, 2, 9,10,16 and

When the independent elements of principal offender and prior calculation and design in Revised Code 2929.04(A)(7) are charged and there is no separate finding as to which separate element was proven
