However, we also agree with the parties as to the sanction respondent should receive, particularly in view of the public reprimand respondent received in 1983. <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bar Assn. v. Snow </em>(May 11, 1983), D.D. No. 83-5. Thus, we order that respondent be suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for a period of six months; however, we suspend imposition of this sanction on the condition that respondent complete a two-year monitored probation, provided that during this period no disciplinary complaints against respondent are certified to the board by a probable cause panel.

I respectfully dissent. The panel that considered the case against respondent recommended that respondent receive a public reprimand.
