(See Appendix, <em>infra.) </em>We have considered appellant\u2019s propositions of law and have reviewed the death sentences for appropriateness and proportionality. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals and uphold the sentences of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">Previous cases decided by this court are dispositive of the issues raised in appellant\u2019s fifth, twentieth, twenty-third, twenty-fourth, and twenty-fifth propositions of law. Without further comment, we reject these propositions of law on authority of <em>State v. Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 520 N.E.2d 568. Likewise, we summarily reject appellant\u2019s first, third, eighth, thirteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth propositions of law since the issues raised by appellant have been addressed and discussed in a number of our prior eases. The case law governing these matters is clear, and the events at trial simply do not warrant the relief requested by this appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">With respect to appellant\u2019s remaining propositions of law, we fail to detect any errors that would undermine our confidence in the outcome of appellant\u2019s trial. We are convinced that appellant received a fair trial, competent representation, and a fair and reliable sentencing determination. Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s remaining propositions of law and address, in opinion form, only those issues that merit some discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b606-12\">Prior to trial, appellant moved to suppress the bloodstained jacket and the DNA evidence derived therefrom on the basis that the jacket had been seized without a warrant. The motion was denied. In his second proposition of law, appellant contends that the trial court committed reversible error in denying the motion. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>The facts surrounding the seizure of appellant\u2019s jacket are not in dispute. On January 12, 1989, appellant voluntarily submitted to a polygraph test at a crime lab in London, Ohio. The results of the test indicated that appellant was being deceptive. Appellant was arrested at the crime lab on outstanding traffic warrants. Appellant was then transported to the Detective Bureau at the Clark County Sheriffs Department, which is located in the same building as the county jail. Appellant was permitted to use the restroom at the Detective Bureau. Appellant removed his jacket and placed it. on a chair before entering the restroom. At that time, Sergeant (now Lieutenant) Patrick Sullivan of the Clark County Sheriffs Department noticed what appeared to be blood on appellant\u2019s jacket. Sullivan had interviewed appellant on January 10, 1989, and knew that appellant had been wearing the jacket on the day of the murders. Sullivan seized the jacket while appellant was in the restroom. Appellant was then escorted to jail where he was booked and processed on the outstanding traffic warrants. Subsequent DNA analysis of the bloodstained jacket revealed that it was highly probable that a bloodstain on the jacket had come from David Miller.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence derived from the jacket on the basis that the jacket had been properly seized pursuant to the \u201cplain view\u201d exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement. We find no abuse of discretion in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">In <em>State v. Waddy </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 424, 442, 588 N.E.2d 819, 833, this court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-8\">\u201cUnder [the plain view] doctrine, an officer may seize an item without a warrant if the initial intrusion leading to the item\u2019s discovery was lawful and it was \u2018immediately apparent\u2019 that the item was incriminating.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">With respect to the first requirement, a lawful initial intrusion, it is clear from the record that appellant was in custody pursuant to a lawful arrest at the time the jacket was seized. The police had every right to be where they were at the time the evidence was seized. Thus, there is no question that the first requirement of the test has been satisfied. Further, the record of the suppression hearing supports the trial court\u2019s determination with respect to the second requirement \u2014 that the incriminating nature of the stains on appellant\u2019s jacket was immediately apparent to the seizing authorities. Sullivan was the chief investigator of the two homicides. Sullivan knew the abusive nature of appellant and Thelma\u2019s relationship. Sullivan knew that appellant had repeatedly lied concerning his (appellant\u2019s) whereabouts at the time of the murders. Sullivan also knew that appellant was at or near the scene of the murders at the approximate time of the killings. Sullivan had viewed the crime scene and the tremendous amount of blood in the Szulewskis\u2019 garage. He had seen appellant wearing the jacket on the day of the murders, and he knew that the stains on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>jacket appeared to be blood. Under these circumstances, it is clear that the trial court had a legitimate factual basis to conclude that Sullivan was immediately aware of the incriminating nature of the bloodstained jacket at the time the item was seized.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">In any event, even if we were to assume that Sullivan had no right to seize the bloodstained jacket at the precise moment that item was taken, it is clear that the jacket would inevitably have come within the exclusive possession and control of the police when appellant was properly booked and processed at the jail. Thus, the inevitable discovery exception to the exclusionary rule seems applicable on the facts of this case. See, generally, <em>State v. Perkins </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 193, 18 OBR 259, 480 N.E.2d 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The court of appeals determined that no warrant was required for the seizure of the jacket since the item was seized as an incident to a lawful arrest. In support of this conclusion, the court of appeals relied on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Edwards </em>(1974), 415 U.S. 800, 94 S.Ct. 1234, 39 L.Ed.2d 771. We need not specifically address this issue since we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the warrant-less seizure of appellant\u2019s jacket was justified pursuant to the plain view exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s second proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">In his fourth proposition of law, appellant contends that his arrest on the outstanding traffic warrants was pretextual. Appellant suggests that police arrested him on the outstanding warrants in order to gather evidence that appellant was guilty of murder. We reject appellant\u2019s arguments for two reasons. First, appellant failed to properly raise this issue at the trial court level. Thus, the issue has been waived. Second, appellant\u2019s arguments are not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">Accordingly, appellant\u2019s fourth proposition of law is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b608-12\">In his sixth proposition of law, appellant contends that the three-judge panel erred by admitting into evidence a tape-recorded copy of Daniel Miller\u2019s January <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>8, 1989 emergency telephone call to 911. During the call, Daniel informed the emergency dispatcher that appellant and Thelma were fighting. Daniel told the dispatcher that appellant had hurt Thelma before. On the tape, appellant can be heard shouting at Thelma Miller: \u201cBitch. You\u2019re a fucking whore. Knock the fuck out of your bitch ass. (Inaudible) if I ever see your bitch ass again \u2014 I\u2019m going to fuck you up. I\u2019m going to fuck you up Misty, I (Inaudible) fucking sucks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Appellant contends that the 911 tape was highly inflammatory. According to appellant, admission of the tape introduced into evidence the \u201centire emotional atmosphere: the sound of violence, of anger in Mr. Kinley\u2019s voice, of fear in Daniel\u2019s.\u201d For this reason, appellant contends that the tape should have been excluded from evidence pursuant to Evid.R. 403 and the Ohio and United States Constitutions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Evid.R. 403(A) provides that evidence is not admissible if the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Generally, the admission of evidence is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the trial court. See <em>State v. Apanovitch </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 19, 25, 514 N.E.2d 394, 401 (\u201cA trial court has broad discretion in the admission and exclusion of evidence.\u201d). Thus, the three-judge panel\u2019s decision to admit the evidence will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">The copy of the 911 tape was played in open court during Daniel\u2019s trial testimony. Other witnesses established that the copy of the tape was a true and accurate reproduction of Daniel\u2019s emergency call to 911. Appellant\u2019s statements on the tape demonstrated the intensity of his anger and hostility toward Thelma just two days before the brutal killings. The evidence helped to establish appellant\u2019s motive and intent with respect to the killings. Appellant was possessive of Thelma and he did not want her to date other men. Upon a review of the evidence, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the recorded reproduction of Daniel\u2019s emergency call to 911. Additionally, we note that this case was tried before a three-judge panel. Thus, we presume that the panel considered only relevant, material, and competent evidence in arriving at its judgment. See, generally, <em>State v. Post </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 380, 384, 513 N.E.2d 754, 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">Appellant also suggests that Daniel\u2019s statements on the tape were not admissible at trial pursuant to the hearsay rule. However, at trial, appellant did not specifically object to the tape on the basis of the hearsay rule. Thus, appellant\u2019s argument has been waived. Moreover, we agree with the court of appeals\u2019 conclusion that \u201c[t]he statements made by Daniel Miller were clearly admissible as \u2018excited utterances\u2019 pursuant to Evid.R. 803(2).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Appellant also argues that the 911 tape recording is a record or report that does not qualify under any exception to the hearsay rule. Therefore, appellant urges that the tape itself was not admissible even if statements on the tape fall within a hearsay exception. However, we find that appellant\u2019s argument is based upon a misconception of the purpose for which the tape was offered into evidence. The tape was not offered to prove the truth of any statement or assertion contained in the recording. Rather, the tape was offered to show that appellant had threatened one of the victims a short time before the killings. Therefore, we find that the tape does not meet the definition of \u201chearsay\u201d set forth in Evid.R. 801(C).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The tape was admissible as independent evidence of the threatened acts of violence. Further, appellant has failed to demonstrate prejudice, and none will be presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s sixth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Having carefully considered each of appellant\u2019s propositions of law, we must now review the death sentences for appropriateness (also raised in appellant\u2019s twenty-first proposition of law) and proportionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Appellant hacked his victims to death while committing an aggravated robbery. We find that the R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) aggravating circumstance of which appellant was found guilty in connection with each count of aggravated (felony) murder was proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">In mitigation, appellant presented evidence concerning his history and family background. In an unsworn statement, appellant apologized to the families involved in this case. He also expressed his love for the victims. We assign these matters very little weight in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">Dr. James Eisenberg, appellant\u2019s court-appointed psychologist, testified that appellant has \u201cdifficulty conforming his conduct in a variety of circumstances.\u201d Further, Eisenberg testified that appellant is emotionally immature. According to Eisenberg, appellant\u2019s psychological history indicates that appellant suffers from a learning disability. Eisenberg diagnosed appellant as suffering from \u201ca mixed personality disorder with paranoid antisocial and explosive features.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">We assign Eisenberg\u2019s testimony some, but very minimal, weight in mitigation. We find that appellant failed to establish the existence of the R.C. 2929.04(B)(3) mitigating factor that he lacked a substantial capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law because of a mental disease or defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>We have also considered the youth of the offender (appellant was twenty-one years old at the time of the killings) and conclude that this R.C. 2929.04(B)(4) mitigating factor is entitled to some weight in mitigation. In so holding, we are persuaded by the evidence of appellant\u2019s emotional immaturity.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">Appellant also suggests that this court should consider, as mitigating, any \u201cresidual doubt\u201d of appellant\u2019s guilt. However, we have no doubt of appellant\u2019s guilt. The evidence at trial demonstrated that appellant was extremely possessive of Thelma and did not want her to date other men. Appellant regularly beat Thelma and repeatedly threatened to kill her. Appellant observed Thelma with another man just two days before the murders. At that time, appellant threatened to kill Thelma and Thelma\u2019s two children. On January 10, 1989, appellant carried through on his threats by viciously hacking his victims to death. Later, appellant admitted to his friend, Donald A. Merriman, that he had killed the victims. Money and other property were missing from the murder scene. The machete from the Szulewskis\u2019 garage was found in an alley near appellant\u2019s home. That machete was undoubtedly the weapon that appellant had used to kill his victims. Blood from one of the victims was found on appellant\u2019s jacket. Blood was found in the automobile appellant had been driving on the day of the murders. Witnesses saw appellant near the scene of the killings. Appellant eventually admitted that he had been at the location where the murders occurred. This evidence and more contained in the record establish, beyond dispute, that appellant was the perpetrator of the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">For each of the two killings, we have weighed the aggravating circumstance against the evidence presented in mitigation. We find that the aggravating circumstance outweighs the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">As a final matter, we have undertaken a comparison of the death sentences imposed in this case to those in which we have previously imposed the death penalty. We have upheld the death penalty in a number of cases involving multiple murders. See, <em>e.g., State v. Montgomery </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 410, 575 N.E.2d 167; and <em>State v. Moreland </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 58, 552 N.E.2d 894. Appellant\u2019s death sentences are neither excessive nor disproportionate.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b611-9\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.
