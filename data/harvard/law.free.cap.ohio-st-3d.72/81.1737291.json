In <em>State ex rel. Miller v. Mead Corp. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 405, 12 O.O.3d 348, 390 N.E.2d 1192, claimant suffered from a pre-existing hearing loss as the result of artillery fire he encountered during World War II. He filed a compensation claim alleging that loud noise in the machine room at his job had aggravated his pre-existing condition. We found first that claimant\u2019s disability was not the result of an \u201cinjury.\u201d In so doing, we relied on the definition of \u201cinjury\u201d employed at the time, which required a showing that the injury was not only work-related, but also accidental in the sense of being the result of a sudden mishap.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">We then held that a pre-existing disease aggravated during employment is not compensable. In so holding, we relied upon the statutory language that an occupational disease, to be compensable, must be \u201ccontracted\u201d in the course of employment. R.C. 4123.54 and 4123.68.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">Claimant contends that case law subsequent to <em>Miller, </em>particularly <em>Village v. Gen. Motors Corp. </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 129, 15 OBR 279, 472 N.E.2d 1079, and <em>Oswald v. Connor </em>(1985), 16 Ohio St.3d 38, 16 OBR 520, 476 N.E.2d 658, has effectively, if not formally, overruled <em>Miller. </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">In <em>Village, </em>we held that \u201c[a]n injury which develops gradually over time as the result of the performance of the injured worker\u2019s job-related duties is compensable under R.C. 4123.01(C).\u201d In so holding, we overruled a tortuous line of cases which suggested that an injury must be the result of a sudden mishap occurring at a particular time and place to be compensable. Included were the very cases relied upon in <em>Miller </em>to find that the claimant\u2019s disability in that case was not the result of an injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">The change in the definition of \u201cinjury,\u201d however, does not affect that portion of <em>Miller </em>which holds that a pre-existing disease aggravated during employment is not compensable. Claimant does not contend that the daily physical stresses and strains of his employment support an award under <em>Village.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>In <em>Oswald, </em>we held that \u201cdeath from a pre-existing cause and accelerated <em>by an occupational disease </em>contracted in the course of and arising out of the scope of employment, is compensable * * (Emphasis added.) This holding was simply an extension of case law decided prior to <em>Miller. </em>Prior to <em>Miller, </em>we had held that death or disability resulting from a pre-existing cause or disease and accelerated <em>by an injury, </em>in the course of and arising out of employment, is compensable. <em>Swanton v. Stringer </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 356, 71 O.O.2d 325, 328 N.E.2d 794; <em>McKee v. Elec. Auto-Lite Co. </em>(1958), 168 Ohio St. 77, 5 O.O.2d 345, 151 N.E.2d 540. After <em>Oswald, </em>claims for aggravation of a pre-existing disease are compensable only where the aggravation itself qualifies as a compensable injury or occupational disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">We are aware that substantial criticism exists concerning the \u201cbasic fallacy relating to aggravation cases * * * that the aggravation itself must, standing alone, have been able to qualify as a compensable accident or occupational disease [and that] [t]here is nothing in the statute requiring that the aggravation itself be quantitatively or qualitatively of such character as to support an award alone.\u201d 1 Larson, The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation (1990), Section 12.22, 3-440 to 3-441, fn. 60.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We need not determine, however, whether this warrants overruling <em>Miller, supra, </em>since the claimant in this case would be precluded from receiving compensation in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Even if we were to hold compensable a claim for wear-and-tear aggravation of a nonoccupational disease, the claimant would have to show that the employment contribution is legally, as well as medically, sufficient to give rise to a compensable disability. See <em>Ryan v. Connor </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 406, 409, 28 OBR 462, 465, 503 N.E.2d 1379, 1382; <em>Village, supra, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 135, 15 OBR at 284, 472 N.E.2d at 1084 (Holmes, J., concurring); 1A Larson, The Law of Workmen\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Compensation, <em>supra, </em>7-317, Section 38.83(a). This would require a showing that the workplace exertion or cumulative workplace exertions are greater than those encountered in ordinary nonemployment life.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Bison Co. v. Shubert </em>(Fla. App.1986), 494 So.2d 253; <em>Bryant v. Masters Machine Co. </em>(Me.1982), 444 A.2d 329; <em>Baker Mobiles of Florida v. O\u2019Neil </em>(Fla.App.1982), 412 So.2d 34; <em>Market Food Distributors, Inc. v. Levenson </em>(Fla.App.1980), 383 So.2d 726; <em>Geenty v. Hyster, Inc. </em>(1975), 23 Ore.App. 146, 541 P.2d 486; <em>Beck v. State </em>(1969), 184 Neb. 477, 168 N.W.2d 532; 1A Larson, The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation, <em>supra, </em>7-319 to 7-336, Sections 38.83(b) and (c), and the cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The ordinary physical stresses and strains of claimant\u2019s dental practice, as a matter of law, are no greater than those which are encountered in ordinary nonemployment life. Thus, we need not reconsider <em>Miller, supra, </em>at this time. In addition, the wear and tear caused by claimant\u2019s employment did not rise to the level of a separately compensable injury or occupational disease pursuant to <em>Oswald, Swanton </em>and <em>McKee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed for the reasons stated herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b196-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AWT\">Cook, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b195-7\">. \u201cThe ultimate test is not the initiation or precipitation of the disease itself, but whether the employment acts upon that disease or condition in such a manner as to cause disability which did not previously exist. * * * The focus * * * should [be] on the question of whether or not claimant\u2019s disability rather than his disease was causally related to his employment.\u201d <em>Perez v. Pearl-Wick Corp. </em>(1977), 56 A.D.2d 239, 392 N.Y.S.2d 496, 498. Thus, other jurisdictions have allowed aggravation claims where the aggravating daily strains of the workplace occurred over protracted periods of time. See, <em>e.g., Pawlosky v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1987), 514 Pa. 450, 525 A.2d 1204, affirming (1984), 81 Pa.Commw. 270, 473 A.2d 260; <em>Malloy v.

State Workmen\u2019s Comp. Commr. </em>(1977), 160 W.Va. 664, 236 S.E.2d 241; <em>Gales v.
