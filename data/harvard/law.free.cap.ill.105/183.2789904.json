An incorporated town, by its charter clothed with a general police power over its streets, and also with a like general power over the subject of nuisances, has the right and authority to pass an ordinance requiring a city railway company to make its railway track, located in and along any of its streets, conform to the requirements thereof, so as to enable wagons, carnages and other vehicles to pass over its track without inconvenience or danger, and to punish for a failure to do so.</syllabus><summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-10\" pgmap=\"183\">Appeal from the Appellate Court for the First District;\u2014\u25a0 heard in that court on appeal from the Criminal Court of Cook county; the Hon.

So far as the facts are concerned which were necessary to be shown in order to bring the case within the .provisions of the ordinance, we have nothing to do with them. They are conclusively settled by the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p> <p id=\"b185-6\" pgmap=\"185\">Conceding, then, as we must, the town authorities had the right to pass the ordinance, and that appellant is conclusively shown to have committed a breach of it, it follows the conviction was proper, and that the judgment of the Appellate Court should therefore be affirmed, which is accordingly done.</p> <p id=\"b185-7\" pgmap=\"185\">Judgment affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b185-8\" pgmap=\"185\">Mr. Chief Justice Scott dissenting.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
