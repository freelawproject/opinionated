Its claim of right is chiefly under a contract, under seal, made May 13, 1874, between Bowen and one Snyder, of the first part, and the Baltimore, Pittsburg and Chicago Railway Company, Illinois division, of the second part, that then being the name of defendant, its name having since been changed to its present one, under the statute of this State. By this contract the parties of the first part agreed to convey to the railway company a right of way for its railroad through section 31, township 38 north, range 15 east; also, twenty acres additional in said section 31 and in section 32, and the railway company agreed to erect on said premises and contiguous grounds, a round-house and terminal division machine, repair and car shops, the. shops to be built of first-class brick' or stone, with iron or slate roof, and- to cost $200,000. At the end of the contract, and after the attestation clause, occur these words: \u201cIt is understood that the right of way east of Stony Island avenue is to be procured free of cost to the party of the second part, except through one ten-acre tract, which is to be paid by the party of the second part, the right of way west of Stony Island avenue to be procured by the party of the second part at its own expense; and the party of the second part further agrees to locate a station between Seventy-ninth and Eighty-first streets, for local passenger trains.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-6\" pgmap=\"14\">The premises described in the body of the contract do not embrace the property in dispute, the former lying in sections 31 and 32, and the latter in section 25, but the right of way in dispute is embraced in the concluding clause, within the description, \u201ceast of Stony Island avenue,\u201d the evidence showing that these two lots, 11 and 13, upon which the right of way is, lie east of Stony Island avenue.</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-7\" pgmap=\"14(186) 15(69)\">The evidence show's this contract was- executed in Baltimore; that its terms had previously been arranged in Chicago; that the defendant, being about to locate its line of railroad from the Indiana State line into Chicago, had three lines surveyed, and marked upon a map of the county, on which map were marked the subdivisions of the lands and the owners\u2019 names,\u2014the central of which routes, as shown \u2022by the map, was the one now occupied by defendant as' a right of way through said lots. Bowen having large real estate interests in the vicinity to be affected by the location of the road, was anxious the present route should be adopted, and an agreement was made in Chicago that the road should be so located, that the road should do the things mentioned above, and Bowen should procure and give defendant certain right of- way, a portion of which was that in controversy. Bowen and Snyder then went on to Baltimore, and entered into the above contract of May 13, 1874. This contract was not recorded until December 21,1876. The deed from Bowen to Honor\u00e9, though dated May 1, 1874, was not acknowledged until May 16, and was delivered some time between then and May 19. Bowen testifies, that before selling the land to Honor\u00e9 he told him he had agreed to give the defendant the right of way across these lands, and that in buying he must let the company have the right of way across the land free of charge.</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-5\" pgmap=\"15\">On September 11, 1874, there was a partition made of the thirty acres, between the three co-tenants, and Abell took the entirety of lots 11 and 13, and the indorsement above named, of September 11, 1874, was made on the trust deed, restricting its lien to lots 11 and 13. Bowen says this was done to enable him to fulfill his agreement to give defendant the right of way; that Abell consented to the division, and that the railway track which was then upon the land should remain, and the railroad should retain its right of way across the land, to carry out Bowen\u2019s agreement to furnish the right of way, and that to induce Abell to accept this division of the land, Bowen agreed to pay a debt of $2500 from Honor\u00e9 to Abell, to secure which he says the quitclaim deed from Honor\u00e9 to Abell was made, and that that deed was not an absolute conveyance, as it purports on its face.</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-6\" pgmap=\"15\">The trust deed above mentioned, Bowen continued to hold until the winter of 1875 and 1876, when he sold the notes secured by it to the Fidelity Savings Bank, of which plaintiff was receiver. At this time John C. Haines was president of the bank, and he. was told of the defendant .being entitled to a right of way over the premises. The defendant went into possession of the premises under the contract with Bowen and Snyder, and completed the construction of its road-bed prior to September, 1874, and in that month its cars were running over the right of way, and have been ever since. It appears that the company has performed all the conditions of the contract of May 13, 1874, which were to be performed on its part. There is no contradictory evidence in the case.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b16-4\" pgmap=\"16\">Messrs.

He 'would not have a right to the possession,\u2014defendant would be lawfully in possession, having been let into the possession by Bowen, under a contract for the right of way, which has been fully performed on defendant\u2019s part. In such a case, where the defendant\u2019s possession is rightful, and the plaintiff is not wrongfully kept out of possession, it is very well settled by the decisions of this court that the action of ejectment can not be sustained. Stow v. Russell, 36 Ill. 23; Kilgour v. Gockley, 83 id. 112; Gridley v. Hopkins, 84 id. 532; St. Louis, Alton and Terre Haute R. R. Co. v. Karnes, 101 id. 403.</p> <p id=\"b18-13\" pgmap=\"18(143) 19(93)\">The. position taken by plaintiff\u2019s counsel is, that the possession of the defendant does not rest upon the written contract\u201dof May 13,1874,\u2014that its- rights rest solely upon verbal \u00a1momises of Bowen to give the right of way without consideration, amounting to no more than a parol license for a right of way, which is revocable at will. This position is based upon the assumption that the contract of May 13, 1874, does not contain any agreement to convey this right of way. It contains no such agreement in terms, but it does in effect. AYe consider such agreement to be embraced in the following words of the concluding clause of that contract, viz: \u201cIt is understood that the right of way east of Stony Island avenue is to be procured free of cost to the party of the second part, except through one ten-acre tract, which is to be paid by the party of the second part.\u201d That ten-acre tract was owned by one Saxton,.from whom defendant afterward obtained the right of way through such tract. The surrounding circumstances may be looked at in construing a contract, where there is any uncertainty of meaning. These two lots (11 and 13) lie east of Stony Island avenue. The line of the railroad had been located, and' a map made, with the line of the road marked upon it as running across these lots.</p> <p id=\"b19-5\" pgmap=\"19\">It is, then, clear enough that this provision was an undertaking by Bowen and Snyder, the parties of the first part, that they would procure' for the company, free of cost to it, this right of way, and when Bowen, who then owned the undivided third of the thirty acres upon which the right of way was located, afterward, by partition, had set off to him lots 11 and 13 as his share in severalty of the thirty acres, the right of way running through lots 11 and 13 was then on his own land solely, and by virtue of that provision in the contract for procuring the right of way, the railroad company could enforce from him a conveyance of this right of way. There was evidently no verbal promise to give the right of \u2022way, distinct from this written contract. Any verbal contract there ever may have been, was embodied in this contract afterward executed, so that thereafter there was no separate verbal promise existing. The circumstances sufficiently show this. It was, then, a written contract for the right of way, made for a valuable consideration, and not a mere verbal promise, without consideration, to give the right of way, revocable at will, under which defendant took possession and claims its right, which right is a sufficient defence as against Bowen.</p> <p id=\"b19-6\" pgmap=\"19(39) 20(220)\">Honor\u00e9 and' the Fidelity Savings Bank occupy no better position than Bowen himself. Honor\u00e9, when he purchased, was informed by Bowen that he had agreed to give the defendant the right of way across the land, which sufficiently affected Honor\u00e9 with notice of this contract. Bowen, it is true, did not mention this particular contract, but he said he had agreed to give the right of way to the company, and that in buying the land, Honor\u00e9 must allow the right of way free of charge. Honor\u00e9 had no right to take the agreement to be any other than it was,\u2014a binding contract for the right of way. Bowen\u2019s interest, to be sure, was but the undivided one-third of thirty acres; but Honor\u00e9 was bound to know that, on partition, the portion of the thirty acres upon which the right of way was located was liable to be assigned to Bowen as his share, and he took subject to that chance. The Fidelity Savings Bank was fully informed of this particular contract before it took the notes and trust deed; and besides, the company at that time was in possession of the right of way,\u2014running its cars over it,\u2014which would be constructive notice of the company\u2019s right. As to Abell, no more need be remarked than that he took, at the most, by his quitclaim deed from Honor\u00e9, but the equity of redemption, which was cut off by the foreclosure sale and deed. To that foreclosure suit, it may be observed, the railway company was not a party.</p> <p id=\"b20-6\" pgmap=\"20\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b20-7\" pgmap=\"20\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
