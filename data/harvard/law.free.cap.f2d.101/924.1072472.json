The controlling issue is whether petitioner was an \u201cassociation\u201d within the meaning of Section 1111(a) (2) of the Revenue Act of 1932, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1696(3), reading \u201cThe term \u2018corporation\u2019 includes associations, joint-stock companies, and insurance companies\u201d and, as such, taxable as a corporation. Respondent claims here that petitioner is either an \u201cassociation\u201d or a business trust, which (he claims) is equivalent to an \u201cassociation\u201d. Petitioner contends it is neither. The Board determined petitioner was not a trust but was an \u201cassociation\u201d, under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-27\">\u201cAssociation\u201d, as used in the Revenue Acts, is a general term requiring definition. The Supreme Court, this Court and other Courts of Appeals have attempted such definition in so far as necessary to dispose of the particular situation presented in each case. These definitions have taken the form of statement of certain characteristics which distinguish \u201cassociations\u201d as used in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>these Acts, and of examination of the indicia of such characteristics in the particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-4\">The most useful discussion of the subject is contained in a group of four cases decided together, of which Morrissey v. Commissioner, 296 U.S. 344, 356-361, 56 S.Ct. 289, 80 L.Ed. 263, is the main case. In that case (pages 356-360, 56 S.Ct. 289) characteristics of an \u201cassociation\u201d (as used in the statute) are that it is made up of persons associating together in a joint enterprise for the transaction of business under terms which give to the arrangement a resemblance to corporate organization in that it comprehends some of the salient features of corporate organization, such as centralized management, continuity of interests, transferability of interests and limitation of liability. <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">With the above statement of the rule of law to be applied, we turn to the facts, which are as follows. C. C. Willmore was engaged in the business of real estate and land development. He owned all of the stock ($50,-000 capital) of the Cyrus Crane Willmore Organization, Incorporated. The company was organized to conduct a general real estate business, including acquirement, holding, improvement and disposition of real estate and to execute, acquire, hold and dispose of notes, bonds and mortgages. This corporation was the agency through which Willmore operated.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">In order to acquire, improve and dispose of a certain tract of suburban real estate, Willmore conceived a plan by which he might enlist needed capital. August 17, 1928, the Wellston Hills Realty Company was organized \u2014 the above corporation (Cyrus Crane Willmore Organization, Inc.) owning all of its $5,000 capital stock. On September 11 and 13, 1928, the tract of land was bought and turned over to the Realty Company. September 15, 1928, the Wellston Hills Syndicate Fund was established by an agreement between the Realty Company, party of the first part and \u201cthe subscribers hereto collectively (hereinafter called \u2018Syndicate Subscribers\u2019), second parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">That agreement set forth that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-8\">\u201cWhereas, the Company, is the owner of a tract of land in the County of St. Louis, Missouri, to be hereafter known as \u2018Wells-ton Hills\u2019, being the property acquired by the Company from H. G. Schaefer and Zion Cemetery, the price paid therefore being $127,500.00 of which amount $42,500.00 was paid in cash at the date of the purchase, and the balance, $85,000.00 is secured by purchase money deed of trust recorded in the Recorder of Deeds\u2019 Office, St. Louis County, Missouri, said tract containing approximately 48 acres; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-12\">\u201cWhereas, the Company requires financial aid to enable it to pay for the said property and to develop and improve the same with streets, alleys, sidewalks, gutters, sewers, water, electric light, gas, etc., and to properly market the said property; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-13\">\u201cWhereas, Syndicate Subscribers have agreed to furnish such aid upon the terms and conditions hereinafter stated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-14\">To accomplish the purposes set forth, the company was to contribute $5,000 and all of the subscribers (each for the amount individually set forth) $95,000 \u201cmaking a total fund of $100,000 to be called the Wells-ton Hills Syndicate Fund.\u201d This fund was to be \u201cused by the Company\u201d, on its checks as \u201cSyndicate Manager\u201d, only for the following purposes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-15\">\u2018\u2018(a) to repay to the Company the $42,-518.00 heretofore by it paid on account of the purchase price, plus interest thereon at <em>6% </em>per annum;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-16\">\u201c(b) to pay interest accruing on the said $85,000.00 Deed of Trust; also to pay the partial releases as provided in said Deed of Trust;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-17\">\u201c(c) to pay interest accruing on such additional moneys as the Company may be compelled to borrow to pay for improvements on the said tract, and to pay installments of principal as the same become due upon such loans;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-18\">\u201c(d) to pay taxes accruing against said property; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-19\">\u201c(e) to pay the engineering fees for platting said property, to pay for the improvements to be made thereon, including streets, sidewalks, gutters, sewers, water, electric light, gas, etc., and the engineering fees thereon, certificates of title, auditors\u2019 fees, legal fees, etc.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b982-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>The Company was designated as \u201cSyndicate Manager\u201d with sole right to determine when and what improvements be made and the prices and terms at which lots be \u25a0sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">The 'fund was not usable by the Company until payments therein of the entire $100,000 and the agreement was void and refund by the Company required unless the entire amount was paid in by September 30, 1928.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">There were provisions as follows: \u25a0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-6\">\u201cThe Syndicate Subscribers shall not be regarded as partners of each other or of the Company. The Syndicate Subscribers are advancing the amount subscribed by them respectively solely to aid the Company, to enable it to finance the project, but the amounts paid in by subscribers shall not be regarded as a loan for which the Company assumes personal responsibility and said amounts are not to be repaid to the subscribers except as hereinafter stated. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-7\">\u201c3. All amounts received from the sale of lots, the cash payments as well as deferred payments, shall also be deposited to the credit of said Wellston Hills Syndicate Fund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-8\">\u201c4. Said Wellston Hills Syndicate Fund shall be used and applied as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-9\">\u201c(a) The first 25% of the sale price of each lot shall be paid to the Company out of the first cash received on account of the sale of such lot, which amount is to be paid to the Coihpany to cover salesman\u2019s commissions and other expense of selling, advertising, postage, collecting the deferred payments, keeping the accounts of the Syndicate and all clerical work and overhead expense of every description, including compensation to the Company for managing the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-10\">\u201c(b) Next, out of said Syndicate Fund the Company shall pay to the Syndicate Subscribers on account of their interest therein, a sum equal to 6% per annum of the subscription amounts which sum shall be payable in annual, semi-annual, quarterly or monthly installments as the Company may deem best.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-11\">\u201c(c) Next, out of said Syndicate Fund the Company shall pay all amounts which are to be paid out to fully pay for the property, improvements, taxes, interest, etc., as provided in paragraph 1, hereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-12\">\u201cIf the Company is compelled in any year to pay income taxes based on profits arising from the sale of Wellston Hills lots, notwithstanding the fact that such profits are to be paid by it to the Syndicate, then the taxes so assessed shall be refunded to it out of the Syndicate Fund the same as taxes against the property, that is to say, the Syndicate Fund shall in that event bear that pro-rata part of the Company\u2019s income taxes for such year as the profit resulting from sales of Wellston Hills lots bears to the total gross income of the Company for such year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-14\">\u201c(d) Distributions of Syndicate Funds shall be made to the Syndicate Subscribers whenever in the opinion of the Company funds of the Syndicate are available for said purpose, but only after sufficient funds have been set aside to guarantee the payment of all amounts when due which may then or thereafter be required to pay for improvements, taxes, interest, etc., as required under paragraph 1 hereof, and when all lots have been disposed of and all liabilities have been paid and all outstandings have been collected or disposed of, final distribution shall be made to the Syndicate Subscribers. Each Syndicate Subscriber shall be entitled to that pro rata part of the Syndicate\u2019s funds and profits which his subscription bears to the amount subscribed by all the Syndicate Subscribers.

While provision is made for payment of <em>6% </em>annually to the subscribers upon the amounts respectively advanced by each, yet the instrument carefully refrains from calling these payments interest. Such payments are from the Fund and not by the Realty Company from its general assets, All personal responsibility of the Realty Company for repayment of the advancements is expressly disavowed. Such provisions are, to say the least, quite unusual in connection with loans.</p>\n<p id=\"A1fo\">Is this an \u201cassociation\u201d within the revenuc statute as that term is defined in the Morrissey case, supra? Clearly these parties were associated together. The contract brought their money together and de~ fincd the rights of the parties. It created a fund, set forth the uses thereof, the party solely entitled to direct usage thereof, the interests of the various parties and the disposition of the fund. Also, this association of individuals was for a business undertaking. The sole inducement for participation was the hope 0f making money through the acquisition, improvement and sale of a tract 0f iaild. Thus the petitioner met the requirements of an association in the respects that it brought together various individuals in a common enterprise for business purposcs '</p>\n<p id=\"Ai_\">The question remains as to whether this association so far rcvealed simiiarity to a business corporation as t0 bring it within the statute. There was centralization of control in that the Realty Company' \u2014 the \u201cSyndicate Manager\u201d \u2014 had sole control of the Fund under the provisions and limitations set forth \u2019in the contract. There was a continuity of interests and an express disavowal of a partnership relation. There was an express limitation of liability to the amount of the respective subscriptions, There was express power of transferability of individual interests. These characteristics fit, like a glove, the analogy to a corporation declared by the Supreme Court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>be sufficient in A. A. Lewis &amp; Co. v. Commissioner, 301 U.S. 385, 388, 57 S.Ct. 799, 801, 81 L.Ed. 1174, where, in commenting on the Morrissey case, the Court said: \u201cWe pointed out that the corporate analogy was evidenced by centralized control, continuity and limited liability, as well as by the issue of transferable certificates; and we said (296 U.S. 344, at. page 356, 56 S.Ct. 289, 295, 80 L.Ed. 263) that the word \u2018association\u2019 implies associates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">We think petitioner was an \u201cassociation\u201d within the meaning of the statute and, as such, was taxable thereunder.
