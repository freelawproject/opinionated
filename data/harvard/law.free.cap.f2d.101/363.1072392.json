The trial resulted in a verdict of the jury for the plaintiff in the sum of $3,000. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>court entered judgment thereon, and from this judgment the plaintiff appeals. For cause of reversal plaintiff relies upon inadequacy of damages and certain rulings of the court made during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">We shall first consider the allegedly prejudicial rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Plaintiff complains of the trial court\u2019s \u201cexcluding the plaintiff from the court room during the progress of the trial.\u201d At the close of the direct examination of plaintiff, counsel for plaintiff called to the stand an X-ray technician who identified certain proffered exhibits. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel then offered as the next witness the plaintiff\u2019s attending physician, and thereupon the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">\u201cMr. Parsons: I was wondering if I couldn\u2019t finish my cross-examination of the plaintiff before the attending physician took the stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">\u201cMr. Irwin: That is the reason I asked the question. The doctor has office hours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-8\">\u201cMr. Parsons: That will be all right, if the plaintiff will step out of the room while he is testifying. I think there are some things about this doctor that will have some bearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-9\">. \u201cMr. Irwin: It is very Unusual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-10\">\u201cThe Court: I think it is proper under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-11\">\u201cMr. Irwin: If you require\u2014 They want you to step outside. (To plaintiff.) (Whereupon, the plaintiff left the courtroom, and the following proceedings were had):\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-12\">.. It is clear from the foregoing that the trial court did not order the plaintiff to be excluded during the examination of her attending physician; and there is no indication that such action would have been taken over plaintiff\u2019s objection. Also, if is apparent that defendant\u2019s counsel was not interested in having plaintiff \u201cstep out of the room\u201d if he were permitted to cross examine her before her physician should testify. The Judge stated that he thought it was proper for the plaintiff to step out of the courtroom \u201cunder the circumstances,\u201d but plaintiff has preserved nothing in the record to disclose to us that any \u201ccircumstances\u201d influenced the trial judge except the \u201ccircumstances\u201d suggested in the colloquy. There was no motion by defendant that the Court request the plaintiff to \u25a0\u201cstep out of the room\u201d and no objection, or exception by the plaintiff to the Court\u2019s statement that he thought it proper \u201cunder the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-14\">There is nothing in the record to present the question of the alleged error \u201cin excluding the plaintiff from the courtroom during the progress of the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-15\">Plaintiff urges that the trial court erred in each of three rulings on evidence. In one instance the trial court made no ruling since the plaintiff abandoned his question and indicated that he would substitute a hypothetical question later. In the other two instances the Court sustained defendant\u2019s objections to questions, one of which was objectionable for form and was confusing, and the other called for an answer which would have indicated that plaintiff was a passenger in the taxicab at the time of the injury. That fact was admitted and the Court so instructed the jury. No exception was taken to the Court\u2019s ruling on either objection and the failure to obtain answers to the questions could not have prejudiced plaintiff\u2019s cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-16\">In respect to the alleged inadequacy of damages the plaintiff insists that there is \u201cno dispute as to the extent of the injury and disability of the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-17\">The verdict of the jury established that the plaintiff had suffered a personal injury as a result of the negligence of the defendant. But there was substantial evidence tending to show that plaintiff\u2019s disability was due to an old arthritic condition which existed before the accident. Also, there was substantial evidence that plaintiff\u2019s physical condition could not have resulted from any injury received in the accident. The jury reasonably could have found that plaintiff\u2019s disability was only partially attributable to the injury received in the accident, or that the disability was not as great as claimed. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b420-18\">The verdict of $3,000 was one for substantial damages, not nominal; and we cannot say, as a matter of law, that such sum was inadequate compensation for all of plaintiff\u2019s damages which were caused by the negligent act of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-19\">The trial court reviewed the plaintiff\u2019s question of inadequacy of damages on the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial and decided against plaintiff\u2019s claim. The evidence affords no ground for a holding that the trial court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-20\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
