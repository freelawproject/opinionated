This appeal is from the order dismissing the petition and discharging the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"A9U\">Appellee, the National Rifle Association of America, is a nonstock corporation organized under the laws of the State of New York, and, since about 1912, has maintained its sole office in the District of Columbia. In its answer in the lower court it alleged that it was a benevolent, charitable and scientific institution incorporated under the laws of the United States and consequently that its property was exempt from taxation because of the provisions of Section 755, Title 20 of the D.C.Code, 1929 (Act of July 1, 1902, 32 Stat. 620, c. 1352, \u00a7 6, par. 10).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This contention has been abandoned on appeal and it is not necessary for us to consider it in either phase. Appellants conceded on argument that appellee is not required to file a return if its property is exempt from taxation. Whether some of appellee\u2019s property is exempt or otherwise not subject to taxation is also immaterial, in view of the nafure of the present case. If any of it is liable to taxation, appellee is obliged to make the return required by law and, in the event of its failure, may be compelled to comply.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AAt\">Appellee assumes on this appeal that appellants\u2019 demurrer admitted the conclusion, pleaded in its answer, that all its property was used for educational purposes, with the resulting necessary conclusion that such property is exempt / from taxation under Section 713, Title 20 of the D.C.Code, 1929 (Act of July 1, 1902, 32 Stat. 616, c. 1352, \u00a7 5).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But the assumption is unsound and the conclusion does not follow. The answer,' after setting out with particularity those parts of its certificate of incorporation and bylaws which disclosed its purposes, alleged: \u201c... respondent [appellee] is therefore advised ... that the property of respondent corporation is all used for \u2018educational purposes\u2019 within the meaning of T. 20, \u00a7 713 of said Code.\u201d This-is a conclusion of law as to the effect and purpose of the statute, and for that reason was not admitted by the demurrer.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Moreover, the conclusion of the pleader was not admitted by demurrer, in the present case, for a further reason, <em>i. e., </em>because it is a conclusion contrary to the specific facts alleged and from which it purports to be drawn,* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to say nothing of the purpose-revealing title of the New York Act under which appellee was incorporated, and which also appears in its answer.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is certainly not usual for societies and clubs, which are organized for social and recreative purposes, to be so engaged that all their property is used for educational purposes. The certificate of incorporation<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the bylaws <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of appellee, which are set out in its answer, list the following objects and purposes of the association: (1) to educate the youth of the nation in marksmanship; (2) to improve the marksmanship of its members; (3) to provide a suitable range or ranges in the vicinity of the City of New York; (4) to secure the issuance of arms and ammunition to those practicing on ranges; (5) to encourage competition in marksmanship between teams and individuals in all parts of the United States; (6) to promote the introduction of the system of aiming drill and rifle practice as part of the military drill of the National Guard in all the states; (7) to encourage marksmanship throughout the United States, particularly among civilians, both as a sport and for the purpose of qualifying as finished marksmen those individuals who may be called upon to serve in time of war; (8) to create a public sentiment for the encouragement of rifle practice both as a sport and as a necessary means of national defense; and (9) to encourage legislation for the establishment and maintenance of suitable ranges. On argument, appellee stated that it engaged in lobbying activities not merely to encourage legislation for the establishment and maintenance of ranges but also (10) to prevent the passage of certain legislation concerning the regulation of manufacture and distribution ol firearms.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-16\">No one of these objects and activities is necessarily or exclusively educational in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>character. The promotion, propaganda and lobbying activities implicit in the eighth, ninth and tenth are definitely not educational.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The first to seventh may be in some small measure educational ; they may. be purely for sport and recreation; they may involve promotion, propaganda and lobbying, as in the case of the eighth, ninth and tenth. It is idle to urge by way of analogy that because the officers of an educational institution or association may engage occasionally in lobbyist or propagandist activities, such an institution should be regarded in the same light as one which engages casually or incidentally or occasionally in educational activities.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It is the primary use made of the property which determines whether it is exempt. School of Domestic Arts and Science v. Carr, 322 Ill. 562, 568, 153 N.E. 669, 671.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Assuming, therefore, \u2019 solely for the purpose of argument, that the allegation concerning educational use is a conclusion of fact; reading it in connection with the particular allegations of objects and'purposes; and giving to them all the most favorable possible interpretation under the \u2018 authorities which define educational use, it is clear, in our view, that at most the educational phase of appellee\u2019s activities is incidental and collateral to the ' social, recreative, promotional and propaganda phases which constitute its major reasons for existence. It does not, therefore, in any real sense relieve the government of its burden of public education.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In fact, if appellee should succeed to any large extent in teaching the youth of the nation to shoot, without at the same time inculcating the discipline of military training, which is a fundamental part of the curriculum of colleges and. academies maintained and approved by the government to provide such training, it is much more probable that the result would be, instead, a tremendous increase in the governmental burden of crime control. Even well recognized methods of youth-training, such as physical education, when distorted and diverted from their 'legitimate uses, may cease to have educational character. And this may be true, even though such distortion and diversion occurs under the direction of educational institutions such as colleges and universities.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> No admission of performance, or even of capacity to perform the difficult task of military training, resulted from appellants\u2019 demurrer, in spite of the conclusion of law pleaded in appellee\u2019s answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-14\">For all these reasons, therefore, the necessity for governmental subsidy or immunity which is implicit in tax exemption \u2014upon the theory that the government is relieved of its burdens<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u2014 fails in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Appellee contends further that its personal property is exempt under the provisions of Section 713, Title 20 of the D. C.Code, 1929, which is the second paragraph of Section 5, Chapter 1352 of the1 Act of July 1, 1902, 32 Stat. 616. As appellee\u2019s contention that its property is all being used for educational purposes must be rejected, it is unnecessary for us to decide whether the language in question was intended to have general application to all property or whether it should be limited to real estate. In any event, it refers only to property used for educational purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"> Appellee also contends that its intangible personal property is exempt from taxation under the provisions of Section 754, Title 20 of the D.C.Code, 1929 (Act of September 1, 1916, 39 Stat. 717, c. 433, \u00a7 11, as amended),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> on the theory that it is neither a resident nor engaged in business within the District. The principle has long been settled that a corporation is a resident of the state in which it was incorporated.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As appellee was incorporated under the laws of New York, its legal residence is in that State even though its principal office is located in the District of Columbia. On the other hand, it is clear that appellee enjoys and exercises within the District the privilege of a situs <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> for carrying on its activities, whatever they may properly be called, as well as capacity to sue and he sued, to be served with process, to maintain offices and a staff of employees, to collect, expend, invest and reinvest large sums of money. However, it contends that it is not engaged in business within the meaning of the code section. It urges that its aims are like those of a chamber of commerce or club,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> even apart from the matter of educational activities; that it distributes no dividends and that its funds come from contributions of members, not from commercial relations with either the public or its own members.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">What then is the meaning of the term \u201cengaged in business\u201d as employed in the statute? Webster\u2019s Dictionary defines \u201cbusiness\u201d as \u201cAny particular occupation or employment habitually engaged in, especially for livelihood or gain.\u201d In its broadest meaning therefore one could be said to be engaged in business if it were his habit to rummage through garbage cans in search of food, after the manner of the human derelicts who may be seen thus employed on the back streets of our large cities. However, rarely do we find the term employed so broadly in statutes or cases, although the language of a Tennessee statute is not far from it, <em>i. e., </em>\u201c... \u2018any transaction with persons or any transaction concerning any property situated in this state through any agency whatever <footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">A consideration of the cases suggests extremes in meaning as follows: On the one hand, persons, associations and corporations engaged in manufacturing, trade and commerce for profit or gain, are beyond question engaged in business. On the other hand, the performance of essential governmental functions is not business within the meaning of statutes such as that here involved <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Persons or agen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>c\u00edes so occupied are not engaged in business, but instead are invested with a portion of the sovereign power which they exercise for the public benefit.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Between these two extremes it is difficult tp find universally applicable principles. The cases vary widely even in their interpretation of similar statutes. As was pointed out in Lindner Packing &amp; Provision Co. v. Industrial Comm., 99 Colo. 143, 60 P.2d 924, 106 A.L.R. 1498, two meanings have been attributed to the term, one broad and one narrow, and it is necessary to determine in each case which meaning was intended. Under particular statutes it has been held that an occupation, in order to constitute a business, must be pursued for livelihood or profit;<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> or that it shall be of a nature specified in the statute.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A7E\">On the face of the statute<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> there is nothing to indicate that Congress intended so to limit it, as to make it applicable <em>only </em>to persons, associations and corporations engaged in a commercial business for profit. This fact is significant in view of the further fact that taxing statutes frequently specify carrying on business <em>for profit </em>as a basis for taxation<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Moreover, the contrary intention appears from the fact that even as to the property of library, benevolent, charitable and scientific institutions, such property is exempt only when it belongs to such institutions as are incorporated under the laws of the United States or the District of Columbia.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AR8\">Neither is the source of its income of particular importance.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> It may be. receiving interest from an endowment fund ; it may be collecting tuition from students, dues from members, dividends from stock. Nor is it necessary that an institution should earn income or profit in order that it may be said to be carrying on business.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> It may be losing money every day; it may be rapidly approaching bankruptcy; it may be actually in the hands of a receiver and still be conducting business.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AuP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>In a number of cases it has been held that professions are not included within the term \u201ctrade or business.\u201d <footnotemark>32</footnotemark> But it is not necessary to determine that question in the present case for appellee is not engaged in a profession.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> A single or occasional disconnected act does not constitute engaging in business.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> It requires that acts of business be conducted, prosecuted and continued \u201cnot from time to time but all the time.\u201d (Lewellyn v. Pittsburgh, B. &amp; L. E. R. Co., 3 Cir., 222 F. 177, 186), or at least for a substantial portion of the time.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> But appellee\u2019s acts are continuous and uninterrupted. It has been held under particular statutes that corporations organized for social purposes, or for the general welfare of society, are not engaged in business;<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> but in other cases exactly the contrary has been held.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> And the Supreme Court of the United States has said that where a state \u2014 perhaps even in its sovereign capacity \u2014 engages in a business, <em>i. e., </em>an activity which does not constitute an essential governmental function, and even though it is not conducted for profit, but instead, for the facilitating of commerce and improving harbors, it subjects itself to regulatory action in the same manner as a private corporation. United States v. California, 297 U.S. 175, 183, 185, 56 S.Ct. 421, 80 L.Ed. 567.</p>\n<p id=\"A1u\">The term \u201cengaged in business,\u201d together with its synonyms,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> \u201ccarrying on business\u201d and \u201cdoing business,\u201d has been most frequently interpreted and defined in connection with laws taxing and regulating the activities of corporations in states other than states of residence. Here again, such statutes frequently speak in terms of business conducted for profit or gain; but, as previously noted, that limitation does not appear in the pertinent statute in the present case;<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> hence, interpretations based thereon are inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"AP6\">Another group of cases interpreting statutes relating to foreign corporations, which statutes do not contain a qualification concerning business conducted for profit or gain, hold that such corporations are engaged in business when they are engaged in the activities for which they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>were incorporated.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The present case falls properly within this group. '</p>\n<p id=\"AcUm\">Appellee collects a minimum of approximately $240,000 to $250,000 per year; expends most thereof each year in paying salaries of officers and employees, and in other respects to further the purposes set forth in the charter and by-laws. Its officers control and manage personal property in the form of office inventories, furniture and equipment, cash on hand and subject to check, securities and savings, which varies in amount from year to year and which in 1936 approximated $140,000. The handling, investment and reinvestment of these substantial funds, by what must be a considerable staff of officers, agents and employees, in onr view, dearly constitutes the carrying on of business-in the District of Columbia within the meanlnf ^e pertinent statute and the aPPllcable decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"AVe\">The Commissioners are specifically authorized to compel the filing of a sworn return by any person required by law to \u25a0 such a return.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Appellee has failed to show that it comes within any exemption provided by law,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> and the lower court erred in entering the order from which this appeal was taken,</p>\n<p id=\"Anf\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"AQd\">STEPHENS, Associate Justice, concurs in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AJR\"> Act of February 18, 1929, 45 Stat. 1227, c. 259, \u00a7 5,.
