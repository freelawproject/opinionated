United States v. Frederick Pleasants, 59 S.Ct. 281, 83 L.Ed. -, decided January 3, 1939.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Therefore, the order of the Board of Tax Appeals on this question is reversed, and the cause is remanded to it to redetermine the tax on this point in accordance with the opinion in the PleasantsCase.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
