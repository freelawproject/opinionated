On or about March 3, 1928, the petitioner acquired by purchase the majority of the capital stock of the Washington Insurance Agency and subsequently, during 1928, acquired additional stock until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>its total holdings thereof were 94 percent. At a meeting of the stockholders and directors of the Washington Insurance Agency on December 17, 1934, liquidation was formally authorized and thereafter, in the same year, its assets were sold for cash and the proceeds distributed to the stockholders. The cost to the petitioner of its stock holdings in the Washington Insurance Agency was $32,187.55. It received from the above-mentioned liquidation the sum of $5,672.56. The actual loss sustained upon the capital stock, as derived by subtracting the amount received from the liquidation from the total cost of said capital stock, was $26,514.99. The Commissioner applied to these items the provisions of \u00a7 23(j) of the Revenue Act of 1934, and in accordance therewith, it not appearing that the petitioner had any capital net gains for the year 1934, limited the deduction on account of the loss sustained to the sum of $2,000. Accordingly, he determined the deficiencies sustained by the Board of Tax Appeals as stated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Section 23(f) provides that losses sustained by corporations during the taxable year shall be allowed as deductions in computing net income. However, subsection (j) of the same section declares: \u201cLosses from sales or exchanges of capital assets shall be allowed only to the extent provided in section 117(d) [section 101 (d)].\u201d By \u00a7 117(b) \u201ccapital' assets\u201d means \u201cproperty held by the taxpayer * * and by subdivision (d) of the same section, it is provided that, \u201cLosses from sales or exchanges of capital assets shall be allowed only to the extent of $2,000 plus the gains from such sales or exchanges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Since the loss sustained by petitioner was not from the sale or exchange of the stock, it is contended that subsection (j) has-no application and that the loss is deductible in full under subdivision (f) of section 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Whether \u00a7 23(j) applies is to be answered by deciding whether, under \u00a7 115(c), stockholders\u2019 losses upon a corporate liquidation are to be treated, for purposes of computation of the tax, in the same manner as losses upon a sale or exchange of the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Section 115(c) provides: \u201cAmounts distributed in complete liquidation of a corporation shall be treated as in full payment in exchange for the stock * * *. The gain or loss to the distributee resulting from such exchange shall be determined under section 111, but shall be recognized only to the extent provided in section 112. Despite the provisions of section'117(a), 100 per centum of the gain so recognized shall be taken into account in computing net income. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">In two cases, White v. United States, 59 S.Ct. 179, 83 L.Ed. -, and Helvering v. Chester N. Weaver Co., 59 S.Ct. 185, 83 L.Ed. -, both decided December 5, 1938, the Supreme Court in construing the quoted section as it appeared in the Revenue Act of 1928 and 1932, respectively, has held that it placed stockholders\u2019 gains and losses from liquidations on the same basis as gains and losses from sales of stock. The cited cases are controlling here. The scheme of the 1934 Act, insofar as here pertinent, is similar to that of the 1928 and 1932 Acts. In the Act here under consideration, as in the earlier Acts, the ultimate reference from \u00a7 115(c) is to \u00a7 112, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 112, for \u201crecognition\u201d of gain or loss on liquidation. And it is true as to the 1934 Act, likewise as to the 1928 and 1932 Acts, that since \u00a7 115 says that the gain or loss upon liquidation is to be \u201crecognized\u201d only to the extent to which gains or losses upon sales or exchanges of property are recognized by \u00a7 112, we must look to the general provisions of the Act, as supplemented, to learn what recognition is to be given to the gains and losses upon liquidation. Since the general provisions as incorporated in \u00a7\u00a7 12, 22 and 23, 26 U.S. C.A. '\u00a7\u00a7 12, 22, 23 (as supplemented by \u00a7 117), make it evident that losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets are deductible only to a limited extent, it follows that the loss here involved is subject to the same restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-16\">Support for the conclusion that \u00a7 115(c) of the 1934 Act puts losses on liquidation on the same basis as losses on sales is found in the fact that in 1934 Congress, to prevent avoidance of surtax through liquidation of corporations with large surpluses, amended the section to provide: \u201cDespite the provisions of section 117(a), 100 per centum of the gain so recognized shall be taken into account in computing net income.\u201d See Helvering v. Chester N. Weaver Co., supra; House Report, No. 704, 73rd Cong., 2nd Sess. pp. 29-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b222-18\">GARRECHT and HANEY, Circuit Judges</author>\n<p id=\"AdA\">(concurring in result).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-19\">' The facts in this case are so nearly like those in the case of Chester N. Weaver Co. v. Commissioner, 9 Cir., 97 F.2d 31, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>upon the argument it was conceded that the determination of the case above referred to by the Supreme Court of the United States should be decisive of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">We are constrained to follow the decision of Helvering v. Chester N. Weaver Co., 59 S.Ct. 185, 83 L.Ed.-, decided December 5, 1938, and, therefore, concur in the result arrived at in the foregoing opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
