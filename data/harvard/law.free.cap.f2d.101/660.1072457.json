National Surety Company, 254 U.S. 73, 41 S.Ct. 29, 65 L.Ed. 143. There, the court said [page 30]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-7\">\u201cThe priority secured to the United States by section 3466 [31 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 191] is priority over all other creditors; that is, private persons and other public bodies. This priority the surety obtains upon discharging its obligation. But what the surety asks here is not to enj oy like priority over such other creditors, but equality with the United States, a creditor whose debt it partly secured. To accord such equality would abridge the priority expressly conferred upon the government.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">The decree is reversed with costs and with directions to accord claimant the priority provided for in subsection (7) of 64b of the Bankruptcy Act and to deny him the priority of subsection (6) of 64b.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
