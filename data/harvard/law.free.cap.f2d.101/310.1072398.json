Proceedings to sell the property were first stayed by the District Court under the provisions of the first Frazier-Lemke Act, 48 Stat. 1289. When, that Act was declared unconstitutional, the proceedings were dismissed. After the passage of the second Frazier-Lemke Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 203(s), the proceedings were reinstated and again dismissed. Thereupon, the present procfeedings in bankruptcy were instituted, so that the matter has. been before the court for a number of years.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-27\">A motion has been filed by the appelleesto dismiss the appeal on the ground that the appellants have failed to file briefs in-this court in support of the appeal; because the transcript of record was not prepared and filed within the time limited and required by law, and because the nature of 'the \u25a0 proceeding was such that the appellants were not entitled to appeal as a matter of right but only upon the order of\u2019 this court. Nevertheless, taking into consideration the claim of the appellants of their inability to employ counsel and to-prepare a brief, we have permitted the appellants to appear in proper person and1 to make extended arguments, and have examined the record filed in the case. -Upon careful consideration thereof, we are. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>of the opinion that there was no error, and that the rulings of the District Court should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
