Defendant in support of his motion to strike filed affidavits averring probable cause. The plaintiff filed an answering affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-14\">The court below took testimony in support of the defendant\u2019s affidavits. Basing its conclusion that there was probable cause upon such testimony and the affidavits, the court granted the motion to strike the complaint as sham and dismissed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-15\">The question involved is: Was it error for the trial court to strike the Plaintiff\u2019s complaint as sham?</p>\n<p id=\"b817-16\">Chapter 151 of the New Jersey Laws of 1928, R.S.N.J.1937, 2:27-124 et seq., which under the Conformity Act, 28 U.S.C. A. \u00a7 724, was applicable to the present action at the time it was before the court below, authorizes the striking out of a sham complaint. Under Rule 85 of the New <em>Jersey </em>Supreme Court the practice in such cases is the same as on a motion to strike out a sham defense. As to the latter, Rule 80 provides that \u201cthe answer may be struck out and judgment final may be entered upon motion and affidavits as hereinafter provided, unless the defendant, by affidavit or other proofs, shall show such facts as may be admitted, by the judge hearing the motion, sufficient to entitle him to defend.\u201d Under the New Jersey practice neither a complaint nor an answer is required to be verified in the first instance. It will therefore be seen that the \u2018purpose of a motion to strike for sham is to require the party against whom the motion is made to verify his pleading by a supporting affidavit controverting the facts sworn to by the moving party. This was clearly indicated by Chief Justice Brogan in Jasion v. Preferred Accident Insurance Company of New York, 113 N.J.L. 108, 172 A. 367, 369, as follows: \u201cThe affidavit challenging the answer was not contradicted or rebutted by the answering affidavit, and the pleading was properly stricken, because there was no fact in dispute for the determination of a jury. To strike out a sham or frivolous answer does not usurp the right of a jury trial. The general denial and some of the separate defenses would unquestionably have entitled the appellant to have gone to the jury on the whole case had they been supported under oath, but they were not supported, and the trial court was justified in striking them out. Cf. Eisele &amp; King v. Raphael, 90 N.J.L. 219, 101 A. 200; Wittemann v. Giele et al., 99 N.J.L. 478, 123 A. 716.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-19\">In the case before us the defendant\u2019s affidavits and testimony offered in support of the motion tended to show that the prosecution was instituted in good faith and with probable cause. Plaintiff\u2019s answering affidavit directly controverted these facts, however, and specifically supported the allegations of the complaint that their prosecution was instituted maliciously and without probable cause. This was sufficient to defeat the motion to strike the complaint since it was not for the court on that motion to determine the veracity of the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit, but merely its sufficiency, if true, to support his complaint. By proceeding to determine the validity of the defense of good faith and probable cause the court assumed a power it did not possess. The plaintiff having verified his complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>is entitled to have those defenses passed upon by a jury at the trial of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">For the reasons stated, the order of the learned court below striking the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, dismissing his cause of action, and entering final judgment in favor of the defendant, is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
