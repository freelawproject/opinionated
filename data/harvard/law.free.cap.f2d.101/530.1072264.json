He further alleged that the goods upon which appellee applies his mark are identical with the goods of appellant, that' said marks are confusingly similar, and that appellant would be damaged by the registration of appellee\u2019s mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-32\">Both parties took testimony. It is established that appellant used his trademark long prior to any use by appellee of his mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-33\">Only two questions are involved, viz., whether a dry-cleaning soap and a dry-cleaning fluid are goods of the same descriptive properties, and whether the marks of the parties are confusingly similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-34\">The testimony shows that appellee\u2019s goods are prepared ready for use by the purchasers, while appellant\u2019s goods are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>intended to be diluted with gasoline or naphtha, the resulting product being then used in a fluid state.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The Examiner of Trade-mark Interferences sustained the notice of opposition, holding that the goods of the parties to which the marks are applied are of the same descriptive properties, and that the marks are so similar that their concurrent use is likely to cause confusion and mistake in the minds of purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Upon appeal the commissioner, through his assistant, reversed the decision of the examiner and dismissed the _ opposition, holding that, while the goods of the parties are of the same descriptive properties, they are widely different in many of their essential characteristics and that, considering the difference in the marks and the difference in the goods, there is no reasonable likelihood of confusion in the concurrent use of the two marks. The assistant commissioner, in coming to this conclusion, relied largely upon our decision in Vick Chemical Co. v. Thomas Kerfoot &amp; Co., Ltd, 80 F.2d 73, 23 C.C.P.A, Patents, 752, wherein we held that the mark \u201cVapex,\u201d a]\u00a1plied to an inhalant used in the treatment o\u00ed colds, and the mark \u201cVaporub,\u201d applied to a salve for the relief of colds, were not confusingly similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Decisions of this and other courts upon the question of confusing similarity of other marks not here involved can not of course be controlling here, and are merely persuasive, for each case must be decided upon its own facts. However, the case of Langfield, etc, v. Solvit-All Corporation, 49 F.2d 480, 18 C.C.P.A, Patents, 1313, in our opinion, has a closer application to the case at bar than llie case relied upon by the assistant commissioner. The appellant in that case was the appellant here; in that ease he opposed the application for registration of the mark \u201cSolvit-All,\u201d used on sanitary solvents for cleaning, disinfecting, anddeodoriziug toilet bowls and similar articles. We there held that the goods of the parties were of the same descriptive properties, and with respect to the confusing similarity of the marks there involved we said [page 481] : \u201cThat the marks are confusingly similar is evident, and requires no discussion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">In the case at bar the goods to which the marks are applied, while not identical,, are very closely related, and, when concurrently used upon such goods, the marks \u201cSolvite\u201d and \u201cSolvoline\u201d are, in our opinion, likely to cause confusion in the minds of purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">We are in accord with the decision of the Examiner of Trade-mark Interferences, and the decision of the commissioner is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
