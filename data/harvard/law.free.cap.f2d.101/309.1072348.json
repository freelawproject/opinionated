The judgment in the District Court of dismissal for lack of jurisdiction was in accordance with the mandate, and presents no possible error. The additional order setting aside the prior proceedings in the case, while not directed by this court, was a necessary consequence of it. The District Court, having no jurisdiction, could not possibly have rendered any binding judgment. It was proper for the District Court so to declare,, and to expunge from its records the judgment improperly entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
