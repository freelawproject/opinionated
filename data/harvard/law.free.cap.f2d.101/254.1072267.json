The insurer has declined to continue compensation payments; the Deputy Commissioner has made a supplementary award against it, including a 20 per cent penalty, under Sec. 14 (f); and the District Court, at the suit of the insurer, has enjoined the enforcement of that award. The sole question on this appeal is whether expenditures for medical and similar benefits under Section 7 are to be counted in determining whether the $7,500 limit of \u201ctotal compensation\u201d fixed by Section 14 (m) has been reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-21\">Section 2 of the act, \u201cDefinitions,\u201d states in paragraph (12) that: \u201c\u2018Compensation\u2019 means the money allowance pay\u00e1ble to an employee or to his dependents as provided for in this Act, and includes funeral benefits provided therein.\u201d This seems clearly to exclude the medical benefits of Section 7. The argument for the insurer rests on the fact, which is obvious, that certain sections of the act nevertheless use the term \u201ccompensation\u201d in a sense which includes those benefits. Examples are Section 4 (a), which requires the employer to secure the payment of \u201cthe compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>payable under sections 7, 8, and 9,\u201d and Section 6 (a), which provides: \u201cNo compensation shall be allowed for the first seven days of the disability, except tire benefits provided for in section <em>7.\u201d </em>The argument proves nothing, for it is equally obvious that in certain other sections of the act, as well as in the definition, \u201ccompensation\u201d excludes medical benefits. Examples are Section 15 (a), which forbids agreements by employees to contribute to a fund for \u201cproviding compensation or medical services * * *\u201d and Section 33 (e) (1) (D), which distinguishes between \u201camounts * * * payable as compensation\u201d and \u201cthe cost of all benefits * * * to be furnished under section 7,\u201d and provides for the payment of \u201csuch compensation and the cost of such benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">We are concerned only with the meaning of \u201ccompensation\u201d in Section 14 (m). The word is there used in such a context that it can hear either sense. It would seem to follow that the statutory definition should he applied. Moreover, Section 14(j) makes provision for the discharge of an employer\u2019s liability for \u201ccompensation\u201d by the payment of \u201ca lump sum egual to the present value of future compensation payments commuted, computed at 4 per centum true discount compounded annually.\u201d This contemplates mathematical accuracy. As it is impossible accurately to forecast the cost of medical benefits, it follows that the \u201ccompensation\u201d to be commuted does not include them. And there is no reason to suppose that the word has one meaning in section 14 (j) and another in 14 (m). Both are parts of Section 14, which is headed \u201cPayment of compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">We conclude that medical and similar benefits under Section 7 are not to be counted in applying the $7,500 limit of \u201ctotal compensation\u201d in Section 14 (m). The same conclusion follows from the principle that compensation acts are to be \u201cconstrued liberally in furtherance of the purpose for which they were enacted.\u201d Baltimore &amp; Philadelphia Steamboat Co. v. Norton, 284 U.S. 408, 414, 52 S.Ct. 187, 189, 76 L.Ed. 366. We find nothing inconsistent with our views in Union Stevedoring Corp. v. Norton, 98 F.2d 1012, or Liberty Mutual Insurance Company v. Parker, D.C., 19 F.Supp. 686, which the insurer cites.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b310-22\"> 44 Stat. 1424, U.S.C.A.
