Thereafter defendant again returned such check to plaintiff and signified its intention not to perform said agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-34\">The only contested issue necessary for us to consider is whether the amended complaint states a cause of action. In doing so, consideration must be given to the exhibits referred to in the complaint, attached to and made a part of the same. Exhibit \u201cA\u201d is a letter dated June 17, 1937, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>directed by the defendant to the plaintiff, in substance suggesting to the plaintiff that defendant is the owner of an abandoned stretch of railroad track known as its Coal City branch, which it is desirous of selling, and that the plaintiff, if interested, P9iTo\\a7 Exhibit B\u201d is a letter datedJune 21 1937, directed to defendant by the plaintiff m which It is stated that plaintiff has made an inspection of such railroad track and makes a proposal to purchase the same for the sum of $10,000, and to remove, without expense to the defendant,_ all parts and track accessories appertaining to the line of railroad, enclosing with such ofer a certified check m the amount of $1,UUU as evMence of good faith. The offer provided that the balance of the purchase price would be paid upon notification of an acceptance , i, F \u2122 \u201e . . , i, . .. of the proposal. The letter stated that it F , j . . , , was a dull season for the plaintiff and urged a reasonably quick decision in regard to the offer. The letter specifically stated \u201cin view o'f the fact that we have tendered you our herein enclosed certified check we must ask that our offer be given some final answer on or before Monday, June 28, 1937.\u201d Exhibit \u201cC\u201d is a letter dated August 17, 1937, from the defendant to the plaintiff returning the $1,000 certified check.</p>\n<p id=\"A7g\">As appears from its amended bill of complaint, it is the theory of the plaintiff that there was an implied acceptance of plaintiff\u2019s offer. The allegation in this respect is, \u201cAfter June 28, 1937, the defendant in \u2018divers ways, by its acts, statements and conduct respecting plaintiff\u2019s offer and by continuing to retain said check for an unreasonable length of time thereafter, accepted the offer to purchase made by plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d While a motion to dismiss undoubtedly admits that which is well pleaded, it is evident that \u201cin divers ways, by its acts, statements and conduct respecting plaintiff\u2019s offer,\u201d is a mere conclusion of the pleader which is not admitted by such motion. Miller v. City of Chicago, 348 Ill. 34, 39, 180 N.E. 627. So there remains to be considered only the allegation that the defendant \u201cby continuing to retain said check for an unreasonable time thereafter, accepted the offer- to purchase made by plaintiff.\u201d While it is difficult to determine from plaintiff\u2019s argument just what its theory is with reference to the time when its offer was accepted, we think, from the allegation of the complaint, that the acceptance, if such it be, must be held to have been made subsequent to June 28, 1937. In fact, it could not be implied logically that any acceptance took place prior to that date for the reason that the plaintiff, in its offer, expressly gave to the defendant up until that date to make reply to the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"AKA\">Nor do we think there could be any acceptance of plaintiffs offer after June 28th, either impliedly or otherwise. In fact, after the date there was no offer remaining which defendant could have accepted. Plaintiff had, in its offer, expressly limited the time within which an acceptance could be made. After that time plaintiff was no longer bound by its offer eyen if tbe defendant had expressly accepted, such acceptance could have been binding <em>upon the p</em>laintiff. The situation was no <em>different </em>than what it would bave been had plaintiff, on June 28, notified the defendant tha<em>t </em>its offer was withdrawn,</p>\n<p id=\"Aog\">In Waterman v. Banks, 144 U.S. 394, on page 402, 12 S.Ct. 646, on page 648, 36 L.Ed. 479, the rule is thus stated: \u201cThere can be no question but that when an offer is made for a time limited 'in the offer itself, no acceptance afterwards will make it binding. Any offer without consideration may be withdrawn at any time before acceptance; and an offer which, in its terms, Hmite the time of acceptance is withdrawn by the expiration of the time,</p>\n<p id=\"A5R\">In Maclay v. Harvey, 90 Ill. 525, on Page 528, 32 Am.Rep. 35, the court gives-its approval to the rule as follows: \u201cWhere an individual makes an offer by post, stipulating for, or by the nature of the business having the right to expect, an answer by return of post, the offer can only endure for a limited time, and the making of it is accompanied by an implied stipulati\u00b0n that the answer shall be sent' by return of post. If that implied stipulation is not satisfied, the person making the offer is-released from it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A7z\">Here the court held that the person making the offer by mail was released because the offer was not accepted by return mail, it being the theory, under the circumstances-there presented, that that constituted a reasonable time. It would seem the rule would apply with even greater force in 'the instant situation, where the offer definitely fixed a date limiting -the time of acceptance. Under the situation thus presented, we think the enclosure of the certified check did not alter\u2019 the legal rights of the parties. That was entirely a voluntary act on the part of the plaintiff and did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number><em>not extend the time </em>of the offer from that expressly stated and its retention by the defendant, under such circumstances, could not obligate the defendant to the acceptance of an offer, which, by its very terms, had ceased to exist. After that date plaintiff had a right to demand and obtain a return of its check given in connection with its offer to purchase, which by its own terms was no longer in existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
