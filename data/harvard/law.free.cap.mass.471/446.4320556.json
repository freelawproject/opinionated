Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>429 Mass. 798, 801 (1999) <em>(General Electric), </em>we held that \u201cmaterials privileged as work product ... are not protected from disclosure under the public records statute unless those materials fall within the scope of an express statutory exemption.\u201d We noted that there is not an express statutory exemption for work product and rejected the claim that work product is protected from disclosure by an implied exemption. See <em>id. </em>at 801-806. In <em>General Electric, </em>the parties were not yet in litigation, so the work product was sought under the public records act rather than in discovery. And in <em>General Electric </em>we did not reach the issue whether the work product would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>protected from disclosure under the \u201cpolicy deliberation\u201d exemption, G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth <em>(d), </em>known as exemption <em>(d). </em>Here, the parties are in litigation, and the work product in the possession of the city of New Bedford (city) was sought in discovery. We now revisit our holding in <em>General Electric </em>and explore the scope of the \u201cpolicy deliberation\u201d exemption in the context of work product sought in discovery from a municipality during litigation. We conclude that \u201copinion\u201d work product that, as codified in Mass. R. Civ. R 26 (b) (3), 365 Mass. 772 (1974), was \u201cprepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for [a] party or . . . that. . . party\u2019s representative\u201d falls within the scope of exemption <em>(d) </em>and therefore falls outside the definition of \u201cpublic records\u201d under G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth. We also conclude that \u201cfact\u201d work product under Mass. R. Civ. P. 26 (b) (3) that was prepared in anticipation of litigation or trial falls within the scope of exemption <em>(d), </em>and therefore falls outside the definition of \u201cpublic records,\u201d where it is not a reasonably completed study or report or, if it is reasonably completed, where it is interwoven with opinions or analysis leading to opinions. Where work product is exempted from disclosure under the public records act, it is protected from disclosure in discovery to the extent provided by Mass. R. Civ. P. 26.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\"><em>Background. </em>The case underlying this appeal concerns liability for the costs of environmental cleanup of widespread soil contamination at and around a site that the city allegedly operated until the 1970s as an unrestricted ash dump for industrial and other waste (site). In October, 2008, property owners from a neighborhood around the site filed a civil action in the Superior Court against the city bringing common-law claims and a claim under G. L. c. 21E<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> seeking damages arising from the soil contamination. In December, 2009, the city filed a third-party com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>plaint alleging common-law claims and cost recovery claims under G. L. c. 21E against various third-party defendants. After the original complaint was filed and before the city filed its third-party complaint, the city solicitor, on behalf of the city, retained Andrew Smyth, a consultant at TRC Environmental Corporation (TRC), to evaluate the issues related to the claims in the civil action and to identify sources of the contamination that may be legally responsible to pay for the cleanup.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Smyth provided his services directly to the city solicitor in connection with the litigation pending against the city.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">During the course of discovery, various third-party defendants moved to strike the city\u2019s privilege and work product objections to TRC documents and to compel their production.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The third-party defendants asked, as part of the relief requested, that the city be compelled to produce documents that Smyth had prepared for the city, including two letters to the city solicitor and a fifty-two-page \u201cevaluation report,\u201d described as a draft, regarding the sources and occurrence of soil contamination in the relevant area of the city (collectively, TRC work product). The city responded that the TRC work product was protected from discovery by the attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine. The motion judge rejected the city\u2019s claim of attorney-client privilege. The judge also rejected the city\u2019s contention that the documents were protected from disclosure under the work product doctrine codified in Mass. R. Civ. R 26 (b) (3), even though he found that the documents contained \u201cinformation which was intended to assist the city solicitor in advising the [cjity as to the potential litigation.\u201d Citing <em>General Electric, </em>the judge concluded that the TRC work product, having been received by the city solicitor, constituted \u201cpublic records\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>sixth, and therefore was subject to discovery unless it fit \u201cwithin an enumerated exception.\u201d Because there is no enumerated exception for work product, and because the documents were not protected by the attorney-client privilege, the judge allowed the third-party defendants\u2019 motion, and ordered that the work product be produced. The judge noted that \u201cbut for the public records law, said materials would clearly constitute attorney work product, and would be subject to a heightened standard for disclosure as codified in Mass. R. Civ. R 26 (b) (3).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Following the ruling, the city moved for a protective order to preclude the third-party defendants from inquiring into the TRC work product at a deposition. The judge construed the motion as seeking a stay of the court\u2019s order, and allowed the motion to give the city an opportunity to file an interlocutory appeal. The city petitioned a single justice of the Appeals Court for interlocutory review, and the single justice allowed the petition and reported it to a full panel of the Appeals Court. We granted direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">On appeal, the city claims that the court should exercise its inherent authority to rule that the TRC work product, even if it consists of \u201cpublic records,\u201d should be protected from discovery during pending litigation by the work product doctrine codified in Mass. R. Civ. R 26 (b) (3). The city also argues that these documents are not \u201cpublic records\u201d because they are protected from public disclosure by the \u201cpolicy deliberation\u201d exemption in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth <em>(cl). </em>Finally, the city argues that the TRC work product is protected from disclosure by the so-called derivative attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Work product. </em>We begin our analysis by discussing the public records law. Under the public records act, G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10 (act), \u201c[ejvery person having custody of any public record, as defined in [G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth], shall, . . . without unreasonable delay, permit it, or any segregable portion of a record which is an independent public record, to be inspected and examined by any person . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10 <em>(a). </em>\u201cPublic records,\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth, includes \u201call . . . documentary materials or data . . . made or received by any officer or employee\u201d of any agency, office, or authority of State or local government, unless such records fall within one of twenty exemptions. Exemption <em>(d), </em>the so-called \u201cpolicy deliberation\u201d exemption, protects from public disclosure \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters relating to policy positions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>being developed by the agency; but . . . shall not apply to reasonably completed factual studies or reports on which the development of such policy positions has been or may be based.\u201d G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth <em>(d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">In <em>General Electric, </em>429 Mass. at 799, we \u201cconsidered] . . . whether a governmental entity subject to the [act] . . . may withhold from public disclosure documents and other records on the basis of an implied exemption for materials covered by the work product doctrine.\u201d When the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) withheld a set of documents in response to a public records request, General Electric commenced an action in the Superior Court under G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10 <em>(b), </em>seeking disclosure of the withheld documents, and the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. See <em>id. </em>at 799-800. The judge allowed DEP\u2019s motion, \u201cconcluding that because the [act] should not be read as an implicit legislative abrogation of well-established legal doctrines, work product enjoys an implied exemption from disclosure under the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 800-801. We disagreed, concluding that work product as defined in Mass. R. Civ. P. 26 (b) (3) is \u201cnot protected from disclosure under the [act] unless those materials fall within the scope of an express statutory exemption.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">In support of this conclusion, we noted the broad scope of the act and its definition of \u201cpublic records.\u201d See <em>id. </em>We also noted that the act specifically declares that, in any court proceeding challenging the withholding of a requested document, \u201cthere shall be a presumption that the record sought is public, and the burden shall be upon the custodian to prove with specificity the exemption which applies.\u201d G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10 (c). See <em>General Electric, </em>429 Mass. at 801. We determined that \u201cthe statute\u2019s clear and unambiguous language mandates disclosure of requested public records limited only by the definition of public record found in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 802. In short, we determined that the only exemptions in the act are those identified in the act, and refused to imply any exemption from disclosure.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>We further noted that the act was modeled on the Federal Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (2012) (FOIA), which contains an exemption protecting from disclosure \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency memorand[a] or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(5). See <em>General Electric, </em>429 Mass. at 803-804. The comparable exemption in the act, exemption (&lt;i), excluded from public disclosure \u201cinter-agency or intraagency memoranda or letters relating to policy positions being developed by the agency,\u201d and does not expressly exclude internal memoranda or letters that would not be available to a party in litigation with the agency. G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth <em>(d). </em>We concluded that the \u201cdifferences between the two statutes reflect a conscious decision by the Legislature to deviate from the standard embodied in the Federal statute concerning the disclosure of [attorney work product].\u201d <em>General Electric, supra </em>at 804, quoting <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>388 Mass. 427, 433 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Having concluded that the act includes no implied exemption for documents within the common-law work product doctrine, we vacated that part of the judgment that allowed the DEP to withhold documents under such an implied exemption, but affirmed that part of the judgment that authorized DEP to withhold documents if they met the requirements of the \u201cpolicy deliberation\u201d exemption in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth <em>(d). General Electric, </em>429 Mass. at 807. We did not address the scope of this exemption, or whether it may protect from disclosure all or some of the documents that had been withheld under the common-law work product doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Today, we revisit the reasoning and holding in <em>General Electric. </em>We note that this appeal comes to us in a different posture from <em>General Electric, </em>in that it is not an appeal under the act from a judge\u2019s decision regarding a public records request but, rather, an interlocutory appeal from a judge\u2019s allowance of dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>covery of work product in a pending lawsuit.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We also note that the judge appeared to understand <em>General Electric </em>to hold that work product otherwise protected from disclosure in litigation under Mass. R. Civ. R 26 (b) (3) is not protected where it is received by a public employee. The judge\u2019s decision did not address whether the reports at issue fall within exemption <em>(d) </em>of the act and for that reason are not public records under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">We no longer hold to the view declared in <em>General Electric </em>that there are no implied exemptions to the public records act, and that all records in the possession of a governmental entity must be disclosed under the act unless they fall within one of the exemptions identified in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth. In <em>Suffolk Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Division of Capital Asset Mgt., </em>449 Mass. 444, 445-446, 455-461 (2007), we concluded that communications within the attorney-client privilege are impliedly exempt from the definition of \u201cpublic records\u201d and therefore are protected from public disclosure under the act. We declared that \u201cthe attorney-client privilege is a fundamental component of the administration of justice,\u201d and that withdrawal of the privilege is \u201cnot required by tire plain terms of the public records law\u201d and would \u201cseverely inhibit the ability of government officials to obtain quality legal advice essential to the faithful discharge of their duties, place public entities at an unfair disadvantage vis-a-vis private parties with whom they transact business and for whom the attorney-client privilege is all but inviolable, and impede the public\u2019s strong in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>terest in the fair and effective administration of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Later, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fremont Inv. &amp; Loan, </em>459 Mass. 209, 211-216 (2011), we determined that documents that had been provided in discovery by a defendant to the Attorney General in an enforcement action and were protected from disclosure to others by a protective order were not subject to disclosure under the act. In response to the argument that such records, once received by the Attorney General, were not excluded from the act by any exemption, we stated that the argument was \u201cbased on the mistaken premise that all documents in the hands of public officials must, absent an applicable exception, be made public notwithstanding a court order prohibiting their circulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 215. We noted that the issuance of such protective orders is among the \u201cinherent powers\u201d of a court, and that such orders \u201cserve to shield litigants and third parties from unwarranted disclosures, and, as a practical matter, to facilitate the discovery necessary for a trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 213-214. We also noted that the act \u201cis silent on the issue of protective orders,\u201d and that, \u201cas a matter of statutory construction,\u201d we did not believe that \u201cthe Legislature would endeavor to effect such a significant change to a long-standing and fundamental power of the judiciary by implication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 215. In essence, we declared an implied exemption for records whose disclosure is limited by a court\u2019s protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Before considering whether an implied exemption for work product otherwise protected in discovery under Mass. R. Civ. R 26 (b) (3) might be necessary to preserve the fair administration of justice, we consider whether some or all such work product might be protected from disclosure under the act by the \u201cpolicy deliberation\u201d exemption in Twenty-sixth <em>(d).</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We reject the suggestion that the Legislature, in crafting the exemptions under the act, intended that all such work product would be public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>records under the act and therefore would be available to the public upon request. In <em>General Electric, </em>we concluded that the Legislature did not intend a separate, implied exemption for work product; we did <em>not </em>conclude that all work product would be outside the scope of other express exemptions. In fact, we specifically affirmed \u201cthat part of the judgment declaring that [DEP] \u2018may withhold documents requested under G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10 . . . if they meet the requirements of G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, [Twenty-sixth] <em>(d).\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>General Electric, </em>429 Mass. at 807.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The holding in <em>General Electric </em>was concisely summarized in the <em>Suffolk Construction </em>decision: \u201cWe concluded, in relevant part, that the [act] and its history expressed the Legislature\u2019s intent to abrogate the broad attorney work-product privilege, and instead to provide to attorney work product the narrower, time-limited protection afforded under G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth <em>(d) . . . </em>.\u201d <em>Suffolk Constr. Co., </em>449 Mass. at 455, citing <em>General Electric, supra </em>at 802-804.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">In discerning legislative intent, we recognize the importance of the difference in language that we identified in <em>General Electric </em>between exemption <em>(d) </em>and its Federal FOIA counterpart, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(5), but to understand the significance of those differences, we must look to the governing interpretation of FOIA exemption (5) in 1973, when exemption <em>(d) </em>was enacted. In <em>Environmental Protection Agency </em>v. <em>Mink, </em>410 U.S. 73, 85-94 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>(1973) <em>(Mink), </em>the United States Supreme Court interpreted the rather bare-bones language of exemption (5), which exempts from disclosure \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency memorand[a] or letters which would not be available by law to a party ... in litigation with the agency.\u201d The Court declared that the legislative history of exemption (5) demonstrates that it was \u201cintended to incorporate generally the recognized rule that \u2018confidential intraagency advisory opinions ... are privileged from inspection\u2019 \u201d in order to further the public policy of \u201copen, frank discussion between subordinate and chief concerning administrative action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 86-87, quoting <em>Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chem. Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>141 Ct. Cl. 38, 48-49 (1958). The Court quoted the following passage from the report of the Senate committee that drafted the legislation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">\u201cIt was pointed out in the comments of many of the agencies that it would be impossible to have any frank discussion of legal or policy matters in writing if all such writings were to be subjected to public scrutiny. It was argued, and with merit, that efficiency of Government would be greatly hampered if, with respect to legal and policy matters, all Government agencies were prematurely forced to \u2018operate in a fishbowl.\u2019 The committee is convinced of the merits of this general proposition, but it has attempted to delimit the exception as narrowly as consistent with efficient Government operation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-6\"><em>Mink, supra </em>at 87, quoting S. Rep. No. 813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 9 (1965). The Court noted the difficulty of attempting to ascertain in the absence of litigation whether documents would be available in discovery, where \u201cwe do not know whether the Government is to be treated as though it were a prosecutor, a civil plaintiff, or a defendant.\u201d <em>Mink, supra </em>at 86. And, distinguishing \u201cmatters of law, policy, or opinion\u201d from \u201cpurely factual material,\u201d the Court stated that, \u201cin the absence of a claim that disclosure would jeopardize state secrets,... memoranda consisting only of compiled factual material or purely factual material contained in deliberative memoranda and severable from its context would generally be available for discovery by private parties in litigation with the Government\u201d and would not be protected by exemption (5) (citation omitted). <em>Id. </em>at 87-89, 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Later that year, when the Massachusetts Legislature was crafting the act, it made clear from the language of exemption <em>{d) </em>that it protected documents \u201crelating to policy positions being devel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>oped by the agency,\u201d but did not protect \u201creasonably completed factual studies or reports on which the development of such policy positions has been or may be based.\u201d G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth <em>(d). </em>In short, although the legislative history is silent on this point, the Legislature avoided the difficulty of ascertaining in the absence of litigation what might be discoverable by omitting the litigation language in FOIA exemption (5), and the Legislature added language clarifying the focus on the formulation of policy that was only implied by the language in FOIA exemption (5), and expressly incorporated the understanding stated in <em>Mink </em>regarding purely factual material.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The word \u201cpolicy\u201d is not defined in the act, but we discern from the language of exemption <em>(d) </em>of the act and from the historical context of its enactment that the word was intended to be defined broadly to accomplish the purpose it shares with exemption (5) of FOIA: the protection of open, frank inter-agency and intraagency deliberations regarding government decisions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Compare <em>General Electric, </em>429 Mass. at 807 (\u201cThe purpose of exemption <em>[d\\ </em>is to foster independent discussions between those responsible for a governmental decision in order to secure the quality of the decision\u201d), with <em>National Labor Relations Bd. </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>421 U.S. 132, 150 (1975), quoting S. Rep. No. 813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 9 (1965), and <em>Carl Zeiss Stiftung </em>v. <em>V.E.B. Carl Zeiss, Jena, </em>40 F.R.D. 318, 324 (D.D.C. 1966) (\u201cthe \u2018frank discussion of legal or policy matters\u2019 in writing might be inhibited if the discussion were made public; and ... the \u2018decisions\u2019 and \u2018policies [... ] formulated\u2019 would be the poorer as a result\u201d). And where FOIA incorporates within its scope the Federal common-law \u201cdeliberative process privilege,\u201d we think that a parallel protection from disclosure under the public records statute was codified by the \u201cpolicy deliberation\u201d exemption in Twenty-sixth <em>(d). </em>See, e.g., <em>National Council of La Raza </em>v. <em>Department of Justice, </em>411 F.3d 350, 356 (2d Cir. 2005), quoting <em>Grand Cent.

See <em>Bobkoski </em>v. <em>Board of Educ. of Cary Consol. Sch. Dist. 26, </em>141 F.R.D. 88, 92-93 (N.D. Ill. 1992) (\u201ctrial related strategy discussions necessarily involve a governmental entity\u2019s deliberative process whereby the entity\u2019s members review and select among various options presented,\u201d and \u201cthe value of such strategic discussions depends upon the open and frank recommendations and opinions that the deliberative process privilege attempts to foster\u201d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> If anything, the need for nondisclosure of materials relating to the government\u2019s preparation for litigation is even greater than the need for nondisclosure of deliberative materials in other contexts, because litigation is an adversarial process, where the disclosure of these materials might be used to the detriment of the government by its litigation adversary. See <em>National Council of La Raza, </em>411 F.3d at 356, quoting <em>Department of Interior </em>v. <em>Klamath Water Users Protective Ass\u2019n, </em>532 U.S. 1, 8-9 (2001) (Klamath) (\u201cdeliberative process privilege .. . is based on \u2018the obvious realization that officials will not communicate candidly among themselves if each remark is a potential item of discovery\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">In describing the scope of exemption <em>(d) </em>as it applies to litigation-related work product, it makes sense to apply the work product terminology we apply in discovery during civil litigation under Mass. R. Civ. R 26. We have recognized that there are two categories of work product under rule 26: fact work product and opinion work product. See <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Comcast Corp., </em>453 Mass. 293, 314 (2009) <em>(Comcast). </em>Under rule 26 (b) (3), \u201c[t]he protection [for work product] is qualified, and can be overcome if the party seeking discovery demonstrates \u2018substantial need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>of the materials\u2019 and that it is \u2018unable without undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by other means.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting Mass. R. Civ. R 26 (b) (3). Opinion work product, which is described in rule 26 (b) (3) as \u201cthe mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an attorney or other representative of a party concerning the litigation,\u201d is \u201cafforded greater protection than \u2018fact\u2019 work product.\u201d <em>Com-cast, supra. </em>We have yet to decide whether the protection of opinion work product is absolute, see <em>id. </em>at 315, \u201cbut at a minimum ... a highly persuasive showing\u201d is needed to justify the disclosure of opinion work product. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Adlman, </em>134 F.3d 1194, 1204 (2d Cir. 1998). See <em>Comcast, supra, </em>quoting Reporters\u2019 Notes to Rule 26, Mass. Ann. Laws Court Rules, Rules of Civil Procedure, at 545 (LexisNexis 2008) (disclosure of opinion work product might be appropriate \u201conly in rare or \u2018extremely unusual\u2019 circumstances\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Opinion work product sought in anticipation of or during the pendency of litigation is related to \u201cpolicy positions being developed by the agency\u201d and therefore is protected from disclosure by exemption <em>(d). </em>Therefore, a litigant should not succeed in obtaining opinion work product that would be protected from discovery by rule 26 (b) (3) by seeking the opinion work product through a public records request.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Fact work product is not protected from disclosure under exemption <em>(d), </em>even if related to policy positions being developed by the agency, if it is a \u201creasonably completed factual stud[y] or report[ ] on which the development of such policy positions has been or may be based.\u201d G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth <em>(d). </em>Where fact work product is not contained within a \u201cfactual study or report,\u201d or where it is contained in a \u201cfactual study or report\u201d that is not \u201creasonably completed,\u201d then it, too, is protected from disclosure, at least until the study or report is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>reasonably completed. Moreover, where a factual study or report is reasonably completed but is interwoven with opinions or with analysis leading to opinions, a purely factual section of the report might fall outside exemption <em>(d), </em>but a discussion or analysis section interwoven with facts would be protected from disclosure.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Under this analysis, exemption <em>(d) </em>would permit a litigant to obtain more documents through a public records request, at least with respect to fact work product, than would be subject to discovery under rule 26. See <em>Suffolk Constr. Co., </em>449 Mass. at 455. See also <em>Judicial Watch, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 366, 372 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (\u201cthe [deliberative process] privilege and the [attorney work product] doctrine are not coterminous in their sweep\u201d). We do not believe that this result is so inconsistent with the administration of justice that we should imply an exemption for work product under the act coterminous with the sweep of Mass. R. Civ. R 26 (b) (3), and depart from our refusal to do so in <em>General Electric. </em>Where opinion work product and some fact work product are already protected under exemption <em>(d), </em>where fact work product receives only qualified protection under rule 26 (b) (3), and where the Legislature specifically excluded from the scope of exemption <em>(d) </em>\u201creasonably completed factual studies or reports,\u201d the disclosure of fact work product that falls outside the scope of exemption <em>(d) </em>does not so interfere with the inherent power of the judiciary to ensure the fair disposition of cases that we must imply such an exemption. Cf. <em>Fremont Inv. &amp; Loan, </em>459 Mass. at 213-214. Nor does it so interfere with the fair administration of justice that we can reasonably infer that the Legislature did not intend to require such disclosure. Cf. <em>Suffolk Constr. Co., </em>449 Mass. at 457-461.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Finally, we conclude that the administration of justice is better served by requiring a public agency to disclose in discovery any requested fact work product that would be disclosed pursuant to a public records act request \u2014 even if it would otherwise be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>protected under rule 26 (b) (3) were it not a public record \u2014 rather than requiring the litigant to make a public records act request for these same documents. See <em>Babets </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Executive Office of Human Servs., </em>403 Mass. 230, 237 n.8 (1988), citing <em>Bougas </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Lexington, </em>371 Mass. 59, 64 (1976) (\u201cIt arguably would be anomalous if access to [public records], intended to be available even to the merely \u2018idly curious,\u2019 should be denied to those who, like the plaintiffs here, have a specific and demonstrable need for them\u201d); <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Bache Halsey Stuart Shields, Inc., </em>738 F.2d 1336, 1344 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (FOIA \u201cacts as a \u2018floor\u2019 when discovery of government documents is sought in the course of civil litigation,\u201d such that \u201cinformation available under the FOIA is likely to be available through discovery\u201d). We recognize that this might require the judge in the underlying litigation to determine the scope of exemption <em>(d) </em>in resolving a discovery dispute, but a judge might have been asked to make the same determination if a litigant who made a public records act request appealed the denial of that request by a custodian of public records under G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10 (6). The difference is that it would likely take far longer to resolve the appeal of the public records request denial than it would to resolve a discovery dispute, and the appeal might not be decided before the underlying litigation is concluded. Where work product is protected from disclosure under the act by exemption <em>(d), </em>it must be treated like any other work product under rule 26 (b) (3), and would be subject to disclosure only upon the showing of need set forth in that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">In the case on appeal, the judge concluded that the documents at issue \u201cclearly constitute attorney work product\u201d under rule 26 (b) (3), and would be \u201cpublic records\u201d unless they fit within one of the enumerated exemptions, but did not address whether the work product is protected from disclosure by exemption <em>(d). </em>We conclude that the judge erred in failing to consider whether the documents at issue are protected from disclosure by exemption <em>(d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">We also consider the third-party defendants\u2019 argument that the documents could not be protected by exemption <em>(d) </em>because reports, letters, or memoranda written by an outside consultant to the city cannot be \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters\u201d as required by exemption <em>(d). </em>Where a memorandum or letter received by the government was prepared at the government\u2019s request by a consultant hired by the government to assist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>it in the performance of its own functions, it is both \u201ctextually possible\u201d and \u201cin accord with the purpose\u201d of exemption <em>(d) </em>to regard the document as an \u201cintra-agency\u201d memorandum or letter. <em>Klamath, </em>532 U.S. at 9-10, quoting <em>Department of Justice </em>v. <em>Julian, </em>486 U.S. 1, 18 n.l (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (interpreting language in exemption [5] of FOIA). There is no reason to require the disclosure of such documents simply because they were prepared by an outside consultant temporarily hired by the government rather than by a public employee. See <em>Soucie </em>v. <em>David, </em>448 F.2d 1067, 1077-1078 &amp; n.44 (D.C. Cir. 1971) (report prepared for government by consultant was not necessarily outside scope of FOIA exemption for \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency memorand[a] or letters,\u201d because \u201c[t]he [government may have a special need for the opinions and recommendations of temporary consultants, and those individuals should be able to give their judgments freely without fear of publicity\u201d); <em>Xerox Corp. </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>65 N.Y.2d 131, 133 (1985) (\u201cIt would make little sense to protect the deliberative process when . . . reports are prepared by agency employees yet deny this protection when reports are prepared for the same purpose by outside consultants retained by agencies\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that the work product in this case is not outside the scope of exemption <em>(d)\u2019s </em>protection of \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters\u201d simply because Smyth was an outside consultant.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The practical consequence of our holding today, stated simply, is that opinion work product that was prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for a party or party representative is protected from discovery to the extent provided under Mass. R. Civ. R 26 (b) (3), even where the opinion work product has been made or received by a State or local government employee. So is fact work product that is prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial where it is not a reasonably completed study or report, or, if it is reasonably completed, is interwoven with opinions or analysis leading to opinions. Other fact work product that has been made or received by a State or local government employee must be disclosed in discovery, even if it would be protected from discovery under rule 26 (b) (3) were it not a public record.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">2. <em>Derivative attorney-client privilege. </em>We also consider the city\u2019s argument that, regardless of whether the documents are protected from disclosure by exemption <em>(d), </em>they are protected from disclosure under the derivative attorney-client privilege because Smyth \u201ctranslated\u201d for the city solicitor \u201ctechnical information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>contained in laboratory data and field observations\u201d relating to the site, and such assistance was necessary for the city solicitor to provide legal advice to the city. Generally, the attorney-client privilege protects only \u201cconfidential communications between a client and its attorney undertaken for the purpose of obtaining legal advice.\u201d <em>Suffolk Constr. Co., </em>449 Mass. at 448. See <em>Comcast, </em>453 Mass. at 303 (indorsing Wigmore\u2019s \u201cclassic formulation\u201d of attorney-client privilege). However, we have recognized that the derivative attorney-client privilege \u201ccan shield communications of a third party employed to facilitate communication between the attorney and client and thereby assist the attorney in rendering legal advice to the client.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 306, citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kovel, </em>296 F.2d 918, 921-922 (2d Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The derivative attorney-client privilege is sharply limited in scope. It attaches \u201conly when the [third party\u2019s] role is to clarify or facilitate communications between attorney and client,\u201d <em>Comcast, </em>453 Mass. at 308, as where \u201cthe [third party] functions as a \u2018translator\u2019 between the client and the attorney,\u201d <em>In re G-I Holdings Inc., </em>218 F.R.D. 428, 434 (D.N.J. 2003), and is therefore \u201cnearly indispensable or servefs] some specialized purpose in facilitating the attorney-client communications.\u201d <em>Comcast, supra </em>at 307, quoting <em>Cavallaro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>284 F.3d 236, 249 (1st Cir. 2002). The privilege does not apply simply because \u201can attorney\u2019s ability to represent a client is improved, even substantially, by the assistance\u201d of an expert. <em>Comcast, supra. </em>In short, the derivative attorney-client privilege protects otherwise privileged communications between an attorney and client despite the presence of a third party where, without the assistance of the third party, what the client says would be \u201cGreek\u201d to the attorney, either because the client is actually speaking in Greek or because the information provided by the client is so technical in nature that it might as well be spoken in Greek if there were not an expert to interpret it for the attorney. See <em>id. </em>at 306 (derivative privilege is exception to rule that \u201c[disclosing attorney-client communications to a third party . . . undermines the privilege\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The communications at issue fail to meet this test. Even if Smyth\u2019s analysis were critical to the city solicitor\u2019s ability to effectively represent the city because the technical data would otherwise have been difficult to understand, Smyth was \u201ctranslating\u201d public record technical data relating to the site, <em>not </em>confidential communications from the client. The purpose of the derivative attorney-client privilege is to maintain the privilege for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>communications between the attorney and the client in circumstances where a third party\u2019s presence would otherwise constitute a waiver of the privilege, and that purpose would not be fulfilled by shielding Smyth\u2019s analysis of technical data from disclosure. See Comcast, 453 Mass. at 307-310, and cases cited (reviewing Federal cases rejecting claim that similar communications from outside experts retained by client\u2019s attorney are within derivative attorney-client privilege). Consequently, if the TRC work product is to be shielded from disclosure, that shield must rest on the work product doctrine, not the derivative attorney-client privilege.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons stated above, we vacate the judge\u2019s order allowing the third-party defendants\u2019 motion to compel production of the work product at issue in this case, and remand the matter to the motion judge so that he may determine whether the work product, in whole or in part, is protected from disclosure under the act because it is exempted from the definition of \u201cpublic records,\u201d under G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth <em>(d). </em>Any work product that is a \u201cpublic record\u201d because it does not fall within exemption <em>(d) </em>(or any other exemption) shall be ordered to be produced in discovery by the city. If any work product is not a \u201cpublic record\u201d because it falls within exemption <em>(d) </em>(or any another exemption), the work product may not be ordered to be produced in discovery unless the third-party defendants have made the required showing of need to justify disclosure of this work product under Mass.
