Among other claims, the plaintiffs maintained that the defendants had implemented a no-tipping policy at certain of their Dunkin\u2019 Donuts stores,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that the implementation of that policy, as well as the method of enforcing it, violated G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A (Tips Act).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Tips Act provides that no employer \u201cshall ... accept . . . any . . . deduction from a tip\u201d given to any wait staff, service, or bartender employee, or \u201cretain... any tip\u201d given to the employer directly. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A <em>(b).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Concluding that the no-tipping policy was not a violation of the Tips Act, a Superior Court judge allowed the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on that claim. The judge denied the motion on the claims alleging that the defendants\u2019 policy of placing money left as tips in the cash register, and a later policy of placing money left as tips in \u201cabandoned change\u201d cups, violated the Tips Act, because he determined that these claims raised triable issues of fact. At the plaintiffs\u2019 request, the judge then reported two questions to the Appeals Court, pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. R 64 (a), as amended, 423 Mass. 1403 (1996), and we allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for direct appellate review.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The judge reported the following questions:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">\u201c1.

The employer clearly communicates the no-tipping policy to customers, who nonetheless leave tips that are retained by the employer?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">We answer the first question, \u201cYes.\u201d We answer question 2(a), \u201cYes,\u201d and 2(b), \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\"><em>Background. </em>We summarize the facts set forth in the judge\u2019s memorandum of decision, supplemented by the parties\u2019 joint statement of material facts, reserving some facts for later discussion. Scrivanos is a franchisee operating approximately sixty-six Dunkin\u2019 Donuts stores in the Commonwealth. He has established various limited liability companies and S corporations that own the stores for which he is a franchisee, and he is the manager of each of these corporations. Scrivanos also established NGP, which manages and operates all of Scrivanos\u2019s Dunkin\u2019 Donuts locations in Massachusetts. The plaintiffs are current and former employees of Scrivanos\u2019s Dunkin\u2019 Donuts stores. They were paid on an hourly basis. All of the plaintiffs earned at least the minimum wage under the Wage Act, G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">Sometime in 2003, the defendants instituted a no-tipping policy at all of their stores, but later withdrew the policy as to some stores. When the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was filed, the policy remained in effect in approximately two-thirds of Scrivanos\u2019s Massachusetts stores, including all of the stores in which the plaintiffs worked. Under the no-tipping policy, an employee is not permitted to accept a tip from a customer, even if the customer wants to leave a tip, and is required to inform a customer who attempts to leave a tip of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">The defendants have instituted various mechanisms for enforcing the no-tipping policy, including the placement of signs in the stores stating \u201cno tipping\u201d or \u201cthank you for not tipping.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>size and location of the signs vary from store to store. Additionally, the defendants instruct employees to inform customers of the no-tipping policy and to refuse to accept tips. The defendants have communicated to employees that the acceptance of tips \u201cwill result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\u201d Before commencement of this litigation, the defendants instructed employees to place \u201ctips\u201d that had been left by customers, notwithstanding the instructions about the no-tipping policy, in the cash register. After the filing of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint in the Superior Court, an \u201cabandoned change\u201d policy was adopted. Employees in stores with a no-tipping policy were instructed to place the money in abandoned change cups located near the cash register. Employees also were instructed to inform customers that the \u201cabandoned change\u201d cups were not for tips, and that any money placed in the cups would be used to discount future customers\u2019 purchases, similar to a \u201ctake-a-penny, leave-a-penny\u201d container.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The plaintiffs asserted in their original complaint that both the defendants\u2019 no-tipping policy and the policy of placing money left as \u201ctips\u201d in the cash register violate the Tips Act. After the implementation of the \u201cabandoned change\u201d policy, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint asserting that this new policy also violates the Tips Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. After a hearing on the motion, a Superior Court judge held that the Tips Act did not prohibit implementation of a no-tipping policy, but that, if customers nonetheless left tips, those tips belonged to the employees, and an employer\u2019s retention of them would constitute a violation of the Tips Act. Concluding that a full record would be helpful for any appeal, the judge denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to report the case to the Appeals Court. Discovery was conducted, and the defendants thereafter filed a motion for summary judgment. A different Superior Court judge denied the motion in part, allowed it in part, and reported the questions to the Appeals Court. We allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>The reported questions require that we construe the language of the Tips Act, and we apply familiar principles of statutory construction to guide our interpretation. \u201cWe look to the intent of the Legislature \u2018ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u2019 \u201d <em>DiFiore </em>v. <em>American Airlines, Inc., </em>454 Mass. 486, 490 (2009), quoting <em>Industrial Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>367 Mass. 360, 364 (1975). \u201cIn addition, our respect for the Legislature\u2019s considered judgment dictates that we interpret the statute to be sensible, rejecting unreasonable interpretations unless the clear meaning of the language requires such an interpretation.\u201d <em>Bednark </em>v. <em>Catania Hospitality Group, Inc., </em>78 Mass. App. Ct. 806, 811 (2011), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dodge, </em>428 Mass. 860, 865 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">We note, as an initial matter, that it is undisputed that the plaintiffs are employees entitled to the protections of the Tips Act. The Tips Act \u201cprotect[s] the wages and tips of certain employees who fall within the ambit of the statute.\u201d <em>Bednark </em>v. <em>Catania Hospitality Group, Inc., </em>78 Mass. App. Ct. at 809. These employees include service employees, service bartenders, and wait staff employees. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A <em>(a). </em>Wait staff employees include counter staff who \u201cserve[ ] beverages or prepared food directly to patrons,\u201d \u201cwork[ ] in a restaurant ... or other place where prepared food or beverages are served,\u201d and have \u201cno managerial responsibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The parties agree that the plaintiffs are \u201cwait staff employees\u201d within the meaning of the Tips Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">1. <em>Whether G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A, permits an employer to maintain a no-tipping policy. </em>General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 152A <em>(b), </em>provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">\u201c[n]o employer or other person shall demand, request or accept from any wait staff employee, service employee, or service bartender any payment or deduction from a tip or service charge given to such wait staff employee, service employee, or service bartender by a patron. No such employer or other person shall retain or distribute in a manner inconsistent with this section any tip or service charge given directly to the employer or person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Relying on language in this provision, the plaintiffs contend that the plain language of the Tips Act prohibits an employer from instituting a no-tipping policy. They argue that G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A <em>(b), </em>does not permit an employer to take any \u201cdeduction from a tip,\u201d and that the defendants\u2019 prohibition on employees accepting tips in effect results in a \u201cdeduction from a tip\u201d that the employee would have received absent the no-tipping policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>The plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation is contrary to several tenets of statutory construction. It would require that we disregard the plain meaning of the words \u201cretain\u201d and \u201cdeduction\u201d as used in G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A <em>(b). </em>Moreover, because the statute explicitly concerns tips that have been \u201cgiven,\u201d either directly to employees or to employers, the plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation distorts the syntax of that section, in order to read into it a provision the Legislature did not include.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">In the first sentence of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A <em>(b), </em>an employer is prohibited from demanding, requesting, or accepting a \u201cdeduction\u201d from a tip \u201cgiven to [a covered] employee.\u201d In construing a statute, where a word is commonly understood, it can \u201cbe given its ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Flemings </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>431 Mass. 374, 375 (2000), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Auth., </em>352 Mass. 617, 618 (1967). According to several dictionary definitions, the word \u201cdeduct\u201d means \u201cto take away, as from a sum or amount.\u201d See Webster\u2019s New Universal Unabridged Dictionary 520 (2003); 3 Oxford English Dictionary 115 (1978). A \u201cdeduction\u201d is commonly defined as \u201csomething that is or may be deducted.\u201d Webster\u2019s New Universal Unabridged Dictionary, <em>supra. </em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 501 (10th ed. 2014) (\u201cThe act or process of subtracting or taking away\u201d); 3 Oxford English Dictionary, <em>supra </em>at 116 (\u201cThat which is deducted or subtracted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Thus, in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute, an employer may not take away any amount from a \u201cservice charge, tip[, or] gratuity,\u201d G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A <em>(a), </em>that was \u201cgiven to\u201d a wait staff employee. A tip that was \u201cgiven to\u201d an employee would include a tip that was handed directly to the employee or left on a counter for the employee, or a sum designated as a tip or gratuity on a customer\u2019s credit card slip.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This reading of the first sentence of \u00a7 152A <em>(b) </em>is \u201cconsonant with sound reason and common sense.\u201d <em>Harvard Crimson, Inc. </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, </em>445 Mass. 745, 749 (2006). See <em>DiGiacomo </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 66 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 343, 346 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The Tips Act also contemplates that tips intended for employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>ees may be given directly to an employer. An employer may \u201csubmit[ ] a bill, invoice or charge to a patron or other person that imposes a service charge or tip,\u201d G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A <em>(d), </em>for instance by submitting an invoice in connection with a private function at which the employer provides food and beverages.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Cooney </em>v. <em>Compass Group Foodservice, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct., 632, 635 (2007). The second sentence of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A <em>(b), </em>addresses an employer\u2019s obligation in such a situation. The sentence states that \u201c[n]o . . . employer or other person shall retain\u201d a tip or service charge \u201cgiven directly to the employer.\u201d The common definition of the word \u201cretain\u201d is \u201cto keep possession of.\u201d Webster\u2019s New Universal Unabridged Dictionary, <em>supra </em>at 1643. Accordingly, the second sentence of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A <em>(b), </em>addresses the circumstance in which tipping is permitted and a tip is actually given, albeit not directly to the employee; if payment of a tip or service charge is made to an employer, \u201cthe statute requires that the proceeds be remitted to the [covered] employees.\u201d <em>Cooney </em>v. <em>Compass Group Foodservice, supra </em>at 637. The Tips Act is explicit in this regard, and prohibits an employer from retaining a service charge or tip that was paid to the employer rather than to the wait staff employee.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">No language in G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A <em>(b), </em>or elsewhere in the Tips Act, see G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A <em>(a)-(g), </em>prohibits an employer from imposing a no-tipping policy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Tips Act addresses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>circumstances in which tipping is permitted and wait staff employees have been given tips, directly or indirectly; it prescribes what the employer is required to do with such tips. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">In support of their argument that a no-tipping policy is prohibited under the Tips Act, the plaintiffs point to the fact that the Legislature considered, but did not adopt, legislation proposed in 2010 House Doc. No. 4814, which stated that \u201c[njothing in [the Tips Act] shall prohibit any employer from establishing a policy prohibiting tipping.\u201d We have consistently rejected similar arguments, recognizing that \u201c[t]he practicalities of the legislative process furnish many reasons for the lack of success of a measure other than legislative dislike for the principle involved in the legislation.\u201d <em>Suffolk Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Division of Capital Asset Mgt., </em>449 Mass. 444, 457 n.18 (2007), quoting <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>381 Mass. 611, 615-616 (1980). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Craft, </em>535 U.S. 274, 287 (2002), quoting <em>Central Bank of Denver, N.A. </em>v. <em>First Interstate Bank of Denver, N.A., </em>511 U.S. 164, 187 (1994) (\u201cseveral equally tenable inferences may be drawn from such inaction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Finally, the plaintiffs find support for their view in <em>DiFiore </em>v. <em>American Airlines, Inc., </em>454 Mass. 486, 496 (2009), where we stated that the \u201cexpress purpose of the [Tips] Act [is] to protect gratuity payments given to, or intended for, [covered] employees.\u201d The plaintiffs suggest that this language indicates that G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A, protects not only tips actually given, but also tips that customers intended covered employees to have, and would have given to those employees had they not been prevented from doing so by imposition of a no-tipping policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">We are not persuaded. In that case, we addressed a question certified to us by the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts concerning the definition of the term \u201cservice charge\u201d in G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A <em>(d). </em>We determined that the Legislature intended by this provision \u201cto ensure that service employees receive all the proceeds from [assessed] service charges,\u201d <em>DiFiore </em>v. <em>American Airlines, Inc., supra </em>at 493, and interpreted the term \u201cservice charge\u201d to include a tip or gratuity as \u201cnonexclusive examples of fees that constitute service charges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 495. Nothing in that decision supports the view that the Tips Act applies to tips that customers intended to give to employees but, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>because of a no-tipping policy, did not give.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">In sum, we do not construe G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A, to require that employers of wait staff employees must permit customers to give tips to such employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">2. <em>Liability under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A, where a no-tipping policy is in effect. </em>We turn to consideration of the second reported question, which relies upon a determination that imposition of a no-tipping policy is not contrary to the Tips Act. The second reported question asks that we consider the circumstances in which an employer seeking to enforce a no-tipping policy may be held in violation of the Tips Act if, notwithstanding the implementation of such a policy, \u201ccustomers . . . leave tips that are retained by the employer.\u201d For reasons we discuss, we conclude that, if an employer has not clearly communicated its no-tipping policy to customers, tips left by customers where service is provided by wait staff belong to those employees, and may not be retained by the employer. On the other hand, where the employer has clearly communicated to customers that a no-tipping policy is in effect, money left by customers in establishments where service is provided by wait staff is not a tip that was given to wait staff employees, regardless of a customer\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">a. <em>Tips retained by employer who has failed to communicate its no-tipping policy clearly to customers. </em>As discussed, the Tips Act defines particular circumstances in which a fee that is assessed by an employer is not a tip or service charge subject to the provisions of the Tips Act. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152 <em>(d). </em>See note 8, <em>supra. </em>In those circumstances, an employer must \u201cinform[ ] the patron that the fee does not represent a tip or service charge for [covered employees].\u201d G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152 <em>(d). </em>This requirement reflects the Legislature\u2019s concern that, absent such information, customers charged a fee by employers of wait staff employees will assume that the employer will remit that amount to its wait staff employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">Similarly, unless an employer who has implemented a no-tipping policy clearly conveys to customers that money they leave when paying their bill does not represent a tip for wait staff employees, it is readily conceivable that customers will have the reasonable expectation that the money they leave will be given to the wait staff employees. The absence of a clear communication to customers of a no-tipping policy could permit employers to pocket sums not intended for them, and would facilitate \u201can \u2018end run\u2019 around the [Tips] Act.\u201d <em>DiFiore </em>v. <em>American Airlines, Inc., </em>454 Mass. at 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 152A <em>(b), </em>prohibits employers of wait staff employees from \u201cdemanding], request[ing] or accepting]\u201d a payment or deduction from a tip \u201cgiven to\u201d such employees. Although an employer may adopt a no-tipping policy, it \u201cmay not escape [this] prohibition in . . . the [Tips] Act,\u201d <em>DiFiore </em>v. <em>American Airlines, Inc., supra </em>at 494, by failing to communicate to customers that the policy is in effect, and that the money they leave will not be kept by the employee as a tip. In the absence of such a communication of the no-tipping policy to customers, we conclude that \u201ca sum of money ..., given as an acknowledgment of any service performed by a [covered] employee,\u201d remains a \u201ctip . . . that a patron . . . would reasonably expect to be given to a [covered] employee.\u201d G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A <em>{a). </em>An employer who, in those circumstances, \u201cdemandfs], requests] or accept[s]\u201d any portion of such sums does so in contravention of the Tips Act. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A <em>(b).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">b. <em>Tips retained by employer who has clearly communicated no-tipping policy to customers. </em>Where an employer who employs wait staff employees has clearly communicated a no-tipping policy that effectively conveys that money left by a customer will not be received by any wait staff employee as a tip, we conclude that any money that is nonetheless left by a customer is not a tip \u201cgiven to\u201d the wait staff employees because a customer cannot reasonably expect that this money has been given to the employees. Accordingly, where there has been a clear communication of a no-tipping policy to customers, the employer has not violated G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A <em>(b), </em>if the sums of money that nonetheless have been left by customers are retained by the employer, or placed in an \u201cabandoned change\u201d cup for use by other customers.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons stated, we answer the first reported question, \u201cYes.\u201d We answer question 2(a), \u201cYes,\u201d and we answer question 2(b), \u201cNo.\u201d We affirm the judge\u2019s order on the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.

Where a judge also frames specific questions, an appellate court is not obligated to answer them. See <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Enterpise Rent-A-Car Co. of Boston, Inc., </em>438 Mass. 187, 188 &amp; n.4 (2002), citing <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Dwight, </em>363 Mass. 256, 276 (1973). Here, the questions underlie the judge\u2019s ruling, and the parties address both questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>fully in their briefs. See <em>Gasior </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp., </em>446 Mass. 645, 646 (2006), quoting <em>McStowe </em>v. <em>Bornstein, 377 </em>Mass. 804, 805 n.2 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b188-8\">Under G.

In addition, employers could instruct wait staff employees to convey to customers orally the existence of a no-tipping policy, and could provide training regarding the content of the communication, as well as when during the various points of interaction with a customer the information should be conveyed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
