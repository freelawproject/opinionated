L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, asking the court for two forms of relief. First, they asked for the establishment of a rule whereby defendants who have been convicted of drug offenses, and who successfully obtain new trials based on Dookhan\u2019s misconduct, cannot thereafter be charged with or convicted of more serious offenses than those of which the defendants originally were convicted, or be given longer sentences than originally were imposed. Second, the petitioners requested an order requiring those district attorneys who prosecuted so-called \u201cDookhan defendants\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to (1) notify all such defendants within ninety days whether the Commonwealth intends to reprosecute them;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (2) vacate the convictions in those cases where the defendants are not so notified; and (3) conclude any reprosecutions within six months. On May 27, 2014, following the release of our decision in <em>Scott, </em>supra,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Committee for Public Counsel Services (CPCS) filed a motion to intervene under Mass. R. Civ. P. 24 (a), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>365 Mass. 769 (1974), to join the petitioners\u2019 requests for relief and to seek additional relief for all Dookhan defendants.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Commonwealth opposed both the petition for relief pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, and the motion to intervene. After several hearings, a single justice on October 21, 2014, reserved and reported the entire case to the full court.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">For the reasons that follow, we now conclude that (1) a defendant who has been granted a new trial based on Dookhan\u2019s misconduct at the Hinton drug lab cannot be charged with a more serious offense than that of which he or she initially was convicted under the terms of a plea agreement and, if convicted again, cannot be given a more severe sentence than that which originally was imposed; (2) the motion to intervene filed by CPCS is allowed; (3) a so-called \u201cglobal remedy\u201d will not be implemented at this time; (4) a lawyer who represented a Dookhan defendant at the plea stage of criminal proceedings is not barred by the advocate-witness rule from subsequently representing that defendant and testifying at an evidentiary hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw a guilty plea; (5) the scope of cross-examination of a Dookhan defendant at a hearing on a motion to withdraw a guilty plea is left to the broad discretion of the motion judge; and (6) the testimony of a Dookhan defendant at a hearing on a motion to withdraw a guilty plea is only admissible at a subsequent trial for impeachment purposes if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>defendant chooses to testify.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">1. <em>Background, </em>a. <em>Kevin Bridgeman. </em>On April 8, 2005, members of the Boston police department\u2019s drug control unit were conducting an undercover operation in the theater district. Officer Greg T. Walsh approached Bridgeman and purchased two rocks of what appeared to be \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine for forty dollars in controlled \u201cbuy\u201d money. Officers then attempted to arrest Bridgeman, whereupon he resisted and struck one of the officers with a closed fist. When Bridgeman was searched after his arrest, officers found twenty-two plastic bags containing what appeared to be crack cocaine and the forty dollars in buy money.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">On June 2, 2005, a Suffolk County grand jury indicted Bridge-man on charges of possession of a class B controlled substance (cocaine) with intent to distribute, as a second or subsequent offense, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A <em>(b) </em>(count one); distribution of a class B controlled substance (cocaine), as a second or subsequent offense, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A <em>(b) </em>(count three); violation of the controlled substances laws in proximity to a school, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J (counts two and four); assault and battery on a police officer, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13D (count five); and resisting arrest, G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 32B (count six). The Commonwealth produced drug certificates signed by Dookhan on the line labeled \u201cAssistant Analyst,\u201d stating that the substances at issue contained cocaine as defined in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 31. Pursuant to a plea agreement, Bridgeman pleaded guilty on October 4, 2005, to counts one (first offense), three (first offense), five, and six. The Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss the second or subsequent offense portions of the indictments and the school zone charges was granted.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">On July 26, 2007, members of the Boston police department\u2019s drug control unit were conducting an undercover operation around Boston Common. An undercover officer approached Bridgeman, engaged him in conversation, walked with him to the Public Garden, and then purchased two plastic bags containing what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>appeared to be crack cocaine for forty dollars in buy money. Bridgeman was arrested, and when he was searched, officers found, among other items, ten additional bags containing what appeared to be crack cocaine and the forty dollars in buy money.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">On September 24, 2007, a Suffolk County grand jury indicted Bridgeman on charges of possession of a class B controlled substance (cocaine) with intent to distribute, as a subsequent offense, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A <em>(b) </em>(count one); violation of the controlled substances laws in proximity to a park, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J (count two); and distribution of a class B controlled substance (cocaine), as a subsequent offense, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A <em>(b) </em>(count three). The Commonwealth again produced drug certificates signed by Dookhan on the line labeled \u201cAssistant Analyst,\u201d stating that the substances at issue contained cocaine as defined in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 31. Pursuant to a plea agreement, Bridgeman pleaded guilty on April 17, 2008, to counts one and three.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss the park zone charge was granted. Bridgeman has completed service of his sentences, but has not yet filed a motion for postconviction relief.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">b. <em>Yasir Creach. </em>On January 7, 2005, members of the Boston police department\u2019s drug control unit were conducting surveillance in the Chinatown section of Boston. They observed Creach engaging in a brief conversation with another man before the two entered an alley marked with a \u201cno trespassing\u201d sign. The officers followed the men into the alley and saw Creach smoking from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>glass tube that had been modified into a crack pipe. The officers recovered one rock of what appeared to be crack cocaine from the pipe, and Creach was placed under arrest. Three days later, a criminal complaint issued from the Central Division of the Boston Municipal Court Department charging Creach with trespassing, G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 120 (count one); and possession of a class B controlled substance (cocaine), G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34. The Commonwealth produced a drug certificate signed by Dookhan on the line labeled \u201cAssistant Analyst,\u201d stating that the substance at issue contained cocaine as defined in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 31. Creach pleaded guilty on April 20, 2005, to both charges.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> He has completed service of his sentences, but has not yet filed a motion for post-conviction relief.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">c. <em>Miguel Cuevas. </em>On January 5, 2007, members of the Salem police department were conducting an undercover operation in the \u201cPoint\u201d neighborhood of Salem. An undercover officer contacted Cuevas by cellular telephone, the two met, and Cuevas sold the officer a \u201ctwist\u201d of what the officer believed to be cocaine for forty dollars in buy money. Three days later, undercover officers again contacted Cuevas by cellular telephone and arranged to purchase more cocaine. Cuevas directed the officers to meet him at the corner of Bridge and Rice Streets. Once there, the officers picked up Cuevas from the side of the road and drove him to the vicinity of a residence on Palmer Street. Cuevas got out of the vehicle, disappeared from sight for a few minutes, and then returned with another twist of what the officers believed to be cocaine. On January 10, undercover officers once more contacted Cuevas by cellular telephone and arranged to purchase cocaine and heroin. The officers picked up Cuevas at the corner of Bridge and Rice Streets and again drove him to Palmer Street. Cuevas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>got out of the vehicle, briefly entered Theo\u2019s Market, and then returned to the vehicle where he sold the officers what appeared to be cocaine and heroin for ninety dollars in buy money.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">On October 5, 2007, an Essex County grand jury indicted Cuevas on charges of distribution of a class B substance (cocaine), as a second or subsequent offense, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A <em>(d) </em>(counts one, two, and three); and distribution of a class A substance (heroin), as a second or subsequent offense, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32 <em>(b) </em>(count four). The Commonwealth produced drug certificates signed by Dookhan on the line labeled \u201cAssistant Analyst,\u201d stating that the substances at issue contained, respectively, cocaine and heroin as defined in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 31. Pursuant to a plea agreement, Cuevas pleaded guilty on January 30, 2009, to all four counts.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Commonwealth did not pursue the second or subsequent offense portions of the indictments. Cuevas has completed service of his sentences.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> On October 18, 2012, Cuevas filed a motion to withdraw his guilty pleas pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001), based on Dookhan\u2019s misconduct at the Hinton drug lab. That motion remains pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">2. <em>Exposure to harsher punishment. </em>The petitioners contend that our decision in <em>Scott </em>has given rise to a substantial fear among Dookhan defendants that by challenging their drug convictions, they will subject themselves to harsher punishment than was imposed when they pleaded guilty.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> For example, they continue, a successful motion for a new trial could result in the reinstate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>ment of previously dismissed charges that carry mandatory minimum sentences.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In the petitioners\u2019 view, the magnitude of Dookhan\u2019s misconduct has placed enormous pressure on the Commonwealth to limit their postconviction relief. They assert that the Commonwealth has an aversion to the duplicative expenditure of scarce prosecutorial resources, that the judicial system has a bias against retrying issues that already have been decided, and that the Commonwealth has a desire to preserve convictions. Consequently, the petitioners argue that their fear of receiving a harsher punishment has chilled the exercise of their postconviction rights. Given these considerations, the petitioners contend that this court should conclude that defendants who plead guilty to drug offenses and subsequently are granted new trials based on Dookhan\u2019s misconduct at the Hinton drug lab cannot (1) be charged with more serious offenses than those of which they initially were convicted; and (2) if convicted again, cannot be given sentences longer than those that originally were imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Preliminarily, before reaching the merits of the petitioners\u2019 arguments, we must resolve a procedural matter. The Commonwealth asserts that the petitioners\u2019 claims are not ripe for review because the harm the petitioners have alleged \u2014 harsher sentences following new trials \u2014 is hypothetical. The Commonwealth correctly points out that, among the petitioners, only Cuevas has sought postconviction relief by filing a motion to withdraw his guilty pleas based on Dookhan\u2019s misconduct, and according to the record, the motion remains pending. In the Commonwealth\u2019s view, the harm alleged by the petitioners is speculative until such time as the petitioners are granted new trials, the Commonwealth charges the petitioners with more serious offenses, and, if convicted, the petitioners actually receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>harsher punishments. Until those events unfold, the Commonwealth continues, the petitioners\u2019 claims are not ripe for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Generally speaking, \u201cthis court will not review [a] matter until the entire case is ripe for review due to the burdensome nature of \u2018piecemeal appellate review.\u2019 \u201d <em>Campana </em>v. <em>Directors of the Mass. Hous. Fin. Agency, </em>399 Mass. 492, 499 n.16 (1987). However, given the significance of this case in light of the thousands of defendants who have been affected by Dookhan\u2019s misconduct and now are considering whether to pursue postconviction relief, coupled with the impact our decision will have on the timely administration of justice in all Hinton drug lab cases, we conclude that it is appropriate to review the petitioners\u2019 claims now in accordance with our broad powers of superintendence under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. See <em>Diatchenko </em>v. <em>District Attorney for the Suffolk Dist., 466 </em>Mass. 655, 657 n.5 (2013), <em>S.C., </em>471 Mass. 12 (2015). We agree with the single justice that in the unique circumstances of this case, the interests of justice dictate immediate resolution of the petitioners\u2019 claims. Moreover, we have said that where, as here, \u201cthe single justice has, in [her] discretion, reserved and reported the case to the full court, we grant full appellate review of the issues reported.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>458 Mass. 11, 14-15 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">We turn to the merits of the petitioners\u2019 arguments. Since the revelation of Dookhan\u2019s egregious misconduct at the Hinton drug lab \u2014 a lapse of widespread magnitude in the criminal justice system \u2014\u2022 we have found it necessary to exercise our general superintendence power to ameliorate its damaging effects. In the early stages of the crisis, this court reviewed and resolved the legality of plea colloquies conducted by special magistrates appointed by the Chief Justice of the Superior Court Department of the Trial Court to preside over criminal proceedings in cases relating to the Hinton drug lab. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charles, 466 </em>Mass. 63, 65-66, 88-89 (2013). Then, in <em>Scott, </em>we articulated a workable approach by which judges should evaluate and decide individual motions to withdraw guilty pleas brought by defendants affected by Dookhan\u2019s misconduct. See <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass. at 352. See also note 6, <em>supra. </em>Now, with this approach in place, it is incumbent on the court to address uncertainties regarding the legal implications of a defendant\u2019s decision to challenge his or her ostensibly tainted drug conviction, and the propriety of returning the parties to the positions they occupied before entering into a plea agreement. These matters are ones of systemic concern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>that this court shall resolve through the exercise of its general superintendence powers under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, so as to ensure that a fear of more punitive consequences, as expressed by the petitioners, does not render their right to seek postconviction relief a flawed option. See <em>Charles, supra </em>at 88-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">It is well established that \u201c[Remedies for prosecutorial misconduct should be tailored to the injury suffered and should not unnecessarily infringe on competing interests.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cronk, </em>396 Mass. 194, 199 (1985). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>469 Mass. 266, 290-292 (2014); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frith, </em>458 Mass. 434, 439-440 (2010); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cinelli, </em>389 Mass. 197, 209-210, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 860 (1983). \u201c[Pjrosecutorial misconduct requires that the rights of defendants be balanced against the necessity for preserving society\u2019s interest in the administration of justice.\u201d <em>Cronk, supra. </em>See <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass. at 352. In the ordinary course, \u201cwhen a defendant withdraws his [guilty] plea after sentencing, he may receive a harsher sentence than was originally imposed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeMarco, </em>387 Mass. 481, 486 (1982). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>468 Mass. 174, 178 (2014) (judge vacated defendant\u2019s plea of guilty and reinstated portion of indictment charging defendant with trafficking in cocaine, which had been dismissed under terms of plea agreement); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Therrien, </em>359 Mass. 500, 502-505 (1971) (allowance of defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw plea of guilty to murder in second degree subjected defendant to trial on charge of murder in first degree with attendant penalties). However, a defendant who files a motion to withdraw a guilty plea as a consequence of Dookhan\u2019s misconduct is not doing so in the context of an ordinary criminal case in which the original charges brought by the Commonwealth, and their attendant sentences, simply can be reinstated as if the plea bargain had never occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">A return to the status quo ante would mean ignoring the egregious misconduct of Dookhan and disregarding its impact on criminal defendants whose drug samples she analyzed. This course of action would present a defendant with two options. A defendant could choose not to file a motion for postconviction relief and accept the fact that his or her convictions may have been tainted by Dookhan\u2019s misconduct. Alternatively, a defendant could choose to file a motion to withdraw his or her guilty plea and, if allowed, accept the fact that he or she may be subject to a harsher punishment than was imposed when he or she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>pleaded guilty. Either way, defendants wrongly would bear the burden of a systemic lapse that, in the circumstances of the Hinton drug lab, we have said is entirely attributable to the government, even though there is no indication that prosecutors had actual knowledge of Dookhan\u2019s misconduct during their prosecutions of the Dookhan defendants. See <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass. at 347-352. Were it not for Dookhan\u2019s actions, defendants would not be in the position of having to seek postconviction relief from her malfeasance in the first instance. Moreover, it cannot be overlooked that many Dookhan defendants already have served the sentences to which they and the Commonwealth agreed. A return to the status quo ante simply is not a legally tenable solution, given that \u201c[w]e must account for the due process rights of defendants . . . [and] the integrity of the criminal justice system.\u201d <em>Scott, supra </em>at 352. The proper solution is one that takes into consideration the interests of the Dookhan defendants and the Commonwealth, recognizing that \u201cin the wake of government misconduct that has cast a shadow over the entire criminal justice system, it is most appropriate that the benefit of our remedy inure to defendants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Lavallee </em>v. <em>Justices in the Hampden Superior Court, </em>442 Mass. 228, 246 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">A plea bargain often has been compared to an enforceable contract. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tirrell, </em>382 Mass. 502, 512 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 610, 611 (2004). \u201c[W]hen a plea rests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of the inducement or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled.\u201d <em>Santobello </em>v. <em>New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 262 (1971). See <em>Correale </em>v. <em>United States, </em>479 F.2d 944, 947 (1st Cir. 1973) (\u201cthe most meticulous standards of both promise and performance must be met by prosecutors engaging in plea bargaining\u201d). We have said that \u201cwhen the prosecutor enters into plea bargain agreements, \u2018the court will see that due regard is paid to them, and that the public faith which has been pledged by him is duly kept.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>394 Mass. 25, 28 (1985), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benton, </em>356 Mass. 447, 448 (1969). See <em>Cruz, supra </em>at 612; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>District Attorney for the Plymouth Dist., </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 671, 673 (1991). See also Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass. R. Crim. R 12, Mass. Ann. Laws Court Rules, Rules of Criminal Procedure, at 1491-1492 (LexisNexis 2014-2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Here, before the revelation of Dookhan\u2019s misconduct, the petitioners and the Commonwealth entered into plea agreements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>that both parties considered to be mutually advantageous and fair. The petitioners agreed to waive various constitutional rights associated with proceeding to trial, and to relieve the Commonwealth of its burden of proving the petitioners\u2019 guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>447 Mass. 625, 628 (2006) (guilty plea constitutes waiver of three constitutional rights: right to jury trial, right to confront one\u2019s accusers, and privilege against self-incrimination). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>470 Mass. 464, 468 (2015) (\u201cIn a criminal case, due process requires that the Commonwealth prove the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d). In exchange, the Commonwealth agreed to reduce the charges against the petitioners,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and, consequently, the sentences that would be imposed by a judge. Any subsequent motions to withdraw those guilty pleas must be viewed as an inevitable result of the disclosure of Dookhan\u2019s misconduct. That being the case, the Commonwealth cannot simply reprosecute the petitioners as if the plea agreements had never existed, thereby giving the Commonwealth a second bite at the proverbial apple in its efforts to convict the petitioners. Instead, the Commonwealth must be held to the terms of its plea agreements.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Therefore, we hold that in cases in which a defendant seeks to withdraw a guilty plea under Mass. R. Crim. R 30 (b) as a result of the revelation of Dookhan\u2019s misconduct, and where the motion is allowed, the defendant cannot (1) be charged with a more serious offense than that of which he or she initially was convicted under the terms of a plea agreement; and (2) if convicted again, cannot be given a more severe sentence than that which originally was imposed. In essence, a defendant\u2019s sentence is capped at what it was under the plea agreement. See <em>Ferrara </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number><em>United States, </em>372 F. Supp. 2d 108, 111 (D. Mass. 2005), aff\u2019d, 456 F.3d 278 (1st Cir. 2006) (when determining proper remedy for government misconduct, \u201c[t]he court\u2019s goal is to fashion a remedy that will, as much as possible, place [the defendant] in the position that he would have been in if the government had not violated his constitutional right to [d]ue [p]rocess\u201d). Our holding will enable the Commonwealth to reprosecute defendants as appropriate, such as where there is sufficient untainted evidence for the Commonwealth to satisfy its burden of proving the charged crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. At the same time, our holding also will safeguard the integrity of the criminal justice system by ensuring that defendants may challenge convictions of drug crimes based on tainted evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">3. <em>Undue delay in postconviction relief. </em>The petitioners assert that the Commonwealth has violated their due process rights by unduly delaying the provision of postconviction relief to Dookhan defendants. They point out that, among other lapses, there is no comprehensive list of docket numbers identifying all of the cases in which Dookhan served as either the primary or secondary chemist,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and that lawyers have not yet been appointed for approximately 30,000 individuals. In the petitioners\u2019 view, these delays have been prejudicial because the Dookhan defendants must contend with the ongoing uncertainties over and the collateral consequences of their purportedly tainted convictions. The petitioners propose that we order the following relief: (1) the Commonwealth should be given ninety days to notify individual defendants, or their counsel, whether it intends to reprosecute their cases;<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> (2) defendants who do not receive such notification within ninety days will be entitled to have their convictions vacated with prejudice; and (3) if timely notice is provided, the Commonwealth will have six months to bring the cases to trial or to conclude them with guilty pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">With regard to the matter of undue delay, \u201c[t]he guaranty of a speedy trial set forth in the Sixth Amendment to the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Constitution (and art. 11 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights) is not read as applying to the appellate process.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>394 Mass. 209, 220 (1985), quoting <em>Williams, petitioner, </em>378 Mass. 623, 625 (1979). However, this court has said that \u201cdeliberate blocking of appellate rights or inordinate and prejudicial delay without a defendant\u2019s consent, may rise to the level of constitutional error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Swenson, </em>368 Mass. 268, 279-280 (1975). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>400 Mass. 676, 684 (1987). \u201cThe fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard \u2018at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 333 (1976), quoting <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Manzo, </em>380 U.S. 545, 552 (1965). See <em>Paquette </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>440 Mass. 121, 131 (2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1150 (2004). We recognize that an inordinate delay in resolving the Hinton drug lab cases may result in a loss of liberty if an incarcerated defendant\u2019s conviction is overturned, and \u201cmay entail anxiety, forfeiture of opportunity, and damage to reputation, among other conceivable injuries.\u201d <em>Williams, petitioner, supra </em>at 626. At the same time, our response to Dookhan\u2019s misconduct necessarily requires consideration of not only \u201cthe due process rights of defendants,\u201d but also \u201cthe integrity of the criminal justice system, the efficient administration of justice in responding to such potentially broad-ranging misconduct, and the myriad public interests at stake.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass. at 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Given the unprecedented circumstances surrounding the debacle at the Hinton drug lab, and the substantial efforts that are being made to deal with the impact of Dookhan\u2019s misconduct on affected defendants, we conclude that, at this juncture, any delays in the provision of postconviction relief do not \u201crise to the level of constitutional error.\u201d <em>Swenson, </em>368 Mass. at 280. Our decisions in <em>Scott, </em>see note 6, <em>supra, </em>and Charles<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> have provided Dookhan defendants and the Commonwealth with meaningful solutions for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>addressing concerns that have arisen as defendants attempt to challenge their drug convictions. In particular, the special evidentiary rule that we created in <em>Scott </em>is designed to enable a defendant \u201cto establish the requisite nexus between egregious government wrongdoing and the defendant\u2019s [own] case\u201d and to \u201crelieve the trial courts of the administrative burden of making duplicative and time-consuming findings in potentially thousands of new trial motions regarding the nature and extent of Dookhan\u2019s wrongdoing.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass. at 353. Affidavits from assistant district attorneys in the Bristol, Essex, Middlesex, Norfolk, Plymouth, and Suffolk Districts regarding the progress of motions for new trials or motions to withdraw guilty pleas filed by Dookhan defendants suggest that they are being resolved at a steady pace.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">That said, we recognize that there has been some delay in providing Dookhan defendants with postconviction relief given their reluctance to file motions to withdraw their guilty pleas because of fears that they will be reprosecuted on more serious charges and will face harsher punishments than resulted from their plea agreements. Here, for example, neither Bridgeman nor Creach has filed a motion to withdraw his guilty pleas. Our decision today should alleviate those fears and remove a significant impediment to further proceedings pertaining to their convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">We also realize that efforts to provide postconviction relief to Dookhan defendants have been hampered by the inability of CPCS to ascertain which cases may have been tainted by Dookhan\u2019s misconduct. The ability of CPCS to identify clients and to assign them attorneys who will represent their interests in postconviction proceedings is crucial to the administration of justice in the Hinton drug lab cases.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> During earlier proceedings in this case in the county court, the Commonwealth commendably provided the single justice and CPCS with the docket num<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>bers (and other relevant identifying information) of the Suffolk County and Essex County cases in which Dookhan analyzed the drug samples as either the primary or secondary chemist. See Mass. R. Prof. C. 3.8 (d), 426 Mass. 1397 (1998) (\u201cThe prosecutor in a criminal case shall . . . make timely disclosure to the defense of all evidence or information known to the prosecutor that tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigates the offense . . . \u201d). While recognizing that only the district attorneys for the Suffolk and Essex Districts currently are parties to this case, we encourage the district attorneys for the districts in other counties in which Dookhan analyzed drug samples as either the primary or secondary chemist to assist the single justice in obtaining docket numbers (and other relevant identifying information) for those cases. See note 20, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">4. <em>Motion to intervene by CPCS. </em>We begin with some pertinent background. On March 12, 2013, CPCS filed a motion to intervene in earlier litigation arising as a consequence of Dookhan\u2019s misconduct at the Hinton drug lab. See Commonwealth <em>vs. </em>Charles, No. SJ-2013-0066, <em>S.C., Commonwealth </em>v. Charles, 466 Mass. 63 (2013). Among other reasons for its motion, CPCS sought to \u201cpreserve its clients\u2019 due process rights to the just and timely resolution of the many thousands of previously-adjudicated cases tainted by the systemic malfeasance and incompetence at the Hinton Drug Lab\u201d and to \u201cadvocate for remedies that [would] restore the integrity of the criminal justice system.\u201d A single justice denied the motion, without prejudice to renewal, concluding that it was premature in light of the ongoing investigations of the Hinton drug lab by Attorney David Meier and by the office of the Inspector General. The single justice stated that CPCS would have an opportunity to renew its motion \u201cat an appropriate time.\u201d In the view of CPCS, now is the appropriate time for intervention on the side of the petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">On May 27, 2014, CPCS filed its motion to intervene in the present case pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 24 (a).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> CPCS agrees with and supports the positions taken by the petitioners. It contends that tens of thousands of defendants who pleaded guilty to various drug offenses without any knowledge of Dookhan\u2019s mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>conduct require the assistance of counsel to secure relief from the violation of their due process rights, and CPCS inevitably will be called on to provide (or already is providing) representation. Beyond the issues raised by the petitioners, CPCS asserts that its ability to assign counsel for Dookhan defendants has been hindered by the position taken by prosecutors in at least one county that a lawyer who represented a defendant at the plea stage of criminal proceedings may not thereafter represent and testify on behalf of that defendant at a hearing on a motion to withdraw a guilty plea without violating Mass. R. Prof. C. 3.7 (a), 426 Mass. 1396 (1998) (advocate-witness rule).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In the view of CPCS, such \u201cdual role representation\u201d should be permitted. CPCS also asserts that Dookhan defendants are concerned about pursing postconviction relief because special magistrates, at hearings on motions to withdraw guilty pleas, have permitted wide-ranging cross-examination of defendants regarding their factual guilt.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> CPCS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>takes the position that the testimony of a Dookhan defendant at such a hearing should be deemed inadmissible in any subsequent reprosecution of the defendant, except for perjury.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The Commonwealth opposes CPCS\u2019s motion to intervene on the grounds that the interests of CPCS are adequately represented by the petitioners, CPCS has not shown that it has other interests that would be impaired by the disposition of the petition for relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, and CPCS seeks relief beyond the scope of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Rule 24 of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, 365 Mass. 769 (1974), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">\u201c(a) Intervention of Right.

CPCS is an entity established by statute to \u201cplan, oversee, and coordinate the delivery of criminal and certain noncriminal legal services\u201d to indigent defendants.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> G. L. c. 21 ID, \u00a7 1. It has a substantial and immediate interest in these proceedings given its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>current and future responsibility for providing representation to thousands of indigent Dookhan defendants who want to pursue postconviction relief from their drug convictions. It cannot be overstated that CPCS has been and will be asked to expend significant resources to handle countless numbers of these cases. We agree with the Commonwealth that there is some overlap in the matters raised by CPCS and the petitioners, especially with regard to the issue of exposure to harsher punishment. However, the interests of CPCS go well beyond those articulated by the petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">CPCS is in the position of having to provide representation to Dookhan defendants in eight counties, and, as such, it has a compelling interest in advocating for uniform practices and solutions that will ensure consistent treatment for all of those defendants, irrespective of their individual jurisdictions. Limiting our review in this case to the specific concerns raised by the petitioners will hamper the timely ability of CPCS to address wider problems that inevitably have arisen as Dookhan defendants consider whether to pursue postconviction relief. The interests of CPCS are not and cannot be adequately represented by the petitioners. At the same time, contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion, CPCS is not attempting improperly to interject in these proceedings matters that are independent from or wholly unrelated to the relief sought by the petitioners. Contrast <em>Coggins </em>v. <em>New England Patriots Football Club, Inc., </em>397 Mass. 525, 539 (1986); <em>Rothberg </em>v. <em>Schmiedeskamp, </em>334 Mass. 172, 178 (1956). The additional issues raised by CPCS are directly connected to its ability to provide representation for Dookhan defendants and to its assessment of the benefits of pursuing postconviction relief for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>those individuals. At this juncture, it is appropriate that CPCS, which will be shouldering much of the burden for attempting to resolve the Hinton drug lab cases, be permitted to intervene in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">5. <em>Global remedy. </em>CPCS contends that, in accordance with our broad powers of superintendence under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, this court should implement a \u201cglobal remedy\u201d to resolve, once and for all, the tens of thousands of cases affected by Dookhan\u2019s egregious misconduct at the Hinton drug lab. In the view of CPCS, the time and expense of proceeding on a case-by-case basis has become untenable. Therefore, it proposes a two-part solution. First, CPCS asserts that this court should vacate the convictions of all Dookhan defendants. Second, it continues, this court should dismiss all such cases with prejudice or, in the alternative, give the Commonwealth a limited opportunity to reprosecute individual cases in which there is sufficient untainted evidence to prove the drug charges beyond a reasonable doubt. Those cases that are not reprosecuted within one year, CPCS asserts, should be dismissed with prejudice in accordance with the speedy trial rule, Mass. R. Crim. P. 36 (b) (1) (D), as amended, 422 Mass. 1503 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">We decline to implement a global remedy at this time. As we have said, our decisions in <em>Scott </em>and <em>Charles </em>have provided Dookhan defendants and the Commonwealth with meaningful solutions for addressing concerns that have arisen as these defendants attempt to challenge their drug convictions. Our decision today will go a long way in resolving additional concerns that have surfaced and in moving these cases forward towards resolution. We stated in <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass. at 352, that when fashioning a workable approach for handling these cases, we must \u201caccount for the due process rights of defendants, the integrity of the criminal justice system, the efficient administration of justice in responding to such potentially broad-ranging misconduct, and the myriad public interests at stake.\u201d We also noted that while \u201c[i]t certainly is true that we cannot expect defendants to bear the burden of a systemic lapse, ... we also cannot allow the misconduct of one person to dictate an abrupt retreat from the fundamentals of our criminal justice system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 354 n.ll, and cases cited. In our view, the implementation of a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach is not presently a workable solution.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">6. <em>Advocate-witness rule. </em>CPCS asserts that, by necessity, the vast majority of its assignments of counsel to Dookhan defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>ants for the pursuit of postconviction relief have been to the same attorneys who handled the defendants\u2019 guilty pleas. However, according to CPCS, prosecutors in at least one county have objected to this dual role representation, arguing that it is prohibited by Mass. R. Prof. C. 3.7 (a). CPCS contends that, given the urgent need for timely resolution of innumerable Hinton drug lab cases, rule 3.7 (a) should not disqualify a lawyer who represented a Dookhan defendant at the plea stage of criminal proceedings from subsequently representing that defendant and testifying at an evidentiary hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw a guilty plea. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Rule 3.7 (a) of the Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct states, in relevant part, that \u201c[a] lawyer shall not act as advocate <em>at a trial </em>in which the lawyer is likely to be a necessary witness except where . . . disqualification of the lawyer would work substantial hardship on the client\u201d (emphasis added). In <em>Smaland Beach Ass\u2019n, Inc. </em>v. <em>Genova, </em>461 Mass. 214, 219-226 (2012) <em>(Smaland), </em>this court discussed the purposes and scope of attorney disqualification under rule 3.7 (a). We stated that \u201c[t]he primary purpose of the rule is \u2018to prevent the jury as fact finder from becoming confused by the combination of the roles of attorney and witness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 220, quoting <em>Steinert </em>v. <em>Steinert, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 287, 291 (2008). See comment [2] to rule 3.7 (\u201cA witness is required to testify on the basis of personal knowledge, while an advocate is expected to explain and comment on evidence given by others. It may not be clear whether a statement by an advocate-witness should be taken as proof or as an analysis of the proof\u2019). In addition, rule 3.7 (a) obviates the possibility that a lawyer \u201cwill appear to vouch for his own credibility,\u201d <em>Culebras Enters. Corp. </em>v. <em>Rivera-Rios, </em>846 F.2d 94, 99 (1st Cir. 1988); mitigates the perception that \u201cthe testifying lawyer may well be distorting the truth for the sake of his client,\u201d <em>id.; </em>and \u201crelieves the opposing counsel of the difficult task of cross-examining his lawyer-adversary.\u201d <em>Smaland, </em>461 Mass. at 220. See <em>Borman </em>v. <em>Borman, </em>378 Mass. 775, 786-787 (1979); <em>Serody </em>v. <em>Serody, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 411, 413-414 (1985). Weighing against these benefits is the substantial countervailing fact that rule 3.7 (a) \u201ccarries with it the severe consequence of stripping a party of chosen counsel.\u201d <em>Smaland, supra. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>450 Mass. 834, 853 &amp; n.15 (2008) (criminal defendant generally enjoys right to be represented by counsel of own choosing).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Significantly, we pointed out in <em>Smaland, </em>461 Mass. at 225, that rule 3.7 (a), by its plain language, prohibits a lawyer from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>acting as both an advocate and a necessary witness \u201cat trial.\u201d There, the court analyzed the prohibitions of rule 3.7 (a) in the context of a lawyer-witness\u2019s <em>pretrial </em>representation of his clients and concluded that \u201can attorney considered to be a necessary witness may participate in pretrial proceedings, though it would be particularly prudent first to secure client consent after consultation.\u201d <em>Smaland, supra </em>at 226. We determined that such a reading of rule 3.7 (a) \u201cadheres to its text and fulfils its underlying purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Concerns about potential jury confusion, cross-examination of a lawyer-adversary, and the appearance of impropriety \u201care absent or, at least, greatly reduced, when the lawyer-witness does not act as trial counsel, even if he performs behind-the-scenes work for the client in the same case.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Culebras Enters. Corp., </em>846 F.2d at 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Relying on the plain language of rule 3.7 (a), and considering the context in which dual role representation has arisen vis-a-vis the Hinton drug lab cases, we conclude that the rule does not bar such representation. The request by CPCS to proceed with dual role representation does not involve plea counsel acting as both an advocate and a necessary witness \u201cat trial.\u201d To the contrary, plea counsel will be acting in those capacities during a motion proceeding before a judge. There will be no jury that might become \u201cconfused by the combination of the roles of attorney and witness.\u201d <em>Steinert, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. at 291. To the extent that plea counsel may be in the position of having to comment on his or her own credibility, the judge is amply able to make the necessary credibility determinations without being swayed by any improper considerations. Apart from the defendant, plea counsel is likely the only individual who can attest to the circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty, and such testimony is critical to the judge\u2019s decision whether to allow a motion to vacate a guilty plea. See <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass. at 354-355 (\u201cthe defendant must demonstrate a reasonable probability that he would not have pleaded guilty had he known of Dookhan\u2019s misconduct\u201d). At the time of plea negotiations, neither the defendant nor plea counsel could have imagined the events that later would unfold at the Hinton drug lab, or entertained the thought that plea counsel would be called as a witness at a subsequent proceeding. See comment [4] to rule 3.7 (\u201cIt is relevant that one or both parties could reasonably foresee that the lawyer would probably be a witness\u201d). Given the numbers of Dookhan defendants and of attorneys able to represent them, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>having plea counsel continue their representation of former clients is a sensible approach for resolving these cases in a timely and efficient manner. Plea counsel already will be familiar with a defendant\u2019s case and can expeditiously work toward bringing it to a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">We recognized in <em>Smaland, </em>461 Mass. at 227 n.20, that \u201ccombining the roles of advocate and witness may create a conflict of interest [as] governed by Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.7, 426 Mass. 1373 (1998) (conflict of interest), or Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.9, 426 Mass. 1342 (1998) (prior representation).\u201d See comment [1] and [5] to rule 3.7. The Commonwealth asserts that dual role representation presents a conflict of interest because the Commonwealth likely will elicit information from counsel that is harmful to a defendant, particularly an admission that, apart from the drug certificate, the evidence against the defendant was strong. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shraiar, </em>397 Mass. 16, 21 (1986) (\u201cA genuine conflict of interest arises whenever trial counsel is called upon to give testimony adverse to his client\u201d). Determining the existence of a conflict of interest is \u201cprimarily the responsibility of the lawyer involved,\u201d comment [5] to rule 3.7, and is a matter for discussion with the client. See Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.7 (b) (2). A defendant may consent to dual role representation notwithstanding a conflict of interest. See id; comment [5] to rule 1.7. See also <em>Perkins, </em>450 Mass. at 853. We conclude that Mass. R. Prof. C. 3.7 (a) does not bar dual role representation of a Dookhan defendant at a hearing on a motion to withdraw a guilty plea, although \u201cit would be particularly prudent first to secure client consent after consultation.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <em>Smaland, </em>461 Mass. at 226. Ultimately, as acknowledged by CPCS, the decision whether to continue with plea counsel or request the appointment of a new attorney should remain in the hands of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">7. <em>Scope of testimony by Dookhan defendants. </em>Finally, CPCS raises two related claims pertaining to the testimony of a Dookhan defendant at a hearing on a motion to withdraw a guilty plea. First, CPCS contends that cross-examination of a defendant should not be permitted to delve into the defendant\u2019s guilt or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>innocence of the underlying crime, unless the defendant asserts a claim of actual innocence. As we understand its argument, CPCS does not seek to preclude cross-examination regarding the alleged facts of a given case, acknowledging that the Commonwealth should be free to question the defendant about his or her assessment of the nature and strength of the evidence against the defendant. However, CPCS wants to prevent the Commonwealth from turning the defendant\u2019s request for postconviction relief into what CPCS views as a game of \u201cgotcha,\u201d where the Commonwealth\u2019s strategy is to ask the defendant about his or her guilt (and presumably elicit a response that he or she is not guilty) and then argue that the defendant is a liar because the defendant\u2019s testimony at the motion hearing contradicts his or her testimony from the plea colloquy. CPCS asserts that allowing the Commonwealth to pursue this line of cross-examination is unfair and prejudicial. Therefore, it continues, this court should limit the scope of cross-examination to questions concerning the defendant\u2019s knowledge about the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence at the time he or she pleaded guilty. We decline to adopt CPCS\u2019s proposed evidentiary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">As CPCS correctly points out, a Dookhan defendant at a hearing on a motion to withdraw a guilty plea \u201cmust demonstrate a reasonable probability that he would not have pleaded guilty had he known of Dookhan\u2019s misconduct.\u201d Scott, 467 Mass. at 355. \u201cUltimately, a defendant\u2019s decision to tender a guilty plea is a unique, individualized decision, and the relevant factors and their relative weight will differ from one case to the next.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356. We have emphasized that \u201cthe full context of the defendant\u2019s decision to enter a plea agreement will dictate the assessment of his claim that knowledge of Dookhan\u2019s misconduct would have influenced [his] decision to plead guilty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 357. A judge\u2019s determination whether a defendant has made the necessary showing will be based on \u201cthe totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">It is well established that the scope and extent of cross-examination is left to a judge\u2019s broad discretion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Horne, </em>466 Mass. 440, 447 (2013); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>431 Mass. 535, 538 (2000). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>408 Mass. 185, 192 (1990), <em>S.C., </em>430 Mass. 348 (1999), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Underwood, </em>358 Mass. 506, 513 (1970) Gudge determines extent to which \u201cthe accuracy, veracity, and credibility of a witness may be tested\u201d on cross-examination). Consequently, whether the Commonwealth should be allowed to cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>examine a defendant on his or her guilt or innocence of the underlying crime is a matter for the motion judge to decide. If permitted, the judge can assess the Commonwealth\u2019s arguments about the defendant\u2019s truthfulness in the context of defense counsel\u2019s countervailing arguments about the essential reasons for the defendant\u2019s guilty plea. Judges are aware that, on occasion, defendants have an incentive to plead guilty for reasons other than actual guilt, including to avoid the imposition of mandatory minimum sentences in the event they are found guilty after trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nikas, </em>431 Mass. 453, 455 (2000), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Second, and dovetailing with the issue just discussed, CPCS contends that the testimony of a Dookhan defendant at a hearing on a motion to withdraw a guilty plea should not be admissible at a subsequent trial on the defendant\u2019s guilt. In the view of CPCS, the Commonwealth cannot put a defendant in the position of having to surrender the privilege against self-incrimination in order to secure the allowance of the motion, and then turn around and use the defendant\u2019s testimony from the motion hearing against the defendant at trial. If such testimony is admissible at trial, CPCS continues, defendants will be deterred from seeking postconviction relief in the first place. CPCS argues that, in light of Dookhan\u2019s egregious misconduct, this result would be inherently unfair.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">In <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 U.S. 377 (1968), the United States Supreme Court considered the issue whether a defendant\u2019s testimony at a suppression hearing regarding his standing to allege a violation of his rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution could be admitted against him at trial on the question of his guilt or innocence. See <em>id. </em>at 382, 389-390. Given that the defendant would be obliged either to give up a valid Fourth Amendment claim, or effectively waive his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, the Court found it \u201cintolerable that one constitutional right should have to be surrendered in order to assert another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 394. Accordingly, the Court held that \u201cwhen a defendant testifies in support of a motion to suppress evidence on Fourth Amendment grounds, his testimony may not thereafter be admitted against him at trial on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>the issue of guilt unless he makes no objection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>425 Mass. 633, 637 (1997) (recognizing rule articulated in Simmons).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Here, although the rights asserted by a Dookhan defendant are somewhat different from those in <em>Simmons, </em>we reach a similar conclusion. A defendant has a \u201cconstitutional due process right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>411 Mass. 309, 310 (1991). See <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass. at 352. See also <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 684 (1984). For a Dookhan defendant, the ability to exercise the right to a fair trial is contingent, in the first instance, on the allowance of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea. However, the allowance of such a motion may depend in significant measure on the defendant\u2019s willingness to sacrifice the privilege against self-incrimination to enable the motion judge to assess the full context of the defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty. See <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass. at 357. Alternatively, a Dookhan defendant can sacrifice the right to a fair trial by asserting the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination at the hearing, thereby increasing the likelihood that his or her motion to withdraw a guilty plea will be denied. Having to make this choice places the defendant in an untenable position. On the one hand, the defendant is compelled to be a witness against himself or herself in order to obtain relief from egregious government misconduct that may well have tainted his or her conviction. On the other hand, the defendant is deterred from pursuing his or her postconviction rights under <em>Scott </em>by not seeking to withdraw the guilty plea, thereby perpetuating the injustice arising from Dookhan\u2019s misconduct. The relief afforded by the allowance of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea would be illusory if the Commonwealth then could turn around and use the defendant\u2019s testimony against him or her at trial. Accordingly, we conclude that the testimony of a Dookhan defendant at a hearing on a motion to withdraw a guilty plea is only admissible at a subsequent trial for impeachment purposes if the defendant chooses to testify.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>425 Mass. at 637, and cases cited (rule articulated in <em>Simmons, </em>390 U.S. at 394, \u201chas not been applied to exclude the use of prior inconsistent statements for impeachment purposes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">8. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>a defendant who has been granted a new trial based on Dookhan\u2019s misconduct at the Hinton drug lab cannot be charged with a more serious offense than that of which he or she initially was convicted under the terms of a plea agreement and, if convicted again, cannot be given a more severe sentence than that which originally was imposed; (2) the motion to intervene filed by CPCS is allowed; (3) a so-called \u201cglobal remedy\u201d will not be implemented at this time; (4) a lawyer who represented a Dookhan defendant at the plea stage of criminal proceedings is not barred by the advocate-witness rule from subsequently representing that defendant and testifying at an evidentiary hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw a guilty plea; (5) the scope of cross-examination of a Dookhan defendant at a hearing on a motion to withdraw a guilty plea is left to the broad discretion of the motion judge; and (6) the testimony of a Dookhan defendant at a hearing on a motion to withdraw a guilty plea is only admissible at a subsequent trial for impeachment purposes if the defendant chooses to testify. The case is remanded to the single justice for further proceedings, consistent with this opinion, as appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The details of Annie Dookhan\u2019s misconduct in the forensic drug laboratory of the William A.

R. Crim. P. 30 (b), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001), in a case involving the misconduct of Dookhan at the Hinton drug lab. Under the first prong of the analysis, a defendant must show egregious misconduct by the government that preceded the entry of the defendant\u2019s guilty plea and that occurred in the defendant\u2019s case. <em>Scott, supra </em>at 347-354. We recognized that, given the breadth and duration of Dookhan\u2019s malfeasance, it might be impossible for a defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>to show the required nexus between government misconduct and the defendant\u2019s own case. <em>Id. </em>at 351-352. Consequently, we established a special evidentiary rule whereby a defendant seeking to vacate a guilty plea under rule 30 (b) as a result of the revelation of Dookhan\u2019s misconduct, and proffering a drug certificate from the defendant\u2019s case signed by Dookhan on the line labeled \u201cAssistant Analyst,\u201d would be entitled to \u201ca conclusive presumption that egregious government misconduct occurred in the defendant\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352. Application of this conclusive presumption in a particular case meant that a defendant\u2019s evidentiary burden to establish each element of the first prong of the <em>Ferrara-Scott </em>framework was satisfied. <em>Id. </em>at 353-354. The defendant then had the burden under the second prong of the analysis of particularizing Dookhan\u2019s misconduct to his or her decision to tender a guilty plea. <em>Id. </em>at 354. That is to say, the defendant had to \u201cdemonstrate a reasonable probability that he [or she] would not have pleaded guilty had he [or she] known of Dookhan\u2019s misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 355.

L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E (b) (1). He pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of trafficking in cocaine (twenty-eight to one hundred grams), G.

After the revelation of Dookhan\u2019s misconduct, Rodriguez filed a motion to vacate his guilty plea pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. R 30 (b). A judge in the Superior Court allowed the motion. The Commonwealth then charged Rodriguez with trafficking in one hundred grams or more of cocaine, a jury convicted him of that charge, and he was sentenced to from eight years to eight years and one day in State prison. The case of Angel Rodriguez suggests that petitioners\u2019 fear is not baseless or unwarranted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b491-6\">It does not appear from the record that the charges against Creach actually were reduced as a consequence of his plea agreement with the Commonwealth.

If, following a Dookhan defendant\u2019s successful withdrawal of a guilty plea, the Commonwealth could reinstate previously dismissed charges that carry mandatory minimum sentences and reprosecute a defendant on all of the charges, the Commonwealth ultimately could benefit from Dookhan\u2019s misconduct.

R. A. P. 8 (e). It seeks to include in the record the transcript of a hearing before a special magistrate and other papers from Commonwealth vs. Cruz, Superior Ct., SUCR2009-10595 (Suffolk County). CPCS asserts that these papers are relevant to the question of the permissible scope of cross-examination when a Dookhan defendant testifies in support of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea. Defense attorneys have taken the position that cross-examination on the facts of the case should be limited to the defendant\u2019s understanding of the nature and extent of the prosecution\u2019s evidence. Prosecutors have argued that the \u201cfull context\u201d of a defendant\u2019s plea decision under <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass. at 357, opens the door to an inquiry encompassing the defendant\u2019s factual guilt. According to CPCS, rulings by special magistrates on this issue have varied widely. For example, in the Cruz case, <em>supra, </em>the special magistrate permitted the prosecutor, over objection, to cross-examine the defendant about his culpability for two drug offenses \u2014 what he had done, said, and known regarding the alleged contraband in question \u2014 and to ask the defendant whether he had pleaded guilty because, in fact, he was guilty. In the view of CPCS, the inclusion of these papers in the record will assist this court in deciding whether the testimony of a Dookhan defendant at a hearing on a motion to withdraw a guilty plea can be used in a subsequent reprosecution of the defendant. The Commonwealth has not filed an objection to CPCS\u2019s motion to supplement the record, and the single justice included the motion as part of her reservation and report to the full court. Because the transcript and other papers from the Cruz case provide helpful background information on this issue, we allow the motion to supplement the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b497-9\">CPCS has raised several additional issues in its motion to intervene.

L. c. 21 ID, \u00a7 5, CPCS is required to \u201cestablish, supervise and maintain a system for the appointment or assignment of counsel at any stage of a proceeding, either criminal or noncriminal in nature, provided, however, that the laws of the commonwealth or the rules of the supreme judicial court require that a person in such proceeding be represented by counsel; and, provided further, that such person is unable to obtain counsel by reason of his indigency.\u201d The Commonwealth asserts that G. L. c. 21 ID does not authorize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>CPCS to intervene on behalf of a broad class of unnamed defendants whom it may or may not represent. Plainly, not all Dookhan defendants will be represented by CPCS in the event they seek postconviction relief. Nonetheless, the claims that have been raised in these proceedings are fundamental to the mission and responsibilities of CPCS, and will impact defendants beyond those currently identified as clients of CPCS. See, e.g., <em>Edwards, petitioner, </em>464 Mass. 454, 455, 458 (2013) (CPCS allowed to intervene in case deciding whether, in determining reasonable compensation to be paid expert retained by indigent petitioner seeking release from commitment as sexually dangerous person, judge is bound by hourly rate set by CPCS); <em>Adoption of Meaghan, </em>461 Mass. 1006, 1006 (2012) (CPCS allowed to intervene to seek ruling whether father and child entitled to appointed counsel in case initiated by private parties involving termination of parental rights). For these reasons, the fact that CPCS has moved to intervene on behalf of a broad class of unnamed individuals is not a bar to the allowance of its motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b504-7\">We add that, in light of our conclusion, dual role representation at a Dookhan defendant\u2019s hearing on a motion to withdraw a guilty plea also does not run afoul of Rule 12 of the Rules of the Superior Court 1017 (LexisNexis 2014-2015), which states: \u201cNo attorney shall be permitted to take part in the conduct <em>of a trial </em>in which he has been or intends to be a witness for his client, except by special leave of the court\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b506-7\">The Commonwealth asserts that this issue is not ripe for review because the harm alleged by CPCS is hypothetical. For the reasons already articulated, we conclude that it is appropriate to consider CPCS\u2019s claim now in accordance with our broad powers of superintendence under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b507-7\">In accordance with Mass. R. Crim. R 12 (f), as appearing in 442 Mass. 1511 (2004), statements made by a Dookhan defendant at a plea colloquy are not admissible at a subsequent trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
