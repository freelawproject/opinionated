L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B, and one indictment charging dissemination of matter harmful to minors, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 28.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant presents two claims on appeal. First, he contends that, during the time period alleged in the indictment, \u00a7 28 was facially overbroad because it did not explicitly require the Commonwealth to prove that the defendant knew that the person receiving the harmful matter was a minor. Second, he argues that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice by suggesting that the defendant would have committed further sexual offenses against one of the child victims had the child not moved away. We conclude that, during the relevant time period, \u00a7 28 was not unconstitutionally overbroad because we interpret the statute to have implicitly required knowledge that the recipient was a minor as an element of the crime. We also conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s suggestion that the defendant would have committed further sexual offenses against the victim was improper but, in the context of the entire closing argument, did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. We therefore affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\"><em>Background. </em>The two victims were the defendant\u2019s nephews, sons of two different sisters of the defendant. In 2006, one victim, C.J., who was approximately eleven years old, moved with his mother and younger brother to Woburn, which is also where the defendant was living at CJ.\u2019s grandmother\u2019s house. A few days during each school week, and nearly every day during the summer, C.J. went to his grandmother\u2019s house where he and the defendant spent time together playing video games, using a computer, and playing sports. Because C.J. looked up to the defendant as a father figure, he did not feel uncomfortable when the defendant began asking him about his physical development through puberty. The defendant would routinely ask C.J. about any physical changes to his body and at one point asked if he had started to \u201cplay\u201d with his genitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">In the summer of 2007, when C.J. was approximately twelve years old, the defendant began asking to see his genitals. With no one else in the room, the defendant and C.J. would often be sitting on the bed in the defendant\u2019s bedroom, playing video games or watching television, and the defendant would ask to see if any pubescent changes had occurred. C.J. would then stand up or kneel on the bed and pull down his pants and underwear; the defendant would look and touch with his hand the pubic region <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>immediately above C.J.\u2019s penis, but would not touch the penis itself. The defendant did not show his genitals to C.J. or ask C.J. to perform any sexual act with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">This pattern of asking to see C.J\u2019s genitals and touching his pubic region occurred at least twice a week, and continued for about one year before C.J. began to feel uncomfortable. C.J. first viewed these interactions as appropriate for a father figure to have with a son, but he felt more uncomfortable after he recognized that the defendant was asking to see his genitals nearly every time he visited.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These interactions between the defendant and the victim stopped after C.J\u2019s family moved to Tewksbury in the summer of 2008, and shortly thereafter moved to New Hampshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The second victim, J.B., also lived in Woburn, with his mother, stepfather, and sister. In 2007, J.B. was approximately nine years old and in fourth grade, and often went after school to his grandmother\u2019s house, where the defendant lived. The defendant and J.B. had a close relationship; they played sports, attended sporting events, and went ice-skating together. For three years, when J.B. was in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades, the defendant went to his house to watch almost every Boston Bruins hockey game.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">In the summer before J.B. was starting either fourth or fifth grade, the defendant asked him how puberty was going, but J.B. did not know what puberty was. The defendant did not raise the topic again until the following winter. While the defendant and J.B. were alone watching television, the defendant asked, \u201cHow is puberty hitting you?\u201d The defendant said, \u201cWell, let me see then. I\u2019ll tell you how puberty is.\u201d J.B. then pulled down his pants and boxer shorts. From this point forward, about every other week, the defendant asked to see J.B.\u2019s penis and J.B. showed him. The defendant did not touch J.B.\u2019s penis during these interactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">On one occasion, when J.B. was in fifth grade, sometime between 2007 and 2008, the defendant asked him to look at something on the defendant\u2019s computer. J.B. sat on the defendant\u2019s lap while the defendant opened a computer program used for downloading music and video recordings. As the defendant scrolled through a list of pornographic video recordings, J.B. saw images of nude adult men and women displaying their genitals and engaging in sexual intercourse. The defendant then played a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>specific video recording, which showed a group of nude women using icicles as sexual toys. The defendant asked J.B. if he had ever searched for materials similar to what was shown in the video recording, and J.B. said \u201cno.\u201d As they watched the video recording, the defendant unbuttoned J.B.\u2019s pants and pulled down his pants and boxer shorts. The defendant grabbed J.B.\u2019s penis and stroked it with two of his fingers. J.B. did not recall any other instance where the defendant touched his genitals or showed him pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Dissemination of matter harmful to minors. </em>At the time of the charged conduct, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 28, as appearing in St. 1982, c. 603, \u00a7 2, provided, \u201cWhoever disseminates to a minor any matter harmful to minors, as defined in [G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 31], knowing it to be harmful to minors, or has in his possession any such matter with the intent to disseminate the same to minors\u201d shall be guilty of a crime.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Since then, the scope of the statute has twice been amended. In 2010, the Legislature amended \u00a7 31 to add to the definition of \u201cmatter\u201d \u201cany electronic communication including, but not limited to, electronic mail, instant messages, text messages, or any other communication created by means of use of the Internet or wireless network.\u201d St. 2010, c. 74, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In 2011, the Legislature amended \u00a7 28 explicitly to require that the dissemination be purposeful and \u201cto a person [the defendant] knows or believes to be a minor.\u201d St. 2011, c. 9, \u00a7 19.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>The defendant contends that until \u00a7 28 was amended to require, as an element of the offense, that the defendant disseminated the harmful matter to a person \u201che knows or believes to be a minor,\u201d the statute was substantially overbroad in violation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 16 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. \u201cThe First Amendment doctrine of substantial overbreadth... is predicated on the danger that an overly broad statute, if left in place, may cause persons whose expression is constitutionally protected to refrain from exercising their rights for fear of criminal sanctions\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Massachusetts </em>v. <em>Oakes, </em>491 U.S. 576, 581 (1989) (opinion of O\u2019Connor, J.). Although the defendant does not contend that he did not know that the victims were minors, he need not do so in order to challenge the constitutionality of the statute, because the overbreadth doctrine \u201cis an exception to the general rule that a person to whom a statute may be constitutionally applied cannot challenge the statute on the ground that it may be unconstitutionally applied to others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Bulldog Investors Gen. Partnership </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>460 Mass. 647, 676 (2011), cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 2377 (2012) (\u201cThe overbreadth doctrine allows an individual whose speech may be constitutionally regulated to argue that a law is unconstitutional because it infringes on the speech of others\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The premise underlying the defendant\u2019s overbreadth claim is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>that \u00a7 28 prior to amendment did not require as an element of the offense that the defendant knew that the recipient of the harmful matter was a minor. If that premise is correct, the statute would be constitutionally suspect because it would chill the non-obscene, sex-related speech of those who cannot reasonably ensure that the matter they disseminate will be seen only by adults. See <em>Reno </em>v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union, </em>521 U.S. 844, 875 (1997) (governmental interest \u201cin protecting children from harmful materials .. . does not justify an unnecessarily broad suppression of speech addressed to adults\u201d [citations omitted]). See also <em>Smith </em>v. <em>California, </em>361 U.S. 147, 153-154 (1959) (punishing bookseller for possession of obscene books without knowledge of obscene content would cause self-censorship and severely limit public access to constitutionally protected matter, because booksellers are limited in amount of reading material with which they can familiarize themselves and they would grow timid in face of \u201cabsolute criminal liability\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">In determining whether to construe the statute prior to amendment to require such knowledge, we apply two principles of statutory construction. First, \u201ca statute is to be construed where fairly possible so as to avoid constitutional questions.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>X-Citement Video, Inc., </em>513 U.S. 64, 69 (1994). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Disler, </em>451 Mass. 216, 228 (2008) (it is our duty to interpret statutes in manner that avoids constitutional difficulties \u201cif reasonable principles of interpretation permit it\u201d [citation omitted]). See also <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Borowski, </em>461 Mass. 415, 422 (2012) (\u201cwe have not hesitated to construe statutory language narrowly to avoid constitutional overbreadth\u201d); <em>Demetropolos </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>342 Mass. 658, 660 (1961) (\u201cwhere a statute may be construed as either constitutional or unconstitutional, a construction will be adopted which avoids an unconstitutional interpretation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Second, where First Amendment rights are at issue, we presume \u201cthat some form of scienter is to be implied in a criminal statute even if not expressed.\u201d <em>X-Citement Video, Inc., </em>513 U.S. at 69 (construing statute to require knowledge that performer in visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct was minor). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>354 Mass. 508, 510 (1968) (\u201cStatutes, purporting to create criminal offences which may impinge upon the public\u2019s access to constitutionally protected matter . . . , have been construed to require knowledge by the accused of the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>giving rise to criminality\u201d [quotation and citation omitted]); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corey, </em>351 Mass. 331, 332-333 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">In <em>Corey, </em>351 Mass. at 334, we applied both of these principles when interpreting an earlier version of \u00a7 28 to require scienter.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant was an employee in a Boston book store who sold a book entitled \u201cCandy\u201d to a seventeen year old girl who asked for the book by name. <em>Id. </em>at 332. The defendant argued that he could not be convicted under \u00a7 28 without evidence that he knew of the allegedly obscene content of the book; the Commonwealth conceded that it had offered no such evidence. <em>Id. </em>According to the Commonwealth, the absence of any language in the statute requiring scienter suggested that the Legislature intended to enact a strict liability criminal statute, much like it did when it enacted a strict liability criminal statute prohibiting the sale of liquor to minors. <em>Id. </em>at 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">We acknowledged that the Legislature had the authority in enacting criminal statutes to define criminal offenses that had no element of scienter, but also recognized that \u201ca different situation is presented when the legislation is in an area where First Amendment rights are involved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Where First Amendment rights are involved, \u201c[t]he [United States] Constitution requires proof of scienter to avoid the hazard of self-censorship of constitutionally protected material.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 332-333, quoting <em>Mishkin </em>v. <em>New York, </em>383 U.S. 502, 511 (1966). Thus, if \u00a7 28 had no scienter requirement, \u201cbooksellers, unable to familiarize themselves with all the material on their shelves, would tend to restrict sales to minors to the relatively few books of which they had some knowledge of the contents or character. The result would be an impediment to the sale to minors not only of unprotected matter but also of that which is constitutionally protected.\u201d <em>Corey, supra </em>at 334. We held that \u00a7 28 \u201cmust be read as requiring scienter.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">For similar reasons, we now construe \u00a7 28 prior to amendment to require scienter that the recipient was a minor. If scienter as to the recipient\u2019s age were not required, online booksellers and other Web site administrators who could not reasonably identify the age of every person who visits their Web sites would be discouraged from disseminating material that is appropriate for adults but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>harmful to minors. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Weidner, </em>235 Wis. 2d 306, 322 (Wis. 2000) (\u201cBy requiring an [IJnternet user ... to prove lack of knowledge regarding the age of the person exposed to material deemed harmful to a child, the [Wisconsin statute on dissemination of matter harmful to minors] effectively chills protected [I]ntemet communication to adults\u201d). Thus, interpreting the statute to require knowledge that the recipient is a minor is necessary to avoid impinging on public access to constitutionally protected matter. See Corey, 351 Mass. at 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">We interpret \u00a7 28 to include an implied element of scienter, not only to preserve the constitutionality of the statute, but also to reflect what we understand to be the legislative intent. First, we note that the statute explicitly requires that the defendant have knowledge that the matter disseminated is harmful to minors. See G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 28, as appearing in St. 1982, c. 603, \u00a7 2 (\u201cWhoever disseminates to a minor any matter harmful to minors . . . knowing it to be harmful to minors\u201d). Second, we previously construed \u00a7 28 to require that the act of dissemination be \u201cpurposeful or intentional\u201d rather than inadvertent, even though the statute itself did not explicitly state the level of intent necessary to prove dissemination. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Belcher, </em>446 Mass. 693, 696-697 (2006). Finally, because \u00a7 28 also made it a crime to possess any matter harmful to minors \u201cwith the intent to disseminate the same to minors,\u201d the Legislature likely intended that same intent be required to criminalize the dissemination of the same matter. See <em>X-Citement Video, Inc., </em>513 U.S. at 72 (\u201cthe presumption in favor of a scienter requirement should apply to each of the statutory elements that criminalize otherwise innocent conduct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Where we adopt a limiting construction of a statute to avoid substantial overbreadth, as we have done here by requiring scienter that the recipient is a minor, \u201cthe statute, as construed, \u2018may be applied to conduct occurring prior to the construction, provided such application affords fair warning to the defendants.\u2019 \u201d <em>Oakes, </em>491 U.S. at 584 (opinion of O\u2019Connor, J.), quoting <em>Dombrowski </em>v. <em>Pfister, </em>380 U.S. 479, 491 n.7 (1965). See <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>495 U.S. 103, 119 (1990) (\u201cCourts routinely construe statutes so as to avoid the statutes\u2019 potentially overbroad reach, apply the statute in that case, and leave the statute in place\u201d). Here, where there can be no issue of fair warning, we conclude that \u00a7 28 included an implied scienter requirement before the 2011 amendment made that requirement explicit and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>was therefore not unconstitutionally overbroad.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Having construed \u00a7 28 prior to amendment to require knowledge that the recipient of the harmful matter was a minor, we must address whether the defendant\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 28 can stand where the judge\u2019s final instructions to the jury did not inform them of this element. See <em>Osborne, </em>495 U.S. at 118, citing <em>Shuttlesworth </em>v. <em>Birmingham, </em>382 U.S. 87, 91-92 (1965) (\u201cwhere a State Supreme Court narrows an unconstitutionally overbroad statute, the State must ensure that defendants are convicted under the statute as it is subsequently construed and not as it was originally written\u201d). Where, as here, the defendant did not object to the judge\u2019s jury instructions, we determine whether the absence of such an instruction created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Belcher, </em>446 Mass. at 696. We conclude that there was no such risk in this case, where the defendant was the uncle of the victim, J.B., and knew him very well, and where J.B. was well below eighteen years of age when the defendant showed him the pornographic material.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">2. <em>Closing argument. </em>The defendant also contends that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument improperly suggested that the defendant would have touched CJ. in the same manner that he touched J.B. if C.J. had not moved away. The prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-6\">\u201cWas [the defendant] able to progress any further than touching [C.J.]\u2019s pubic area? No. Why not? Because [C.J.] left, that\u2019s why. Not because he was done learning about sex from his uncle, because he physically moved to another state. You heard eighth grade he left. He was in Tewksbury for a short amount of time and then New Hampshire. At that point they saw each other infrequently, not every day. The access col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>lapsed and his opportunity at that point to take it further vanished.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The prosecutor later reemphasized this theory, stating, \u201cNow the point that [the defendant] got to with [J.B.] shows you exactly what his intent was when he started with [C.J.]. Due to circumstances beyond his control, that is a couple of hundred miles maybe or a state border, he was unable to reach that point with [C.J.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">The defendant contends that the prosecutor\u2019s argument regarding the sexual crimes that the defendant would have inflicted on C.J. had C.J. not moved was improper because it was speculative and played on the jury\u2019s fear that, if they found the defendant not guilty, he would \u201ctake it further\u201d and commit more sexual crimes. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ayoub, 11 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 563, 569 (2010) (statements that \u201cinvited speculation about offenses uncommitted and ... uncharged\u201d are imprudent). Because the defendant failed to object to the closing argument, we review whether the prosecutor\u2019s argument created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Renderos, </em>440 Mass. 422, 425 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">The prosecutor\u2019s remarks were improper in that they suggested that had C.J. not moved away, the defendant might have committed additional sexual offenses against him, which invited the risk that the jury would divert their focus from the evaluation of the evidence regarding the defendant\u2019s alleged crimes, and consider instead what the defendant might have done under different circumstances. A prosecutor may make reasonable inferences as to what might have actually happened during the commission of the alleged crimes, but may not argue what might have happened had the victim not moved away.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">The challenged remarks, however, followed the defendant\u2019s closing argument, and must be evaluated in that context. See <em>Renderos, </em>440 Mass. at 425 (prosecutor\u2019s remarks evaluated in context of entire closing argument, judge\u2019s instructions of law, and evidence at trial); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grandison, </em>433 Mass. 135, 143 (2001) (prosecutor may fairly respond to defendant\u2019s closing argument). In his closing argument, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel contended that the defendant was \u201ctrying to introduce these young men to this whole idea of sexual development, maturity, puberty and everything that goes along with sex education,\u201d albeit in a clumsy manner, and therefore \u201c[n]one of these events were [\u00bf\u25a0ic] indecent.\u201d The prosecutor countered that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>defendant\u2019s touching of the victims was not for the purpose of their sex education, but for his own sexual gratification and that the defendant took advantage of the trust he had built with the victims. In this context, a reasonable jury were more likely to have understood the prosecutor\u2019s statements that suggested what the defendant might have done, had C.J. not moved away, as commentary on the intent of the defendant\u2019s earlier touching of C.J., rather than on the defendant\u2019s future sexual dangerousness. The prosecutor\u2019s statement, \u201c[T]he point that [the defendant] got to with [J.B.] shows you exactly what his intent was when he started with [C.J.],\u201d directed the jury to consider the defendant\u2019s conduct with J.B. in evaluating the defendant\u2019s intent in touching C.J. Having considered the prosecutor\u2019s improper statements in the context of the closing arguments and recognizing the strength of the evidence against the defendant, we conclude that there was no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>Because G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 28, was constitutional at the time of the defendant\u2019s charged conduct, and the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, we affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-7\">An additional charge of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen was nol pressed before trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b154-9\">The defendant also routinely kissed C.J. on the lips when they parted.

The plaintiffs argued that \u00a7 28 was unconstitutionally overbroad because it did not require that a defendant <em>know </em>that the intended recipient of the harmful matter was a minor. <em>Id. </em>at 4-5. The plaintiffs reasoned that those who disseminate \u201csexually frank\u201d information through a generally accessible Web site cannot verify the age of every individual who accesses their Web site; therefore, they cannot prevent minors from viewing information that might be harmful to them but appropriate for adults, without significantly limiting adults from accessing this information. <em>Id. </em>at 4, 5 n.3. The Commonwealth agreed that, if \u00a7 28 did not require that the sender know that the recipient was a minor, the statute would be unconstitutionally overbroad. <em>Id. </em>at 5. The judge noted that she could not construe the statute to require such knowledge as an element of the offense because \u201cin the absence of an explicit state court adjudication . .. revision of a state statute by a federal court would be inappropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b158-8\">The relevant portions of the earlier version of \u00a7 28 read, \u201cWhoever sells . . . to a person under the age of eighteen years a book... which is obscene, indecent or impure, or manifestly tends to corrupt the morals of youth . . . shall be punished . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corey, </em>351 Mass. 331, 331 (1966), quoting G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 28, as amended through St. 1959, c. 492, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b160-5\">On appeal, the Commonwealth also argues that the defendant\u2019s overbreadth challenge was rendered moot by the 2011 amendment, even though the amendment was not effective during the time period covered by the indictment. The Commonwealth\u2019s argument rests on the plurality opinion of Justice O\u2019Connor in <em>Massachusetts </em>v. <em>Oakes, </em>491 U.S. 576, 582 (1989), joined by three other Justices, which concluded that \u201coverbreadth analysis is inappropriate if the statute being challenged has been amended or repealed.\u201d Justice O\u2019Connor reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">\u201cOverbreadth is a judicially created doctrine designed to prevent the chilling of protected expression. An overbroad statute is not void ab initio, but rather voidable, subject to invalidation notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s unprotected conduct out of solicitude to the First Amendment rights of parties not before the court. Because the special concern that animates the overbreadth doctrine is no longer present after the amendment or repeal of the challenged statute, we need not extend the benefits of the doctrine to a defendant whose conduct is not protected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 584. Justice Scalia wrote a separate opinion, Part I of which was joined by four other Justices, which stated that a subsequent legislative amendment of a statute does not \u201celiminate the basis for the overbreadth challenge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 585-586. Justice Scalia reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-8\">\u201cThe overbreadth doctrine serves to protect constitutionally legitimate speech not merely ex post, that is, after the offending statute is enacted, but also ex ante, that is, when the legislature is contemplating what sort of statute to enact. If the promulgation of overbroad laws affecting speech was cost free, as Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s new doctrine would make it \u2014 that is, if <em>no </em>conviction of constitutionally proscribable conduct would be lost, so long as the offending statute was narrowed before the final appeal \u2014 then legislatures would have significantly reduced incentive to stay within constitutional bounds in the first place\u201d (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 586. It was only because Justice Scalia concluded that the statute prior to amendment was not impermissibly overbroad that Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s opinion had the five votes necessary to announce the judgment of the court to vacate the judgment below and remand for further proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 585, 588, 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">Several circuit courts of the United States Court of Appeals have agreed that a subsequent amendment of a statute renders moot an overbreadth defense. See, e.g., <em>National Advertising Co. </em>v. <em>Miami, </em>402 F.3d 1329, 1332 (11th Cir. 2005), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1170 (2006); <em>Stephenson </em>v. <em>Davenport Community Sch. Dist., </em>110 F.3d 1303, 1311-1312 (8th Cir. 1997); <em>Kentucky Right to Life, Inc. </em>v. <em>Terry, </em>108 F.3d 637, 644 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 860 (1997). Yet, as the defendant notes, part I of Justice Scalia\u2019s opinion was the \u201conly proposition to which five Members of the Court [had] subscribed.\u201d <em>Oakes, supra </em>at 591 n.1 (Brennan, J., dissenting). The Supreme Court has explained that where \u201cno single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, \u2018the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds ....\u2019\u201d <em>Marks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>430 U.S. 188, 193 (1977), quoting <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>428 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>153, 169 n.15 (1976). However, the Court has also acknowledged that this test \u201cis more easily stated than applied.\u201d <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>United States, </em>511 U.S. 738, 745 (1994). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robison, </em>521 F.3d 1319,1323-1324 (11th Cir. 2008) (\u201cnarrowest grounds\u201d approach does not make sense where two opinions \u201csimply set forth different criteria\u201d and one opinion does not constitute subset of broader opinion). \u201cSince <em>Marks, </em>several members of the Court have indicated that whenever a decision is fragmented such that no single opinion has the support of five Justices, lower courts should examine the plurality, concurring and <em>dissenting </em>opinions to extract the principles that a majority has embraced\u201d (emphasis added). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>467 F.3d 56, 65 (1st Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 948 (2007). Because we construe the statute prior to amendment to be constitutional, we need not determine the appropriate method of interpreting fragmented Supreme Court decisions in order to decide whether, under <em>Oakes, </em>the 2011 amendment of \u00a7 28 rendered the defendant\u2019s overbreadth challenge moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
