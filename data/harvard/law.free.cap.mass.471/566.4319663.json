L. c. 149, \u00a7 148B, which makes it a violation of the statute to fail \u201cto properly classify an individual as an employee,\u201d applies to real estate salespersons licensed under, and affiliated with and working for, a licensed brokerage firm pursuant to G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 87RR. A Superior Court judge concluded that the independent contractor statute did not apply in these circumstances to the salespersons in this industry. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the material undisputed facts. The defendants Jacob Realty, LLC (Jacob Realty); NextGen Realty, Inc. (NextGen); and RentMyUnit.Com, Inc., doing business as Boardwalk Properties (Boardwalk Properties) (collectively, business entities), are licensed Massachusetts real estate brokerage firms that are in the business of renting and selling real estate in Massachusetts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendants Demetrios Salpoglou and Yuan Huang are members of Jacob Realty and shareholders of NextGen and Boardwalk Properties, and are involved in the operations of these business entities. Salpoglou serves as the broker of record for the business entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">The plaintiffs Nesto Monell, Jonathan Gibson, Rachael Butcher, and Lindsey Bumes were licensed real estate salespersons who worked for Jacob Realty under its real estate broker\u2019s license. The plaintiff Ann McGovern was a licensed real estate salesperson who worked for NextGen under its real estate broker\u2019s license. The plaintiff Benjamin Smith was a licensed real estate salesperson who worked for Boardwalk Properties under its real estate broker\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Throughout the course of their relationship, the defendant business entities classified the plaintiffs as independent contractors.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant entities required the plaintiffs to work sixty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>\u201cfront desk hours\u201d during training<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and, thereafter, in some cases complete monthly \u201coffice hours\u201d duty, which involved answering telephone calls from, and greeting, prospective clients.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The salespersons were able to select the \u201coffice hours\u201d that they wished to work. The business entities, however, allowed salespersons only one shift change every two months.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">At the commencement of their relationship with the business entities, the plaintiffs signed nondisclosure, nonsolicitation, and noncompete agreements<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and were required to undergo a training program. The business entities encouraged the plaintiffs to purchase a day planner and required them to obtain a cellular telephone with a \u201c617\u201d area code,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to adhere to a dress code, and to submit to various disciplinary actions if they did not meet their productivity goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The defendant entities compensate their salespersons pursuant to a commission policy. Under the policy salespersons are paid on a \u201ccommission-only basis\u201d and expressly will not be treated as employees \u201cwith respect to compensation for taxes or any other purpose.\u201d A commission is earned on completion by the salesperson of a rental or sales transaction involving a client\u2019s real estate. The commission due to the salesperson usually amounts to a percentage (typically fifty per cent) of a transaction\u2019s gross commission, less any applicable deductions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The business entities receive the balance as their portion of the fee charged to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>client. Commissions are paid \u201conly when a transaction is completed in its entirety\u201d as defined by the policy. Pursuant to the policy, the business entities \u201cwill issue [a] Form 1099-MISC\u201d to each salesperson and each salesperson \u201cagrees to provide [the business entities] with a signed W-9 [form].\u201d Thus, the plaintiffs were responsible for paying their own taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">In 2011, the plaintiffs filed a complaint against the defendants in the Superior Court. As relevant here, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants violated the independent contractor statute by misclassifying them as independent contractors when they actually were employees.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On this count of the complaint, the plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment, which the judge denied. The judge then granted partial summary judgment in favor of the defendants.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The judge determined that there is a conflict between the independent contractor and real estate licensing statutes insofar as a real estate salesperson would not be able to satisfy all three indicia of an independent contractor relationship while simultaneously complying with the real estate licensing statute. Based on his determination that the real estate licensing statute was more recently amended and is more specific than the independent contractor statute, the judge concluded that, pursuant to statutory construction principles, the independent contractor statute did not control, meaning that the defendants did not fail properly to classify the plaintiffs as employees and therefore could not be liable for a violation of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148B.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">2. <em>Standard of review. </em>Summary judgment is appropriate where there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 716 (1991); Mass. R. Civ. R 56 (c), as amended, 436 Mass. 1404 (2002). Moreover, \u201c[w]e exercise de novo review over questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>of statutory construction.\u201d <em>Atlanticare Med. Ctr. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Med. Assistance, </em>439 Mass. 1, 6 (2003). Because the issue before us is one of statutory construction, we begin by providing an overview of the relevant statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">3. <em>Statutory overview, </em>a. <em>Independent contractor statute. </em>The Commonwealth\u2019s wage laws are set forth in provisions in G. L. c. 149 (Wage Act). Within the Wage Act is the independent contractor statute. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148B. Effective July 19, 2004, the Legislature amended \u00a7 148B by striking out its language and replacing it in its entirety. See St. 2004, c. 193, \u00a7 26. The statute has not since been amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">The independent contractor statute states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-7\"><em>\u201c(a) </em>For the purpose of this chapter and chapter 151[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] an individual performing any service, except as authorized under this chapter, shall be considered to be an employee under those chapters unless:\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-8\">\u201c(1) the individual is free from control and direction in connection with the performance of the service, both under his contract for the performance of service and in fact; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-9\">\u201c(2) the service is performed outside the usual course of the business of the employer; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-10\">\u201c(3) the individual is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business of the same nature as that involved in the service performed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-11\"><em>\u201c(b) </em>The failure to withhold federal or state income taxes . . . shall not be considered in making a determination under this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-12\"><em>\u201c(d) </em>Whoever fails to properly classify an individual as an employee according to this section and in so doing fails to comply, in any respect, with [G. L. c. 149], or [G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1, 1A, IB, 2B, 15, or 19], or [G. L. c. 62B],[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>] shall be punished and shall be subject to all of the criminal and civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>remedies, including debarment [from public bidding], as provided in [\u00a7 27C] of this chapter. Whoever fails to properly classify an individual as an employee according to this section and in so doing violates [G. L. c. 152][<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>] shall be punished as provided in [G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 14,] and shall be subject to all of the civil remedies, including debarment [from public bidding], provided in [\u00a7 27C] of this chapter. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148B.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">As noted above, the independent contractor statute was adopted as part of St. 2004, c. 193, which is entitled \u201cAn Act further regulating public construction in the Commonwealth.\u201d The act\u2019s emergency preamble states the purpose of the act is \u201cto regulate further public construction in the commonwealth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although the statute was part of legislation making changes to the public construction industry, the Legislature kept it in c. 149, thus leaving it applicable to a wide range of industries. See <em>Lipsitt </em>v. <em>Plaud, </em>466 Mass. 240, 245 (2013) (since enactment of Wage Act in 1886, Legislature has broadened scope of employees covered).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">We have stated that the purpose of the independent contractor statute is \u201cto protect workers by classifying them as employees, and thereby grant them the benefits and rights of employment, where the circumstances indicate that they are, in fact, employees.\u201d <em>Depianti </em>v. <em>Jan-Pro Franchising Int'l, Inc., </em>465 Mass. 607, 620 (2013), quoting <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Eastern Connection Operating, Inc., </em>465 Mass. 191, 198 (2013). See <em>Cumpata </em>v. <em>Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mass., Inc., </em>113 F. Supp. 2d 164, 168 (D. Mass. 2000) (\u201cWage Act is meant to protect employees from the dictates and whims of shrewd employers\u201d). Indeed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-8\">\u201c[m]isclassification not only hurts the individual employee; it also imposes significant financial burdens on the Federal government and the Commonwealth in lost tax and insurance revenues. Moreover, it gives an employer who misclassifies employees as independent contractors an unfair competitive advantage over employers who correctly classify their employees and bear the concomitant financial burden.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number><em>Somers </em>v. <em>Converged Access, Inc., </em>454 Mass. 582, 593 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">To this end, the independent contractor statute \u201cestablishes a framework for determining whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor.\u201d <em>Depianti, </em>465 Mass. at 621. The statute establishes a presumption that \u201can individual performing any service\u201d is an employee. <em>Id. </em>See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148B <em>(a) </em>(\u201can individual performing any service ... shall be considered to be an employee\u201d). Next, the statute \u201clays out three indicia [or factors] of an independent contractor relationship, all three of which must be established to rebut the presumption of employment.\u201d <em>Depianti, supra. </em>In interpreting the statute, we have stated that, \u201c[i]n light of the statute\u2019s broad remedial purpose, \u2018it would be an error to imply ... a limitation where the statutory language does not require it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Psy-Ed Corp. </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>459 Mass. 697, 708 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">b. <em>Real estate licensing and registration scheme. </em>General Laws c. 112, \u00a7\u00a7 87PP through 87DDDx/2, and G. L. c. 112, \u00a7\u00a7 65A through 65E, set forth the licensing and registration provisions governing real estate brokers and salespersons.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> A real estate \u201cbroker,\u201d for purposes here, is defined as including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\">\u201cany person who for another person and for a fee, commission or other valuable consideration, or with the intention or in the expectation or upon the promise of receiving or collecting a fee, commission or other valuable consideration, does any of the following: \u2014 sells, exchanges, purchases, rents or leases, or negotiates, or offers, attempts or agrees to negotiate the sale, exchange, purchase, rental or leasing of any real estate, or lists or offers, attempts or agrees to list any real estate, or buys or offers to buy, sell or offers to sell. . . real estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 87PP. In contrast, a real estate \u201csalesman\u201d or salesperson is \u201can individual who performs any act or engages in any transaction included in the foregoing definition of a broker, except the completing of the negotiation of any agreement or transaction which results or is intended to result in the sale, exchange, purchase, renting or leasing of any real estate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Both brokers and salespersons are required to be licensed. G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 87RR. \u201cThe examination for a [salesperson\u2019s] license <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>shall be based upon the same general subject matter as for a broker\u2019s license, but shall be more elementary in nature.\u201d G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 87SS.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Real estate salespersons must conduct business with, or be affiliated with, a licensed broker. G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 87RR. See 254 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.00(6) (1998) (\u201cA licensed salesperson must be engaged by a licensed broker and a licensed salesperson shall not conduct his own real estate business\u201d). A real estate salesperson may affiliate with only one broker. G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 87VV (when real estate salesperson affiliates with broker, salesperson \u201cshall not act as [salesperson] for any other licensed broker while so affiliated, nor accept any valuable consideration for the performance of any act as a real estate [salesperson] from any person except the broker with whom he [or she] is affiliated\u201d). Concerning the relationship between the broker and his or her affiliated salesperson, \u00a7 87RR provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">\u201cNo [salesperson] may conduct or operate his [or her] own real estate business nor act except as the representative of a real estate broker who shall be responsible for the [salesperson] and who must approve the negotiation and completion by the [salesperson] of any transaction or agreement which results or is intended to result in the sale, exchange, purchase, renting or leasing of any real estate or in a loan secured or to be secured by mortgage or other encumbrance upon real estate. No [salesperson] shall be affiliated with more than one broker at the same time nor shall any [salesperson] be entitled to any fee, commission or other valuable consideration or solicit or accept the same from any person except his [or her] licensed broker in connection with any such agreement or transaction. A [salesperson] may be affiliated with a broker either as an employee or as an independent contractor and may, by agreement, be paid as an outside salesperson on a commission-only basis, but shall be under such supervision of said broker as to ensure compliance with this section and said broker shall be responsible with the [salesperson] for any violation of [G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 87AAA,] committed by said [salesperson].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Section 87AAA enumerates numerous grounds for the suspension, revocation, or refusal to renew the license of a broker or salesperson. These grounds include a range of conduct, the prohibition of which is intended to promote fairness and integrity in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>real estate transactions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>See 254 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.00 (2005) (setting forth professional standards of practice as well as additional grounds for discipline).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">4. <em>Discussion. </em>In this appeal, we address the conflict between the independent contractor statute and the real estate licensing statute which, respectively, support the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that they are \u201cemployees\u201d and the defendants\u2019 claim that the plaintiffs are or can be \u201cindependent contractors.\u201d The plaintiffs rely on the independent contractor statute insofar as it creates a presumptive employee status that, in its application, includes real estate salespersons. The defendants rely on the real estate licensing statute providing that a \u201c[salesperson] may be affiliated with a broker <em>either </em>as an employee or as an independent contractor.\u201d See G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 87RR.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">\u201cThe general and familiar rule is that a statute must be interpreted according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished.\u201d <em>Lowery </em>v. <em>Klemm, </em>446 Mass. 572, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>576-577 (2006), quoting <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934). Clear and unambiguous language in a statute is conclusive as to legislative intent. <em>Commissioner of Correction </em>v. <em>Superior Court Dep\u2019t of the Trial Court, </em>446 Mass. 123, 124 (2006). In addition, \u201ca remedial statute . . . should be given a broad interpretation ... in light of its purpose ... to \u2018promote the accomplishment of its beneficent design.\u2019 \u201d <em>Seller\u2019s Case, </em>452 Mass. 804, 810 (2008), quoting <em>Neff </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Indus. Accs., </em>421 Mass. 70, 73 (1995). In cases \u201c[w]here two or more statutes relate to the same subject matter, they should be constmed together so as to constitute a harmonious whole consistent with the legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Federal Nat\u2019l Mtge. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Hendricks, </em>463 Mass. 635, 641 (2012), quoting <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513-514 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">As an initial matter, there is no question that the independent contractor statute is a remedial statute. See <em>Depianti, 465 </em>Mass. at 621. It thus should be given a construction that furthers, not defeats, its purpose. See <em>id. </em>The difficulty in seeking to construe it in harmony with the real estate licensing statute, however, is that the real estate licensing statute makes it impossible for a real estate salesperson to satisfy the three factors required to achieve independent contractor status, all of which must be satisfied to defeat the presumption of employee status. For instance, under the second factor of the independent contractor statute, the employer must prove that \u201cthe service [of the worker] is performed outside the usual course of the business of the employer.\u201d G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148B <em>(a) </em>(2). Because under G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 87RR, \u201c[n]o [salesperson] may conduct or operate his [or her] own real estate business nor act except as the representative of a real estate broker,\u201d an employer can never prove that the service is performed outside the usual course of the employer\u2019s business. Under the express language of \u00a7 87RR, a salesperson is prohibited from performing any services other than as the broker\u2019s representative and as part of the broker\u2019s business. Under the third factor of the independent contractor statute, the employer must prove that the worker \u201cis customarily engaged in an independently established\u201d business in the real estate industry. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148B <em>(a) </em>(3). General Laws c. 112, \u00a7 87RR, however, prohibits a real estate salesperson from operating his or her own real estate business. Thus, compliance with this third factor also is not possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>The exclusion of real estate salespersons from independent contractor status clearly was not intended by the Legislature. While \u00a7 87RR expressly authorizes a real estate salesperson to affiliate with a broker as an employee, it <em>also </em>expressly authorizes an association as an <em>independent contractor. </em>See <em>id. </em>(\u201cA [salesperson] may be affiliated with a broker <em>either </em>as an employee <em>or </em>as an independent contractor ...\u201d [emphasis added]). We cannot view this express language as superfluous. See <em>Casa Loma, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>377 Mass. 231, 234 (1979) (\u201cIt is a common tenet of statutory construction, that, wherever possible, no provision of a legislative enactment should be treated as superfluous\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Unlike the judge, we do not view the 2010 amendment to \u00a7 87RR to be instructive in resolving the conflict. The 2010 amendment to \u00a7 87RR added language authorizing brokers and salespersons to enter into agreements whereby a real estate salesperson could be paid on a commission-only basis. See St. 2010, c. 307, \u00a7 1 (as applying to salespersons, adding in second paragraph, in third sentence, \u201cand may, by agreement, be paid as an outside salesperson on a commission-only basis\u201d). The judge concluded that, by virtue of this amendment and, in contrast, of the independent contractor statute being left intact, the Legislature intended that real estate salespersons qualify as independent contractors despite the inherent level of control brokers must exercise over them. Although this interpretation is reasonable, it is not dispositive of the issue before us, because when enacting St. 2010, c. 307, \u00a7 1, the Legislature could have deleted the reference in \u00a7 87RR that permits a real estate salesperson to be affiliated with a broker <em>either </em>as an employee or as an independent contractor. The Legislature took no action regarding the nature of this affiliation. Thus, the amendment does not reflect an affirmation that a real estate salesperson is an independent contractor. It reflects an affirmation that the salesperson may be an independent contractor, but he or she also may be an employee.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Where the Legislature left the reference in place regarding the nature of the affiliation, we conclude that the 2010 amendment simply was intended to address how a real estate salesperson, whether an employee <em>or </em>an independent contractor, could be paid, authorizing payment in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>the form of commissions only.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The amendment cannot be said to speak to the nature of the affiliation between the broker and salesperson other than confirming the fact that the affiliation may be either as an employee or as an independent contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The judge\u2019s reliance on the familiar canon of construction providing that a specific statute, in this case \u00a7 87RR, controls over the provisions of a general statute, such as the independent contractor statute, however, is appropriate here. See <em>TBI, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Health of N. </em>Andover, 431 Mass. 9, 18 (2000); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. (No. 1), </em>425 Mass. 210, 215 (1997). As outlined earlier, real estate brokers are responsible for their affiliated salespersons\u2019 compliance with a broad range of statutory provisions and regulations. No doubt this supervision and control has been required due in part to the difference in training and testing that is required of real estate brokers in comparison to salespersons. It also necessarily is in place to protect the public, namely the consumers who are selling, purchasing, leasing, or renting real estate in a highly regulated field. Despite that level of supervision and control mandated by law, \u00a7 87RR nevertheless expressly preserves a salesperson\u2019s ability to be affiliated with a broker as either an employee or an independent contractor. Thus, it is \u00a7 87RR that controls in this instance, not the more general independent contractor statute. Were we to conclude otherwise, we would be subjecting real estate brokerage firms to potential criminal penalties for misclassifying their real estate salespersons in a manner expressly authorized by the real estate licensing statute. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148B <em>(d) </em>(failure to properly classify individual as employee and to comply with other provisions of Wage Act or Fair Minimum Wage Law subjects employer to criminal penalties).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">That being said, we underscore the limited nature of our holding. The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged four counts: the first for misclassification under the independent contractor statute, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148B; the second for failing to make timely payment of wages and taking improper deductions, under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148; the third for failure to pay the State statutory minimum wage for all hours worked, in violation of G. L. c. 151, \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq.; the fourth for failure to pay time and one-half for hours worked in excess of forty hours per week, in violation of G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>See note 10, <em>supra. </em>The judge granted summary judgment to the defendants only on the first count. Following the judge\u2019s decision, the plaintiffs dismissed the remaining counts without prejudice in order to pursue this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Because we agree with the Superior Court judge that the independent contractor statute does not apply to real estate salespersons, we conclude that the judge properly granted summary judgment on the first count: the plaintiffs cannot prevail on a claim based on a statute that does not apply to them. In reaching that conclusion, however, we take no position on whether the plaintiffs in fact are employees or independent contractors, or on how, in the absence of the framework established by the independent contractor statute, it may be determined whether a real estate salesperson is properly classified as an independent contractor or employee. Earlier proposed legislation specifically provided that \u201ca [salesperson] or broker may be affiliated with a broker either as an employee or as an independent contractor, as determined by their written agreement and customary work practices.\u201d St. 2008, c. 304, \u00a7 8. The Governor, however, disapproved this language, concluding that it \u201cwould allow real estate sales persons and brokers to rely on written agreements to avoid the classification rules for independent contractors.\u201d See 2008 House Doc. No. 5075. The statute ultimately enacted expressly stated that a commission-only compensation structure may be established \u201cby agreement.\u201d G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 87RR. It does not, however, indicate how a broker and real estate salesperson may create an independent contractor relationship, rather than an employment relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Because the plaintiffs based their argument on appeal on the contention that they are employees under the framework set forth in the independent contractor statute, they did not address how the court should determine the nature of their relationship if the court determines, as we have, that the framework does not apply. In light of the potential impact of that issue on the real estate industry as a whole and its significant ramifications for real estate salespersons\u2019 access to the rights and benefits of employment, we think it prudent to leave that issue\u2019s resolution to another day, when it has been fully briefed and argued. Should the Legislature be so inclined, it may wish to clarify how a real estate salesperson may gain employee status under the real estate licensing statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>order denying the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment and granting partial summary judgment to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b581-9\">The defendants deny that defendant Boston Pads, LLC, operates a real estate office and that it had any real estate agents associated with it. The defendants contend that Boston Pads, LLC, is a professional consulting services firm that does not trade, lease, buy, or sell real estate for commissions. For the purpose of this opinion, when we refer to the defendants or to the business entities, such references shall not include Boston Pads, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b581-10\">The defendants assert that the business entities are legally distinct entities and that a salesperson associated with one business entity was not otherwise associated with another business entity. This assertion has no bearing on the issues before us. Therefore, we decline to address the point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b582-7\">During \u201cfront desk hours,\u201d the business entities asked salespersons to perform \u201cwarm calling,\" which included speaking with landlords, entering information into the business entities\u2019 database, and arranging times to meet with landlords to obtain keys and visit properties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b582-8\">Specifically, the training guide provided that during office hours shifts the salespersons were to answer the telephone, greet clients and landlords, take out the trash, update facsimiles, telephone landlords, acquire new listings, and answer agent telephone calls. Under the guide, salespersons were prohibited during this time to schedule showings of available apartments for rent or property for sale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b582-9\">Various forms used by the business entities, including an application for employment, an equal opportunity statement, and an antiharassment policy, contained language referencing the salesperson\u2019s \u201cemployment\u201d with the business entities. The defendants admit that the various forms were used by them at one time or another, but make no admissions regarding whether the forms were used with the named plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b582-10\">The business entities instructed salespersons on what information they were required to enter into their cellular telephones and on how they were to answer their telephones.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b582-11\">Deductions include a monthly \u201cdesk fee\u201d of fifty dollars for part-time salespersons and seventy-five dollars for full-time salespersons. For salesper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>sons who elect to participate in a \u201cfarm program,\u201d whereby a contractor would manually update a salesperson\u2019s real estate listings on Web sites, a deduction of five dollars per day also is assessed. There is a dispute in the record whether the plaintiffs were compelled to elect to join the farm program.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b583-8\">The plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants failed to pay them wages owed under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148; failed to compensate them in accordance with minimum wage laws pursuant to G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 20; and failed to pay them time and one-half for all hours worked over forty hours per week in violation of G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A. The judge did not rule on these claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b583-9\">The plaintiffs then filed an assented-to motion to dismiss the remaining counts of their complaint without prejudice should the judge\u2019s ruling be reversed on appeal, which was allowed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b584-13\">General Laws c. 151 is known as the minimum fair wage law and has provisions pertaining to the minimum fair wage as well as overtime pay. G. L. c. 151, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 1A, IB, 22.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b584-14\">General Laws c. 62B sets forth the Commonwealth\u2019s wage withholding laws.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b585-9\">General Laws c. 152 pertains to worker\u2019s compensation benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b585-10\">Under the Wage Act provisions in G. L. c. 149, the Legislature has also broadened the type of eligible compensation covered, extending coverage to commissions that are \u201cdefinitely determined\u201d and \u201cdue and payable.\u201d <em>Lipsitt </em>v. <em>Plaud, </em>466 Mass. 240, 245 &amp; n.8 (2013), quoting St. 1943, c. 467.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b586-9\">Regulations governing real estate brokers and salespersons appear at 254 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 2.00 through 7.00 (2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b588-7\">The proscribed conduct is set forth in G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 87AAA, as follows: \u201c(a) knowingly made any substantial misrepresentation; (b) acted in the dual capacity of broker and undisclosed principal in the same transaction; (c) acted for more than one party to a transaction without the knowledge and consent of all the parties for whom he [or she] acts; (d) failed, within a reasonable time, to account for or remit any moneys belonging to others which have come into his [or her] possession as a broker or [salesperson]; (e) paid commissions or fees to or divided the same with any person, who, being required to be licensed as a broker or [salesperson] in this or any other [S]tate, is not so licensed; (f) accepted, given or charged any undisclosed commission, rebate or profit on expenditures for a principal; (g) induced any party to a contract or lease relating to real estate to break the same when such action is effected for the personal gain of the licensee; (h) commingled the money or other property of his [or her] principal with his [or her] own; (i) failed to give to both the buyer and seller a copy of the purchase and sale agreement; (j) committed any act expressly prohibited in [\u00a7\u00a7 87RR to 87CCC]; (k) affirmatively solicited for sale, lease, or the listing for sale or lease, of residential property on the grounds of alleged change of value due to the presence or the prospective entry into the neighborhood of a person or persons of another race, economic level, religion or ethnic origin or distributes, or causes to be distributed, material or makes statements designated to induce a residential property owner to sell or lease his [or her] property due to such change in the neighborhood; or (1) accepted from a prospective seller a net listing, an agreement to sell real estate for a stated price which authorized the broker to keep as commission any amount of money received from the sale of said real estate in excess of the stated price.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The defendants concede this point: \u201cIt is true that the November 2010 amendment confirms the lawfulness of engaging licensed salespersons as employees, just as it is true that the amendment confirms the lawfulness of engaging them as independent contractors.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b591-7\">The fact that a real estate salesperson may be paid in the form of commissions only and that commissions may be subject to the Wage Act does not negate the applicability of the independent contractor statute.
