The transfer restriction in this case required the shareholder first to offer his stock to the company at his desired price, and then, if the company rejected it, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>offer it at a price to be determined by arbitrators. The plaintiff, Michael A. Vale, invoked this process by tendering an offer to the defendant, New England Cleaning Services, Inc. (NECS). After doing so, however, he changed his mind regarding his desire to sell and sought to withdraw from the process of valuing his stock. NECS moved to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">A judge in the Superior Court denied the motion to compel, relying on the doctrine of <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>106 Mass. 373, 389 (1871), which distinguishes arbitration from appraisal. The judge concluded that a mere disagreement over the value of stock was legally insufficient to give rise to arbitration. On appeal, NECS argues that <em>Palmer </em>and its progeny were abrogated by G. L. c. 251, inserted by St. 1960, c. 374, \u00a7 1, as amended (Arbitration Act), which, among other things, provides that a written contract providing for the arbitration \u201cof any existing controversy\u201d is \u201cvalid, enforceable and irrevocable\u201d except on grounds that exist for \u201cthe revocation of any contract.\u201d See G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">We conclude that the distinction between arbitration and appraisal remains valid, but affirm the judge\u2019s denial of the motion to compel on other grounds. A stock valuation may be conducted through arbitration, so long as an actual controversy exists regarding the value of the stock. A rejected offer to sell the stock creates such a controversy, provided that the shareholder still desires to sell the stock and the transfer restriction requires him to offer it first to the company. A shareholder may not, however, unilaterally withdraw the controversy from arbitration once it has commenced. Because the shareholder in this case decided not to sell the stock prior to the commencement of arbitration, the controversy to be arbitrated was rendered moot.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">1. <em>Background. </em>Vale is a fifty per cent shareholder of NECS, a Massachusetts close corporation. The only other shareholder is Vale\u2019s brother, David J. Valchuis. Vale and Valchuis formed NECS in 1977 and both remain directors of the company. In 2005, Vale and Valchuis experienced a breakdown in their business relationship, after Vale stepped down as NECS\u2019s president. On several occasions over the ensuing eight years, Vale expressed a desire to sell his NECS stock. Article 5 of NECS\u2019s articles of incorporation (Article 5) describes a discrete process that a share<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>holder must follow if he or she desires to sell his or her stock.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Vale did not invoke Article 5 during these initial discussions regarding the sale of his stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">In June, 2013, NECS suspended shareholder distributions on the asserted grounds of increased labor costs and other expenses. In response, Vale filed a complaint against NECS and Valchuis in the Superior Court, alleging breach of fiduciary duty and seeking an accounting. Vale contended in essence that the suspension of distributions was designed to force him to sell his shares at a reduced price. NECS filed a counterclaim, alleging breach of fidciary duty and breach of contract. The basis of the breach of contract claim was Vale\u2019s failure to comply with Article 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">In October, 2013, during the pendency of the litigation, Vale specifically invoked Article 5 in a letter sent to Valchuis in the latter\u2019s capacity as a director of NECS. In the letter, Vale offered his shares to NECS at the price of $5 million and, and as required by Article 5, named one arbitrator. Consistent with Article 5, Vale\u2019s letter also stated that \u201cthe Board of Directors must within thirty (30) days of this notice either accept this offer, or notify me in writing the name of an arbitrator selected by NECS.\u201d On November 1, 2013, NECS declined Vale\u2019s offer and named a second arbitrator accordingly. Under the provision of Article 5, the two named arbitrators were then to select a third arbitrator for the purpose of arbitrating (or \u201cascertaining\u201d) the value of the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>On November 8, 2013, Vale argued in his motion before the Superior Court that because he had invoked Article 5, NECS\u2019s counterclaim for breach of contract was moot. The following week, prior to the selection of the third arbitrator, Vale informed NECS that he was \u201cno longer interested in selling his NECS stock\u201d and that the \u201carbitration that has not yet commenced . . . is therefore moot.\u201d NECS responded that Vale had no power to terminate the arbitration proceedings that he had commenced by invoking Article 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">NECS filed a motion to compel Vale to arbitrate the value of his stock. The judge concluded that, notwithstanding its references to \u201carbitrators,\u201d Article 5 called for a valuation proceeding in the nature of an appraisal rather than arbitration. Finding that there was no agreement to arbitrate and, therefore, that the Arbitration Act did not apply, the judge denied NECS\u2019s motion to compel arbitration. NECS filed an interlocutory appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 251, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 18, and we granted NECS\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The validity and scope of arbitration agreements have been governed by statute in the Commonwealth since at least 1786. See St. 1960, c. 374; St. 1925, c. 294; Rev. St. 1901, c. 194; Pub. St. 1881, c. 188; Gen. St. 1855, c. 147; Rev. St. 1835, c. 114; St. 1786, c. 21. In an early case, <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Bigelow, </em>8 Mass. 1, 2 (1811), this court construed the 1786 statute as limiting arbitration to disputes in the nature of personal actions at law and, as a result, held that an arbitrator had no jurisdiction to determine title to real estate. In 1835, the Legislature, citing <em>Fowler, </em>expanded the realm of arbitrable disputes to include \u201c[a]ll controversies, which might be the subject of a personal action at law, or of a suit in equity.\u201d Rev. St. 1835, c. 114. The question then arose whether a contractual provision calling for a valuation of property created an agreement to arbitrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">In <em>Palmer, </em>106 Mass. at 389, this court concluded that it did not, observing that a \u201creference to a third person to fix by his judgment the price, quantity or quality of material, to make an appraisement of property and the like, especially when such reference is one of the stipulations of a contract founded on other and good considerations, differs in many respects from an ordinary submission to arbitration.\u201d In an appraisal, for example, \u201c[t]he decision may be made without notice to or hearing of the parties . . . and it may be made upon such principles as the person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>agreed on may see fit honestly to adopt, or upon such evidence as he may choose to receive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Our subsequent cases continued to apply the doctrine of <em>Palmer, </em>firmly entrenching the \u201cdistinction between the arbitration of a controversy and a contract one term of which calls for the ascertainment by designated persons of values, quantities, losses or similar facts.\u201d <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Franks, </em>294 Mass. 262, 266 (1936). See <em>Eliot </em>v. <em>Coulter, </em>322 Mass. 86, 90 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The scope of arbitrable disputes remained unchanged until the passage of the present Arbitration Act, which provides that \u201ca provision in a written contract to submit to arbitration any controversy thereafter arising between the parties shall be valid, enforceable and irrevocable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 1. Notably absent from the Arbitration Act is the long-standing limitation of arbitration to actions in law and equity. NECS makes much of this omission, arguing that the Arbitration Act rendered <em>Palmer </em>and its progeny obsolete. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Although NECS is correct that the Arbitration Act expanded the scope of arbitrable controversies, the fact of the matter is that a controversy actually must exist to be submitted for arbitration. The long line of cases distinguishing arbitration from appraisal was largely concerned with the absence of a controversy and other indicia of arbitration, rather than the valuation proceeding\u2019s genesis in law or equity. Thus, in <em>Franks, </em>294 Mass. at 266-267, quoting <em>Matter of Fletcher, </em>237 N.Y. 440, 451 (1924), we explained that the \u201cprovisions of the Arbitration Law are properly applicable to any contract where the parties have agreed to substitute for the courts an informal tribunal of their choice in the settlement of a controversy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Here, the motion judge ruled that Article 5 did not create a controversy and, thus, did not contain an arbitration clause. Relying on <em>Eliot, </em>322 Mass. at 89, the judge reasoned that although \u201c[tjhere may be a dispute about the value of NECS stock ... such a difference of opinion regarding value does not convert the valuation process into an arbitration determinative of the rights and liabilities of the parties.\u201d The <em>Eliot </em>case does not support this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">In <em>Eliot, supra, </em>we observed that our understanding of the distinction between appraisal and arbitration was in accord with that of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Omaha </em>v. <em>Omaha Water Co., </em>218 U.S. 180 (1910) <em>(Omaha Water Co.). </em>In that case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>the Court held that a valuation proceeding was an appraisal, rather than arbitration, where there was \u201cno antecedent disagreement as to price.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 196. The notion that an arbitration of value required an antecedent disagreement was drawn from an English case, <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>53 Eng. Rep. 916 (1858), in which \u201cthere was a contract for the sale of a brewery at a price to be fixed by persons called arbitrators, one chosen by each party and a third by these two, before entering upon valuation.\u201d <em>Omaha Water Co., supra </em>at 194. In <em>Collins, </em>the English court observed that although \u201cfixing the price of a property may be \u2018arbitration,\u2019 \u201d the case before the court involved a mere appraisal. <em>Collins, supra </em>at 918. The court explained the distinction as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">\u201cAn arbitration is a reference to the decision of one or more persons, either with or without an umpire, of some matter or matters in difference between the parties. It is very true that in one sense it must be implied that although there is no existing difference, still that a difference may arise between the parties; yet I think the distinction between an existing difference and one which may arise is a material one, and one which has been properly relied upon in the case. If nothing has been said respecting the price by the vendor and purchaser between themselves, it can hardly be said that there is any difference between them. It might be that if the purchaser knew the price required by the seller, there would be no difference, and that he would be willing to give it. It may well be that if the vendor knew the price which the purchaser would give, there would be no difference, and that he would accept it. It may well be that the decision of a particular valuer appointed might fix the price and might be equally satisfactory to both; so that it can hardly be said that there is a difference between them. Undoubtedly, as a general rule, the seller wants to get the highest price for his property, and the purchaser wishes to give the lowest, and in that sense it may be said that an expected difference between the parties is to be implied in every case, but unless a difference has actually arisen, it does not appear to me to be an \u2018arbitration.\u2019 Undoubtedly, if two persons enter into an arrangement for the sale of any particular property, and try to settle the terms, but cannot agree, and after dispute and discussion respecting the price, they say, \u2018We will refer this question of price to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>A.B., he shall settle it,\u2019 and thereupon they agree that the matter shall be referred to his arbitration, that would appear to be an \u2018arbitration,\u2019 in the proper sense of the term, and within the meaning of the [Common Law Procedure Act]; but if they agree to a price to be fixed by another, that does not appear to me to be an arbitration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 918-919.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The analysis of the English court in <em>Collins </em>is consistent with our precedent. The <em>Palmer </em>and <em>Eliot </em>cases each involved valuation clauses in contracts similar to that of the <em>Collins </em>case, that is, clauses that did not presuppose an antecedent disagreement regarding value. The contracts merely stated that value would be determined by a third party. <em>Palmer, </em>106 Mass. at 386 (\u201cBy the terms of the contract, and as a mode of fixing compensation, the amount of gravel deposited in filling it to a fixed grade was to be measured on the ground by the city engineer, whose measurements were to be conclusive\u201d); <em>Eliot, </em>322 Mass. at 87 (lease set annual rent at percentage of \u201cfair valuation of the land comprised in the premises; said fair valuation to be determined ... by three [3] disinterested parties or a majority of them, one to be chosen by the lessors, one by the lessees and one by the two so chosen\u201d). As such, the contracts did not call for arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Nonetheless, our cases \u2014 both prior to and following the Arbitration Act \u2014 have recognized that value may be arbitrable so long as an actual controversy exists. For example, in <em>Franks, </em>294 Mass. at 265, we explained that if, \u201cbefore the agreement to arbitrate was entered into the plaintiff had completed a sale delivery of stock to the defendants on terms which obligated the defendants to pay a fair price for it, an issue as to price would be a controversy which might be the subject of a personal action, and so also a proper subject for statutory arbitration.\u201d Although we concluded that no controversy existed in that case, in other cases we have enforced arbitration clauses triggered by antecedent disagreements regarding value. See, e.g., <em>Berkshire Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Burbank, </em>422 Mass. 659, 660 (1996) (contract provided for submission of damages valuation only if agreement could not be reached); <em>Trustees of Boston &amp; Me. Corp. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>363 Mass. 386, 387 (1973) (contract provided for submission of price to arbitration only after objection to offer price).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Here, there clearly was \u2014 at least initially \u2014 an arbitrable disagreement regarding the value of Vale\u2019s shares. Acting pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>to Article 5, Vale offered his shares to NECS at the price of $5 million. NECS rejected that offer, ostensibly disputing the value of the shares. See 1 Williston on Contracts \u00a7 5:3 (4th ed. 2007) (\u201cAs a general principle, any words or acts of the offeree indicating that the offer has been declined . . . amount to a rejection\u201d). At that juncture, a controversy existed that properly could be submitted to arbitration. See <em>Collins, </em>53 Eng. Rep. at 918-919. Although not dispositive, the fact that Article 5 repeatedly refers to \u201carbitrators\u201d suggests that the parties intended the valuation proceeding to be an arbitration. <em>General Convention of New Jerusalem in the U.S. of Am., Inc. </em>v. <em>MacKenzie, </em>449 Mass. 832, 835 (2007) (\u201cWhen the words of a contract are clear, they must be construed in their usual and ordinary sense\u201d). Had the valuation proceeding gone forward, NECS would have, pursuant to Article 5, received an enforceable right to purchase the shares at the price determined by the arbitrators. See <em>Franks, </em>294 Mass. at 267 (arbitrations result in judgments enforceable in court). See also G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 16 (court has jurisdiction to enforce arbitration awards). Consequently, we hold that Article 5 contains an agreement to arbitrate future controversies regarding valuation, which is properly within the scope of the Arbitration Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Vale argues that even if Article 5 contains an arbitration agreement, he was entitled to withdraw his offer to sell his shares at any time prior to NECS\u2019s acceptance of the price determined by the arbitrators. NECS counters that Vale is precluded from withdrawing his offer, because his invocation of Article 5\u2019s arbitration provisions, i.e., the naming of an arbitrator, was irrevocable. NECS argues further that allowing Vale to invoke and withdraw from arbitration would destroy NECS\u2019 right to receive the fruits of Article 5. Neither party\u2019s interpretation of Article 5 is sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">We interpreted a nearly identical stock transfer restriction in <em>Merriam </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Mkts., Inc., </em>464 Mass. 721, 731 (2013).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In that case, we explained that the \u201ctext of [the stock transfer restriction] begins with a requirement that a shareholder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>first offer his shares to the corporation, but thereafter describes a discrete process of valuation and subsequent offer at a price determined by arbitrators.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, Article 5 operates in the same manner. It prescribes an initial offer of shares at Vale\u2019s desired price, which NECS is free to accept or reject. As explained herein, the rejection of that offer creates a controversy, which is to be resolved by arbitration. The question then, is not whether Vale was able to withdraw his offer, but whether he was able to withdraw the controversy from arbitration.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">At common law and under earlier statutes, the general rule was that a party could withdraw an issue from arbitration at any time prior to the arbitrator\u2019s award. See, e.g., <em>Wallis </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>13 Allen 19, 24 (1866) (\u201csubmission to arbitrators is a power; and it is generally true that a power may be revoked at any time before execution\u201d); <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>16 Johns. 205, 208 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1819) (\u201crevocation of the powers of the arbitrators stripped them of all pretence of authority to act as such; and, in the strictest truth, the instrument to which they put their hands and seals, was no award under the submission, for the submission itself was at an end\u201d). This rule arose from the long-standing judicial hostility toward arbitration agreements. See <em>La Stella </em>v. <em>Garcia Estates, Inc., </em>66 N.J. 297, 299 (1975) (\u201cEnglish common law at the time of the American Revolution was undoubtedly hostile to arbitrations. . . . Thus it permitted either party to an arbitration of an existing dispute to withdraw at any time before the actual award and, beyond that, it declared that an agreement to arbitrate future disputes was against public policy and not enforceable\u201d). Today, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>however, the law \u201cexpress [es] a strong public policy favoring arbitration as an expeditious alternative to litigation for settling commercial disputes.\u201d <em>Home Gas Corp. of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Walter\u2019s of Hadley, Inc., </em>403 Mass. 772, 774 (1989), quoting <em>Danvers </em>v. <em>Wexler Constr. Co., </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 160, 163 (1981). See <em>Gilmer </em>v. <em>Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., </em>500 U.S. 20, 24 (1991) (\u201cpurpose [of Federal Arbitration Act] was to reverse the longstanding judicial hostility to arbitration agreements that had existed at English common law and had been adopted by American courts, and to place arbitration agreements upon the same footing as other contracts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The consensus among courts construing modern statutory arbitration clauses is that \u201ca party to a binding, irrevocable arbitration cannot unilaterally withdraw from participation in the arbitration after it has begun.\u201d <em>Crihfield </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>224 W. Va. 407, 412 (2009). See, e.g., <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Engstrom, </em>89 Cal. App. 3d 513, 523 (1979); <em>Cabus </em>v. <em>Dairyland Ins. Co., </em>656 P.2d 54, 56 (Colo. Ct. App. 1982); <em>Juhasz </em>v. <em>Costanzo, </em>144 Ohio App. 3d 756, 762 (2001); <em>Godfrey </em>v. <em>Hartford Cas. Ins. Co., </em>142 Wash. 2d 885, 897 (2001). See generally 6 CJ.S. Arbitration \u00a7 85 (2004) (\u201cWhere the agreement is irrevocable, a party may not unilaterally withdraw an issue from arbitration\u201d). Sound policy justifications support this view. Allowing withdrawal after the parties have expended resources in preparing for and participating in the arbitration would be antithetical to the Arbitration Act\u2019s purpose of \u201cfurthering] the speedy, efficient, and uncomplicated resolution of business disputes.\u201d <em>Floors, Inc. </em>v. <em>B.G. Danis of New England, Inc., </em>380 Mass. 91, 96 (1980). See <em>Cabus, supra </em>(\u201cto allow one party to withdraw such an issue after going through the arbitration process does not comport with the policy favoring arbitration\u201d). See also <em>Manatt, Phelps, Rothenberg &amp; Tunney </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>151 Cal. App. 3d 1165, 1171 (1984) (noting unfairness that would result if withdrawal were allowed \u201cafter testimony had been taken, evidence received and documents produced and filed\u201d). Moreover, a party should not be permitted to commence arbitration and then withdraw without prejudice to avoid an unfavorable outcome. See <em>Godfrey, supra </em>(parties may not \u201csubmit a dispute to arbitration only to see if it goes well for their position\u201d). Here, NECS argues that Vale commenced arbitration when he invoked Article 5. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Arbitration is commonly understood to commence with the filing of a submission agreement or a demand for arbitration. 6 C.J.S. Arbitration, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 9 (\u201cagreement for the submission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>an issue to arbitrators constitutes the charter of the entire arbitration proceedings, is a prerequisite to the commencement of a valid proceeding, and defines or limits the issues to be decided\u201d); 1 Domke on Commercial Arbitration \u00a7 18:2 (3d ed. Supp. 2014) (\u201cdemand for arbitration ... must contain the name of the parties, the arbitration clause upon which it is based, the nature of the dispute and the relief sought\u201d). The submission agreement or demand is generally \u201cconsidered to be in effect when the parties agree on arbitrators and the controversy is submitted to them for their determination.\u201d 21 \"Williston on Contracts \u00a7 57:45 (4th ed. 2001) . See P.A. Finn, BJ. Mone, &amp; J.N. Seich, Mediation and Arbitration \u00a7 12:1 (2004). Thus, unless otherwise provided in the contract or rules governing the arbitration, the mere selection of an incomplete panel of arbitrators does not constitute a commencement of arbitration. See <em>Norfleet </em>v. <em>Safeway Ins. Co., </em>144 Ill. App. 3d 838, 842 (1986) (\u201cin our view, the appointment of a partial board of arbitrators cannot logically constitute \u2018initiation\u2019 of arbitration proceedings. At the very least, there must be a full panel of arbitrators selected before the proceedings could commence\u201d). Cf. <em>Northcom, Ltd. </em>v. <em>James, </em>848 So. 2d 242, 247 (Ala. 2002) (\u201cAppointing an arbitrator does not initiate the arbitration process as provided in the Commercial Arbitration Rules\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Here, Article 5 does not set forth the rules for arbitration, nor does it articulate a particular point at which arbitration is deemed to commence. It merely describes a process for appointing arbitrators, which process remained incomplete at the time Vale changed his mind about selling his shares. The record does not reflect that a formal submission agreement or demand for arbitration was ever filed with the arbitrators in this case. Permitting a shareholder to retract his or her desire to sell at this preliminary stage undercuts neither the express terms of Article 5 nor the policies disfavoring withdrawal from arbitration. See <em>Invicta Plastics, U.S.A., Ltd. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>120 Cal. App. 3d 190, 193 (1981) (mere change of mind prior to commencement of arbitration not equivalent to unilateral withdrawal from arbitration).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">NECS speculates that allowing Vale to terminate the Article 5 process \u2014 even at this preliminary stage \u2014 will provide incentive for Vale repeatedly to invoke and terminate the process, thereby disrupting NECS\u2019s business operations and pressuring it to buy his shares at an exorbitant price. The law is clear, however, that the invocation and termination of the Article 5 process must be in good faith. <em>Merriam, </em>464 Mass. at 727 (\u201cAlthough a share<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>holder in a close corporation always owes a fiduciary duty to fellow shareholders, good faith compliance with the terms of an agreement entered into by the shareholders satisfies that fiduciary duty\u201d). Cf. <em>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s London </em>v. <em>Argonaut Ins. Co., </em>500 F.3d 571, 575 (7th Cir. 2007) (withdrawal of arbitration demand did not render controversy moot where withdrawal constituted procedural maneuvering aimed to defeat counterparty\u2019s ability to obtain judicial determination of rights). Thus, if Vale were to engage in such vexatious conduct, NECS would have recourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Moreover, allowing Vale to change his mind prior to the commencement of arbitration does not destroy NECS\u2019s ability to enjoy the fruits of Article 5. The purpose of Article 5 is to provide shareholders in a close corporation the opportunity to sell their shares at a fair price, while protecting the company against an infusion of undesirable new shareholders. See <em>Merriam, </em>464 Mass. at 731 (\u201cValuation processes like those described by [the stock transfer restriction] are often employed in close corporations because there is no ready market for stock in a close corporation\u201d). Should Vale decide to sell his shares in the future, NECS will have the opportunity to purchase them pursuant to Article 5. In view of the foregoing, Vale was entitled to change his mind regarding his desire to sell his shares, thereby rendering moot the controversy to be arbitrated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Without a controversy, there can be no arbitration. G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons set forth herein, we conclude that Article 5 of NECS\u2019s articles of incorporation contained a valid agreement to arbitrate future controversies regarding the value of NECS\u2019s stock, but that no such controversy existed at the time of NECS\u2019s motion to compel arbitration. Therefore, for reasons other than those set forth by the motion judge, the order denying NECS\u2019s motion to compel arbitration is affirmed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b510-8\">We acknowledge the amicus brief submitted by the New England Legal Foundation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Article 5 of the articles of organization (Article 5) of NECS provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">\u201cAny stockholder... desiring to sell, transfer or pledge such stock owned by him or them, shall first offer it to the corporation through the Board of Directors, in the manner following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-9\">\u201cHe shall notify the directors of his desire to sell or transfer by notice in writing, which notice shall contain the price at which he is willing to sell or transfer and the name of one arbitrator.

It shall then be the duty of the arbitrators to ascertain the value of the stock, and if any arbitrator shall neglect or refuse to appear at any meeting appointed by the arbitrators, a majority may act in the absence of such arbitrator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-10\">\u201cAfter the acceptance of the offer, or the report of the arbitrators as to the value of the stock, the directors shall have thirty (30) days within which to purchase the same at such valuation, but if at the expiration of thirty days, the corporation shall not have exercised the right so to purchase, the owner of the stock shall be at liberty to dispose of the same in any manner he may see fit. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b516-7\">The stock transfer restriction in <em>Merriam </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Mkts., </em>Inc., 464 Mass. 721, 723 n.9 (2013), likewise contained in the articles of organization, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-8\">\u201cAny stockholder . . . desiring to sell, assign, transfer, pledge, or hypothecate in any manner such stock owned by him, shall first offer it to the corporation through the Board of Directors, in the manner following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-9\">\u201cHe shall notify the directors of his desire to sell ... in writing, which notice shall contain the price and all other terms at which he is willing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>sell.. . and the name of one arbitrator.

See <em>Merriam, </em>464 Mass. at 728 (characterizing same language as creating option); <em>Stapleton </em>v. <em>Macchi, </em>401 Mass. 725, 729 n.6 (1988) (\u201cAn option is simply an irrevocable offer creating a power of acceptance in the optionee\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b520-8\">It does not follow, however, that NECS would be entitled to terminate the Article 5 process. As the Appeals Court explained in <em>Brodie </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 371, 383-384, <em>S.C., </em>447 Mass. 866 (2006), refusing to proceed with arbitration could improperly hinder Vale\u2019s ability to sell his shares on the open market.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b520-13\">In consequence of this conclusion, we need not reach Vale\u2019s remaining arguments that NECS waived Article 5, that NECS\u2019s board of directors never properly rejected Vale\u2019s initial offer, or that Article 5 was superseded by a subsequent declaration of trust.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
