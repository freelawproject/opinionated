We hold that a properly approved tariff may so limit a public utility\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>On December 8, 2006, two employees of NSTAR Electric and Gas were performing a switching procedure to restore electrical equipment that had been taken out of service. During the procedure, an explosion occurred, igniting a fire in the basement of a building at One Broadway in Cambridge. Smoke filled the basement and flowed into the stairwells leading up to the other floors of the building. The fire and smoke resulted in extensive damage to the building, requiring its closure for approximately six weeks. Construction and repairs continued for a lengthy period of time thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">At the time of the fire, the building was owned by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). MIT leased space in the building to Cambridge Incubator, Inc. (Cambridge Incubator),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Sedo.com, EEC (Sedo), and Allodia Corporation (Allodia). Cambridge Incubator and Sedo purchased insurance coverage from Maryland Casualty Corporation (Maryland Casualty); Allodia purchased insurance coverage from Assurance Company of America (Assurance). In the wake of the fire, Maryland Casualty paid claims by Cambridge Incubator and Sedo, and Assurance paid claims by Allodia.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Maryland Casualty and Assurance then brought this complaint against NSTAR Electric Company and NSTAR Electric &amp; Gas Company (collectively, NSTAR), seeking to recover for the claims paid to Cambridge Incubator, Sedo, and Allodia. The plaintiffs asserted causes of action in negligence, gross negligence or reckless, wilful and wanton misconduct, breach of contract, and breach of express and implied warranties. They alleged that the explosion resulted from NSTAR\u2019s inadequate maintenance of its equipment at the building and training of the crew performing the switching procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">NSTAR moved for partial summary judgment. It contended that, to the extent to which the insurers sought recovery for business interruption losses, their claims were barred as a matter of law by Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and Energy Tariff No. 200A (tariff), filed with and approved by the DPU on January 31, 2006, and in effect when the explosion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>occurred in December, 2006. The tariff contained a \u201cLimitation of Liability\u201d clause providing that, \u201cfor non-residential Customers served under general service rates, the Company shall not be liable in contract, in tort (including negligence and [G. L. c.] 93A), strict liability or otherwise for any special, indirect, or consequential damages . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">A judge of the Superior Court allowed, in part, NSTAR\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The judge determined that, while private parties may not contractually limit their liability for gross negligence, a tariff filed with and approved by a regulatory agency may so limit a public utility\u2019s liability. Because the claims paid to Allodia and Sedo that the plaintiffs sought to recover were exclusively for business interruption, the judge determined that they were fully precluded by the \u201cLimitation of Liability\u201d clause. By contrast, the judge concluded that, to the extent Maryland Casualty sought to recover for claims paid to Cambridge Incubator for property damage, its claims were not for \u201cspecial, indirect or consequential damages,\u201d and thus were not barred by the tariff.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">In the wake of the judge\u2019s decision, the parties filed a stipulated judgment awarding Maryland Casualty the amount of $17,062 plus interest for claims paid to Cambridge Incubator for property damage. The plaintiffs then appealed from the decision granting partial summary judgment, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>On appeal, the plaintiffs assert that the judge improperly granted partial summary judgment because (1) there is a genuine dispute regarding the authenticity of the tariff; (2) the language at issue in the tariff does not clearly and unambiguously preclude liability for claims based on gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct; and (3) NSTAR cannot limit its liability for losses caused by its own gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We conclude that the tariff is authentic, that the clause at issue does encompass claims based on gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct, and that the clause is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>enforceable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">a. <em>Authenticity of the tariff. </em>General Laws c. 25, \u00a7 1, provides that the DPU \u201cshall have an official seal, which shall be judicially noticed.\u201d The judge based his decision granting summary judgment on the copy of the tariff submitted to the Superior Court by NSTAR and accompanied by a cover letter that contained the DPU\u2019s official seal. The cover letter attests that \u201cthe attached are true and certified copies of NSTAR Electric Company/Cambridge Electric Company Terms and Conditions for Distribution Services Tariffs ... on file with the Rates and Revenue Requirements Division of this Agency and also a copy of the Stamp Approval dated January 31, 2006 of the compliance filing . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The plaintiffs contend that the judge erred in granting summary judgment to NSTAR because there is a genuine and material factual dispute as to the authenticity of the tariff at issue. The plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the tariff\u2019s authenticity focuses on discrepancies between the copy of the tariff that accompanied NSTAR\u2019s motion for summary judgment and the copy of the tariff later submitted to the court with the cover letter from the DPU. We conclude that these alleged discrepancies, which involve minor differences in the pagination of the documents, do not give rise to a \u201cgenuine issue\u201d regarding the authenticity of the tariff accompanied by the DPU\u2019s official seal. See <em>DIRECTV, LLC </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue, </em>470 Mass. 647, 657-658 (2015), citing <em>Hip-Saver, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kiel, </em>464 Mass. 517, 522 (2013) (no genuine issue of material fact where party has \u201cno reasonable expectation\u201d of prevailing on factual dispute). See also Mass. R. Civ. P. 56(c), as amended, 436 Mass. 1404 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">b. <em>Interpretation of the \u201cLimitation of Liability\u201d clause. </em>The tariff\u2019s \u201cLimitation of Liability\u201d clause provides, in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\">\u201cUnless there is negligence on the part of the Company, the Company shall not be liable for damage to the person or property of the Customer or any other persons resulting from the use of electricity or the presence of the Company\u2019s appliances and equipment on the Customer\u2019s premises. In any event, for non-residential Customers served under general service rates, the Company shall not be liable in contract, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>in tort (including negligence and [G. L. c.] 93A), strict liability or otherwise for any special, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever including, but not limited to, loss of profits or revenue, loss of use of equipment, cost of capital, cost of temporary equipment, overtime, business interruption, spoilage of goods, claims of Customers of the Customer or other economic harm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">This court has observed that, \u201cwhere words in a tariff are used in a peculiar or technical sense, and where extrinsic evidence is necessary to determine their meaning or proper application, so that \u2018the enquiry is essentially one of fact and of discretion in technical matters,\u2019 then the issue of tariff application must first go to the [regulatory] [commission.\u201d <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>390 Mass. 604, 613 (1983), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Western Pac. R.R., </em>352 U.S. 59, 66 (1956). The interpretive question at issue in this case, however, does not turn on any technical term. Instead, it concerns the meaning and scope of a tariff provision specifying the types of damages for which NSTAR may be held liable. Because the interpretation of such a provision poses a pure question of law, it is proper for judicial resolution. See <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Christ Church in the City of Boston, </em>85 Mass. App. Ct. 157, 159 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">We have little difficulty concluding that the portion of the \u201cLimitation of Liability\u201d clause at issue here encompasses a claim of gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct. The clause refers to liability \u201cin tort.\u201d A cause of action for gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct is a form of liability \u201cin tort.\u201d <em>MacFadyen </em>v. <em>Maki, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 618, 621-623 (2007); 1 D.B. Dobbs, P.T. Hayden, &amp; E. M. Bublick, Torts \u00a7 140 (2d ed. 2011); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 500 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The plaintiffs assert that the clause\u2019s parenthetical phrase \u2014 \u201c(including negligence and [G. L. c.] 93A)\u201d \u2022\u2014 indicates that \u201c[t]he only \u2018tort\u2019 liability [the clause] purports to limit is that for \u2018negligence and [G. L. c.] 93A.\u2019 \u201d \u201cIt is,\u201d however, \u201chornbook law that the use of the word \u2018including\u2019 indicates that the specified list... that follows is illustrative, not exclusive.\u201d <em>Puerto Rico Maritime Shipping Auth. </em>v. <em>Interstate Commerce Comm\u2019n, </em>645 F.2d 1102, 1112 n.26 (D.C. Cir. 1981). The tariff\u2019s \u201cuse of the word \u2018including\u2019 indicates that the [parenthetical] list is representative, not all-inclusive, and that any ... tort is covered\u201d by the clause. See <em>Barrows </em>v. <em>Wareham Fire Dist., </em>82 Mass. App. Ct. 623, 626 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>In context, the specific reference to \u201cnegligence\u201d in the parenthetical serves to clarify the relation between the \u201cLimitation of Liability\u201d clause\u2019s first and second sentences. The first sentence indicates that the public utility shall not be held liable to any customers \u201c[ujnless there is negligence on the part of the Company.\u201d The second sentence indicates that, \u201c[i]n any event,\u201d the utility shall not be liable \u201cin tort (including negligence . . . )\u201d to \u201cnon-residential Customers served under general service rates ... for any special, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever.\u201d The clause\u2019s specific reference to liability for \u201cnegligence,\u201d then, elucidates the relation between the \u201cno liability to any customers without negligence\u201d rule established in the first sentence and the \u201cno liability to nonresidential customers served under general service rates for special, indirect or consequential damages\u201d rule articulated in the second sentence. It does not render the latter rule ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Indeed, the intention to exempt the company from all liability to nonresidential customers served under general service rates for special, indirect, or consequential damages is abundantly clear from the tariff. The tariff\u2019s list of the potential bases for liability is followed by the phrase \u201cor otherwise,\u201d thereby sweeping up any other potential bases of liability not encompassed in the already broad categories of liability specifically listed. Further, the tariff\u2019s reference to \u201cspecial, indirect, or consequential damages\u201d is sandwiched between the words \u201cany\u201d and \u201cwhatsoever.\u201d Finally, the tariff\u2019s illustrative list of potential forms of \u201cspecial, indirect, or consequential damages\u201d is preceded by the phrase \u201cincluding, but not limited to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Short of a specific reference to gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct, it is difficult to imagine how the tariff more plainly could have exempted the defendants from liability for \u201cspecial, indirect, or consequential damages.\u201d Because such a specific reference is not required, and the plaintiffs do not contest that they are nonresidential customers served under general service rates or that they are seeking to recover special, indirect, or consequential damages, the rule articulated in the second sentence encompasses the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">c. <em>Enforceability of the limitation of liability clause. </em>In Massachusetts, a public utility\u2019s \u201cliability for damages may be limited by properly filed and approved tariffs.\u201d <em>Disk \u2019N\u2019 Data, Inc. </em>v. <em>AT&amp;T </em>Communications, 415 Mass. 886, 888 (1993). Such tariffs \u201chave the \u2018force and effect of law,\u2019 \u201d <em>id.., </em>so long as they satisfy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>the basic \u201crequirement of reasonableness,\u201d <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>New England Tel &amp; Tel Co., </em>327 Mass. 132, 135 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The core of the plaintiffs\u2019 argument is that, while a public utility may, through its tariff, limit its liability for ordinary negligence, it may not limit its liability for gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct. In making that argument, the plaintiffs invoke the well-established principle of contract law indicating that, \u201cwhile a party may contract against liability for harm caused by its negligence, it may not do so with respect to its gross negligence.\u201d <em>Zavras </em>v. <em>Capeway Rovers Motorcycle Club, Inc., </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 17, 19 (1997). See <em>CSX Transp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>697 F. Supp. 2d 213, 226 (D. Mass. 2010) (\u201cthe [Supreme Judicial Court] would not enforce agreements purporting to require indemnification against gross negligence\u201d). We conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 invocation of that principle of contract law is inapposite in light of the distinction between a contractual release of liability and a properly filed and approved public utility tariff.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 argument relies primarily on one nearly one and one-half century old precedent, <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>American Tel. Co., </em>13 Allen 226 (1866). In that case, a plaintiff sued a telegraph company for damages resulting from a missent telegraph. <em>Id. </em>at 227. This court determined that the statutory scheme governing telegraph companies \u201ctakes the business of conducting and managing a line of electric telegraph within this [C] ommonwealth out of the class of ordinary private occupations, and makes it a quasi public employment, to be carried on with a view to the general benefit and for the accommodation of the community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 231. The court nevertheless deemed enforceable a contractual clause providing that the telegraph company would not be liable for errors and delays in the transmission of messages unless the plaintiff paid extra to have the message in question sent back to the station from which it originated. <em>Id. </em>at 236. The court observed that the general rule that a defendant is liable for damages caused by its negligence</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">\u201cdoes not operate so as to prevent parties from prescribing reasonable rules and regulations for the management of the business, or establishing special stipulations for the performance of service which, if made known to those with whom they deal, and directly or by implication assented to by them, will operate to abridge their general liability at common law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>and to protect them from being held responsible for unusual or peculiar hazards which are incident to particular kinds of business. Of course, a party cannot in such way protect himself against the consequences of his own fraud or gross negligence, or the fraud or gross negligence of his servants or agents.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">In Wilkinson, 327 Mass. at 135, the court cited <em>Ellis, supra, </em>in the context of claims against a telephone company for financial loss caused by the defendant\u2019s failure of service. The court affirmed a directed verdict in favor of the defendant telephone company, based on a limitation of liability clause in the rate schedule and accompanying regulations. <em>Wilkinson, supra </em>at 134. The court observed, in dicta, that \u201c[o]ne of the counts in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration alleges wilful and wanton acts of the defendant and, if sustained by evidence, might require submission of this action to the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 135. The court concluded, however, that the plaintiff could not recover on that count because \u201c[njowhere in the opening statement. . . [was] there a sufficient allegation of facts from which the jury could infer or find any wilful or wanton misconduct on the part of the defendant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">In our view, both the <em>Wilkinson </em>court\u2019s citation to <em>Ellis </em>and the plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on <em>Ellis </em>elide the significant historical transformation in the regulation of public utilities that occurred after 1866, when <em>Ellis </em>was decided. The <em>Ellis </em>court determined that the statutory scheme governing the telegraph industry transformed it into \u201ca quasi public employment,\u201d even though the statutory scheme did not confer on telegraph companies all the duties and obligations that apply to common carriers. <em>Ellis, </em>13 Allen at 231. The court nevertheless concluded that the statutory scheme \u201crecognized and affirmed\u201d a telegraph company\u2019s right, under \u201cfamiliar and well settled principles of common law,\u201d to \u201cmake rules and regulations by which to define and limit their duties and obligations in the transaction of the business which they assume to carry on.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">The limitation of liability clause at issue in <em>Ellis, </em>then, was contractual. Its contractual character, moreover, was crucial to the court\u2019s decision. The court observed that the plaintiff \u201chad notice\u201d of the term limiting the telegraph company\u2019s liability. <em>Id. </em>at 237. Although the plaintiff, as the intended recipient rather than the sender of the missent message, \u201centered into no express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>contract with the defendants,\u201d the court concluded the plaintiff\u2019s power to recover was limited by the terms of the contract entered into between the sender and the telegraph company. <em>Id. </em>As the court explained, \u201cit is difficult to see how the plaintiff, who claims through the contract entered into by the sender of the message with the defendants, which created the duty and obligation resting on the defendants, can claim any higher or different degree of diligence than that which was stipulated for the parties to the contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">In the late Nineteenth Century, this contract-based approach gave way to the now dominant tariff-based model for public utilities regulation. See Kearney &amp; Merrill, The Great Transformation of Regulated Industries Law, 98 Colum. L. Rev. 1323, 1331-1332 (1998) (Kearney &amp; Merrill). Under that model, the \u201cprogenitor\u201d of which was the 1887 Interstate Commerce Act (ICA), a public utility is required to file a tariff, which contains all rates and all regulations, practices, or classifications affecting those rates. See Kearney &amp; Merrill, <em>supra </em>at 1331. Once the tariff is approved by the relevant regulatory agency, any deviation from it is strictly prohibited. <em>Id. </em>With respect to telegraphs (the industry at issue in <em>Ellis), </em>the United States Supreme Court observed in <em>Western Union Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Priester, </em>276 U.S. 252, 259 (1928), that, as a result of amendments to the ICA bringing the telegraph industry into the tariff-based model of public utility regulation, \u201c[w]hat had previously been a matter of common law liability, with such contractual restrictions as the [S]tates might permit, then became the subject of [Fjederal legislation to secure reasonable and just rates for all without undue preference or advantage to any.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\"><em>Wilkinson, </em>decided eighty-five years after <em>Ellis, </em>manifests the transformation in public utility regulation. Whereas in <em>Ellis </em>telegraph companies operating in the Commonwealth were \u201conly required to transmit despatches \u2018according to the regulations\u2019 which they may establish,\u201d <em>Ellis, </em>13 Allen at 235, in <em>Wilkinson </em>the defendant telephone company\u2019s \u201crates, regulations, and practices [were] subject to the control and supervision of the [DPU].\u201d <em>Wilkinson, supra </em>at 133. The DPU\u2019s ultimate control over the rates, regulations, and practices governing the provision of telephone service, moreover, was crucial to the court\u2019s analysis of the case. In affirming the grant of a directed verdict, the court observed that \u201crates and regulations are indissolubly bound together\u201d such that, \u201c[w]hen the [DPU] approved [the] regulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>[at issue], it must have had in mind its effect on rates and no modification of the regulation may be countenanced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">We likewise have observed that \u201cthe extensive legislative regulation of [an electric company\u2019s] rates and practices takes the furnishing of electricity out of the realm of contract law.\u201d <em>FMR Corp. </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>415 Mass. 393, 396 (1993). Instead, \u201c[t]he process of utility rate making by a public regulatory body is the exercise of a legislative function, . . . which has been delegated to the [DPU] through the enactment of G. L. c. 164\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>390 Mass. 772, 774 (1984). The result of that process is a \u201cquasi statutory enactment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <em>777, </em>quoting <em>Haverhill Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Findlen, </em>357 Mass. 417, 420 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">In light of this distinction, we are persuaded that the contract rule against releases for gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct should not be applied in the tariff context. Several considerations lead us to that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">First, tariffs differ from contracts in that the regulatory process by which the rates are set provides recourse for the public to challenge rates or tariff terms as onerous or unfair. Courts in the Commonwealth have been particularly \u201ccautious in enforcing releases against liability,\u201d and have \u201cdecline[d] to do so\u201d in circumstances \u201cwhere a public utility attempts to limit its liability.\u201d <em>Zavras </em>v. <em>Capeway Rovers Motorcycle Club, Inc., </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 17, 19 (1997). See <em>Sharon </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>437 Mass. 99, 106 (2002) (\u201cWe have not had occasion to rule on the validity of releases required in the context of a compelled activity or as a condition for the receipt of essential services [e.g., public education, medical attention, housing, public utilities], and the enforceability of mandatory releases in such circumstances might well offend public policy\u201d). Such heightened scrutiny makes sense in the context of contractual releases, given that public utilities typically enjoy \u201clegislatively sanctioned monopolies]\u201d for the provision of essential services, <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>390 Mass. at <em>777, </em>obviating the possibility of true bargaining between a utility and its customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">In the context of a public utility tariff, however, the regulatory regime provides a framework for protecting against onerous or unfair limitations in liability. Pursuant to G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 94, for instance, electric companies operating within the Commonwealth must file with the DPU \u201cschedules . . . showing all rates, prices and charges to be charged or collected within the [C]ommon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>wealth for the sale and distribution of... electricity, together with all forms of contracts to be used in connection with such schedules.\u201d Before an electric company may change its rates, the DPU must \u201chold a public hearing and make an investigation as to the propriety of such proposed changes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The DPU may initiate an investigation, either upon complaint or on its own motion, into a proposed rate change. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, \u201call contracts for the sale of. . . electricity by . . . electric companies . . . shall be filed with the [DPU],\u201d and the \u201c[DPU] may investigate the propriety of any such contract, both before and after such contract has become effective, and may, after notice and a public hearing, make such orders relative to the rates, prices, charges and practices covered by such contract as the public interest requires.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Second, because the tariff that results from this process is \u201cnot... a matter of contract by which a legal liability could be modified, but a matter of law by which a uniform liability was imposed,\u201d see <em>Western Union Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Esteve Bros. &amp; </em>Co., 256 U.S. 566, 572 (1921), it demands a degree of judicial deference not warranted in the contractual context. The statutory scheme indicates that \u201c[t]he Legislature delegated the responsibility for regulating [electric] company practices to the DPU.\u201d <em>Lebowitz Jewelers Ltd. </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 268, 273 (1987). To evaluate and invalidate that \u201cLimitation of Liability\u201d clause based on traditional contract law principles would entail the court impermissibly \u201csubstituting] its judgment for that of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Purity Supreme, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>380 Mass. 762, 776 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Finally, a judicial decision invalidating the \u201cLimitation of Liability\u201d clause would have effects beyond the clause itself. \u201cThe limitation of liability was an inherent part of the rate\u201d set by the DPU, and \u201c[t]he company could no more depart from it than it could depart from the amount charged for the service rendered.\u201d <em>Western Union Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Esteve Bros. &amp; Co., </em>256 U.S. at 571. Because \u201cthe rates as fixed by the [DPU] are established with the rule of limitation in mind,\u201d invalidation of the limitation would undermine the broader structure by which both the public utility\u2019s \u201crights and privileges\u201d as well as \u201cits liabilities\u201d are carefully defined and limited. <em>Waters </em>v. <em>Pacific Tel. Co., </em>12 Cal. 3d 1, 7 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The fact that the plaintiffs here allege gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct does not alter the analysis. In a classic formulation, this court described the distinctions between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>ordinary negligence, gross negligence, and wilful and wanton misconduct as matters of degree. \u201cThe element of culpability which characterizes all negligence is in gross negligence magnified to a high degree as compared with that present in ordinary negligence,\u201d but is nevertheless \u201csomething less than . . . willful, wanton and reckless conduct....\u201d <em>Altman </em>v. <em>Aronson, </em>231 Mass. 588, 591-592 (1919). Because the tariff provision at issue applies to all claims by nonresidential customers seeking to recover \u201cspecial, indirect, or consequential damages,\u201d without regard to distinctions between the degrees of culpability, we decline to make such a distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Courts in other jurisdictions have reached the same conclusion. Most pertinently, the United States Supreme Court in <em>Western Union Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Priester, </em>276 U.S. 252, 259-260 (1928), after concluding that the tariff system took the regulation of the telegraph industry out of the realm of contract law, determined that a plaintiff could not escape a limitation of liability clause in a tariff simply by affixing the \u201cvituperative epithet\u201d of \u201cgross\u201d to an allegation of negligence. \u201c[I]f it be assumed that we can weigh and measure degrees of negligence and that a public service company may not by contract alone limit its liability for gross negligence, so-called,\u201d the court observed, \u201cnevertheless we may not disregard a lawful exercise of the regulatory power which has made no distinction between degrees of negligence, nor may we, upon any theory of public policy, annex to the rate as made conditions affecting its uniformity and equality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 260. Tracking this analysis, courts in other jurisdictions similarly have rejected arguments that an allegation of gross negligence takes a plaintiff\u2019s claim out of the scope of a limitation of liability clause. See <em>Stern </em>v. <em>General Tel. Co., </em>50 Cal. App. 3d 538, 541-542 (1975); <em>Professional Answering Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Tel. Co., </em>565 A.2d 55, 65 (D.C. 1989); <em>In re Illinois Bell Switching Station Litig., </em>234 Ill. App. 3d 457, 463-465 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">We acknowledge that a number of courts in other States have reached a different conclusion, determining that a provision in a tariff exempting a public utility from liability for gross negligence is invalid. Closer examination of the extra-jurisdictional authorities identified by the plaintiffs, however, reveals that many are distinguishable from the instant case. In <em>Satellite Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>Birch Telecom of Okla., Inc., </em>51 P.3d 585, 589 (Okla. 2002), for instance, the Oklahoma Supreme Court observed that \u201c[cjourts overwhelmingly reject attempts to limit liability either by con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>tract or by tariff for gross negligence, willful misconduct, and fraud.\u201d There, however, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant engaged in fraud, not gross negligence, and the court held that, \u201c[bjecause [the] tariff attempted to limit its liability for fraud, it was unreasonable, does not have the force of law, and is not binding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other decisions cited by the plaintiffs, the tariff specifically provided that, while the utility would not be liable for negligence, it could be held liable for gross negligence. See <em>Pilot Indus. </em>v. <em>Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>495 F. Supp. 356, 362 (D.S.C. 1979) (\u201cThis Court is likewise convinced that the tariff on file with the South Carolina Public Service Commission and the Federal Communications Commission effectively limits defendant\u2019s liability for service interruptions in the absence of its gross negligence or wilful/wanton conduct\u201d); <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Consolidated Edison Co., </em>98 Misc. 2d 304, 305 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1978) (tariff provision \u201cessentially exempts [electric company] from liability for ordinary negligence and renders it liable for gross negligence only\u201d). Because these tariffs did not seek to exempt the defendants from liability for gross negligence, the courts had no occasion to determine whether such an exemption would be valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Finally, while we reject a categorical rule that a limitation of liability clause in a tariff must distinguish between ordinary negligence and gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct, a tariff provision limiting liability nevertheless must satisfy the basic requirement of reasonableness. <em>Wilkinson, </em>327 Mass. at 135; <em>Lebowitz Jewelers Ltd. </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. at 270. The plaintiffs, however, only argue that the challenged provision is \u201cunreasonable\u201d insofar as they contend that any tariff provision limiting liability for gross negligence is unreasonable. We reject that contention, and see no other reason for thinking that the \u201cLimitation of Liability\u201d clause is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The provision does not categorically exempt NSTAR from liability for negligence, much less gross negligence. On the contrary, the provision specifically contemplates liability for negligence, to both residential and nonresidential customers alike. The portion of the \u201cLimitation of Liability\u201d clause that the plaintiffs challenge here merely exempts NSTAR from liability for a particular type of damages (\u201cspecial, indirect, or consequential damages\u201d) asserted by a particular class of customers (nonresidential customers served under general service rates). There are compelling reasons why the DPU could approve of such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>limitation, even where it fails to make a distinction between ordinary negligence and gross negligence. As scholars have noted, consequential damages, such as damages for lost profits or business interruption, are at once extremely difficult to predict and potentially immense in magnitude. See, e.g., Tort Recovery for Negligently Inflicted Economic Loss: A Reassessment, 37 Stan. L. Rev. 1513, 1536 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Under these circumstances, we think that the \u201cLimitation of Liability\u201d clause is reasonable. We have no occasion to address whether a broader limitation of liability tariff provision \u2014 one that, for instance, fully immunized a public utility from liability for damages resulting from its gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct, rather than merely immunizing it from claims for a particular type of damages, or one that encompassed claims for fraud \u2014 would, if it were to survive DPU scrutiny, satisfy the basic requirement of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons stated, we conclude that the limitation of liability clause in the tariff precludes the plaintiffs\u2019 claims to recover for business interruption and other consequential or economic damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b431-9\">Doing business as Cambridge Innovation Center.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b432-8\">The plaintiffs also assert that there is a genuine dispute regarding whether the losses sought by plaintiffs were caused by NSTAR\u2019s gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct. We agree with NSTAR that this argument is not properly before the court. The judge never addressed whether there is a genuine dispute of material fact regarding NSTAR\u2019s alleged gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct. Instead, the judge determined that, even if the plaintiffs could show gross negligence, their claims would be barred as a matter of law by the \u201cLimitation of Liability\u201d clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b433-9\">Because we conclude that the \u201cLimitations of Liability\u201d clause precludes all of plaintiffs\u2019 claims, we do not address NSTAR\u2019s alternative argument that, regardless of the clause, the claims of Sedo and Allodia are barred by the economic loss doctrine.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
