The defendant was charged with assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A <em>(b), </em>and assault and battery in violation of G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>c. 265, \u00a7 13A (a). At trial, the defendant contended, and presented evidence seeking to show, that the beating was justified based on the need for self-defense and defense of others present. The jury found him guilty of both charges. We affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\"><em>Background. </em>1. <em>Facts. </em>Based on the evidence presented at trial, the jury could have found the following. On the evening of November 27, 2009, Officer Michael Sedergren and Lieutenant John Bobianski of the Springfield police department were on patrol in a cruiser when they observed a black Honda Civic automobile dragging its muffler and causing sparks to fly behind it. The officers stopped the vehicle, and Bobianski spoke to the driver, Malika Barnett. While Bobianski was speaking to Barnett, Sedergren observed Barnett\u2019s companion, Melvin Jones, who was the sole passenger in the vehicle (and the victim in this case), slide toward the floor in the right front passenger\u2019s seat and stuff something in his waistband. Concerned that the victim could be hiding a weapon or other contraband, Sedergren requested assistance over the police radio from Officer Theodore Truoiolo and the defendant, who were together on patrol that night in a separate vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Once Truoiolo and the defendant arrived, all four officers approached the Honda, with two officers on each side of the vehicle.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Truoiolo and Sedergren went to the passenger\u2019s side and asked the victim to step out of the vehicle so that they could conduct a patfrisk of him. The victim complied. At the officers\u2019 instruction, the victim moved to the rear of the vehicle and placed his hands on the trunk. Truoiolo then began patting the victim\u2019s outer garments to check for weapons. When Truoiolo reached the victim\u2019s front right pants pocket, Truoiolo felt a hard object no bigger than his palm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Truoiolo squeezed the object and yanked the victim toward himself; as he did so, the victim threw his elbow and forearm into Truoiolo\u2019s chest and tried to run away.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Sedergren caught the victim around the neck about five feet from the vehicle, but the victim continued to try to run, and the two men ended up against the side of the hood of the second police cruiser. Truoiolo then grabbed hold of the victim\u2019s collar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>and right shoulder, while Sedergren had the victim in a \u201cchoke hold type maneuver\u201d and was on top of the victim\u2019s back. At this point, the victim was bent forward over the hood of the police cruiser, with his head facing the windshield and his legs spread apart. The defendant, having seen the victim try to run, went over to the cruiser where the victim was lying spread eagle. The defendant was unable to see the victim\u2019s hands, but in response to a statement of Sedergren\u2019s, the defendant began to hit the victim repeatedly around his head with a flashlight.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although not all the blows hit the victim\u2019s head, the defendant swung the flashlight at the victim fourteen or more times. At least three strikes made contact with the victim\u2019s head and upper body.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The victim continued to move after the first strikes to his head. The officers were shouting commands such as \u201cdon\u2019t move\u201d and \u201cgive us your hands,\u201d but they did not state that the victim was under arrest. Eventually, Truoiolo cuffed the victim\u2019s right hand but could not reach the victim\u2019s left hand because of where Sedergren was positioned. The defendant, realizing that many of his blows were hitting the hood of the cruiser rather than the victim\u2019s upper body, moved down and delivered three hard blows with the flashlight to the victim\u2019s upper leg. Then, in response to another statement from Sedergren, the defendant hit the victim behind his left knee.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Following that blow, the victim fell to the ground with the officers on top of him. The defendant continued to hit the victim as he was lying still on the ground, this time around the victim\u2019s upper body and his feet. Eventually, the officers rolled the victim to the side while he lay on the ground and finished handcuffing him, and then Truoiolo reached into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>victim\u2019s pocket and pulled out the hard object that he had felt earlier, a small bag that was determined to contain \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine and marijuana. The victim had no weapons on his person, and no weapons were found in the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The victim was taken by ambulance to Baystate Medical Center. The right side of his face was deformed from swelling and bruising, and he suffered fractures of his orbital socket and nose. The victim was also diagnosed with a choroidal rupture, an eye injury resulting from blunt force trauma to the head and causing loss of vision in his right eye. At the time of trial, in February, 2012, the victim continued to experience vision loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Two persons in a house across the street from where the officers stopped the vehicle noticed the incident developing and recorded much of it on a video camera. The recording, which includes both audio and video, was admitted as an exhibit at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">2. <em>Procedural history. </em>On October 14, 2010, a complaint issued from the Holyoke Division of the District Court Department, charging the defendant with assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon and assault and battery. Several months later, the defendant filed a notice stating that he would raise as defenses (1) self-defense, (2) defense of another, and (3) \u201c[djefense of a law enforcement officer\u2019s right to use force reasonably necessary to effect an arrest, overcome physical resistance and/or prevent escape.\u201d See Mass. R. Crim. R 14 (b) (3), as appearing in 442 Mass. 1518 (2004). Thereafter, approximately three months before trial, the defendant filed an expert witness report of Dr. Frank Gallo, director of the master of science in policing program at Western New England University, that the defendant claimed supported a conclusion that the defendant\u2019s use of force against the victim was reasonable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Commonwealth responded to the notice of defenses and to the expert witness report by filing a motion in limine to exclude any defense based on the reasonable force necessary to effect an arrest.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In response, in two subsequent pretrial hearings regarding Gallo\u2019s proposed testimony, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>defendant\u2019s trial counsel stated repeatedly that reasonable force to effect an arrest was <em>not </em>the legal theory on which the defendant was relying and on which Gallo\u2019s testimony would be based. Rather, counsel asserted that the defendant\u2019s theory of the case, reflected in Gallo\u2019s testimony (see note 5, <em>supra), </em>was that the defendant used force to effect a Terry-type stop and a patfrisk of the victim, see <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, 392 </em>U.S. 1, 27 (1968), and that, ultimately, the force used was reasonably necessary for self-defense and defense of others, and also based on a police officer\u2019s training to escalate the use of force in response to a deadly threat, such as a suspect obtaining an officer\u2019s gun.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Commonwealth indicated that if the defendant was not asserting that he used reasonable force to effect an arrest, then the Commonwealth\u2019s motion in limine to exclude evidence of this defense was moot. The trial judge does not appear to have ruled on the motion in limine to exclude, but she did rule preliminarily that Gallo would be allowed to testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The defendant was tried before a jury in February, 2012. Despite the trial judge\u2019s preliminary ruling concerning Gallo, the defendant did not call Gallo as a trial witness. At the close of the evidence, the defendant submitted a request for jury instructions that included repeated reference to the defendant\u2019s status as a police officer, to a police officer\u2019s right to use force in making an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>arrest, and to the fact that a person who is being arrested by a police officer may not use force to resist arrest. The defendant also proposed instructions on self-defense and defense of another that mirrored in most respects the District Court\u2019s model jury instructions on these defenses, and that included the duty to exhaust all other options, including retreat, before resorting to force. See Instruction 9.260 of the Criminal Model Jury Instructions for Use in the District Court, at 1-5, 17 (2009) (Instruction 9.260). In connection with each of the defendant\u2019s proposed instructions, including the instruction on self-defense, the defendant sought a statement regarding his status as a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">At the charge conference, the judge indicated initially that she would instruct the jury on the definition of arrest and on police privilege in some form, although not using the defendant\u2019s proposed language. The judge later presented both counsel with a proposed instruction stating that \u201c[bjecause of the nature of the job, a police officer is permitted to use force in carrying out his official duties if such force is necessary and reasonable,\u201d and that a civilian who is arrested by a police officer must submit to the arrest, but a police officer may not use \u201cexcessive or unnecessary force\u201d to make an arrest.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant indicated his satisfaction with this instruction. The Commonwealth, however, objected to it on the ground, among others, that it was essentially an instruction on resisting arrest, a defense the defendant had earlier eschewed. After further discussion with counsel, the judge determined that the planned instruction was confusing and misstated the law, and that, therefore, the instruction would not be given; the defendant objected. The judge\u2019s instructions to the jury ultimately included self-defense and defense of another, but did not reference the defendant\u2019s status as a police officer in connection with those defenses or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The jury found the defendant guilty of both charges. The defendant timely appealed. We transferred the case from the Appeals Court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>On appeal, the defendant primarily challenges the trial judge\u2019s decision not to give the jury the instruction she had proposed on police privilege and resisting arrest, which had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>effect of eliminating entirely from her jury instructions any reference to a police officer\u2019s ability to use reasonable force in connection with official duties. This issue was exacerbated, the defendant argues, by the judge\u2019s instructions on self-defense, which included reference to the duty to retreat \u2014 a requirement that in the defendant\u2019s view is inappropriate when the person asserting the defense is a police officer. At trial, the defendant\u2019s actual objection to the jury instructions before and after the jury charge specifically focused on the judge\u2019s decision not to give her proposed instruction on police privilege and resisting arrest. Nevertheless, because the defendant\u2019s status as a police officer was clearly a central issue throughout the trial and a focal point of the defense,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> on appeal, we treat the defendant\u2019s challenge to the judge\u2019s instructions generally as preserved. We therefore review the judge\u2019s instructions for prejudicial error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>445 Mass. 589, 591 (2005). In doing so, we conclude that the judge\u2019s instructions, insofar as they contained no reference to the defendant\u2019s status as a police officer and included the duty to retreat in the explanation of self-defense, were flawed. We further conclude, however, that the errors were not prejudicial when considered in the context of the evidence in the case and the instructions as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">We consider first the judge\u2019s decision not to give her proposed police privilege and resisting arrest instruction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This decision was appropriate in the circumstances of this case for two reasons. The first concerns fairness. By initially suggesting an intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>pursue the defense of effecting an arrest and then disavowing it, counsel effectively indicated to the Commonwealth that it need not present evidence aimed at overcoming this defense.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Indeed, the prosecutor argued during the charge conference that had she anticipated a defense based on the use of force to effect an arrest and a related jury instruction, she would have called a potential expert witness to rebut this theory.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Second, and more importantly, the judge was correct in her eventual conclusion that her proposed instruction would have confused and potentially misled the jury. The planned instruction was based on the District Court\u2019s model jury instruction on police privilege and resisting arrest, which primarily serves to articulate that a civilian who is being arrested by someone the civilian knows is a police officer must submit to the arrest and may not use force against the arresting officer unless the officer uses excessive or unnecessary force to make the arrest. See Instruction 9.260, at 12-13.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This case, however, presents the opposite scenario: the defendant was a police officer charged with assault and battery on a civilian. In addition, to the extent that both the model instruction and the trial judge\u2019s proposed instruction discussed self-defense, like the model instruction, the proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>instruction spoke only of a civilian\u2019s right to defend himself or herself against a police officer who uses excessive force, not the other way around.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See note 10, <em>supra. </em>See also Instruction 9.260. Accordingly, the instruction was structured so as to focus the jury on evaluating the actions of the putative arrestee and on whether those actions were reasonable in light of the police officer\u2019s use of force, rather than on the reasonableness of the police officer\u2019s actions. But here, where the defendant was a police officer who claimed that his actions were necessary for self-defense and defense of others against violence at the hands of the victim, the opposite focus was the essential one, that is, whether the officer\u2019s claims in response to the victim\u2019s alleged use of force and related conduct were reasonable. Given the context, the proposed instruction\u2019s potential for creating juror misunderstanding was a real one.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">But that is not the end of the matter. Although the judge did not err in declining to give her proposed instruction, this case was fundamentally about the reasonableness of a police officer\u2019s use of force against a civilian; therefore, the judge\u2019s instructions should have acknowledged the defendant\u2019s status and explained that, as a police officer, the defendant would have been justified in using force in connection with his official duties, including effecting an arrest, as long as such force was necessary and reasonable.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The language that begins the model instruction on police privilege and resisting arrest is not the only possible approach, but this language does convey a police officer\u2019s right to use reasonable force. See Instruction 9.260, at 12 (\u201cBecause of the nature of the job, a police officer is permitted to use force in carrying out his [her] official duties if such force is necessary and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>reasonable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">In addition, the defendant raises legitimate concerns with respect to the judge\u2019s instruction on self-defense. In keeping with the model jury instruction on self-defense, the judge referenced a defendant\u2019s obligation to do \u201ceverything reasonable in the circumstances to avoid physical combat before resorting to force\u201d including considering \u201cavenues of escape that were reasonably available.\u201d See Instruction 9.260, at 2, 4. We agree with the defendant that a police officer has an obligation to protect his fellow officers and the public at large that goes beyond that of an ordinary citizen, such that retreat or escape is not a viable option for an on-duty police officer faced with a potential threat of violence. Cf. <em>Reed </em>v. Hoy, 909 F.2d 324, 331 (9th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1250 (1991), recognized as overruled on other grounds, <em>Edgerly </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of San Francisco, </em>599 F.3d 946, 956 n.14 (9th Cir. 2010) (duty to retreat before resorting to deadly force \u201cmay be inconsistent with police officers\u2019 duty to the public to pursue investigations of criminal activity\u201d and should not apply absent clear authority, which plaintiff had not identified). The supplemental model instruction on the duty to retreat before resorting to the use of force in self-defense should not have been given in this case. Furthermore, while it is appropriate to require a police officer to do \u201ceverything reasonable in the circumstances to avoid physical combat before resorting to force\u201d against a civilian, the question must be whether the defendant <em>as a police officer </em>had reasonable options available other than to use force \u2014 not whether a similarly situated civilian would have had other options.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">In sum, the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury were erroneous in two respects: (1) they failed to acknowledge, particularly in connection with the claim of self-defense, that the defendant was a police officer and that he was entitled to use force in carrying out his official duties if and to the extent such force was necessary and reasonable; and (2) the self-defense instruction included an erroneous statement that the defendant had a duty to retreat if possible under the circumstances. We turn, then, to the question whether the errors were prejudicial to the defendant. \u201cAn error is not prejudicial if it \u2018did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect\u2019; however, if we cannot find \u2018with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error,\u2019 then it is prejudicial.\u201d <em>Cruz, </em>445 Mass. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>591, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Considering the jury instructions as a whole, as we must, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Niemic, </em>427 Mass. 718, 720 (1998), <em>S.C., </em>451 Mass. 1008 (2008), as well as the strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, we conclude that the errors were not prejudicial. At trial, the defendant admitted to hitting the victim repeatedly with the flashlight, the victim clearly sustained significant injuries, and the only issue was whether the defendant\u2019s acts were justified. The record as a whole presents extremely strong evidence that the defendant did not strike the victim in the manner that he did in self-defense and in defense of his fellow officers. The video recording of the beating showed three officers surrounding a single victim, who was bent over the hood of a car as the defendant struck him repeatedly with a flashlight. Sedergren, who was on top of the victim\u2019s back and was holding him around the neck, weighed between 250 and 260 pounds at the time of the incident; the victim, by comparison, weighed about 165 or 170 pounds. None of the officers saw the victim\u2019s hand on Sedergren\u2019s gun. Moreover, based on the officers\u2019 positioning around the victim, it was implausible if not impossible that the victim could have reached the gun, because it was bolstered on the right side of Sedergren\u2019s body, where Truoiolo was.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As previously noted, the video recording also belied the defense\u2019s theory, because although an officer can be heard on the recording yelling \u201csmash him in the knees,\u201d see note 3, <em>supra, </em>there was no audible statement or reference regarding a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Furthermore, as part of her charge on self-defense and defense of another, the judge explained that whether a defendant was justified in using force in his or her own defense or in defense of others depended upon what a reasonable person would have done in the circumstances that were presented <em>to the defendant. </em>See Instruction 9.260, at 1-5, 17. Even in the absence of a specific instruction on the defendant\u2019s status as a police officer, it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>clear to the jury that he was, in fact, an officer, and that at the time of the incident, he was involved in a traffic stop as part of his official duties. Moreover, through Sedergren\u2019s and Truoiolo\u2019s testimony, the defendant introduced evidence concerning the \u201ccontinuum\u201d of force that police officers are trained to use in responding to an individual who presents varying degrees of threatening behavior or resistance. We presume that the jury followed the judge\u2019s instruction, and in doing so, we assume that they evaluated the defendant\u2019s claims of self-defense and defense of others from the perspective of what a reasonable police officer would have done in the circumstances presented to him or her.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Finally, we conclude with \u201cfair assurance,\u201d <em>Cruz, </em>445 Mass. at 591, that if the judge had charged the jury that the defendant was entitled to use such force as was necessary and reasonable to carry out his official duties, the addition of this instruction would not have had an effect on the verdicts. The force that the defendant used here \u2014 repeated blows with a flashlight to the head and other parts of the body of a victim who was bent over the hood of an automobile, and later lying on the ground \u2014 was extreme and went beyond that which was necessary for the accomplishment of any of the defendant\u2019s responsibilities as a police officer that night. Even if the defendant believed at one point that the victim was trying to grab Sedergren\u2019s gun, that danger would have completely dissipated by the time the victim was on the ground; yet even then, the defendant continued to strike the victim. In these circumstances, assuming the jury had been instructed properly about the defendant\u2019s police officer status, the jury reasonably could not have found that the beating was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons that have been discussed, the jury instructions in this case should have been more narrowly tailored to reflect the fact that the defendant was a police officer engaged in his official duties at the time of the incident. However, given the strength of the evidence against the defendant and the weakness of his defenses, we conclude that the errors were not prejudicial and that the defendant is not entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b595-8\">The victim in this case was a black male. All four officers involved in the incident were white males.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b595-9\">On cross-examination, Officer Theodore Truoiolo admitted that the object in the victim\u2019s pants pocket could not have been a gun, and that Truoiolo never indicated to the other officers that the victim might be armed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The exact words that Officer Michael Sedergren used were somewhat in dispute. Sedergren testified that he said, \u201cHe\u2019s got my fucking gun, smash him\u201d; the defendant testified that Sedergren said, \u201cHe\u2019s got my gun, hit him, hit him.\u201d However, the jury also heard that the defendant\u2019s written report of the incident, filed the day after it occurred, did not quote either statement, but simply said that Sedergren informed the other officers that he believed the victim was trying to grab his gun. In a bystander\u2019s video recording of the event, introduced at trial and discussed <em>infra, </em>the words \u201csmash him in the knees\u201d are audible, but no reference to a gun can be heard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Sedergren testified that he called for the defendant to strike the victim again after Sedergren heard Truoiolo say that the victim was \u201cgoing for his waist.\u201d However, as previously noted, Truoiolo knew that the victim did not have a gun in his waistband, and Truoiolo gave no indication to the other officers following the patfrisk that the victim might be armed. Truoiolo admitted on cross-examination that any possible threat of deadly force against the officers was neutralized by the time that Truoiolo handcuffed the victim\u2019s right hand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b597-8\">Dr. Frank Gallo\u2019s report is not part of the record on appeal. However, Gallo testified in a pretrial voir dire hearing that he had concluded that the defendant\u2019s use of force was \u201cobjectively reasonable,\u201d given that the defendant was presented with an individual who had resisted a <em>Terry-type </em>stop and then tried to disarm an officer. See <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 27 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b597-9\">The Commonwealth\u2019s argument for the exclusion of this defense was essentially that the defendant used deadly force against the victim, and that such force is authorized for the purpose of effecting an arrest only when the arrest is for a felony and the crime for which the arrest is made involved conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>including the use or threatened use of force, or there is a substantial risk that the person to be arrested will cause death or serious bodily harm if he or she remains at large. See <em>Julian </em>v. <em>Randazzo, </em>380 Mass. 391, 396 &amp; n.1 (1980) (civil suit against police officers; jury properly charged regarding limits on officer\u2019s use of deadly force in making arrest in accordance with Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure \u00a7 120.7 [1975]); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>372 Mass. 823, 829-830 (1977) (similar limitations applied in criminal case against civilian who used deadly force in citizen\u2019s arrest; jury properly charged in accordance with Model Penal Code \u00a7 3.07). The Commonwealth reiterates this argument on appeal. However, because of the manner in which we resolve this case, we need not address the claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b598-12\">For example, at the first of the two pretrial hearings, on November 25, 2011, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel stated, \u201c[Melvin Jones is] not under arrest. This victim is not [under arrest]. This reasonable force to effect an arrest, that\u2019s not my theory. I don\u2019t know where that came from. I apologize for that. But from the outset this is a threshold inquiry, a pat down frisk, and force is escalated to the point where it\u2019s the defense argument that deadly force should be used in response to the testimony, \u2018[h]e\u2019s going for my gun.\u2019 \u201d At the second pretrial hearing, on December 6, 2011, trial counsel reiterated this position and responded affirmatively when the judge asked for confirmation that in the defense\u2019s view, this case had nothing to do with resisting arrest and was all about \u201cthe alternative theory of self-defense or defense of others.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b599-8\">The judge\u2019s proposed instruction was a somewhat modified version of the District Court\u2019s model jury instruction on police privilege and resisting arrest.

The full text of the proposed instruction is included at note 10, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b600-6\">As previously noted, the defendant\u2019s proposed jury instructions included numerous references to the defendant\u2019s status as a police officer. In addition, Sedergren, Truoiolo, and the defendant each testified regarding his training on the appropriate use of force in conducting his duties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b600-7\">The judge\u2019s proposed instruction stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">\u201cBecause of the nature of the job, a police officer is permitted to use force in carrying out his official duties if such force is necessary and reasonable. Members of the jury in your deliberations you are to determine whether the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant Jeffrey Asher [is] guilty of the offenses charged. Melvin Jones is not the defendant in this trial \u2014 however you did hear testimony in this trial about the actions of Melvin Jones when confronted by members of the Springfield Police Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-9\">\u201cA person who is arrested by someone who he knows is a police officer is not allowed to resist that arrest with force, whether the arrest is lawful or not. Even if the arrest is illegal, the person must resort to the legal system to restore his liberty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-10\">\u201cHowever, a police officer may not use excessive or unnecessary force <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>to make an arrest \u2014 whether the arrest is legal or illegal \u2014\u2022 and the person who is being arrested may defend himself with as much force as reasonably appears to be necessary.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b601-7\"> Although defense counsel\u2019s express disavowals were made during pretrial hearings, during the trial itself counsel did not suggest a change in position until the final charge conference that took place after the close of the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b601-8\">The defendant\u2019s late-breaking about-face also put the judge in the position of having to determine, after the close of the evidence, whether an instruction on a theory that the defendant had previously disclaimed was nevertheless warranted based on the facts. In these circumstances, the judge\u2019s last-minute change of approach may have been at least in part a product of the confusion that the defendant generated on this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b601-9\">In addition to the substance of the model instruction, the cases cited at the end of that instruction suggest that it is designed for use in cases involving charges of resisting arrest or assault and battery on a police officer or similar authority figure. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moreira, </em>388 Mass. 596 (1983) (assault and battery of police officer); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>369 Mass. 640 (1976) (various charges stemming from assault of correction officer); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Urkiel, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 445 (2005) (resisting arrest); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 642 (2004) (resisting arrest and three counts of assault and battery of police officer); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>24 Mass.

App. Ct. 629 (1985) (assault and battery of correction officer).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b602-6\">For an example that illustrates a civilian\u2019s right to use self-defense against a police officer in limited circumstances, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 642, 649-654 (2004), in which the Appeals Court noted that \u201cwhere the officer uses excessive or unnecessary force to subdue the arrestee, ... the arrestee may defend himself by employing such force as reasonably appears to be necessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 652, quoting <em>Moreira, </em>388 Mass. at 601.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>326 Mass. 597, 601-602 (1950) (police officer convicted of manslaughter of civilian; reasonableness of officer\u2019s acts in attempting to arrest armed suspect was key question for trier of fact to decide); <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Sturtevant, </em>199 Mass. 265, 265-266 (1908) (tort action for assault by police officer on civilian; judge properly instructed jury that defendant had right \u201cto arrest the plaintiff and to use such force as was reasonably necessary to overcome any resistance which he offered[,] but the defendant had not the right to use unreasonable or excessive force\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Although Truoiolo did not have control of the victim\u2019s hands, he testified that the victim\u2019s left hand was on the other side of Sedergren (meaning Sedergren\u2019s left side) and that the victim\u2019s right hand was somewhere in front of the victim. This positioning was consistent with the fact that the victim was bent over the hood, with Sedergren over the victim\u2019s back on the left side and Truoiolo to the victim\u2019s right. If the victim\u2019s left hand was on Sedergren\u2019s left side, and the victim\u2019s right hand was in front of him, the victim could not have reached a gun that was on the right side of Sedergren\u2019s body.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
