While the defendant\u2019s appeal to this court was pending, he filed a motion for a new trial arguing ineffective assistance of counsel and error in the jury instructions. We remanded the motion to the Superior Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge, who had been the trial judge, granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The Commonwealth appealed. We conclude that the judge erred and reverse the order allowing the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">1. <em>Background, </em>a. <em>Facts presented at trial. </em>From the evidence presented at trial, the jury could have found the following facts. In the early morning hours of September 16, 1996, the defendant was riding in the back seat of his friend\u2019s vehicle after a day spent consuming alcohol. His friend, John J. McCrystal, was driving; the defendant and another friend, Melissa Radigan, were seated in the back seat, and the victim was sitting directly in front of the defendant in the front passenger\u2019s seat. The defendant and the victim had had an altercation earlier in the evening. The group was on the way to the defendant\u2019s house to continue drinking when the defendant reached forward and slit the victim\u2019s throat. McCrystal stopped the vehicle, and the defendant got out, opened the front passenger\u2019s door, and pulled the victim to the ground. The defendant stabbed the victim multiple times while he lay on the concrete.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The defendant spent the hours before the killing drinking to excess. Beginning at approximately 12:45 p.m., the defendant, accompanied by a friend, David Bruso, consumed at least two beers and two double shots of one hundred proof alcohol at a bar owned by McCrystal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At 2:30 pm., the defendant and Bruso left the bar, stopped at the liquor store Bruso owned to obtain eight to ten single-shot bottles of one hundred proof alcohol, and went to a barbecue at the local Knights of Columbus hall. The two consumed the single-shot bottles, and the defendant also drank more than six beers and more than four shots of seventy-proof alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>While at the barbecue, the defendant ran into Radigan, who was attending the event with her mother and sister. For a brief time, the defendant and Radigan left the barbecue and returned to McCrystal\u2019s bar where they each had a drink. The two went back to the barbecue, where they continued to drink and fell down when they attempted to dance together.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The defendant and Radigan left again at about 9:30 p.m. to return to McCrystal\u2019s bar. Later in the evening, the defendant telephoned McCrystal to ask him to come to the bar to give the two a ride home. McCrystal arrived and saw the defendant and Radigan in the restaurant portion of the building. McCrystal then entered the bar to wait. The victim arrived shortly thereafter. The defendant and Radigan left the restaurant area, entered the bar, and sat next to McCrystal. The defendant ordered a cognac on the rocks, and Radigan and McCrystal both ordered a beer. The bartender hesitated in serving the defendant and Radigan because both appeared to \u201chave been drinking quite a bit.\u201d The bartender served the two only after McCrystal said he was driving them home.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The altercation with the victim, a bar patron, began at approximately 11 p.m. The defendant had thrown a drink on Radigan. The victim reprimanded the defendant by telling him, \u201cYou don\u2019t do that to a lady\u201d and \u201cYou don\u2019t treat a lady like that.\u201d The defendant approached the victim, repeating, \u201cDon\u2019t cross my path.\u201d The defendant challenged the victim to take their dispute outside; after trying to ignore the defendant, the victim agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">The two men continued their argument outside, frequently bumping chests. As the bar was across from the police station, a police officer arrived quickly and asked them to break it up. The officer recognized the two men and told them he did not want any \u201cproblems out here on the street.\u201d Each man responded that there was no problem and returned inside. The defendant then bought the victim a beer.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">The parties were joined at the bar by Bruso, who had spent several hours asleep in his vehicle after leaving the barbecue. Bruso described the defendant\u2019s demeanor, noting that \u201chis eyes were very glossy. He seemed very intoxicated to the point of almost being asleep, but not asleep. His eyes were open.\u201d Although Bruso had seen the defendant intoxicated on many occasions, he noted that \u201cit was the drunkest I\u2019ve ever seen him.\u201d Another patron, Irene Grigas, who arrived after the altercation with the victim, similarly noted that she had never seen the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>fendant in that state. Bruso offered to give the defendant a ride home, but McCrystal told Bruso that he was giving the defendant a ride. Bruso left the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The bartender started to close the bar at about 12:30 a.m., and the defendant, Radigan, and McCrystal made plans to go back to the defendant\u2019s apartment to \u201ckeep the party going.\u201d The victim declined McCrystal\u2019s invitation to join them, opting instead to assist the bartender in closing for the night. Before departing, the defendant went to the restaurant side of the building, where he remained for about five minutes before meeting with the others. While inside, he put on a winter jacket that he stored at the restaurant, even though the weather was \u201cnice\u201d and the evening was an \u201cIndian Summer September type of night.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">McCrystal carried some beer to his vehicle, where he sat in the driver\u2019s seat to await the defendant. Radigan joined him and sat in the front passenger\u2019s seat. The defendant arrived; when he was told the victim would not be joining them, he returned to the bar. After a few minutes, the defendant emerged from the bar followed by the victim. The defendant asked Radigan to get in the back seat. Radigan complied and sat behind McCrystal. The defendant directed the victim to sit in the front passenger\u2019s seat, and he sat in the back seat behind the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">McCrystal drove the short distance to the defendant\u2019s apartment complex, stopping for a few minutes to talk to a police cruiser that pulled alongside his vehicle. About one hundred yards from the complex, the defendant leaned forward and put his arm around the victim. McCrystal admonished them because he thought the two were \u201cfooling around.\u201d Radigan heard McCrystal shouting and then saw the defendant lean forward toward the victim. In the immediate aftermath of that event, both McCrystal and Radigan felt and saw blood. McCrystal stopped the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">The defendant pulled the victim from the vehicle and continued to stab him. McCrystal shouted to the defendant to stop and \u201cget off him, you\u2019re going to kill him.\u201d The defendant replied, \u201cI think it\u2019s too late for that.\u201d McCrystal was able to push the defendant off the victim when he noticed, for the first time, that the defendant had a knife in his hand. McCrystal recognized the knife as the type the defendant used at his family\u2019s restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">The defendant said to McCrystal, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be with me on this.\u201d McCrystal responded, \u201cWhat, are you crazy? ... No way.\u201d The defendant\u2019s face then became more serious and he ran past McCrystal into the driver\u2019s seat of McCrystal\u2019s vehicle. McCrystal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>attempted to reach through the window and shut off the engine but was unsuccessful. In response to a resident\u2019s telephone call, Scott J. Crevier, a Ware police officer, arrived just as the defendant entered McCrystal\u2019s vehicle. While the defendant was turning the vehicle around in the parking lot, Crevier attempted to block the exit with his cruiser. The defendant \u201cnarrowly missed\u201d striking the cruiser and took off out of the parking lot. After a high-speed car chase, at times approaching 110 miles per hour, police eventually were able to apprehend the defendant, who resisted handcuffs until he was sprayed with mace.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Police accompanied the defendant to the hospital at 2:55 a.m. to be treated for the after-effects of the mace. The defendant smelled of alcohol and admitted to drinking a lot. The emergency room physician did not perform any alcohol ingestion evaluation because the defendant\u2019s \u201cgait was normal, his speech was clear, his coordination was intact, [and] he was cooperative.\u201d Later, at the police station, a police officer observed that the defendant\u2019s eyes were \u201cbloodshot, glassy, and watery\u201d; his speech was \u201cvery slow\u201d; and he \u201ctook a while\u201d to answer questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The victim was pronounced dead at 1:28 a.m. The medical examiner who performed his autopsy opined that the victim suffered a \u201cmajor fatal wound\u201d that was one inch deep and six and one-half inches long and wrapped from the midline of the victim\u2019s neck to behind his ear. The victim had a total of nine knife wounds to his neck, head, chest, abdomen, shoulder, and back.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">The defendant presented an intoxication defense at trial, seeking to persuade the jury that because of his long-standing history of alcoholism and his excessive consumption of alcohol in the twelve hours preceding the killing, he was not capable of forming the specific intent required for deliberately premeditated murder or to act with extreme atrocity or cruelty in causing the victim\u2019s death. Three witnesses \u2014 David Bruso, Irene Grigas, and Dr. Robert A. Fox, Jr. \u2014 testified in support of the defendant\u2019s theory of defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">As already noted, Bruso and Grigas recounted aspects of the day of drinking and the defendant\u2019s demeanor while in their presence. Dr. Fox, a psychiatrist with an expertise in substance abuse, opined that because of the defendant\u2019s level of intoxication at the time of the killing, the defendant\u2019s thinking and reasoning functions would have been highly impaired and his higher functions required to premeditate, form intent, or to process what he was doing would have been impaired. He opined that the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content at the time of the killing was likely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>between .26 and .3 per cent,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and explained the physiological effects of alcohol on the body, including on the ability to think, reason, remember, make connections, and concentrate, and the lowering of a person\u2019s inhibitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">b. <em>The motion for a new trial.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In his motion for a new trial, the defendant argued that trial counsel was ineffective in \u201cfail[ing] to fully investigate, present and argue evidence of the defendant\u2019s severe neuropsychiatric disorders.\u201d The judge conducted an evidentiary hearing and considered first the \u201cperformance prong\u201d of the <em>Saferian </em>test, or whether counsel\u2019s performance fell \u201cmeasurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, 366 </em>Mass. 89, 96 (1974). The judge concluded that the defendant met the performance prong of the <em>Saferian </em>test because \u201cfurther evaluation of the defendant\u2019s mental condition would have done nothing to diminish and potentially much to enhance the only possible defense available to the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">As a preface to our analysis of the Commonwealth\u2019s claim of error, we summarize the evidence presented at the hearing and relied on by the judge in her decision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The evidence at the hearing consisted of testimony from trial counsel; Dr. Fox, the expert retained by trial counsel to conduct a pretrial assessment of the defendant\u2019s history of alcohol dependence and intoxication level; and affidavits from three experts, retained after trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">The defendant\u2019s trial counsel, found by the judge to be an experienced and successful criminal trial attorney, was retained by the defendant\u2019s family to represent the defendant at the trial. The attorney met with the defendant ten or more times in preparation for the trial. During those meetings, he \u201cperceived no evidence of mental illness or impairment\u201d and received no information from the defendant or his family to suggest any mental abnormality. Recognizing, however, that the defendant was high<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>ly intoxicated at the time of the killing, the attorney retained the services of Dr. Fox and requested an opinion whether, because of the defendant\u2019s alcohol consumption, the defendant had the \u201cability to form the specific intent necessary for first degree murder.\u201d Although the request was limited to this question, counsel did not object to a full psychiatric evaluation of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Dr. Fox examined the defendant over the course of eight hours and thereafter advised trial counsel that he was prepared to opine at trial that the defendant was incapable of forming the specific intent required for murder in the first degree. In a letter written subsequent to the initial meetings with counsel and a few days before trial, Dr. Fox stated his opinion to \u201ca reasonable degree of medical certainty . . . that [the defendant] was unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of his act and was unable to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.\u201d He also informed counsel that he believed that the defendant had a dual diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcoholism, and suggested further testing by a PTSD expert. Counsel, however, declined to seek further evaluation of the defendant for PTSD after meeting with Dr. Fox several times during the trial preparation and after considering all of the other information available from his investigation into the case. He decided, as a matter of strategy, to pursue only an intoxication defense and to limit Dr. Fox\u2019s trial testimony to the defendant\u2019s history of alcohol dependence and intoxication at the time of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Counsel\u2019s explanation for this strategic choice was that he believed, based on his experience as a criminal defense lawyer, \u201cthat juries almost never accept an insanity defense.\u201d The attorney added that (1) he believed a dual defense based on both intoxication and PTSD could cause a loss of credibility with the jury and the PTSD defense could water down the substantial evidence he had developed to support an intoxication defense; and (2) he was skeptical of some of Dr. Fox\u2019s conclusions and thought the PTSD defense was based on a \u201cshaky factual foundation.\u201d Counsel believed there was a \u201creal chance that [the intoxication] evidence was strong enough to win a manslaughter verdict\u201d because it was based on undisputed evidence demonstrating the defendant\u2019s lengthy history of alcoholism and extreme amount of alcohol he had consumed at the time of the killing. He noted as well his concern that a defense of lack of criminal responsibility would allow the Commonwealth\u2019s experts to have access to the defendant and vitiate the advantage of the overwhelming evidence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>defendant\u2019s intoxication.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The judge credited the attorney\u2019s explanation of his strategic decisions and his recollection that he had discussed the decision with the defendant, who had agreed with counsel\u2019s strategy. In addition, she found that defense counsel \u201cdid not ignore Dr. Fox\u2019s opinion that the defendant suffered as well from PTSD, [but] he made a tactical decision that the PTSD defense suggested by Dr. Fox was unlikely to succeed.\u201d The judge also found that trial counsel \u201cvigorously argued all the evidence [and] succeeded in part, as the jury found the defendant not guilty of murder by deliberate premeditation.\u201d At the same time, she noted that counsel had only a rudimentary understanding of PTSD and had based his decision to forgo further investigation of the condition on his personal assessment of the defendant during their meetings. In addition, she noted defense counsel\u2019s \u201cgeneral lack of faith in psychiatry ... as a defense in criminal trials.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Dr. Fox confirmed that he had reported his PTSD diagnosis to trial counsel in advance of the trial and advised the attorney to pursue further evaluation of that condition. Dr. Fox recalled that at one of the trial preparation meetings, trial counsel advised him that he intended to present only the intoxication defense and explained that his questions during the trial would be limited to that issue. In recounting his pretrial involvement with trial counsel, however, Dr. Fox criticized counsel\u2019s strategic choices and testified that he disagreed with counsel\u2019s intoxication defense strategy. He expressed \u201cfrustration]\u201d that he did not have the \u201copportunity\u201d for a full discussion of the issue with counsel. As to this point, however, the judge found that Dr. Fox told defense counsel that \u201cPTSD <em>might </em>be a defense worth pursuing\u201d and that \u201cfurther evaluation and objective testing would be useful if the defense were to be presented in court\u201d (emphases added). The judge made no finding that Dr. Fox ever expressed to counsel his disagreement with the trial strategy. As the trial record demonstrates, Dr. Fox testified at trial in accordance with trial counsel\u2019s defense strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">The three experts, in their affidavits based on extensive post-trial testing and interviews with defendant\u2019s family, definitively diagnosed the defendant with PTSD and other mental diseases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>including alcohol dependency, brain injury, intermittent explosive disorder, dysthymic disorder, social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, and several unspecified personality disorders.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> All of these experts opined that because of the defendant\u2019s multiple mental disorders, he lacked the capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct and to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Standard of review. </em>\u201cIn the absence of constitutional error, a motion for a new trial is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>381 Mass. 141, 142 (1980), who may grant a new trial \u201cif it appears that justice may not have been done.\u201d Mass. R. Crim. R 30 (b), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001). Judges are to apply the rule 30 (b) standard rigorously and should grant such motion only if the defendant comes forward with a credible reason that outweighs the risk of prejudice to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiCicco, </em>470 Mass. 720, 728 (2015), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fanelli, </em>412 Mass. 497, 504 (1992). On the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal of the grant of a defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, we consider whether the judge committed a significant error of law or abuse of discretion in allowing the defendant\u2019s motion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>462 Mass. 591, 597 (2012). That discretion, however, \u201cis not boundless and absolute.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Genius, </em>402 Mass. 711, 714 (1988). Under the abuse of discretion standard, the issue is whether the judge\u2019s decision resulted from \u201ca clear error of judgment in weighing the factors relevant to the decision ... such that the decision falls outside the range of reasonable alternatives\u201d (quotation and citation omitted).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>L.L. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>470 Mass. 169, 185 n.27 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">On review, \u201c[a] judge\u2019s findings of fact after an evidentiary hearing on a motion for a new trial will be accepted if supported by the record.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>443 Mass. 213, 224 (2005). Where, as here, the motion judge is also the trial judge, we give \u201cspecial deference\u201d to the judge\u2019s findings of fact and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>ultimate decision on the motion. <em>Lane, </em>462 Mass. at 597. We consider the record in its entirety, however, to determine whether \u201cthere exists in the record before us evidence to support the judge\u2019s decision to order a new trial.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>393 Mass. 318, 324 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">b. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>\u201cWhere a new trial is sought based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the burden of proving ineffectiveness rests with the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montez, </em>450 Mass. 736, 755 (2008), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Comita, </em>441 Mass. 86, 90 (2004). We begin the analysis with an overview of the legal principles underlying the judge\u2019s allowance of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel. Under the familiar <em>Saferian </em>test, a defendant is denied constitutionally effective assistance of counsel if the representation fell \u201cmeasurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer,\u201d and that the performance inadequacy \u201clikely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. at 96. The <em>Saferian </em>test is implicit recognition that the constitutional interest undergirding the assistance of counsel jurisprudence is the right to a fair trial. Although a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel may not prevail unless counsel\u2019s performance affects the fairness of the trial, we need not reach that analysis if we determine that counsel\u2019s representation did not fall measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haley, </em>413 Mass. 770, 775 (1992). See also <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 689 (1984) (\u201c[T]he purpose of the effective assistance guarantee ... is simply to ensure that criminal defendants receive a fair trial,\u201d not to \u201cimprove the quality of legal representation, although that is a goal of considerable importance to the legal system\u201d). \u201cIn cases where tactical or strategic decisions of the defendant\u2019s counsel are at issue, we conduct our review with some deference to avoid characterizing as unreasonable a defense that was merely unsuccessful.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valentin, </em>470 Mass. 186, 190 (2014), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>409 Mass. 266, 272 (1991). This measure of deference is as it must be because, ultimately, counsel alone has the benefit of the full factual picture that dictates the choice of those matters to be revealed to the fact finder and those that are better left unexposed to court room scrutiny. From that vantage point, counsel \u201cknows best how to defend a client.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Glover, </em>459 Mass. 836, 843 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>Where, as here, the defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is based on a tactical or strategic decision, the test is whether the decision was \u201c \u2018manifestly unreasonable\u2019 when made.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acevedo, </em>446 Mass. 435, 442 (2006), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>374 Mass. 722, 728 (1978). The inquiry involves both temporal and substantive considerations. The temporal consideration limits the effect of hindsight by requiring a focus on the point in time when counsel made the challenged strategic decision. <em>Glover, </em>459 Mass. at 843, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fenton F., </em>442 Mass. 31, 38 (2004). Substantively, \u201c[ojnly \u2018strategy and tactics which lawyers of ordinary training and skill in the criminal law would not consider competent\u2019 \u201d are manifestly unreasonable. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pillai, </em>445 Mass. 175, 186-187 (2005), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Levia, </em>385 Mass. 345, 353 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">c. <em>Manifest unreasonableness of counsel\u2019s strategic decisions. </em>Deference to the motion judge\u2019s discretion notwithstanding, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lucien, </em>440 Mass. 658, 669-670 (2004), we conclude for the reasons explained <em>infra </em>that the record before us lacks support for the judge\u2019s ruling that counsel\u2019s duty to provide constitutionally effective assistance of counsel compelled further investigation of Dr. Fox\u2019s PTSD diagnosis and the presentation of a defense based on that diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">First, the judge erred by misapplying the \u201cmanifestly unreasonable\u201d test to the facts of this case. Reasonableness in the context of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is an objective standard that measures counsel\u2019s conduct against that which \u201clawyers of ordinary training and skill in the criminal law\u201d would consider competent. See <em>Pillai, </em>445 Mass. at 186-187. See also <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. at 96. Although our cases applying the manifestly unreasonable test have not precisely marked the limits of a trial attorney\u2019s prerogative to make strategic decisions, we have been clear that reasonableness does not demand perfection. <em>Valentin, </em>470 Mass. at 190. See <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691. Nor is reasonableness informed by what hindsight may reveal as a superior or better strategy. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bernier, </em>359 Mass. 13, 17 (1971). Counsel may strive for perfection, but only competence or the avoidance of a \u201cserious incompetency\u201d is required. <em>Walker, </em>443 Mass. at 225. The manifestly unreasonable test, therefore, is essentially a search for rationality in counsel\u2019s strategic decisions, taking into account all the circumstances known or that should have been known to counsel in the exercise of his duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>provide effective representation to the client and not whether counsel could have made alternative choices. <em>Id. </em>at 227-228. Counsel\u2019s strategic choices did not yield an outcome favorable to the defendant, and in hindsight, he could have done more or made different choices. Nonetheless, those strategic choices were rational and entirely consistent with what \u201clawyers of ordinary training and skill in the criminal law\u201d would deem to be competent. <em>Pillai, </em>445 Mass. at 186-187. See <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. at 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Counsel\u2019s decision to forgo further investigation of the defendant\u2019s mental state was an informed exercise of his prerogative to decide on the defense strategy. As the judge found, counsel was aware of the options but made the strategic decision that a lack of criminal responsibility or diminished capacity defense was unlikely to succeed and that further investigation was unnecessary. Indeed, Dr. Fox\u2019s letter of January 5, 1999, proposing these options to counsel suggested that it would have been necessary to pursue further investigation only if counsel intended to choose either defense. Because counsel had done what was necessary to identify the defense options based on PTSD, we discern no basis to hold that he was required exhaustively to explore and identify the constellation of mental diseases later identified in the posttrial examinations. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Candelario, </em>446 Mass. 847, 856-858 (2006). Cf. <em>Walker, </em>443 Mass. at 223. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberio, </em>428 Mass. 278, 280 (1998), <em>S.C., </em>440 Mass. 245 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">In reviewing the judge\u2019s assessment of defense counsel\u2019s strategy, we cannot blind ourselves to what counsel and other experienced trial attorneys know all too well: the extreme difficulty in successfully defending a murder case based on a lack of criminal responsibility defense.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Walker, </em>443 Mass. at 226 &amp; n.2 (affirming judge\u2019s finding of no ineffective assistance of counsel and noting \u201cinsanity verdicts are rare, even when . . . there is strong evidence of mental illness or bizarre human conduct\u201d). We reiterate here the judge\u2019s references to counsel\u2019s concern that a lack of criminal responsibility defense would expose the defendant\u2019s mental condition to examination by the Commonwealth\u2019s experts. This possibility was a powerful disincentive to pursue a defense based on a newly diagnosed condition that likely would have been undermined by the Commonwealth\u2019s expert. Given the substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>tial agreement of all the trial witnesses, including the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses, on the defendant\u2019s extreme intoxication at the time of the killing, counsel was entitled to weigh this factor more heavily in his strategic choice of a defense. From the perspective of the hypothetical lawyer of ordinary skill and training, the choice between a defense that, in counsel\u2019s reckoning at least, would require riding \u201ctwo horses,\u201d and a viable alternative defense based on the factually unassailable intoxication defense developed by counsel, would pose little difficulty. Thus, we conclude that the judge\u2019s implicit finding that the hypothetical attorney of ordinary skills and training would perceive a \u201cserious incompetency\u201d in counsel\u2019s strategy to forgo an insanity defense in this case was error. See <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. at 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Further, the adequacy of counsel\u2019s performance is supported by Dr. Fox\u2019s agreement to testify at trial in accordance with counsel\u2019s strategy to defend against the indictment based only on the intoxication defense.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Dr. Fox\u2019s participation in the trial on these terms would not have communicated to counsel the fundamental disagreement that Dr. Fox asserted at the posttrial proceedings. Rather, counsel likely would have assumed that his approach was acceptable from a medical point of view. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaboriault, </em>439 Mass. 84, 95 (2003) (rejecting defendant\u2019s claim that trial counsel was manifestly unreasonable by failing to obtain expert\u2019s opinion on criminal responsibility prior to trial where counsel obtained opinion from another expert and this expert did not volunteer such opinion until after trial). Where this is the case, we see no basis to fault counsel for elevating his concern for a viable legal defense over a possible alternative approach likely fraught with difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">The judge\u2019s assessment of counsel\u2019s performance also is a factor in our analysis. Here, the judge found that defense counsel \u201cis one of the most experienced and successful criminal trial attorneys in Western Massachusetts\u201d and that, except for the strategic decision challenged by the defendant in his motion for a new trial, \u201ccounsel\u2019s performance at trial was in all other respects exemplary.\u201d Significantly, the judge also found that counsel \u201ctook appropriate steps to investigate various defenses\u201d and \u201cdid not ignore [the defense expert\u2019s] opinion that the defendant suffered... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>from PTSD.\u201d Where counsel\u2019s performance is \u201cin all other respects exemplary,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we are persuaded that the measure of deference generally accorded to counsel\u2019s strategic choices was not applied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">As a closing observation on this issue, we emphasize that caution is warranted in any suggestion that an attorney representing a defendant in a murder case must submit to the advice of a chosen expert. Medical experts are not attorneys. A defendant\u2019s legal counsel is uniquely qualified to assess the nuances that attend the development of the trial strategy. See <em>Glover, </em>459 Mass. at 843. Although counsel\u2019s strategic choices are always open to review, we are hesitant to endorse an analytical approach to ineffective assistance of counsel claims that permits a retained expert to support or otherwise cooperate with the defense strategy at trial and later repudiate that participation by criticizing or attacking the very role he played in the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">We appreciate that our appellate cases offered no clear guidance to the judge in her analysis of counsel\u2019s strategic choices; however, the cases relied upon by the judge do not require a finding that counsel\u2019s strategic decisions were manifestly unreasonable. In <em>Walker, </em>443 Mass. at 223, the issue centered on counsel\u2019s decision not to investigate a defense of lack of criminal responsibility. Despite defense counsel\u2019s knowledge in that case that the defendant had years prior attempted suicide and had been discharged from the armed services for psychological reasons, <em>id. </em>at 225-226, the court held that because of \u201cscant\u201d evidence that the defendant had a history of mental health problems, counsel\u2019s decision not to investigate lack of criminal responsibility was not a manifestly unreasonable strategic choice. <em>Id. </em>at 227-228. The judge extrapolated from <em>Walker </em>a constitutional duty to explore fully the nature and extent of the defendant\u2019s PTSD, apparently based on the defendant\u2019s presentation of \u201cstrong expert opinion evidence that he suffered from mental illness at the time of the homicide.\u201d According to this logic, if counsel was excused from the obligation to investigate a lack of criminal responsibility defense where the evidence of mental disease was minimal or nonexistent, then counsel is obliged to investigate where there is strong evidence of such a condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">The judge\u2019s reference to the \u201cstrong\u201d posttrial evidence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>defendant\u2019s mental illness at the time of the homicide suggests an undue reliance on hindsight. As we often have cautioned, a court may not apply the benefit of hindsight in assessing counsel\u2019s strategic choices. See <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 680; <em>Glover, </em>459 Mass. at 843. The issue for the judge considering ineffective assistance of counsel on this ground is whether the strategic choice was reasonable at the time made. See <em>Strickland, supra', Glover, supra. </em>We reiterate that despite the substantive appeal of the new information, the issue should not be resolved by giving undue weight to facts unearthed during counsel\u2019s posttrial research. Rather, the issue is whether counsel was under a duty to make that same inquiry based on what he knew or should have known at the time of his trial preparation. Here, trial counsel already was aware of the implications of the defendant\u2019s PTSD diagnosis and made a rational choice to rely on a different defense; he was under no duty to seek further expert opinion on the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\"><em>Candelario, </em>446 Mass. 847, also relied on by the judge, does not support the finding that counsel\u2019s strategic choices were manifestly unreasonable. In <em>Candelario, supra </em>at 853, trial counsel retained a mental health expert to evaluate the defendant before trial. Although the expert diagnosed the defendant with a frontal lobe deficit, trial counsel decided not to present an insanity defense and focused instead on winning a verdict of murder in the second degree or manslaughter. <em>Id. </em>at 853-854. This court affirmed the denial of a motion for a new trial where the evidence suggested that the defendant was a malingerer and his mental health issues were contrived, and concluded that trial counsel\u2019s decision was reasonable in light of the obvious \u201cweaknesses in a defense of lack of criminal responsibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 854, 856-857. Thus, <em>Candelario </em>is in accord with the view stated above that defense counsel may reject an expert\u2019s opinion of a defendant\u2019s mental condition if it is in the best interest of the trial strategy. <em>Glover, </em>459 Mass. at 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">d. <em>Prejudice. </em>Based on our conclusion that the judge erred in ruling that counsel\u2019s strategic choices to forgo further investigation of the defendant\u2019s mental condition and to present only an intoxication defense were manifestly unreasonable, we need not address the issue of prejudice. <em>Glover, </em>459 Mass. at 844-845.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">\n<em>Order granting motion for a new trial reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b678-16\">The jury did not find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree on the theory of deliberate premeditation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b679-7\">The defendant also moved for a reduction of the verdict pursuant to Mass.
