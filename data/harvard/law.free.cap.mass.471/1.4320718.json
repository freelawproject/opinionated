More specifically, we revisit the question whether certain provisions of the Crime Bill apply to drug crimes with which the defendant was charged before the statute\u2019s effective date, but for which the defendant was not convicted until after the effective date. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>466 Mass. 286 (2013). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>466 Mass. 551 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b16-11\">The Crime Bill had an emergency preamble and was effective on passage, which occurred on August 2, 2012. Among other things, it made a number of changes to provisions of the Commonwealth\u2019s controlled substances law, G. L. c. 94C.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Crime Bill also included a section specifying that certain provisions of the legislation were to apply retroactively to individuals who previously had been convicted of certain drug crimes with mandatory minimum sentences and were still serving those sentences. See St. 2012, c. 192, \u00a7 48 (\u00a7 48). In <em>Galvin, </em>466 Mass. at 286-287, 290-291, based on our review of the Crime Bill\u2019s language and purpose, we interpreted \u00a7 48\u2019s retroactivity provisions to mean that certain of its mandatory minimum sentence reductions should be applied retroactively to a defendant who had been charged with committing a drug offense before the Crime Bill\u2019s effective date, but who was not tried, convicted, or sentenced until after that date. Thereafter, in <em>Bradley, </em>466 Mass. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>561, we held that the school zone radius reduction included in \u00a7 30 of the Crime Bill should be applied retroactively to an individual who committed a drug offense prior to the Crime Bill\u2019s effective date, where the adjudication of the case did not occur until later.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-5\">The defendant here has been indicted on a charge of trafficking in cocaine in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E <em>fib) </em>(2), the second tier of this trafficking crime.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The indictment was pending on August 2, 2012, the Crime Bill\u2019s effective date, and remains pending. The Crime Bill amends \u00a7 32E <em>fib) </em>(2), along with \u00a7 32E <em>fib) </em>(1), in two ways: by striking out the previous versions of these two clauses and replacing them with new clauses that reconfigure or redefine the trafficking weights defining each, and by reducing the mandatory minimum sentence applicable to each. See St. 2012, c. 192, \u00a7 21. A judge of the Superior Court has agreed with the defendant that, following this court\u2019s decisions in <em>Galvin </em>and <em>Bradley, </em>both the amendments to \u00a7 32E <em>fib) </em>(2) effected by \u00a7 21 of the Crime Bill apply to this defendant. We conclude that, in accordance with <em>Galvin, </em>466 Mass. at 290-291, \u00a7 21\u2019s reduction of the mandatory minimum sentence required for a violation of \u00a7 32E <em>fib) </em>(2) applies retroactively to the defendant, but that \u00a7 21\u2019s redefinition of the minimum and maximum trafficking weights does not.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b17-6\">Background.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On May 3, 2011, Somerville police officers observed the defendant engaging in what they believed to be street-level drug transactions. The police later searched the defendant and discovered him to be in possession of eight bags of cocaine with a total weight of 28.14 grams. On October 20, 2011, the defendant was indicted on a charge of violating G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E <em>fib) </em>(2), which at the time prohibited trafficking in cocaine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>with a net weight of \u201c[t]wenty-eight grams or more, but less than one hundred grams,\u201d and imposed a mandatory minimum prison sentence of five years and a maximum sentence of not more than twenty years. See G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E <em>(b) </em>(2), as amended through St. 2010, c. 256, \u00a7 70. See also G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-5\">On August 2, 2012, the Crime Bill was enacted and went into effect. As noted, \u00a7 21 amended \u00a7 32E <em>(b) </em>(1), the first tier of trafficking in cocaine, by increasing the net weights defining the tier to the range of from eighteen grams to thirty-six grams \u2014 the first tier previously had been defined as from fourteen grams to twenty-eight grams \u2014 and to establish a mandatory minimum sentence of two years, rather than the previous mandatory minimum of three years. See G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E <em>(b) </em>(1), as amended by St. 2012, c. 192, \u00a7 21. Section 32E <em>(b) </em>(2), the second trafficking tier, was amended to redefine the weight range for the tier as from thirty-six grams to one hundred grams \u2014 previously, the range had been from twenty-eight to one hundred grams \u2014 and to set the mandatory minimum sentence as three and one-half years instead of the previous five years.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E <em>(b) </em>(2), as amended by St. 2012, c. 192, \u00a7 21. Thus, if the defendant were to be charged and convicted under the version of \u00a7 32E <em>(b) </em>that incorporates the Crime Bill amendments, the defendant could only be found guilty under \u00a7 32E <em>(b) </em>(1), the lowest tier of trafficking in cocaine, rather than \u00a7 32E <em>(b) </em>(2), the second tier.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-6\">Prior to trial, on September 28, 2012, the defendant filed a motion to apply all the Crime Bill\u2019s amendments to \u00a7 32E <em>(b) </em>(1) and (2) to his case. He later filed a supplemental motion renewing his request in light of this court\u2019s decisions in <em>Galvin </em>and <em>Bradley. </em>On February 6, 2014, the judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion in a written memorandum of decision. On March 3, the Commonwealth filed a notice of appeal from the judge\u2019s order pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 <em>(a) </em>(1), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996), arguing that the order in substance constituted an allowance of a motion to dismiss so much of the indictment as charged trafficking in cocaine in violation of \u00a7 32E <em>(b) </em>(2), leaving in place the lesser included offense of trafficking in cocaine in violation of \u00a7 32E <em>(b) </em>(l).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We granted the Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>wealth\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201cAs a general rule of statutory construction, a newly enacted statute is presumptively prospective, and \u2018[t]he repeal of a statute shall not affect any punishment, penalty or forfeiture incurred before the repeal takes effect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Galvin, </em>466 Mass. at 290, quoting G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, Second. See <em>Bradley, </em>466 Mass. at 553; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dotson, </em>462 Mass. 96, 99-100 (2012). \u201cThe consequence of this presumption is to \u2018preserve, even after legislative change of a statute, the liability of an offender to punishment for an earlier act or omission made criminal by [a] statute repealed in whole or in part.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bradley, supra, </em>quoting <em>Dotson, supra. </em>The presumption of prospective application governs \u201cunless [its] observance would involve a construction inconsistent with the manifest intent of the lawmaking body or repugnant to the context of the same statute.\u201d <em>Galvin, supra, </em>quoting G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6. See <em>Bradley, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b19-6\">The defendant in <em>Galvin </em>had been charged with committing a drug crime \u2014 distribution of cocaine as a second or subsequent offense in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A <em>(d) </em>\u2014 before August 2, 2012, the effective date of the Crime Bill, but his case was not adjudicated until after that date. <em>Galvin, </em>466 Mass. at 287. Section 14 of the Crime Bill amended \u00a7 32A (d) to reduce the section\u2019s mandatory minimum sentence of five years to three and one-half years and, in sentencing the defendant, the judge imposed the amended three and one-half year mandatory minimum. <em>Id. </em>at 288. The question raised on appeal was whether, given the date of his offense and indictment, the defendant was entitled to the benefit of this reduced mandatory minimum sentence effected by \u00a7 14 of the Crime Bill. <em>Id. </em>at 286-287.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-7\">In answering this question, we observed that \u201cone of [the Crime Bill\u2019s] primary purposes was to significantly reduce the sentences to be served by individuals under the mandatory minimum provisions of a wide range of drug-related offenses.\u201d See <em>Galvin, </em>466 Mass. at 291. Given this statutory goal of reducing sentences served for certain drug offenses (including violations of \u00a7 32A <em>[d]) </em>going forward, and considering the fact that in the retroactivity provisions of \u00a7 48 of the Crime Bill the Legislature had expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>provided for application of the legislation\u2019s reduced mandatory m\u00ednimums to individuals previously convicted of these crimes and currently serving prison sentences, we concluded that to deny the defendant in that case the benefit of the Crime Bill\u2019s reduced mandatory minimum sentence for violating \u00a7 32A <em>(d) </em>would be \u201canomalous, if not absurd,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 291, and accordingly \u201cinconsistent with the manifest intent of the [Legislature] as well as repugnant to the context of the [Crime Bill].\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-5\">In contrast to the change to \u00a7 32A <em>(d) </em>at issue in <em>Galvin, </em>the defendant here seeks to benefit from changes to \u00a7 32E <em>(b) </em>(2) that do not merely reduce the applicable mandatory minimum sentence but also effectively redefine the elements of the underlying crime for which he has been indicted. This change is unquestionably substantive in nature: by increasing the minimum drug weight required for a violation of \u00a7 32E <em>(b) </em>(2), the Legislature has altered what the Commonwealth must prove in order to convict the defendant under this statute. See <em>Dotson, </em>462 Mass. at 100 (legislative amendment to G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, differentiating between first and second offenses for disorderly conduct has substantive impact on how Commonwealth must prosecute offenses). The result of applying the increased drug weights to the defendant\u2019s case would be that the defendant can be charged only with violating \u00a7 32E <em>(b) </em>(1), which, as the Commonwealth correctly contends, is essentially a lesser included offense of \u00a7 32E <em>(b) </em>(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b20-6\">The defendant does not contest this characterization of the redefined weights as a change to the elements of the crime of which he is accused, or the observation that this is a more substantive change than the one applied retroactively in <em>Galvin. </em>Rather, he argues that regardless of the nature of the change, retroactive application of the reconfigured drug weights to him is consistent with the manifest intent of the Crime Bill and of \u00a7 48 in particular. Section 48 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b20-7\">\u201cNotwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, any person incarcerated on the effective date of this act for an offense which, at the time such person was sentenced on such offense, requires serving a minimum term of incarceration before such person is eligible for probation, parole, work release or release shall be eligible for probation, parole, work release and deductions in sentence for good conduct <em>under [\u00a7\u00a7] 12 to 29, </em>inclusive\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b21-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>St. 2012, c. 192, \u00a7 48. The defendant argues that because the reconfigured trafficking weights are included in \u00a7 21 of the Crime Bill and \u00a7 21 itself is included within \u00a7\u00a7 12 to 29, the reconfigured trafficking weights therefore come within the portion of the Crime Bill to which the retroactivity provision in \u00a7 48 specifically applies. He concludes from this that the retroactivity provision in \u00a7 48 demonstrates a clear legislative intent to apply all the provisions of \u00a7 21 retroactively to him, not merely those provisions that affect his eligibility for a reduced mandatory minimum sentence under \u00a7 32E <em>(b) </em>(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">The difficulty with the defendant\u2019s argument is that it substantially ignores key language of \u00a7 48 the Crime Bill. By its express terms, \u00a7 48 focuses on offenders with mandatory minimum terms of incarceration, and specifically on these offenders\u2019 eligibility \u201cfor probation, parole, work release and deductions in sentence for good conduct.\u201d The reductions in the mandatory minimum sentences included within \u00a7\u00a7 12 to 29 of the Crime Bill directly affect a drug offender\u2019s eligibility for virtually all of these programs, because the programs otherwise would not be available until the mandatory minimum portion of a sentence has been served. See G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32H. For the same reasons that we discussed in <em>Galvin, </em>see 466 Mass. at 291, it would be \u201cinconsistent with the manifest intent\u201d and \u201crepugnant to the context\u201d of the Crime Bill not to apply the new mandatory minimum sentence for a violation of \u00a7 32E <em>(b) </em>(2) expressly set out in \u00a7 21 of the Crime Bill to the defendant in this case. If we did not apply this new mandatory minimum sentence retroactively, a person convicted and sentenced before the enactment of the Crime Bill would be eligible to be released on parole upon completion of the new, shorter mandatory minimum term, but a person who committed the crime on the same day but was convicted and sentenced <em>after </em>its enactment would not be eligible for release until completion of the old, longer mandatory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">But the provisions of \u00a7 21 that amend \u00a7 32E <em>(b) </em>(1) and (2) by reconfiguring the trafficking weights are a different matter. These provisions in and of themselves have no direct relationship to eligibility for probation, parole, work release, or good conduct sentence deductions. Rather, the net weights determine only which tier of trafficking will apply; it is the separate sentencing provisions within each trafficking tier that then define the man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>datory minimum sentence for that tier.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">As Galvin, 466 Mass. at 290-291, suggests, the starting point for any consideration of applying the Crime Bill retroactively to the defendant is \u00a7 48. Section 48 specifically refers to mandatory minimum sentences (required \u201cminimum term of incarceration\u201d), and provides that the Crime Bill\u2019s amended m\u00ednimums are to apply to those currently incarcerated. It makes no mention of the redefined trafficking weights that the Crime Bill enacts, and at best, it would be administratively challenging to apply those redefined weights to currently incarcerated individuals.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> More importantly, it would appear to be beyond the authority of the Department of Correction (department) to treat a person convicted and sentenced for violation of \u00a7 32E <em>(b) </em>(2) as effectively convicted and sentenced for violation of \u00a7 32E <em>(b) </em>(1) \u2014 the result the defendant seeks in this case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">If the redefined trafficking weights in \u00a7 21 of the Crime Bill do not apply to those who are the direct and explicit beneficiaries of the retroactivity provisions of \u00a7 48 \u2014 individuals convicted of drug crimes with mandatory minimum penalties who were pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>viously sentenced and remained incarcerated when the Crime Bill went into effect \u2014 there is no reason or justification for them to apply retroactively to the defendant. In light of this, and of the indirect manner in which the trafficking weight amendments affect mandatory minimum sentences, we conclude that it is not inconsistent with \u00a7 48 or with the manifest intent of the Crime Bill generally to confine the retroactive application of the Bill\u2019s provisions solely to the revised and reduced mandatory minimum sentences contained within \u00a7\u00a7 12 to 29.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">In arguing against this result, the defendant asserts that applying the amended drug trafficking weights in \u00a7 21 to him furthers a primary purpose of the Crime Bill, namely, to \u201csignificantly reduce the sentences to be served by individuals under the mandatory minimum provisions of a wide range of drug-related offenses.\u201d Galvin, 466 Mass. at 291. As previously described, see note 7, <em>supra, </em>retroactive application to the defendant of the Crime Bill\u2019s reconfigured drug weights for the trafficking offenses defined in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E <em>(b) </em>(1) and (2), would result in his receiving, if convicted, two reductions in the mandatory minimum term he must serve when compared to the sentence he would have received under the version of \u00a7 32E <em>(b) </em>(2) in effect at the time he was indicted, thereby furthering the Crime Bill\u2019s goal of reducing the mandatory minimum sentences served for drug-related offenses. This, he argues, is additional evidence that retroactive application of the amended drug weights to him is consistent with the manifest intent behind the new statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">However, in light of the presumption of prospectivity in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, Second, the mere fact that retroactive application of the amended trafficking weights to the defendant might appear to advance an important purpose of the Crime Bill, by itself, does not necessarily mean that failing to do so is inconsistent with the statute\u2019s purpose. If it were otherwise, every amendment or partial repeal and amendment of a criminal statute would need to be given retroactive effect, in direct conflict with the presumption of prospectivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">In sum, although retroactive application of the increased drug weights to cases pending at the time that the Crime Bill became <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>effective might further advance an important goal of the Crime Bill, in contrast to the <em>Galvin </em>and <em>Bradley </em>cases, here, we conclude that prospective application is not contrary to its \u201cmanifest intent\u201d or \u201crepugnant\u201d to the statute\u2019s context.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">Finally, the defendant invokes the \u201crule of lenity,\u201d arguing that in interpreting the Crime Bill, any ambiguity as to whether the increased drug weights should apply retroactively to him must be resolved in his favor. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>462 Mass. 676, 679 (2012), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roucoulet, </em>413 Mass. 647, 652 (1992) (\u201cwhen a criminal statute can \u2018plausibly be found to be ambiguous,\u2019 the rule of lenity applies, and we \u2018give the defendant the benefit of the ambiguity\u2019 \u201d). However, the rule of lenity does not come into play when the question to be answered is whether a particular criminal statute should be applied retroactively to a defendant who is charged with committing an offense before that statute went into effect. This inquiry is governed instead by G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, Second. Even if this were not the case, \u201c[t]he rule of lenity does not require . . . that absent an ambiguity we construe a penal statute most favorably to a defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carrion, </em>431 Mass. 44, 46 (2000). See <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>468 Mass. 49, 52 n.8 (2014). Here, given the presumption that new statutes will be applied prospectively, the absence of any explicit indication that the Legislature intended the increased drug weights to apply retroactively, and our observation that applying the increased drug weights retroactively would appear to create substantial practical difficulties, we conclude that no ambiguity exists concerning the retroactive application of the redefined drug trafficking weights in \u00a7 21 of the Crime Bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The reduced mandatory minimum sentence under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E <em>(b) </em>(2), as amended by St. 2012, c. 192, \u00a7 21, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>will apply to the defendant if he is convicted of that offense. The reconfigured drug trafficking weights provided in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E (\u00bf&gt;) (1) and (2), as amended by St. 2012, c. 192, \u00a7 21, are not applicable to the defendant. The order of the Superior Court dated February 6, 2014, is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b16-12\">These changes to G. L. c. 94C include increases to the weights required to establish certain drug offenses; reductions to the mandatory minimum sentences associated with certain drug crimes; and a reduction in the radius of school zones, which influences whether those convicted of certain drug violations in specified areas must be subject to mandatory sentence enhancements. See, e.g., St. 2012, c. 192, \u00a7\u00a7 21, 25, 30.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b17-7\">General Laws c. 94C, \u00a7 32E <em>(b), </em>prohibits trafficking in <em>\u201ca controlled substance defined in clause (4) of paragraph </em>(a) . . . <em>of Class B of [\u00a7 31]\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Cocaine is one of the controlled substances included in class B. See G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 31. For ease of reference, we refer to \u00a7 32E <em>fib) </em>in this opinion as prohibiting trafficking in cocaine.

We accept the Commonwealth\u2019s characterization, and we do not discuss the issue further in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b22-7\">The defendant\u2019s case illustrates the point. If the reconfigured trafficking weights in \u00a7 21 of the Crime Bill were applied retroactively to him, the direct effect would be that the crime with which he is charged would change from trafficking in violation of \u00a7 32E (\u00a3&gt;) (2) to trafficking in violation of \u00a7 32E <em>(b) </em>(1). As a consequence of that change \u2014 not directly \u2014 the mandatory minimum sentence upon conviction would then shift from three and one-half years (\u00a7 32E [i&gt;] [2]) to two years (\u00a7 32E [6] [1]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b22-8\">Not everyone previously convicted of trafficking in cocaine in violation of \u00a7 32E <em>(b) </em>(2) who was still serving a sentence when the Crime Bill went into effect would be affected by the bill\u2019s reconfiguration of the trafficking weight ranges of \u00a7 32E <em>(b) </em>(1) and (2). Rather, whether such an inmate would be affected would depend on the actual weight of the cocaine involved in his or her underlying criminal case, and the Department of Correction (department) would have to investigate and determine the actual weight of the drugs at issue in each such person\u2019s case. Such an investigation into the underlying facts of each case is certainly outside the scope of the department\u2019s responsibilities, if not of its authority, and is, in many cases, difficult if not impossible to accomplish as a practical matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b22-9\">We note that although the department began as early as 2012 to apply the Crime Bill\u2019s reduced mandatory minimum sentences to those convicted before the Crime Bill\u2019s effective date who are still incarcerated, the department did not similarly apply the Crime Bill\u2019s amendments to the trafficking weights for cocaine (see St. 2012, c. 192, \u00a7 21) and heroin (see St. 2012, c. 192, \u00a7 25) to this group. See Memorandum from Charles W. Anderson, Jr., Counsel to Department of Correction, to Hon. Robert A. Mulligan, Chief Justice of Massachusetts Trial Court, et al., at 2-3 (Sept. 18, 2012) (regarding department\u2019s implementation of St. 2012, c. 192).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b23-8\">We disagree with the defendant\u2019s contention that the reference in \u00a7 48 to \u00a7\u00a7 12-29 \u201cinclusive\u201d of the Crime Bill as a unit reflects a manifest intent by the Legislature to give every provision of each of these sections retroactive effect, rather than an intent to ensure only that the changes in mandatory minimum sentences would be retroactive. As discussed, this more limited scope of retroactivity is consistent with the actual language of \u00a7 48.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b24-7\"> Although in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>466 Mass. 551 (2013), and <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>468 Mass. 49 (2014), we treated these two exceptions to the rule of prospective application as distinct.analyses, at other times, we have determined that a single line of inquiry is sufficient to address both exceptions. Compare, e.g., <em>Bradley, supra </em>at 553, and <em>Watts, supra </em>at 55, 60, with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>466 Mass. 286, 290-291 (2013), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dotson, </em>462 Mass. 96, 100-101 (2012). Addressing both exceptions together is appropriate here, where the defendant advances essentially the same argument under the repugnancy exception as he does under the manifest intent exception, namely, that applying the amended drug weights retroactively results in lower mandatory minimum sentences for more individuals, in keeping with the Crime Bill\u2019s purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
