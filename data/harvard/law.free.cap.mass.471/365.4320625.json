We conclude that the judicial liens survive the discharge where, as here, the Bankruptcy Court judge did not avoid them.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number><em>Background. </em>The plaintiff, Pagona Christakis, filed a complaint in the Land Court to remove judicial liens that had attached to real property she owned in Billerica after three creditors obtained final judgments against her. Only one creditor defendant, Jeanne D\u2019Arc Credit Union (credit union), filed an answer. The other two creditor defendants, Harvest Credit Management VII, LLC (Harvest), and Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. (Citibank), failed to respond. The plaintiff moved for entry of judgment by default against Harvest and Citibank and for summary judgment against the credit union; the latter cross-moved for summary judgment. In denying the plaintiff\u2019s motions and allowing the credit union\u2019s motion, the judge concluded that \u201c[t]he defendants\u2019 liens remain, subject to potential review by the [Bankruptcy [Cjourt to determine if they impair exempt property.\u201d The judge then entered judgment in favor of all the defendants, including the defaulting defendants. The plaintiff appealed, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">We summarize the relevant facts in the summary judgment record, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. The defendants are creditors of the plaintiff, apparently for unpaid credit card bills.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Each defendant sued the plaintiff to collect the unpaid debt and obtained a final judgment, based on which a writ of execution was issued, and a levy of execution was made on the plaintiff\u2019s real property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On July 26, 2010, the plaintiff\u2019s bank<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>ruptcy petition was filed pursuant to Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code and was subsequently converted into a Chapter 7 case on April 28, 2011.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiff received a discharge in bankruptcy on August 19, 2011. See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(b) (2012) (\u201ca discharge . . . discharges the debtor from all debts that arose before the date of the order for relief under [Chapter 7]... \u201d). The plaintiff did not seek or obtain a ruling from the Bankruptcy Court avoiding any of the defendants\u2019 liens. See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(f)(1) (2012) (debtor may avoid judicial lien on debtor\u2019s interest in property to extent that lien \u201cimpairs an exemption\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>Under Federal law, a discharge in bankruptcy \u201cvoids any judgment at any time obtained, to the extent that such judgment is a determination of the <em>personal liability </em>of the debtor with respect to any debt discharged under [11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727]\u201d (emphasis added). 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524(a)(1) (2012). See <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 524(a)(2) (discharge \u201coperates as an injunction\u201d against any act to collect debt \u201cas a personal liability of the debtor\u201d). The debt itself is not extinguished by the discharge; it remains in existence but cannot be enforced personally against the debtor. See <em>One to One Interactive, LLC </em>v. <em>Landrith, </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 142, 149 (2010). Essentially, \u201ca bankruptcy discharge extinguishes only one mode of enforcing a claim \u2014 namely, an action against the debtor in personam \u2014 while leaving intact another \u2014 namely, an action against the debtor in rem.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Home State Bank, </em>501 U.S. 78, 84 (1991).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As a matter of Federal law, an unavoided, otherwise valid lien perfected prior to the bankruptcy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>filing \u201csurvives or passes through the bankruptcy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 83. See <em>In re Garran, </em>338 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2003) (\u201ca judicial lien attached to property is a liability in rem, [and] it is not routinely discharged at the conclusion of the bankruptcy case\u201d). This distinction between in personam and in rem actions \u201ccomports with the purposes of the bankruptcy process by striking a balance between the need for debtors to obtain a reprieve from their debts, while simultaneously protecting creditors\u2019 secured property rights.\u201d <em>United Presidential Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>31 B.R. 145, 147 (N.D. Tex. 1983). Thus, the lien may still be enforced, but because of the discharge of personal liability, the enforcement of the lien \u201cis an action in rem with no recourse available against the debtor for any deficiency.\u201d W. L. Norton, Bankruptcy Law and Practice \u00a7 58:4, at 58-17 (3d. ed. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Federal law does not overlook the burden that judicial liens can place on a bankrupt debtor. See <em>Farrey </em>v. <em>Sanderfoot, </em>500 U.S. 291, 297 (1991) (\u201cCongress enacted [11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(f)] with the broad purpose of protecting the debtor\u2019s exempt property\u201d); <em>In re Garran, </em>338 F.3d at 5 (\u201cbecause judicial liens may interfere with the \u2018fresh start\u2019 the Bankruptcy Code seeks to give debtors, such liens may be avoidable under a separate provision of the Bankruptcy Code, \u00a7 522[f]\u201d). Under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(f)(1), a Bankruptcy Court judge may \u201cavoid the fixing of a lien,\u201d including a judicial lien, \u201con an interest of the debtor in property to the extent that such lien impairs an exemption to which the debtor would have been entitled.\u201d See <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 522(f)(2) (lien deemed to impair exemption to extent that sum of lien, all other liens on property, and exemption amount \u201cexceeds the value that the debtor\u2019s interest in the property would have in the absence of any liens\u201d). For instance, a debtor may be able to avoid a judicial lien on a debtor\u2019s primary residence to the extent that it impairs the homestead exemption. See, e.g., <em>In re Mariano, </em>311 B.R. 335, 340-341 (Bankr. D. Mass. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The plaintiff concedes that the defendants\u2019 liens remain valid under Federal law despite the discharge, but contends that they are invalid under Massachusetts law. We agree with the plaintiff that \u201c[t]he existence and nature of the lien that survives is determined by State law.\u201d <em>First Colonial Bank for Sav. </em>v. <em>Bergeron, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 136, 137 (1995). See <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Wasserman, </em>238 F.2d 683, 686 (1st Cir. 1956) (validity of lien after attached property is taken by eminent domain \u201cdepends wholly upon the local law\u201d). But we do not agree that Massachusetts law should differ from Federal law in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Massachusetts case law has long provided that liens perfected well before the filing of a bankruptcy petition remain valid after a discharge. In <em>Casavant </em>v. <em>Boreka, </em>298 Mass. 528, 529 (1937), we stated that \u201ca valid lien securing [a] debt may be enforced,\u201d notwithstanding a discharge, provided the lien had attached more than the period prescribed by statute before the filing of the bankruptcy petition.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Our early cases also addressed whether a creditor holding an attachment on the debtor\u2019s property may obtain a special judgment to levy an execution after a discharge. In <em>Davenport </em>v. <em>Tilton, </em>10 Met. 320, 320, 326 (1845), the debtor obtained a discharge, but creditors already held attachments on mesne process, which constituted liens on the debtor\u2019s property. Because the Bankruptcy Act of 1841 specifically provided for the survival of a lien after discharge, <em>id. </em>at 321, the main issue was whether the discharge operated \u201cas to bar every form of judgment, and [to] deprive the attaching creditor of the power of obtaining any execution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 328. We held that, despite the discharge, the creditors were entitled to a special judgment to enable them to levy upon the attached property. <em>Id. </em>at 331. See <em>Bosworth </em>v. <em>Pomeroy, </em>112 Mass. 293, 294-295 (1873) (after debtor received discharge, where creditor had valid attachment of property, creditor entitled to special judgment, \u201cto be enforced against the property attached, and not against the person or other property of the defendant\u201d). \u201cThe object of this [special judgment] [was] to enable the plaintiff to avail himself of an existing lien saved to him by the bankrupt law, and which cannot be enforced in any other way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 295. Our treatment of special judgments demonstrates that, under State law, we distinguish between in personam and in rem actions after a discharge, and permit the latter but not the former.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>Other jurisdictions also have concluded that a valid lien remains enforceable after discharge.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Some States, by statute, enable a discharged debtor to seek a State court docket entry recognizing a discharge of personal liability, but those statutes have been interpreted to preserve the validity of liens obtained prior to the bankruptcy filing. See <em>Albritton </em>v. <em>General Portland Cement Co., </em>344 So. 2d 574, 576 (Fla. 1977) (Florida statute allows debtor to clarify on record that discharged judgment no longer constitutes personal liability on debtor but \u201cdoes not affect a lien which arose from the judgment prior to bankruptcy\u201d); <em>Ducker </em>v. <em>Standard Supply Co., </em>280 S.C. 157, 158 (1984) (discharged debtor entitled to docket entry discharging judgment as to personal liability but not as to lien upon real property).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">In comparison, Wisconsin law provides that upon a debtor\u2019s application to the court, \u201cthe only thing required for satisfaction of a judgment debt and cessation of an associated judgment lien is that the underlying judgment has been discharged in bankruptcy.\u201d <em>Megal Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Shadof, </em>286 Wis. 2d 105, 133 (2005). See <em>In re Spore, </em>105 B.R. 476, 485 (Bankr. W.D. Wis. 1989) (Wsconsin law \u201cprovide[s] the legal basis and the legal means for debtors discharged in bankruptcy to void liens surviving bankruptcy\u201d). But this mechanism was created by statute, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>through interpretation of \"Wisconsin common law. See \"Wis. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 806.19(4) (Thompson Reuters 2013) (\u201cAny person who has secured a discharge of a judgment debt in bankruptcy ... may submit an application for an order of satisfaction of the judgment\u201d and \u201c[ujpon satisfaction, a judgment shall cease to be a lien on any real property that the person discharged in bankruptcy owns or later acquires\u201d). There is no similar statutory provision in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">We are not persuaded that we should alter the long-standing balance of interests between debtors and creditors, reflected in Federal law and our common law, by extinguishing both actions in personam <em>and </em>actions in rem against the discharged debtor. The plaintiff contends that \u201ca court must vacate a void judgment\u201d pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. R 60, 365 Mass. 828 (1974), and where a judgment is vacated, the liens resting on that judgment must be vacated as well. See <em>Field </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp., </em>393 Mass. 117, 118 (1984). But a discharge merely voids a judgment \u201cto the extent that such judgment is a determination of the personal liability of the debtor.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524(a)(1). Under rule 60, \u201c[a] judgment is void if the court from which it issues lacked jurisdiction over the parties, lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter, or failed to provide due process of law.\u201d <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Sannella, </em>400 Mass. 392, 395 (1987). See <em>Lubben </em>v. <em>Selective Serv. Sys. Local Bd. No. </em>27, 453 F.2d 645, 649 (1st Cir. 1972) (\u201cA void judgment is one which, from its inception, was a complete nullity and without legal effect\u201d). A discharge does not indicate that a judgment was a nullity from the start, nor does a discharge arise from a lack of jurisdiction or a failure to provide due process. The debt itself is not extinguished and would not be void as to personal liability but for the bankruptcy filing. Therefore, where a discharge only voids a judgment as to actions in personam, the liens resting on that judgment need not be invalidated, because the judgment is not void as to actions in rem. Consequently, the judge did not err in granting summary judgment to the credit union.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>The judge also entered judgment for Citibank and Harvest, even though they were in default. We consider now whether the defaulting defendants also were entitled to judgment. The entry of default means that the \u201cwell-pleaded facts\u201d of the complaint are accepted as true. <em>Nancy P. </em>v. <em>D\u2019Amato, </em>401 Mass. 516, 519 (1988). It does not mean that the party in default is deemed to have admitted the plaintiff\u2019s conclusions of law. See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Boykan, </em>464 Mass. 285, 295 (2013), citing <em>Productora e Importadora de Papel, S.A. de C.V. </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>376 Mass. 826, 834-835 (1978) (Productora). In order for a judge to enter a judgment by default, the factual allegations in the complaint must be sufficient to state a claim for relief. See <em>Productora, supra </em>(after default, plaintiff\u2019s factual allegations must still \u201cconstitute a legitimate cause of action\u201d in order for judgment to enter). If the factual allegations, accepted as true, would not permit a finding of liability, then a defaulting defendant is entitled to dismissal of the complaint despite its default. See <em>Nancy P., supra </em>at 519-520 (where defendant defaulted, judge appropriately dismissed plaintiff\u2019s claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress, because facts as alleged did not state \u201cclaim for relief\u2019). Here, even if we accept as true the facts alleged in the complaint, the defaulting defendants\u2019 liens survive the discharge as a matter of law. We therefore conclude that Citibank and Harvest Credit were as entitled to judgment as the credit union.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The defendants\u2019 liens survived the bankruptcy discharge as a matter of Federal and State law. Therefore, we affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of the credit union and affirm the denial of the plaintiff\u2019s motions for summary judgment and for entry of judgment by default. We affirm as well the entry of judgment on behalf of all the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b379-17\">We acknowledge the amicus brief submitted by the New England Legal Foundation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Although not disputed, the exact nature of the underlying debt is unclear from the record. The motion judge described it as \u201capparently for unpaid credit card bills,\u201d and the plaintiff referred to it as \u201cwhat appear[s] to be credit card debts.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b380-7\">\u201cAn execution is a process issued from a court in which a judgment has been rendered, in a civil action, for the purpose of carrying the judgment into effect.\u201d <em>Miller </em>v. <em>London, </em>294 Mass. 300, 304 (1936). See Mass. R. Civ. P. 69, 365 Mass. 836 (1974) (\u201cProcess to enforce a judgment for the payment of money shall be a writ of execution, unless the court directs otherwise\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">\u201cThe execution creates a lien which is then perfected by a levy of execution.\u201d <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Bauman, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 214, 216 (1991). See <em>LaChance </em>v. <em>Peerless Ins. Co., </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 451, 453 (1994) (\u201cA levy is the taking or seizure of property by an officer pursuant to a writ of execution\u201d). To levy an execution on real property, an officer need not physically enter the land. See <em>McGrath </em>v. <em>Worcester County Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 599, 603 (1975) (\u201can overt act by the officer falling short of an entry upon the land has been held sufficient to mark the commencement of a levy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">Both the execution and the memorandum noting the levy should be recorded. See G. L. c. 236, \u00a7 4 (\u201cthe officer shall forthwith deposit in the registry of deeds ... a copy of the execution with a memorandum thereon that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>execution is in his hands for the purpose of taking the land of the defendant\u201d).

Jeanne D\u2019Arc Credit Union recorded a writ of attachment on August 28, 2008, and subsequently obtained an execution and recorded it on June 9, 2009.

G.

Federal law distinguishes between consensual and nonconsensual liens by enabling the debtor to avoid certain judicial liens in bankruptcy. See <em>In re Smith, </em>401 B.R. 674, 687 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 2009) (Congress has demonstrated belief that consensual lienholders \u201care sufficiently worthy of protection that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>should be provided with a shortcut, a head start... to collect their claims\u201d).

Yet, there is no similar distinction between <em>unavoided </em>judicial liens and consensual liens when determining whether a lien survives a Chapter 7 discharge.
