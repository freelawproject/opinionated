Galenski then sought continued health insurance coverage and contribution by the town to the cost of her group health insurance premiums. In 2001, the town had voted to adopt G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9E, which required it to contribute over fifty per cent of the health insurance premiums of all of its retirees. Before employing Galenski, however, the town had enacted a policy stating that it would contribute only to the group health insurance premiums of retired employees who had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>retired after a minimum of ten years of employment with the town. Although Galenski was permitted to remain a member of the town\u2019s group health insurance plan after she retired, the town determined she was not eligible for any contribution by the town to her health insurance premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Galenski filed a complaint in the Superior Court contending that the town had violated her right to payment by the town of a portion of her group medical insurance premiums, as required under G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9E; she sought declaratory and injunctive relief, and also raised a claim of estoppel based on detrimental reliance. A judge of the Superior Court allowed Galenski\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the first two claims, denied the town\u2019s cross motion for summary judgment, and issued a permanent injunction prohibiting the town from enforcing its policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The town appealed, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We conclude that, because the town had voted to accept G. L. c. 32B, a local option statute that governs group health insurance for municipal employees, the terms of the statute govern whether and in what amounts the town must contribute to the cost of a retiree\u2019s health insurance premiums. Accordingly, the town\u2019s retirement policy imposing a minimum term of service as a prerequisite to premium contributions from the town is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">1. <em>Factual background. </em>We recite the facts as set forth in the judge\u2019s decision, supplemented by undisputed facts in the record. In 1956, the town voted to accept G. L. c. 32B; by accepting certain local option provisions of that statute, the town was required to make group health insurance coverage available to retired employees. In 2001, the town\u2019s voters chose to accept G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9E.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> General Laws c. 32B, \u00a7 9E, requires municipalities to contribute to the group health insurance premiums of retired employees at a rate determined by the municipality, but that rate must exceed fifty per cent of the cost of the insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>premiums.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">In February, 2006, the town enacted a retirement policy restricting participation in its group health insurance plan to those employees who retired from the town \u201cafter a minimum of ten (10) years of employment by the [t]own.\u201d The policy further provided that \u201c[a]n eligible retiree with less than ten (10) years of employment with the [town] may choose to continue health insurance coverage through the [t]own\u2019s carrier at [one hundred per cent] of the retiree\u2019s cost.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Galenski began employment as the principal of Erving Elementary School on July 1, 2006.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At that time, she was a long-time educator with over thirty years of creditable service<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as a public school teacher in the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As an active employee, Galenski was enrolled in the town\u2019s health insurance plan, and the town contributed to the cost of her health insurance premiums. Galenski retired in good standing in October, 2012, after six years of service to the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">At a meeting on October 1, 2012, the town\u2019s board of selectmen determined that Galenski, although eligible to continue to participate in the town\u2019s group health insurance plan, would be responsible for one hundred per cent of her insurance premiums. After her retirement, Galenski continued to participate in the town\u2019s group health insurance plan, paying the entire amount of the monthly premiums.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Standard of review. </em>We review a grant of summary judgment de novo to determine whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, all material facts have been established and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>DeWolfe </em>v. <em>Hingham Ctr., Ltd., </em>464 Mass. 795, 799 (2013). See Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>amended, 436 Mass. 1404 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">b. <em>Statutory framework. </em>General Laws c. 32B is a local-option statute governing various insurance benefits for employees of municipalities and other State political subdivisions. <em>Cioch </em>v. <em>Treasurer of Ludlow, </em>449 Mass. 690, 690 n.2 (2007). The purpose of G. L. c. 32B \u201cis to provide a plan of group life insurance, group accidental death and dismemberment insurance and group general or blanket hospital, surgical, medical, dental and other health insurance for certain persons in the service of counties ..., cities, towns and districts and their dependents.\u201d G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">As a local-option statute, G. L. c. 32B \u201cdoes not take effect until a governmental unit accepts it.\u201d <em>Connors </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>430 Mass. 31, 37 (1999). \u201cOnce accepted, however, it provides the exclusive mechanisms by which and to whom the [municipality] may provide group health insurance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Yeretsky </em>v. <em>Attleboro, </em>424 Mass. 315, 316-317 (1997). Where a municipality has exercised its local option to provide group health insurance for its employees through acceptance of G. L. c. 32B, \u201cemployees are automatically covered by group insurance unless the employee \u2018give[s] written notice . . . indicating that he is not to be insured for such coverages.\u2019 \u201d <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Town Manager of Southbridge, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 479, 480 (1995), <em>S.C., </em>423 Mass. 1018 (1996), quoting G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Under the \u201cdefault\u201d provision of G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9, if group health insurance is offered to a municipality\u2019s active employees, such insurance coverage \u201cshall be continued [for retired employees] and the retired employee shall pay the full premium cost, subject to the provisions of [G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9A or 9E,] whichever may be applicable.\u201d See <em>Yeretsky </em>v. <em>Attleboro, supra </em>at 317. In lieu of the default provision under G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9, a municipality adopting G. L. c. 32B may opt to accept one of these two local options, which require contributions by the municipality to a retiree\u2019s group insurance premiums. By adopting G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9A, a municipality chooses to pay fifty per cent of a retiree\u2019s insurance premiums; if a municipality adopts G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9E, the municipality then \u201cmay elect to pay \u2018a subsidiary or additional rate\u2019 greater than fifty per cent of a retiree\u2019s health insurance premium.\u201d <em>Somerville </em>v. <em>Commonwealth Employment Relations Bd., </em>470 Mass. 563, 565 (2015). In addition, G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9E, mandates that \u201c[n]o governmental unit . . . shall provide different subsidiary or additional rates to any group or class within that unit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>c. <em>Validity of the town\u2019s term of service requirement. </em>The town contends that its term of service policy, restricting the town\u2019s obligation to contribute to retirees\u2019 health insurance premiums to those retirees who were employed by the town for a minimum of ten years, is consistent with the language and purpose of G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9E. The town relies on <em>Cioch </em>v. <em>Treasurer of Ludlow, </em>449 Mass. at 696-697, for the proposition that a town policy or regulation permissibly may limit a retiree\u2019s eligibility for insurance coverage under G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9E. The town construes the prohibition in G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9E, against affording different premium contribution rates to \u201cany group or class\u201d as meaning only that groups such as teachers, fire fighters, and police officers cannot, through collective bargaining, negotiate different rates of contribution for their members. The town argues that such collective bargaining by separate groups could expose a municipality to expensive administrative costs, thereby defeating what it views to be the Legislature\u2019s purpose of cost containment.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\u201c[A] statute must be interpreted according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>College Hill Props., LLC, </em>465 Mass. 134, 139 (2013), quoting <em>Harvard Crimson, Inc. </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, </em>445 Mass. 745, 749 (2006). In interpreting a statute, we look first to its plain language. <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>College Hill Props., LLC, supra </em>at 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Municipalities accepting G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9E, \u201cshall... in addition to the payment of fifty per cent of a premium for contributory group life, hospital, surgical, medical, dental and other health insurance for employees retired from the service of the town, and their dependents, pay a subsidiary or additional rate\u201d that is determined by vote of the municipality. \u201cThe word \u2018shall\u2019 is ordinarily interpreted as having a mandatory or imperative obligation.\u201d <em>Hashimi </em>v. <em>Kalil, </em>388 Mass. 607, 609 (1983). The statute, by its terms, is mandatory, and \u201conce accepted the municipality must comply with the statute\u2019s unambiguous mandates,\u201d notwithstanding that the statute was adopted voluntarily. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>461 Mass. 602, 609 (2012). Because the town chose to adopt G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9E, the plain language of that section mandates that the town contribute more than fifty per cent of the premiums of \u201cemployees retired from the service of the town.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>As stated, an \u201cemployee\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 32B, is defined as \u201cany person in the service of a governmental unit... who receives compensation for any such service, whether such person is employed, appointed or elected by popular vote, . . . provided, however, that the duties of such person require not less than [twenty] hours, regularly, in the service of the governmental unit during the regular work week of permanent or temporary employment.\u201d G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 2. As a public school principal, Galenski held a position that falls within this definition. As an employee with more than thirty years of creditable service, Galenski was eligible to receive retirement benefits. See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 5 (1) (m); note 6, <em>supra. </em>Because she was a member of the town\u2019s group health insurance plan while employed as the principal of Erving Elementary School, Galenski was statutorily entitled to continued group health insurance as a retiree. See G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9. Cf. <em>Lexington Educ. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Lexington, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 749, 752 (1983) (rejecting town\u2019s \u201cself-imposed and super-statutory\u201d minimum hours requirement for eligibility for health insurance benefits as inconsistent with statutory definition of \u201cemployee\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">In describing contributions by a municipality to its retirees\u2019 insurance premiums, G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9E, further mandates that \u201c[n]o governmental unit. . . shall provide different subsidiary or additional rates to any group or class within that unit.\u201d Identical language appears in G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 7A, which governs contributions to insurance premiums of active employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">On the date of Galenski\u2019s retirement, the town\u2019s retirement policy provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">\u201cFor a retiree ... to qualify for participation in the [t]own\u2019s group insurance . . . [t]he employee must qualify for county or teacher\u2019s retirement and must retire from the [town] after a minimum of ten (10) years of employment by the [t]own . . . , having been eligible for health insurance for all of the ten (10) years ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">\u201cAn eligible retiree with less than ten (10) years of employment with the [town] may choose to continue health insurance through the [t]own\u2019s carrier at [one hundred per cent] of the retiree\u2019s cost.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">The requirement that a retiree \u201cmust retire from the [town] after a minimum of ten (10) years of employment by the [t]own\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>order to receive contribution towards insurance premiums is not consistent with G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9E. The town\u2019s requirement of a minimum term of service places retirees like Galenski into a subclass of retirees who are not entitled to contribution to their health insurance premiums, despite otherwise qualifying for superannuation retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\u201c[A] municipality may not enact a bylaw, policy, or regulation that is inconsistent with State law.\u201d <em>Cioch </em>v. <em>Treasurer of Ludlow, </em>449 Mass. at 699. The town\u2019s retirement policy is inconsistent with G. L. c. 32B in two significant respects and, accordingly, is invalid. First, the retirement policy establishes different insurance premium contribution rates for different groups of employees, despite the \u201cliteral mandate of equal treatment for all groups of employees with respect to employer contributions toward insurance costs.\u201d See <em>Swampscott Educ. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Swampscott, </em>391 Mass. 864, 867 (1984) (interpreting identical language in G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 7A <em>[d], </em>which governs insurance premium contribution for active employees, where \u201ctown has undertaken voluntarily to pay more than [fifty per cent] of one group of employees\u2019 insurance costs\u201d). Second, the retirement policy seeks to exempt the town from contributing to any portion of the insurance premiums for one group of employees, notwithstanding that the town has adopted G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9E, which by its plain language obligates the town to contribute more than fifty per cent of the costs of that group\u2019s insurance premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Our interpretation of the clear statutory language is consistent with the Legislature\u2019s manifest purpose in enacting G. L. c. 32B, which is to provide group health insurance for municipal employees. See G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 1. The statute provides local governments \u201cwith a volume of purchasing power sufficient to assure that their employees will receive the highest possible level of benefits at the lowest possible cost.\u201d <em>Connors </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>430 Mass. at 39, quoting 1967 Senate Doc. No. 1174, at 4. The town argues that its retirement policy simply furthers the cost containment goals of G. L. c. 32B. This argument is unavailing. The purpose of the statute is to create \u201ca \u2018comprehensive scheme of coverage\u2019 for governmental employees\u201d by \u201cgathering] them in large groups so as to effect economies of scale\u201d (citation omitted). <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Town Manager of Southbridge, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. at 480. The goal of cost containment does not, however, permit the town to seek further reduction of its costs through a policy that eliminates its obligation to contribute to the insurance premiums of a certain subset of retirees.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Invalidation of a town regulation is appropriate where \u201cthe purpose of the statute cannot be achieved in the face of the local by-law\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Connors </em>v. <em>Boston, supra </em>at 35. The town\u2019s term of service policy is inconsistent with the \u201ccomprehensive scheme of coverage\u201d established by G. L. c. 32B, because it treats retired employees differently based on their years of service to the town, and precludes them from receiving benefits to which they are statutorily entitled. See <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Town Manager of Southbridge, supra </em>at 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The town\u2019s reliance on <em>Cioch </em>v. <em>Treasurer of Ludlow, </em>449 Mass. at 696-697, is misplaced. In that case, we addressed the validity of a municipality\u2019s policy requiring a retiree to have been enrolled in a group health insurance plan while an active employee in order to continue that coverage during retirement. <em>Id. </em>at 696. The plaintiff was a retiree who had been enrolled in her husband\u2019s health insurance plan while she was an active employee of a municipality. Three years after her retirement, when her husband retired, she sought to enroll in one of the municipality\u2019s health insurance plans. <em>Id. </em>at 692-693. We noted that the statute \u201caccords municipalities substantial latitude in the adoption of \u2018such rules and regulations, not inconsistent with [G. L. c. 32B], as may be necessary for [its] administration.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 697-698, quoting G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 14. We upheld the municipality\u2019s policy because \u201c[n]othing in the plain language of G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7[ ] 9 or 16, requires a municipality to permit a retiree who has not enrolled in a municipal health insurance plan while employed, to enroll in a municipal health insurance plan after she has retired, or precludes it from doing so.\u201d <em>Cioch </em>v. <em>Treasurer of Ludlow, supra </em>at 698. We concluded that, while a municipality permissibly could limit enrollment to active employees, it remained obligated by the statute to \u201cprovide[] for continued coverage of those employees during their retirement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Finally, we reject the town\u2019s assertion that its \u201cpolicy is not unlike pension benefits that are calculated based on years of service,\u201d and its suggestion that its policy furthers reasonable cost containment efforts because it should not be held \u201cresponsible for paying a significant portion of [an] employee\u2019s health insurance premium in retirement [who had worked for other municipalities].\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To the contrary, the Legislature was cognizant of the potential consequences to a town which, because it has chosen to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>accept G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9E, must, as the last employer in a retiree\u2019s long-term public service career, contribute to the premiums of such retirees. The Legislature enacted G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9A <em>Vi, </em>specifically to address those concerns. Where a retiree has served a number of municipalities, G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9A <em>Vi,</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>creates a reimbursement scheme between those employing municipalities, and allows the municipality from which the employee retired to recover its proportional share of contributions from other municipalities where the retiree had been employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The plain language of this provision supports our interpretation of G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9E, as reflecting the Legislature\u2019s intent that a municipality that has chosen to adopt that section must contribute to the premiums of all of its retirees, regardless of whether, as active employees, their years of creditable service were performed largely in other municipalities.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We give effect to all provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>of a statute, which \u201cmust be viewed \u2018as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Gormally, </em>440 Mass. 699, 704 (2004), quoting 2A N. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 46.05, at 154 (6th ed. 2000). The town\u2019s interpretation of the statutory scheme is inconsistent with G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9A <em>Vz, </em>which reflects the Legislature\u2019s understanding that the last employer in line will be required to contribute to the insurance premiums of its retirees, notwithstanding that the retiree may have spent a substantial portion of her career working for a different municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Final judgment was entered only as to the first two claims; the claim of detrimental reliance is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b320-8\">The town of Erving (town) accepted G.

Because Massachusetts has \u201cthe strongest type of home rule,\u201d municipal action is presumed to be valid unless preempted by State law. <em>Connors </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>430 Mass. 31, 35 (1999). The town argues that its policy is not inconsistent with G. L. c. 32B, which establishes only a \u201csparse framework,\u201d and, therefore, that the Legislature did not intend to preempt municipal action such as the town\u2019s retirement policy. Our determination that the town\u2019s policy is in conflict with the language and intent of G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 9E, disposes of this claim. Cf. <em>Connors </em>v. <em>Boston, supra </em>at 39-40, citing <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>425 Mass. 697, 699 (1997) (addressing question of preemption, and holding that local executive order expanding definition of dependent was inconsistent with language and intent of G.

L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9A <em>Vz,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">\u201cWhenever a retired employee or beneficiary receives a healthcare premium contribution from a governmental unit in a case where a portion of the retiree\u2019s creditable service is attributable to service in [one] or more governmental units, the first governmental unit shall be reimbursed in full, in accordance with this paragraph, by the other governmental units for the portion of the premium contributions that corresponds to the percentage of the retiree\u2019s creditable service that is attributable to each governmental unit. The other governmental units shall be charged based on their own contribution rate or the contribution rate of the first employer, whichever is lower.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b327-9\">The town argues that, notwithstanding G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9A <em>Vz, </em>it should be permitted to exclude retirees who served the town for fewer than ten years from its insurance premium contributions, arguing, essentially, that G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9A <em>Vz, </em>does not do enough to contain costs. The town contends that it should be permitted to further reduce costs by limiting the class of retirees eligible for pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>mium contributions to those employed by the town for longer periods of service. The town notes, for example, that although it may seek reimbursement from other municipalities under G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9A <em>Vi, </em>it first must contribute to the premiums, and may seek reimbursement only the following year. It notes also that it must seek reimbursement based on the lower of the municipalities\u2019 rates of contribution. Concerns that the cost containment measures established by the statute are inadequate may be addressed to the Legislature.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
