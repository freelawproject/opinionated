He was conceived through in vitro fertilization (IVF),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> using a known <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>sperm donor<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> selected by J.S. and V.K., whose names appear on his birth certificate. The petitioners sought to adopt their son as a means of ensuring recognition of their parentage when they travel outside the Commonwealth, or in the event of their relocation to a State where same-sex marriage is not recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The petitioners filed a motion to proceed with the adoption without further notice, arguing that, as Nicholas\u2019s lawful parents, they could consent to the adoption, no other consent was necessary, and no notice to any other person was required under G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 4. While recognizing the petitioners as Nicholas\u2019s legal parents in Massachusetts, a Probate and Family Court judge issued an interlocutory order denying the motion, and reserving and reporting to the Appeals Court the question \u201cwhether the lawful parents of a child must give notice to the <em>known </em>biological father/sperm donor pursuant to G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 2,\u201d in conjunction with their petition for adoption. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion to consider the correctness of the judge\u2019s ruling. See <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. of Boston, Inc., </em>438 Mass. 187, 188 &amp; n.4 (2002), citing <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Dwight, </em>363 Mass. 256, 276 (1973).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We conclude that G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 2, does not require the lawful parents of a child to give notice of the petition for adoption to a known sperm donor and, accordingly, answer the reported question, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>Adoption of children in the Commonwealth is governed by G. L. c. 210 (adoption statute). \u201cThe law of adoption is purely statutory, <em>Davis </em>v. <em>McGraw, </em>206 Mass. 294, 297 (1910), and the governing statute, G. L. c. 210[ ], is to be strictly followed in all its essential particulars. <em>Purinton </em>v. <em>Jamrock, </em>195 Mass. 187, 197 (1907).\u201d <em>Adoption of Tammy, </em>416 Mass. 205, 210 (1993). We interpret a statute by looking \u201cfirst to its language as the \u2018principal source of insight into legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Adoption of Daisy, </em>460 Mass. 72, 76 (2011), quoting <em>Water Dep\u2019t of Fairhaven </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>455 Mass. 740, 744 (2010). \u201cWhere the meaning of the language is plain and unam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>biguous, we will not look to extrinsic evidence of legislative intent \u2018unless a literal construction would yield an absurd or unworkable result.\u2019 \u201d <em>Adoption of Daisy, supra, </em>quoting <em>Boston Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>National Conference of Firemen &amp; Oilers, Local 3, </em>458 Mass. 155, 162 (2010). If the meaning of the statutory language is not plain, we look to \u201cthe intent of the Legislature ascertained from all [the statute\u2019s] words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished.\u201d <em>Garney </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Teachers\u2019 Retirement Sys., </em>469 Mass. 384, 388 (2014), quoting <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">1. <em>Notice requirement. </em>The adoption statute requires the written consent of certain persons before a decree of adoption may issue. Under G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 2,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">\u201c[a] decree of adoption shall not be made ... without the written consent of the child to be adopted, if above the age of twelve; of the child\u2019s spouse, if any; of the lawful parents, who may be previous adoptive parents, or surviving parent; or of the mother only if the child was born out of wedlock and not previously adopted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">The notice requirements for any person whose consent is required under this provision are set forth in G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">By its plain language, G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 4, requires notice of a petition for adoption to be given only to those persons from whom written consent to the adoption must be obtained. See G. L. c. 210, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 4. No notice is required for persons not expressly included in G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 2. See <em>Petition for Revocation of a Judgment for Adoption of a Minor, </em>393 Mass. 556, 560 (1984). \u201cThe statutory notice provision sets forth who is to be notified,\u201d and a person who does not fit into one of the statutory categories \u201cis not entitled to notice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 2, does not include the category of \u201csperm donor\u201d among those from whom consent is required as a prerequisite to adoption, under the plain language of the statute, no notice to a sperm donor is required. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>See <em>Adoption of Daisy, supra </em>at 77, quoting <em>Commissioner of Correction </em>v. <em>Superior Court Dep\u2019t of the Trial Court for the County of Worcester, </em>446 Mass. 123, 126 (2006) (\u201cWe do not read into the statute a provision which the Legislature did not see fit to put there, nor add words that the Legislature had an option to, but chose not to include\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Thus, if the known sperm donor is entitled to notice of the petitioners\u2019 petition for adoption, the only potentially applicable category of persons to whom notice must be given under G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 2, is that of \u201clawful parent.\u201d We turn, therefore, to consideration of the category of \u201clawful parent,\u201d as that term is used in the statute, and whether it has any application to the known sperm donor here.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">2. <em>Lawful parent. </em>In his reservation and report, the judge stated as an \u201cundisputed fact[ ]\u201d that J.S. and V.K. are Nicholas\u2019s lawful parents. As an initial matter, we agree that, pursuant to G. L. c. 46, \u00a7 4B, J.S. and V.K. are Nicholas\u2019s lawful parents, and that, as residents of the Commonwealth, they are not required to adopt their son in order to establish their parentage.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201c[A]ny child bom as a result of artificial insemination with spousal consent is considered to be the child of the consenting spouse.\u201d <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>463 Mass. 488, 493 (2012), citing G. L. c. 46, \u00a7 4B. We also understand G. L. c. 46, \u00a7 4B, which refers specifically to \u201cartificial insemination,\u201d to include parentage of a child bom through the use of any assisted reproductive technology. See <em>Okoli </em>v. <em>Okoli, </em>81 Mass. App. Ct. 371, 377 (2012) (concluding that G. L. c. 46, \u00a7 4B, is applicable to IVF procedures). Therefore, lawful parentage, and its associated rights and responsibilities, is conferred by statute on the consenting spouse of a married couple whose child is conceived by one woman of the marriage, through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>the use of assisted reproductive technology consented to by both women. See G. L. c. 46, \u00a7 4B. Because Nicholas was born to J.S., his biological mother, after an IVF procedure to which V.K., her spouse, consented, J.S. and V.K. are his lawful parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">That conclusion, however, does not address whether, under G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 2, a known sperm donor also may be a \u201clawful parent\u201d for purposes of the notice requirement. In his reservation and report, the Probate and Family Court judge noted that \u201cthe statute does not differentiate between an anonymous sperm donor and a known sperm donor,\u201d but stated that he was \u201cnot convinced\u201d that \u201cabsent a determination by [an appellate] court, . . . the known biological father/sperm donor is precluded from filing a subsequent action to establish his paternity in accordance with G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 6.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">We have observed previously, in dicta, that, although the adoption statute \u201cdoes not comment on the [parental] rights and obligations, if any, of the [sperm donor], . . . inferentially he has none.\u201d <em>R.R. </em>v. <em>M.H., </em>426 Mass. 501, 502, 509-510 (1998) (concluding that surrogacy agreement between plaintiff father, who had donated sperm, and defendant mother, who had agreed to act as surrogate and then changed her mind during pregnancy, was unenforceable). As to a child of a marriage who is conceived via artificial insemination or IVF, as here, G. L. c. 46, \u00a7 4B, by its nature, contemplates that a third party must provide genetic material for the child\u2019s conception. Nonetheless, as is consistent with our paternity statutes and long-standing presumption of the legitimacy of marital children, see <em>D.H. </em>v. <em>R.R., </em>461 Mass. 756, 760 (2012), and cases cited, G. L. c. 46, \u00a7 4B, confers legal parentage only upon the mother\u2019s consenting spouse, not the sperm donor. It is thus presumed that marital children have only two lawful parents: the biological mother and her spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">In certain contexts, however, we have concluded that there are circumstances in which a \u201cputative father\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> may establish paternity, or claim at least some of the associated rights and obligations of parentage, where the child\u2019s mother was married to someone else at the time of the child\u2019s conception. See G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 6 (a) (for child born during marriage or within 300 days after termination of marriage, husband is presumed to be father of child and must be joined in any paternity action). Where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>the mother was married when the child was born, a putative father who is not the mother\u2019s spouse may establish paternity in one of two ways only: either through a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity executed by both parents, or through an adjudication of paternity by a court of competent jurisdiction. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>458 Mass. 540, 544 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">A voluntary acknowledgment of paternity requires that the mother and her spouse sign an affidavit denying that the spouse is the child\u2019s father; the putative father and the mother must then sign a notarized acknowledgment of parentage stating that they are the parents of the child. These documents must be filed with the court or the registrar of vital records. See G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 11 <em>(a); D.H. </em>v. <em>R.R., supra </em>at 761-762. A putative father also may file a complaint in equity in the Probate and Family Court, seeking to establish paternity. Where the mother was married to someone else at the time of the child\u2019s birth, a putative father may \u201cestablish paternity [through adjudication] only if he has a substantial relationship with the child ... and alleges he is the child\u2019s biological father\u201d (citation omitted).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>D.H. </em>v. <em>R.R., supra </em>at 763. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>See <em>C.C. </em>v. <em>A.B., </em>406 Mass. 679, 691 (1990) (requiring putative father to demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, \u201csubstantial parent-child relationship with the child\u201d in order for complaint for paternity of child of married mother to \u201cproceed beyond preliminary stages\u201d). Once a putative father successfully establishes his paternity and becomes the legal father of the child, the presumed father, the mother\u2019s spouse, logically, then, loses his legal parentage, either by consenting to a voluntary acknowledgment that he is not the child\u2019s father, or by a judgment of paternity. See <em>D.H. </em>v. <em>R.R., supra </em>at 761; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>McDonald, supra </em>at 544; <em>C.C. </em>v. <em>A.B., supra </em>at 690-691.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Even if, as the judge contemplated, a known sperm donor could bring an action in accordance with G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 6, to establish his paternity, nothing in G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 2, reflects any legislative intent that consent to adoption is required of one who may have a theoretical basis to attempt to establish parentage in the future. Indeed, the adoption statute does not require that notice of an adoption of a marital child be given to a putative father whose parental rights have not been determined. See <em>Adoption of a Minor, </em>338 Mass. 635, 643-644 (1959) (consent of putative father who was not lawful parent at time of adoption was not required). See also G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 4A (requiring notice to be given only to putative fathers of children born out of wedlock).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">In <em>Adoption of Tammy, </em>416 Mass. 205, 213 n.5 (1993), a case with facts similar to those here,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we noted that the sperm donor provided his written consent to a joint adoption, \u201c[ajlthough not required by the statute.\u201d Here, following the plain and unambiguous language of the adoption statute, see <em>Adoption of Daisy, </em>460 Mass. 72, 77 (2011), we make explicit the conclusion reached implicitly in <em>Adoption of Tammy, supra. </em>We will not extend the notice requirements of G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 4, beyond the enumerated categories of persons whose consent was required by the Legislature under G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 2. See <em>Adoption of Tammy, supra </em>at 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\"><em>Conclusion. </em>Because G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 2, does not require the lawful parents of a child to give notice of the petition for adoption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>to a known sperm donor, we answer the reported question, \u201cNo.\u201d The order denying the petitioners\u2019 motion to proceed with the adoption without further notice is reversed. The matter is remanded to the Probate and Family Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-16\">A pseudonym.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b387-17\">In vitro fertilization (IVF) is \u201c[a] procedure by which an egg is fertilized outside a woman\u2019s body and then inserted into the womb for gestation.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 956 (10th ed. 2014).

See <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>463 Mass. 488, 492-493 (2012) (recognizing as marital children in Commonwealth two children of same-sex couple, conceived through assistive reproductive technology and born into California domestic partner relationship); <em>Della Corte </em>v. <em>Ramirez, </em>81 Mass.

Am. Acad. Matrimonial Lawyers 43, 48 (2008). The reality today is that families take many different forms, and we recognize that a genetic connection \u201cbetween parent and child can no longer be the exclusive basis for imposing the rights or duties of parenthood.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60. As commentators suggest, see <em>id. </em>at 47-50, the better view is that a sperm donor may assert parentage only where he donates \u201csperm for, or consents to, assisted reproduction . . . with the intent to be the parent of [the] child.\u201d Uniform Parentage Act \u00a7 703 (2002). Indeed, the Uniform Parentage Act presumes that a sperm donor is not a parent of a child conceived by means of assisted reproduction. See Uniform Parentage Act \u00a7 702 (2002) (commenting that sperm donor cannot sue to establish parental rights). In the circumstances here, the sperm donor clearly donated the sperm with the intent that J.S. and V.K be the child\u2019s legal parents; a potential change of heart, years hence, would not alter that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Moreover, to bring a claim in equity to establish paternity requires establishing a \u201csubstantial parent-child relationship\u201d between the putative father and the child. See <em>C.C. </em>v. <em>A.B., </em>406 Mass. 679, 690 (1990). In the context of assisted reproductive technology, a putative father also may be a biological family member of one of the spouses; the petitioners indicate in their brief that choosing such a donor may allow a nonbiological parent to have a biological tie to the child. The existence of a relationship such as that of an uncle, cousin, or other family member, however, when coupled with being a sperm donor, does not itself give rise to a \u201csubstantial parent-child relationship.\u201d See <em>id. </em>at 689.
