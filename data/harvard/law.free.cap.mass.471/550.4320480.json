When one of her children, Jesus, attempted to intervene, he, too, was beaten with the hammer but was able to escape. Soon thereafter, the defendant, Levi Omar Alcantara, called the police from a nearby gasoline station claiming that he had also been a victim of the attacks in Maria\u2019s home. In contrast, both Jesus and his brother, Christopher, identified the defendant as the assailant. The handle of the hammer tested positive for the defendant\u2019s deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and red-brown stains on the defendant\u2019s clothing were consistent with the DNA of both Maria and Jesus.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">The defendant was indicted for murder in the first degree, assault with intent to kill, and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. A jury convicted him of all of the charges, including murder in the first degree by reason of extreme atrocity or cruelty. On appeal, the defendant assigns error to several evidentiary mlings made by the trial judge. We find no reversible error and no basis for exercising our authority under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to reduce the level of guilt or to order a new trial. Accordingly, we affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">1. <em>Background, </em>a. <em>The trial. </em>We recite the facts that the jury could have found, reserving certain details for the issues raised on appeal. On April 22, 2006, Jesus awoke to the sound of his mother screaming inside their home on Washington Street in Lawrence. On further investigation, he observed a man beating his mother with a hammer. Another of Maria\u2019s children, Christopher, then observed the assailant on top of Jesus, beating him with the hammer. Jesus was able to rid the assailant of the hammer, at which point the assailant struck him with a vase. Jesus wrested himself free and ran from the home. Christopher then observed the assailant leave the home, jump over a fence, and escape down an alley.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Jesus ran to a neighbor, who placed an emergency 911 telephone call in which she reported that \u201csome guy went inside [her] neighbor\u2019s house and he hit a little kid and he\u2019s bleeding out of his head . . . screaming to [her] to call the ambulance to help him.\u201d Lawrence police officers responded to the scene and interviewed Jesus, who described the assailant as wearing a blue or white T-shirt and blue or dark jeans. Jesus and Christopher, who were fourteen and twelve years of age, respectively, at the time of the assault, told the police that they recognized the assailant as the cousin of their mother\u2019s former boy friend, Ysidro Santos.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Maria was transported to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead as a result of skull fractures and brain lacerations caused by multiple \u201cchop wounds\u201d of the head that were consistent with blows from a hammer.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Nineteen minutes after the neighbor\u2019s 911 call, the defendant placed two 911 calls in which he stated that \u201csomething happened to [him]\u201d; that he had been at Washington Street; and that he was now at a gasoline station about one-quarter mile away. An officer responded to the gasoline station and found the defendant clad only in boxer shorts, socks, dress shoes, and a torn and stained blue T-shirt; with scratches on his face, forearms, and chest; and with a cut on his right hand. The defendant approached the officer and screamed, \u201c[T]hey tried to kill me. They threw me in the car and they tried to kill me, too.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The defendant was transported to the police station for further questioning. The defendant told the police that four Hispanic men entered Maria\u2019s home and beat him with a baseball bat and the victim with a hammer. Two of the men then forcibly removed the defendant from the home, placed him in their automobile, removed his clothing, and robbed him. The defendant stated that he subsequently was able to escape from the vehicle, at which point he ran to the gasoline station and placed the 911 calls. When the defendant was being escorted to the police station bathroom \u2014 and, in the process, by an interview room where Christopher was sitting with the door ajar \u2014 Christopher exclaimed: \u201cThat\u2019s the guy.\u201d Christopher and Jesus were subsequently presented with photographic arrays and asked if any of the photographs depicted the assailant. Both Christopher and Jesus selected the defendant\u2019s photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>A request was made for Santos to submit a DNA sample, but Santos never submitted the sample and the police never followed up with him. The police did, however, obtain DNA samples from the defendant, Maria, Jesus, and Christopher. The defendant\u2019s DNA was consistent with a profile obtained from a red-brown stain on the handle of the hammer. The handle also reflected DNA from an unknown person. There was other DNA evidence implicating the defendant as the hammer-wielding assailant. For example, a red-brown stain on the defendant\u2019s shoe was consistent with Maria\u2019s DNA, while a red-brown stain on the defendant\u2019s T-shirt was consistent with both Maria\u2019s and Jesus\u2019s DNA. The police did not find the remainder of the defendant\u2019s clothing, which the Commonwealth attempted to explain by the high water level of a nearby river.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The theory of the defendant\u2019s case was misidentification and the failure by the police to conduct an adequate investigation into other plausible suspects, including Santos and the four men mentioned in his statement at the police station. The defendant highlighted discrepancies between Jesus\u2019s and Christopher\u2019s descriptions of the assailant, as compared to the clothing the defendant was wearing at the gasoline station and in surveillance footage from a convenience store shortly before the attack. The defendant also attempted, with varying success, to introduce evidence that Santos was a third-party culprit and that the police should have conducted a more extensive investigation into his alleged role in orchestrating the attack on Maria, Jesus, and, indeed, the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">b. <em>Suppression and admission of the custodial statement. </em>Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion to suppress the statements he had made at the gasoline station and police station. The motion judge observed that the statement at the gasoline station was not made in response to police questioning and, therefore, was not subject to suppression. In contrast, the judge concluded that the Commonwealth failed to prove that the custodial statement at the police station was voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt. Consequently, the statement made at the police station was suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">At trial, however, the defendant moved to admit the suppressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>statement as evidence of a third-party culprit, consciousness of innocence, and the inadequacy of the police investigation. The Commonwealth objected and the judge initially denied the motion, ruling that, even if the defendant could waive his constitutional right to the suppression, the statement constituted inadmissible hearsay. The Commonwealth then withdrew its objection to the statement with respect to the adequacy of the police investigation, prompting the judge to admit the statement only for that limited purpose. The judge then instructed the jury that the statement was \u201cpermitted to be introduced by the defendant only as it bears on the police investigation of this case. So it should be clear that the Commonwealth had no choice, they were not permitted to introduce this during their case-in-chief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">During the charge conference, the Commonwealth requested a consciousness of guilt instruction referencing several statements that the defendant had made to the police. The defendant objected to the use of the custodial statement for this purpose, as it had only been admitted for the purpose of challenging the police investigation. The judge disagreed, stating to counsel that \u201conce the Commonwealth withdrew its objection to the custodial statements it obviously mooted or made moot that limiting instruction.\u201d The judge later instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">\u201cYou\u2019ve heard evidence suggesting that the defendant may have made false statements; that is, he may have intentionally made certain false statements around the time of his arrest. If the Commonwealth has proven the defendant did make those statements, you may consider whether such actions indicate feelings of guilt by the defendant and whether in turn such feelings of guilt might tend to show actual guilt on these charges.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">c. <em>Midtrial hearings. </em>During the trial, a hearing was held to determine the admissibility of a statement by a local convenience store clerk that there was \u201chearsay in the neighborhood\u201d that Santos had stated that Maria \u201cdeserved what she got.\u201d In addition, a voir dire hearing was conducted to determine whether the statements of Maria\u2019s daughter, Chabley, and the godfather of Maria\u2019s children could be introduced through the testimony of two State police officers as evidence of a third-party culprit or inadequate police investigation. Trooper Brian O\u2019Neil testified that the neighbor gave him a handwritten statement stating that Chabley had told the neighbor that \u201cher mother\u2019s boyfriend had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>threatened the mother. He told her to watch her back, that one of these days something bad was going to happen to her.\u201d Lieutenant James Dowling testified that the godfather told him that Chabley had said \u201cthat [Y]sidro Santos stated that he was going to have her mother killed because she did not want to be with him anymore.\u201d Although, at first, the godfather told Lieutenant Dowling that Chabley told him this directly, the godfather later stated that he had heard it from another person who had heard it from Chabley. The judge concluded that each of these statements was unreliable and, thus, inadmissible at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Consciousness of guilt instruction. </em>The defendant contends that the judge erred in allowing his custodial statement to be considered as evidence of consciousness of guilt, where the judge previously instructed the jury that the statement was only admissible insofar as it reflected on the adequacy of the police investigation. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>379 Mass. 472, 485-486 (1980). Because his challenge to the instruction was preserved at trial, we review the claim for prejudicial error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burgos, </em>462 Mass. 53, 67, cert. denied, 133 S. Ct. 796 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">\u201cA consciousness of guilt instruction is permissible where \u2018there is an inference of guilt that may be drawn from evidence of flight, concealment, or similar acts, such as false statements to the police, destruction or concealment of evidence, or bribing or threatening a witness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stuckich, </em>450 Mass. 449, 453 (2008). \u201cFalse statements to police may be considered as consciousness of guilt if there is other evidence tending to prove the falsity of the statements.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robles, </em>423 Mass. 62, 71 (1996). Such statements are not ensnared by the rule against hearsay because they are offered not for their truth, but for the proposition that the defendant\u2019s \u201cversion of events was intended to be a lie.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caillot, </em>454 Mass. 245, 256 (2009), cert. denied, 559 U.S. 948 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Here, the Commonwealth presented evidence, apart from the defendant\u2019s custodial statement, warranting a consciousness of guilt instruction. The defendant\u2019s statements at the gasoline station and during the 911 calls portrayed a version of events in stark contrast to the testimony of the victim\u2019s children. According to the defendant, the perpetrators kidnapped him and attempted to kill him. According to Jesus and Christopher, however, the defendant was the perpetrator. If the jury accepted the children\u2019s version of the events, then the defendant\u2019s statements reflected an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>attempt to lie to the police about his role in the killing and assault. See <em>id. </em>Consequently, it was not error for the judge to instruct the jury that they could consider the defendant\u2019s statements as evidence of consciousness of guilt if the Commonwealth proved that the statements were false. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>467 Mass. 291, 308-309 (2014) (erroneous admission of cumulative consciousness of guilt evidence not prejudicial error).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Nonetheless, as the Commonwealth concedes, the judge\u2019s ruling that the consciousness of guilt instruction could also encompass the defendant\u2019s custodial statement was inconsistent with her prior ruling and instruction limiting that statement\u2019s use to the adequacy of the police investigation. The prosecutor\u2019s discussion of consciousness of guilt during closing argument, however, was focused on the defendant\u2019s missing clothing, his 911 calls, and his statement at the gasoline station. In contrast, the prosecutor\u2019s use of the defendant\u2019s custodial statement in her closing focused the jury specifically on the reasonableness of the police response to the information the defendant had provided.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>425 Mass. 633, 643 (1997) (prosecutor\u2019s closing argument did not guide jury to prohibited inference).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Moreover, the judge did not share with the jury her ruling that the statement was available to be used for consciousness of guilt purposes, nor, in her final instructions, did she explicitly invite the jury to draw a connection between the custodial statement and consciousness of guilt. Although the better practice would have been for the judge to have reminded the jury that they could consider that statement only as evidence of the adequacy of the police investigation, \u201c[w]e presume that a jury follow all instructions given to it.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watkins, </em>425 Mass. 830, 840 (1997). As far as the jury knew, the prior limiting instruction remained in effect and the custodial statement was not part of the Commonwealth\u2019s case. Thus, to the extent the judge\u2019s ruling on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>consciousness of guilt constituted error,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the error \u201cdid not influ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>ence the jury, or had but very slight effect.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bresilla, </em>470 Mass. 422, 440 (2015), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Gambora, 457 Mass. 715, 729 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">b. <em>Admission of the neighbor\u2019s 911 call. </em>The neighbor\u2019s 911 call, in which she stated that \u201csome guy went inside [her] neighbor\u2019s house and he hit a little kid,\u201d was admitted in evidence over the defendant\u2019s objection. The defendant conceded that the majority of the statement was admissible as an excited utterance, see Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 803(2) (2014), but that the words \u201csome guy\u201d constituted inadmissible hearsay because they were not based on the neighbor\u2019s personal knowledge. The defendant renews this argument on appeal, contending that its admission improperly undermined his narrative of four men entering the house to commit the killing. We review for prejudicial error. <em>C0mmonwealth </em>v. Middlemiss, 465 Mass. 627, 631 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">\u201cThe broad rule on hearsay evidence interdicts the admission of a statement made out of court which is offered to prove the truth of what it asserted.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. DelValle, 351 Mass. 489, 491 (1966), <em>S.C., </em>353 Mass. 684 (1968). However, a statement is admissible as an excited utterance, \u201cif (1) there is an occurrence or event \u2018sufficiently startling to render inoperative the normal reflective thought processes of the observer,\u2019 and (2) if the declarant\u2019s statement was a \u2018spontaneous reaction to the occurrence or event and not the result of reflective thought.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>437 Mass. 620, 623 (2002), quoting 2 McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 272, at 204 (5th ed. 1999). \u201cGenerally, evidence based on a chain of statements is admissible only if each out-of-court assertion falls within an exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>400 Mass. 639, 643 n.8 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Here, the neighbor\u2019s statement made on the 911 call in the presence of the bleeding and screaming child was clearly admissible as an excited utterance. See <em>Middlemiss, </em>465 Mass. at 631 &amp; n.4 (victim\u2019s 911 call seeking assistance admissible as excited utterance); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harbin, </em>435 Mass. 654, 657 (2002) (bystander declaration admissible as excited utterance). However, the neighbor did not observe \u201csome guy\u201d strike Jesus. As such, that portion of the statement constituted totem pole hearsay requiring its own exception to the hearsay rule. See <em>McDonough, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number><em>supra. </em>See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>436 Mass. 252, 255 (2002) (\u201cdeclarant must have personal knowledge of the event in question\u201d). At the hearing on this issue, defense counsel contended that it was Jesus who relayed this information to the neighbor.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The judge replied aptly that the statement of a child \u201cwho is standing in front of [the neighbor] bleeding from his head\u201d is likewise encompassed by the excited utterance exception. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snell, </em>428 Mass. 766, <em>777, </em>cert. denied, 527 U.S. 1010 (1999) (victim\u2019s statements to neighbor immediately after defendant tried to kill her admissible as excited utterance). There was no error. See <em>King, supra </em>at 257 (judge has broad discretion to determine whether prerequisites for excited utterance have been met).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">c. <em>Exclusion of third-party culprit evidence. </em>The defendant contends that the judge erred in preventing him from introducing the testimony of Trooper O\u2019Neil, Lieutenant Dowling, and the convenience store clerk, as well as the defendant\u2019s own statement at the police station, as third-party culprit evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">\u201cA defendant has a constitutional right to present evidence that another may have committed the crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conkey, </em>443 Mass. 60, 66 (2004), <em>S.C., </em>452 Mass. 1022 (2008). Consequently, we afford \u201cwide latitude\u201d to such evidence, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva-Santiago, </em>453 Mass. 782, 800 (2009), insofar as it tends to show that another person \u201chad the motive, intent, or opportunity to commit it.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>404 Mass. 378, 387 (1989). However, \u201cbecause the evidence is offered for the truth of the matter asserted \u2014 that a third party is the true culprit \u2014 we have permitted hearsay evidence that does not fall within a hearsay exception only if, in the judge\u2019s discretion, \u2018the evidence is otherwise relevant, will not tend to prejudice or confuse the jury, and there are other \u201csubstantial connecting links\u201d to the crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>Silva-Santiago, supra </em>at 801, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>441 Mass. 291, 305 (2004). Moreover, \u201cthe evidence, even if it is not hearsay, \u2018must have a rational tendency to prove the issue the defense raises, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>evidence cannot be too remote or speculative.\u2019 \u201d <em>Silva-Santiago, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>422 Mass. 18, 22 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Here, defense counsel essentially conceded that the store clerk\u2019s testimony repeated an unsubstantiated rumor lacking in evidentiary value. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bizanowicz, </em>459 Mass. 400, 418-419 (2011) (defendant not entitled to base third-party culprit defense on rumor). With respect to Trooper O\u2019Neil\u2019s testimony, the judge observed that there was no evidence as to when Santos made the alleged statements to Chabley. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>426 Mass. 715, 716-717 (1998), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keizer, </em>377 Mass. 264, 267 (1979) (\u201cacts of the other person [must be] so closely connected in point of time and method of operation as to cast doubt upon the identification of [the] defendant as the person who committed the crime\u201d). With respect to Lieutenant Dowling\u2019s testimony, the judge concluded that Loriano\u2019s statement was unreliable because of the variations and multiple levels of hearsay. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>470 Mass. 201, 216 (2014) (layered hearsay with uncertain sources unreliable and inadmissible as third-party culprit evidence). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>432 Mass. 578, 589 (2000) (\u201ctestimony would have no tendency to prove that [a third party] was actually the murderer, and would be confusing as no more than an opinion of [the third party\u2019s] involvement\u201d). The defendant\u2019s constitutional rights were not violated by the exclusion of the various hearsay statements implicating Santos.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">It was likewise proper for the judge to exclude the defendant\u2019s custodial statement as third-party culprit evidence. The \u201csubstantial connecting links\u201d between Santos and the killing were clearly lacking in this case, where the only admissible evidence of motive or intent was that Santos and Maria had recently ended their relationship. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>469 Mass. 447, 466 (2014) (evidence of former boy friend\u2019s ill will or possible motive insufficient to support third-party culprit defense). Moreover, the only evidence supporting the defendant\u2019s version of the events involving the four unidentified assailants was his own self-serving statement. See <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>512 U.S. 594, 600 (1994) (\u201cSelf-exculpatory statements are exactly the ones which people are most likely to make even when they are false\u201d). Although it is possible that the police would have discovered additional evidence had they conducted a more thorough investigation, their failure to do so was admissible for <em>Bowden, </em>rather than third-party culprit, purposes. <em>Silva-Santiago, </em>453 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>at 802-803. The judge was within her discretion to so limit the defendant\u2019s use of that statement to the adequacy of the police investigation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>at 801 (\u201cadmission of feeble third-party culprit evidence poses a risk of unfair prejudice to the Commonwealth\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">d. <em>Exclusion of evidence undermining police investigation. </em>The defendant next argues that the judge abused her discretion in declining to allow the defendant to introduce evidence of an inadequate police investigation. The defendant assigns error to the exclusion of the following: (i) the exclusion of the defendant as a source of the DNA on sperm cells found in Maria\u2019s vagina; (ii) the presence of illegal drugs in Maria\u2019s body revealed during her autopsy; and (iii) the testimony of Trooper O\u2019Neil and Lieutenant Dowling that Chabley said that Santos made threatening statements about Maria. These claims are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">\u201cDefendants have the right to base their defense on the failure of police adequately to investigate a murder in order to raise the issue of reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s guilt in the minds of the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Phinney, </em>446 Mass. 155, 165-166 (2006), <em>S.C., </em>448 Mass. 621 (2007). \u201c[T]he inference that may be drawn from an inadequate police investigation is that the evidence at trial may be inadequate or unreliable because the police failed to conduct the scientific tests or to pursue leads that a reasonable police investigation would have conducted or investigated, and these tests or investigation reasonably may have led to significant evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Silva-Santiago, </em>453 Mass. at 801. This generally is referred to as the <em>Bowden </em>defense. See generally <em>Bowden, </em>379 Mass. at 486. Where, as here, the defendant asserts a <em>Bowden </em>defense, the trial judge must determine \u201cwhether the probative weight of the <em>Bow-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number><em>den </em>evidence exceed[s] the risk of unfair prejudice to the Commonwealth from diverting the jury\u2019s attention to collateral matters.\u201d <em>Silva-Santiago, supra </em>at 803. \u201c[T]he exclusion of evidence of a <em>Bowden </em>defense is not constitutional in nature and therefore is examined under an abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 804 n.26.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Here, the judge held hearings to determine the admissibility of the proposed <em>Bowden </em>evidence. The sperm and drug evidence was lacking in probative value. There was no indication that Maria, who was found fully clothed, was engaged in sexual intercourse around the time of the attack, nor was there any evidence whatsoever suggesting that the killing arose from a sexual relationship. The judge did not abuse her discretion in ruling that the proposed evidence was likely to confuse the jury. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nesbitt, </em>452 Mass. 236, 254 (2008) (\u201cfor inconclusive DNA evidence to be admissible, it must be probative of an issue of consequence in the case\u201d). Similarly, the judge did not abuse her discretion in ruling that the drug evidence was not probative of police thoroughness, where there was no indication that the drugs or supplier of the drugs played any role in causing Maria\u2019s death. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>429 Mass. 388, 401 (1999) (\u201cbare statement that [a third party] and the victim dealt drugs together lacks probative quality and would merely mislead the jury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Moreover, as previously stated, it was within the judge\u2019s discretion to exclude the unreliable evidence of Santos\u2019s threats. The defendant may not bootstrap that unreliable evidence into a claim that the police haphazardly failed to confirm Santos\u2019s alibi, where the police had two eyewitnesses \u2014 each of whom knew both the defendant and Santos \u2014 who identified the defendant as the only assailant. As in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>469 Mass. 266, 278 (2014), where the only reliable evidence implicating a third party in the killing was a deteriorated relationship with the victim, the judge properly excluded the evidence as more prejudicial than probative.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">In any event, the defendant \u201cwas permitted to challenge the adequacy of the investigation as a whole,\u201d <em>id., </em>including the failure of the police to follow up with Santos for testing in connection with the unidentified DNA on the hammer and in Maria\u2019s finger nail scrapings. See note 8, <em>supra. </em>The jury were also allowed to hear the defendant\u2019s custodial statement, in which he described the four men that he alleged committed the killing and assaults. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>During closing argument, defense counsel vigorously argued these points, as well as the inconsistencies between the eyewitness descriptions of the assailant and the clothing the defendant was observed wearing prior to and following the killing. \u201cThus, where the issue of an inadequate investigation was fairly before the jury, the defendant suffered no prejudice from the exclusion of the proffered evidence.\u201d <em>Wood, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">e. <em>Access to Christopher\u2019s treatment records. </em>During empanelment, the Commonwealth became aware that one of its witnesses, Christopher, had been committed to a psychiatric hospital in Florida on more than one occasion following the killing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Commonwealth informed the defendant, prompting him to seek discovery of the treatment records on grounds that the information contained therein might reflect an impaired ability to recall the events in question. The judge denied the motion, ruling that the mere fact of subsequent psychiatric assistance does not, by itself, constitute the necessary evidentiary showing to allow a defendant access to a witness\u2019s treatment records.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">On appeal, the defendant appears to argue that showing a potential for uncovering relevant information is sufficient to compel access to statutorily privileged treatment records. That is not the law. A party seeking to access statutorily privileged treatment records must:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">\u201cestablish good cause, satisfied by a showing \u2018(1) that the documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) that they are not otherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise of due diligence; (3) that the party cannot properly prepare for trial without such production and inspection in advance of trial and that the failure to obtain such inspection may tend unreasonably to delay the trial; and (4) that the application is made in good faith and is not intended as a general \u201cfishing expedition.\u201d \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sealy, </em>467 Mass. 617, 627 (2014), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lampron, </em>441 Mass. 265, 269 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Relevance is merely one factor in the analysis, and it is not established by rank speculation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Sealy, supra </em>at 628. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bourgeois, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 433, 437 (2007) (\u201cbroad claims concerning the victim\u2019s lack of credibility as a result of mental health problems are entirely speculative and lack the specificity and reasonableness required\u201d), with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Labroad, </em>466 Mass. 1037, 1039 (2014) (\u201cUnlike in <em>Bourgeois, [supra,] </em>the defendant in this case alleged, with particularity, that the [victim\u2019s] psychological records contained specific information regarding her complaint of sexual assault\u201d). Moreover, the defendant does not even offer an argument on appeal as to the remaining factors germane to the analysis. See <em>Lampron, supra. </em>In consequence, we cannot say that the judge erred in denying the defendant access to Christopher\u2019s treatment records.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">f. <em>Limitation on cross-examination of Christopher. </em>During the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of Christopher, the defendant sought to impeach the witness\u2019s credibility by inquiring into his use of prescription antipsychotic drugs around the time of the incident. Notwithstanding the fact that he was unsure whether Christopher was actually taking such drugs at the time of the incident, defense counsel argued that the subject was fodder for cross-examination because drug use could adversely affect Christopher\u2019s ability to perceive or recall the events in question. The judge found no evidence countermanding the clear recall exhibited by Christopher and, as a result, barred defense counsel from exploring the witness\u2019s drug use on cross-examination. The defendant assigns error to this ruling. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">A witness may \u201cbe impeached by evidence challenging his testimonial facilities (e.g., ability to perceive the events or remember them accurately).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daley, </em>439 Mass. 558, 564 (2003). \u201cWhile defendants are entitled to reasonable latitude on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>cross-examination, the scope of such cross-examination, including the extent of impeachment of a witness for credibility and competency, are well within the judge\u2019s sound discretion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carrion, </em>407 Mass. 263, 273 (1990). Evidence of a witness\u2019s use of legal or illegal drugs is admissible on cross-examination if it would demonstrate an impaired ability by the witness \u201cto perceive and to remember correctly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 273-274. However, the party seeking admission of such evidence must show a connection between the drug use and the witness\u2019s ability to perceive, remember, or testify to the event in question. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caine, </em>366 Mass. 366, 369 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">In the present case, the defendant did not introduce any evidence that Christopher was on psychiatric medication at the time of the incident other than an averment that the defendant believed it to be so. Even if Christopher had been prescribed psychiatric medication at or around the time of the incident, there was no evidence to show that it would have impaired his ability to perceive or recall the incident. Thus, the defendant failed to establish the requisite nexus between Christopher\u2019s alleged antipsychotic medication use and any possible impairment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arce, </em>426 Mass. 601, 604 (1998) (\u201cevidence of the use of drugs is not alone sufficient to show that drug usage adversely affected [a witness\u2019s] perception and memory\u201d). See also <em>Caine, supra </em>at 370 (mere fact that witness was committed to State hospital insufficient to compel testimony regarding alleged habitual intoxication and drug addiction). The trial judge did not abuse her discretion in limiting the defendant\u2019s cross-examination on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">g. <em>General Laws c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>We have reviewed the record in accordance with G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, and have found no basis to set aside or reduce the verdict of murder in the first degree or to order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b566-7\">The defendant was known to refer to persons as his \u201ccousin\u201d regardless of any actual legal relation.

The police interview the defendant. And he makes a number of statements to them. And you can consider, I think when you consider the police investigation in this case, whether they made any sense. They had spoken to Jesus Mandes, and they had spoken to Christopher Mandes. They had that information.... His story simply didn\u2019t make sense, and the police, I would suggest, understood that.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b570-8\">In his closing argument, defense counsel contended that the defendant\u2019s willingness to speak to the police at the police station, \u201cafter they tell him, look, you have a right [not to say anything],\u201d and \u201ca right to a lawyer,\u201d was consistent with his innocence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b571-5\">At trial, the defendant argued that he was entitled to use the suppressed statement as a shield, but that the Commonwealth remained constitutionally precluded from using the statement as a sword against him. Although the judge appeared to accept this argument initially, we are not aware of any direct support for it in the case law. As one commentator has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">\u201cBy introducing evidence obtained illegally, the defendants should also waive their rights to exclude other evidence obtained in the same unlawful search, seizure, or interrogation as that which yielded the evidence they introduce. It does not advance the goal of protecting affected defendants from the consequences of those constitutional violations if they are not so much objecting to the violation of their rights as trying to take strategic advantage of it with evidence they would not otherwise have. While they undoubtedly would prefer to take advantage of suppression to use any exculpatory proof gathered illegally while excluding the inculpatory proof, there is no justification for allowing them to do so. ... A defendant insisting in good faith on protection from the consequences of authorities\u2019 illegality is hard pressed to claim that he is entitled to exploit those consequences selectively. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Kainen, Shields, Swords, and Fulfilling the Exclusionary Rule\u2019s Deterrent Function, 50 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 59, 92 (2013). These principles have found general application both in the Commonwealth and in other jurisdictions. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Redmond, </em>357 Mass. 333, 341 (1970) (in insisting his attorney question witness concerning certain events, defendant \u201clost the benefit of the earlier order suppressing evidence\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pierson, </em>101 F.3d 545, 546 (8th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1202 (1997) (defendant opened door to government\u2019s use of inculpatory statement previously suppressed on Miranda grounds); <em>Pettijohn </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>599 F.2d 476, 481 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 946 (1979) (\u201cOnce a defendant attempts to introduce testimony that is intimately interrelated with previously suppressed testimony, the defendant waives his objections to the introduction of that related evidence\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>144 N.J. 538, 562-563 (1996) (defendant may not selectively introduce suppressed evidence without allowing government opportunity to place evidence in proper context).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Yet, there is a tension in applying these principles to a defendant\u2019s use of statements already deemed involuntary. On one hand, involuntary statements are considered unreliable and incompetent evidence, repugnant to due process and inadmissible for any purpose at trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durand, </em>457 Mass. 574, 591-592 &amp; n.22 (2010). On the other hand, prior to the voluntariness determination, a defendant may waive the issue by using the purportedly involuntary statements, thereby opening the door to their use by the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>379 Mass. 600, 604-605 (1980). Assuming without deciding that the defendant was properly allowed to waive voluntariness altogether and introduce the statement after prevailing on his motion to suppress, it was not constitutional error to allow the Commonwealth to respond by arguing that the statement was false. See <em>id. </em>at 606 (\u201cWhen a defendant, acting through competent counsel, puts particular evidence in issue, he may not effectively argue on appeal that his own trial strategy denied him his constitutional rights\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pettijohn, </em>373 Mass. 26, 31 (1977) (\u201cWe assume without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>deciding that the defendant is correct in his premise that, having prevailed on the motion to suppress ... the defendant was privileged to make a timely waiver of his rights as to the entire suppression issue\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Although the defendant now argues that the identity of the third-party declarant is unknown, the evidence supports the position taken at trial. During the 911 call, the neighbor asked, \u201cWhat guy?\u201d to a person in her presence. In light of the fact that the neighbor also described Jesus as presently bleeding from his head and screaming to her for help, it is at least a reasonable inference that her question was in response to his statement that a \u201cguy\u201d had struck him. Indeed, the defendant used this to his advantage during closing argument by pointing out that Jesus was unable to answer the neighbor\u2019s question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Moreover, the defendant was not precluded from presenting a third-party culprit defense to the jury. The jury heard evidence, which defense counsel reinforced in closing argument, that there was deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of an unknown person on the hammer; that there was hair from an unknown person found in Maria\u2019s fingernail scrapings; that Santos and Maria had recently ended their relationship; that Maria\u2019s blood was not found on the defendant\u2019s hands; that the defendant purported to be a victim of the attacks in his 911 calls and gasoline station statement; and that Jesus\u2019s and Christopher\u2019s descriptions of the assailant\u2019s clothing were inconsistent with the clothing the defendant was depicted wearing in surveillance footage recorded shortly before the killing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bizanowicz, </em>459 Mass. 400, 419 (2011) (\u201cNor did the judge\u2019s exclusion of these statements deprive the defendant of the ability to present a defense suggesting that [the third party] was the killer\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b577-8\">Christopher was committed to psychiatric care pursuant to a Florida law allowing for the hospitalization of an individual at the request of a mental health professional, judge, or law enforcement official, if believed that the person suffers from a mental illness and poses a significant risk of harm to either himself or herself or other people.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b577-9\">In denying the defendant\u2019s motion, the trial judge noted that the evidence could become admissible if the Commonwealth opened the door by suggesting that Christopher\u2019s condition was triggered by the traumatic experience of finding his mother beaten to death and his brother badly injured. During the hearing, the Commonwealth indicated that it had no intention of doing so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b578-8\">For example, one might speculate that a child who finds his mother beaten to death with a hammer would be prompted to seek psychiatric assistance as a result. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bourgeois, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 433, 438 (2007) (\u201creferences to various psychiatric and other problems the victim appeared to be experiencing all occurred at or about the time she revealed the abuse and reasonably could be viewed as a consequence of the defendant\u2019s abuse\u201d). Yet, it is unclear, absent some further showing, how this would be relevant to the witness\u2019s capacity to perceive or recall the underlying event.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
