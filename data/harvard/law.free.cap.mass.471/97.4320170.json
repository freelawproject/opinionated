L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E (b) (2); unlawful possession of ammunition without a firearm identification card, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(h)\\ </em>and being an armed career criminal, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10G <em>(b). </em>Sonja Farak, then a chemist at the Department of Public Health\u2019s State Laboratory Institute in Amherst (Amherst drug lab), tested the substances in the defendant\u2019s case on June 8, 2007, and signed the certificates of drug analysis (drug certificates).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to a plea agreement, the defendant pleaded guilty on April 13, 2009, to trafficking in cocaine (fourteen to twenty-eight grams), and unlawful possession of ammunition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">On April 1, 2013, a State grand jury indicted Farak on four counts of tampering with evidence, G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13E; four counts of theft of a controlled substance (cocaine) from a dispensary, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 37; and two counts of unlawful possession of a class B substance (cocaine), G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34. Approximately three weeks later, the defendant filed a motion to withdraw his guilty pleas pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001). He claimed that Farak was a govem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>ment agent by virtue of her role at the Amherst drug lab, that her misconduct was widespread and egregious, and that such misconduct antedated his guilty pleas. As a consequence, the defendant asserted that because his guilty pleas were based, in part, on an assumption that the drug certificates were truthful and accurate, his decision to plead guilty was not knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. The defendant further claimed that Farak\u2019s misconduct constituted newly discovered evidence that would have had a significant impact on his decision to plead guilty and cast serious doubt on the justice of his convictions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On October 30, 2013, a Superior Court judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion. Farak pleaded guilty to all ten charges on January 6, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The defendant appealed, and we granted his application for direct appellate review. The defendant now contends that the judge abused his discretion by (1) failing to afford the defendant the benefit of the conclusive presumption articulated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass. 336, 352-353 (2014), that egregious misconduct by Farak occurred in the defendant\u2019s case; (2) ignoring direct and circumstantial evidence of misconduct by Farak that antedated the entry of the defendant\u2019s guilty pleas; and (3) finding that the defendant would have pleaded guilty notwithstanding Farak\u2019s misconduct. The defendant also claims that the judge erred by quashing a subpoena that had been issued to Farak\u2019s spouse, Nikki Lee, where she was a necessary witness for the defense. For the reasons set forth below, we vacate the order denying the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty pleas, and we conclude that, given the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to thoroughly investigate the matter of Farak\u2019s misconduct at the Amherst drug lab, the defendant is entitled to a measure of relief, as will be described in detail.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We remand the case for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>1. <em>Background on the Amherst drug lab.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Amherst drug lab began operation in 1987 with the primary function of analyzing suspected controlled substances for law enforcement agencies involved in the prosecution of criminal cases in western Massachusetts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As of January, 2013, there were four employees at the facility, and each one could access the evidence safe by means of an electronic card or a key. On January 17, 2013, the evidence officer at the Amherst drug lab, Sharon Salem, was attempting to match drug certificates with the corresponding samples when she realized that she was missing the samples in two cases. Records reflected that Farak had completed testing on those samples earlier in the month and had confirmed that the substances were cocaine. On January 18, Salem reported the missing evidence to her supervisor, James Hanchett, who searched Farak\u2019s work station and discovered, among other items, a manila envelope containing the packaging for the two missing samples, which had been cut open. Testing of the substances in the packaging was negative for cocaine, contrary to Farak\u2019s earlier analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Hanchett immediately contacted the State police, who shut down the Amherst drug lab and began an investigation. They discovered two additional case envelopes in a temporary storage locker used by Farak, a location where evidence was not allowed to be stored overnight. Although each envelope was supposed to contain suspected cocaine, neither did, and a search for those substances was unsuccessful. Investigators also interviewed Farak\u2019s colleagues who said that, beginning in September, 2012, they observed a change in Farak\u2019s behavior, including frequent unexplained absences from her work station and a decrease in productivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">On January 19, 2013, the State police forensic services conducted an inventory of all drug evidence at the Amherst drug lab. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Only the four above-described samples were missing. A similar inventory conducted approximately four months earlier had not uncovered any missing samples. Also on January 19, the State police searched Farak\u2019s vehicle pursuant to a warrant and seized, among other items, manila envelopes bearing case numbers, paperwork relating to the Amherst drug lab, a plastic bag containing a white powdery substance and a brown tar-like substance, a plastic bag containing assorted pills, and photocopies of three newspaper articles about individuals who had been investigated, charged, or sentenced for the illegal possession or theft of controlled substances.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Attached to one of the articles was a handwritten note stating, \u201cThank [G]od I\u2019m not a law enforcement <em>officer\u201d </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Farak was arrested at her home that same day. She was charged by criminal complaint in the District Court with unlawful possession of a class A substance (heroin), unlawful possession of a class B substance (cocaine), and two counts of tampering with evidence. On January 25, 2013, the State police searched a tote bag that had been seized from Farak\u2019s work station pursuant to a warrant. The bag contained a variety of substances that could be used to dilute or replace cocaine (soap, baking soda, soy candle flakes, and oven-baked clay), other items commonly used in the drug trade (plastic laboratory dishes, waxed paper, and fragments of copper wire), and several evidence bags that had been cut open. The evidence bags bore diverse dates from December 16, 2012, to January 6, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">On April 1, 2013, a State grand jury indicted Farak on four counts of tampering with evidence at the Amherst drug lab, four counts of stealing cocaine from that facility, and two counts of unlawful possession of cocaine. While proceedings were ongoing in the Superior Court with respect to these charges, four additional cases surfaced in which it seemed, based on retesting, that Farak may have removed cocaine from samples that were sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>mitted to the Amherst drug lab for analysis between June 15 and October 10, 2012, and replaced at least some of the cocaine with a counterfeit substance. It is not clear from the record why this particular evidence was selected for retesting. Nonetheless, it does appear that no charges were brought against Farak with respect to these four additional cases. On January 6, 2014, Farak pleaded guilty to all ten charges.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">2. <em>Factual and procedural history. </em>In the spring of 2007, Springfield police Officer Thomas Nehmer discovered, through the use of a confidential informant, that the defendant was selling cocaine. On May 4, 2007, based on information received from the informant regarding the defendant\u2019s involvement in an upcoming drug deal, the police established surveillance at the time and place of the transaction. When the defendant arrived as predicted, he was secured by police and found to be in possession of two cellular telephones, ninety-one dollars, and what appeared to be approximately eight grams of cocaine. He was placed under arrest and transported to the police station. Following a waiver of his Miranda rights, the defendant told officers that in his bedroom at his residence were packaging materials, scales, and approximately thirty grams of cocaine. Officer Nehmer applied for and was granted a search warrant. When officers searched the defendant\u2019s residence, they discovered fifty-eight rounds of .22 caliber ammunition, scales, cutting agents, and two bags containing substances that appeared to be cocaine and weighed approximately forty-four grams. The substances were tested by Farak at the Amherst drug lab on June 8, 2007. According to the drug certificates that she signed, each substance tested positive for cocaine.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">On April 13, 2009, after engaging in a thorough colloquy with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>the judge and before Farak\u2019s misconduct had become known, the defendant pleaded guilty to trafficking in cocaine (fourteen to twenty-eight grams), and unlawful possession of ammunition. The bases for his subsequent motion to withdraw his guilty pleas were twofold. First, the alleged criminal conduct by Farak at the Amherst drug lab rendered his guilty pleas unknowing, unintelligent, and involuntary. Second, such misconduct constituted newly discovered evidence that cast real doubt on the justice of his convictions. The judge considered each contention in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">In deciding whether the defendant\u2019s pleas were knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, the judge relied on the analysis articulated in <em>Ferrara </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 456 F.3d 278, 290 (1st Cir. 2006).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He stated that a defendant seeking to set aside a guilty plea as involuntary must show that (1) the government or its agents committed some egregiously impermissible conduct that antedated the entry of the plea, and (2) the misconduct was material to the defendant\u2019s choice to plead guilty. See <em>id. </em>With regard to the first part of the inquiry, the judge concluded that, given Farak\u2019s role at the Amherst drug lab, she must be deemed to be an agent of the Commonwealth. Next, the judge considered whether Farak\u2019s alleged misconduct antedated the defendant\u2019s guilty pleas on April 13, 2009. The judge said that, although there was \u201cpowerful evidence\u201d that Farak had engaged in egregiously impermissible conduct by stealing cocaine and replacing it with other substances, he was not persuaded that she was doing so at the time of the defendant\u2019s guilty pleas. Therefore, the defendant failed to establish that Farak\u2019s misconduct antedated his guilty pleas. Further, in the judge\u2019s view, the negative findings made during an October, 2012, quality assurance audit of the Amherst drug lab were disconcerting, but there was no evidence that these general deficiencies had any bearing on the testing performed in the defendant\u2019s case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As such, the findings of the audit did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>amount to the kind of egregiously impermissible government conduct contemplated by the <em>Ferrara </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The judge then considered the second part of the <em>Ferrara </em>inquiry, namely whether Farak\u2019s misconduct would have been material to the defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty. The judge stated that there was no evidence that the test results in this case were inaccurate, or that Farak was involved in any misconduct at the time of the defendant\u2019s guilty pleas. Moreover, he continued, there were good reasons for the defendant to accept the plea agreement. Given the strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s case (including the defendant\u2019s own incriminating statements), the significant benefit the defendant received from the plea agreement, and the absence of any evidence that Farak\u2019s misconduct affected the drug testing in the defendant\u2019s case, the judge concluded that Farak\u2019s misconduct would not have been material to the defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty, even if such misconduct had antedated the defendant\u2019s pleas. The judge also found that the negative audit of the Amherst drug lab failed to satisfy the threshold of materiality required to invalidate the defendant\u2019s guilty pleas. Accordingly, based on the totality of the circumstances, the judge concluded that the defendant had failed to establish that his guilty pleas were not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Finally, the judge considered whether Farak\u2019s misconduct at the Amherst drug lab constituted newly discovered exculpatory evidence that cast real doubt on the justice of the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>convictions. The judge first determined that there was no evidence that the defendant or his attorney was aware of Farak\u2019s misconduct or the negative audit, or that either reasonably could have been discovered at the time of the defendant\u2019s pleas. Therefore, the judge continued, the evidence of Farak\u2019s misconduct, in particular, and the administrative problems at the Amherst drug lab, in general, qualified as \u201cnewly discovered.\u201d However, for all of the reasons he already had articulated, the judge stated that this newly discovered evidence was \u201cnot sufficiently weighty, potent, or pertinent to the fundamental issues of this case to be worthy of consideration at a new trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">3. <em>Standard of review. A </em>motion to withdraw a guilty plea is treated as a motion for a new trial pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. R 30 (b). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Furr, </em>454 Mass. 101, 106 (2009). \u201cUnder Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b), a judge may grant a motion for a new trial any time it appears that justice may not have been done. A motion for a new trial is thus committed to the sound discretion of the judge.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass. at 344. We review the allowance or denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea to determine whether the judge abused that discretion or committed a significant error of law. <em>Id. </em>We accept the judge\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by the evidence, because the judge who heard the witnesses testify is the \u201cfinal arbiter [on] matters of credibility.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schand, </em>420 Mass. 783, 787 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">4. <em>Discussion. </em>Due process requires that a plea of guilty be accepted only where \u201cthe contemporaneous record contains an affirmative showing that the defendant\u2019s plea was intelligently and voluntarily made.\u201d <em>Furr, </em>454 Mass. at 106, citing <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238 (1969), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>368 Mass. 100, 102 (1975). \u201cA guilty plea is intelligent if it is tendered with knowledge of the elements of the charges against the defendant and the procedural protections waived by entry of a guilty plea.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass. at 345. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duest, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 623, 630-631 (1991). \u201cA guilty plea is voluntary so long as it is tendered free from coercion, duress, or improper inducements.\u201d <em>Scott, supra. </em>Typically, a motion to withdraw a guilty plea will allege a facial defect in the plea procedures, but a guilty plea \u201calso may be vacated as involuntary because of external circumstances or information that later comes to light.\u201d <em>Id., </em>and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">We begin by reviewing the framework for analyzing the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty pleas. In <em>Ferrara, </em>456 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>F.3d at 280, 284, 290-293, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit analyzed whether blatant misconduct by the government, discovered more than ten years after entry of the defendant\u2019s guilty plea, could render such plea involuntary. The prosecutor in <em>Ferrara </em>deliberately manipulated a key witness, failed to disclose exculpatory evidence, and affirmatively misrepresented the nature of the witness\u2019s planned testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 291-293. The court concluded that when a defendant seeks to vacate a guilty plea as a result of underlying government misconduct, rather than a defect in the plea procedures, the defendant must show both that \u201cegregiously impermissible conduct... by government agents . . . antedated the entry of his plea,\u201d and that \u201cthe misconduct influenced his decision to plead guilty or, put another way, that it was material to that choice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 290. Relying on Ferrara, this court articulated in <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass. at 346-358, a two-prong framework for analyzing a defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea under Mass. R. Crim. R 30 (b) in a case involving the misconduct of Annie Dookhan, a chemist at the William A. Hinton State Laboratory Institute\u2019s forensic drug laboratory (Hinton drug lab) from 2003 to 2012. Under the first prong of the analysis, a defendant must show egregious misconduct by the government that preceded the entry of the defendant\u2019s guilty plea and that occurred in the defendant\u2019s case. <em>Id. </em>at 347-354. Under the second prong of the analysis, a defendant must demonstrate a reasonable probability that he or she would not have pleaded guilty had he or she known of the government misconduct. <em>Id. </em>at 354-358.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">We recognized in <em>Scott </em>that, given the breadth and duration of Dookhan\u2019s malfeasance, it might be impossible for a defendant to show the required nexus between the government misconduct and the defendant\u2019s own case. <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass. at 351-352. Dookhan\u2019s \u201cinsidious\u201d misconduct, \u201cwhich belie[d] reconstruction, [was] a lapse of systemic magnitude in the criminal justice system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352. Consequently, we established a special evidentiary rule whereby a defendant seeking to vacate a guilty plea under rule 30 (b) as a result of the revelation of Dookhan\u2019s misconduct, and proffering a drug certificate from the defendant\u2019s case signed by Dookhan on the line labeled \u201cAssistant Analyst,\u201d would be entitled to \u201ca conclusive presumption that egregious government misconduct occurred in the defendant\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Application of this conclusive presumption in a particular case meant that a defendant\u2019s evidentiary burden to establish each ele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>ment of the first prong of the <em>Ferrara-Scott </em>framework was satisfied. <em>Id. </em>at 353-354. We emphasized in <em>Scott </em>that this special evidentiary rule is unique in that it is \u201ca remedy dictated by the particular circumstances surrounding Dookhan\u2019s misconduct as a chemist at the Hinton drug lab and is intended to apply only to this narrow class of cases in which a defendant seeks to withdraw his or her guilty plea after having learned of Dookhan\u2019s misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, we stated that \u201c[sjhould the <em>Ferrara </em>analysis be applied in the case of a motion for a new trial under Mass. R. Crim. R 30 (b) that <em>does not arise from the investigation of Dookhan, </em>the defendant will have the burden to establish each element of the first prong of <em>Ferrara, </em>and the adequacy of the defendant\u2019s showing will be committed to the sound discretion of the motion judge\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">a. <em>Prong one of the </em>Ferrara-Scott <em>analysis: egregious misconduct by the government in the defendant\u2019s case. </em>In the present appeal, the defendant contends that Farak\u2019s misconduct at the Amherst drug lab was egregious, and that Farak was a government agent such that her misconduct is attributable to the Commonwealth. Moreover, in the defendant\u2019s view, Farak\u2019s misconduct was systemic in magnitude. As a consequence, the defendant argues, he was entitled to the conclusive presumption articulated in <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass. at 352-353, and, therefore, he was not required to prove that such misconduct occurred in his own case. The defendant asserts that even if this court does not apply the conclusive presumption, it still should determine that, because there was direct and circumstantial evidence suggesting that Farak\u2019s misconduct antedated the entry of his guilty pleas, misconduct must have occurred in his case. Given all of these circumstances, the defendant contends that the discovery of Farak\u2019s egregious misconduct after he had tendered his guilty pleas rendered those pleas unknowing, unintelligent, and involuntary. As such, the defendant continues, the judge abused his discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty pleas.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We agree with the defendant that Farak\u2019s misconduct was egregious and that it is attributable to the Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>wealth. However, based on the evidence of her misconduct that has been uncovered thus far, we disagree with the defendant that he is entitled to the conclusive presumption articulated in <em>Scott </em>or, alternatively, that he has shown that Farak\u2019s malfeasance antedated the entry of his guilty pleas. Nonetheless, given the absence of a thorough investigation into the matter by the Commonwealth, and the cloud that overshadows the integrity of drug analyses performed by Farak at the Amherst drug lab, we conclude that the defendant is entitled to a measure of relief, as will be described. We turn to the <em>Ferrara-Scott </em>framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">i. <em>Egregious misconduct. </em>On January 6, 2014, Farak pleaded guilty to, among other offenses, four counts of tampering with evidence at the Amherst drug lab and four counts of stealing cocaine from that facility. There is no dispute between the parties that this constituted \u201cegregious misconduct\u201d by Farak. She was entrusted with analyzing purported drug samples, signing drug certificates that identified and set forth the precise weight of each sample, and testifying to the results of her analyses. By tampering with evidence, Farak cast serious doubt on the integrity of this entire process. Her misconduct could render a defendant\u2019s guilty plea involuntary by wholly undermining the evidentiary foundation of the Commonwealth\u2019s case. We conclude that Farak\u2019s misconduct constitutes the type of egregious misconduct that satisfies the first element of the first prong of the <em>Ferrara-Scott </em>analysis. See <em>Scott, 461 </em>Mass. at 347-348. See also <em>Ferrara, </em>456 F.3d at 290-293.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">ii. <em>By the government. </em>The defendant contends that because Farak was a government agent, her misconduct is attributable to the Commonwealth. In contrast, the Commonwealth argues that Farak\u2019s misconduct, while egregious, was an individual unlawful scheme and, as such, should not be attributable to the Commonwealth. We agree with the defendant\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">In <em>Scott, 461 </em>Mass. at 348-350, we considered various circumstances where actions by a range of government agents might constitute misconduct \u201cby the government\u201d that could render a defendant\u2019s guilty plea involuntary. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>711 F.3d 460, 467 (4th Cir. 2013) (law enforcement officer\u2019s conduct in lying in search warrant affidavit in defendant\u2019s case, regardless of prosecutor\u2019s lack of actual knowledge of of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>fleer\u2019s wrongdoing, constituted impermissible government conduct). In the related context of a prosecutor\u2019s duty to disclose exculpatory evidence to the defense, we pointed out that, generally speaking, \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s duty does not extend beyond information held by \u2018agents of the prosecution team,\u2019 \u201d <em>Scott, supra </em>at 349, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>451 Mass. 451, 454 (2008), but that \u201cindividuals other than prosecutors and police may be considered agents of the prosecution team.\u201d <em>Scott, supra. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, 427 </em>Mass. 816, 824 (1998) (prosecutor\u2019s duty to disclose exculpatory evidence extends to information in possession of chemist at State police crime laboratory who \u201chas participated in the investigation or evaluation of the case and has reported to the prosecutor\u2019s office concerning the case\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>427 Mass. 659, 679 (1998) (medical examiner considered to be agent of Commonwealth). We concluded in <em>Scott </em>that Dookhan, in her role as a chemist at the Hinton drug lab, was an agent of the Commonwealth whose misconduct was attributable to the government for the limited purposes of the <em>Ferrara </em>analysis. <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass. at 349-350. Significantly, it appeared from the record that Dookhan had engaged in egregious misconduct \u201cto further what she perceived to be the mission of the Commonwealth\u201d \u2014 getting criminals off the streets \u2014 and not to further her own \u201cindividual unlawful scheme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 350, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Waters, </em>410 Mass. 224, 230 (1991). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campiti, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 43, 65-66 (1996) (defendant not entitled to new trial where State police officer involved in investigation of defendant embezzled money from district attorney\u2019s office to support gambling habit, but where such activity did not taint voluminous evidence against defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Farak, like Dookhan, was an agent of the prosecution team, given that, where she was the analyst for a purported drug sample recovered from a defendant, she \u201cparticipated in the investigation or evaluation of the case\u201d and \u201creported to the prosecutor\u2019s office concerning the case.\u201d <em>Scott, supra </em>at 349, quoting <em>Martin, </em>427 Mass. at 824. In addition, Farak was \u201cexpected to testify as [an] expert witness [ ] regarding the testing of samples in various criminal prosecutions.\u201d <em>Scott, supra </em>at 350. Admittedly, it appears from the record that Farak was tampering with evidence at the Amherst drug lab in order to support her own cocaine habit. Nonetheless, the effect of her misconduct was to raise serious questions about the integrity of her work on behalf of the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>monwealth. With respect to at least eight known cases, it seems apparent that Farak\u2019s actions tainted the drug analysis process, which, in turn, raises concerns about the reliability of her analyses in other cases where she was the assistant analyst. Such malfeasance goes right to the heart of the Commonwealth\u2019s ability to convict a defendant in a drug case and, therefore, is directly related to \u201cthe Commonwealth\u2019s interest in law enforcement.\u201d <em>Waters, </em>410 Mass. at 230. Farak\u2019s misconduct was not merely an \u201cindividual unlawful scheme,\u201d <em>id., </em>and, as such, is attributable to the Commonwealth. The defendant has satisfied the second element of the first prong of the <em>Ferrara-Scott </em>analysis. See <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass. at 348-350. See also <em>Ferrara, </em>456 F.3d at 290-293.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">iii. <em>In the defendant\u2019s case. </em>Finally, the third element of the first prong of the <em>Ferrara-Scott </em>analysis requires the defendant to show that egregious misconduct by Farak antedated the entry of his guilty pleas and occurred in his own case. See <em>Scott, supra </em>at 350-354. See also <em>Ferrara, supra </em>at 290. The defendant asserts that he was entitled to the conclusive presumption articulated in <em>Scott, supra </em>at 352-353, and, therefore, he was not required to prove that Farak\u2019s misconduct occurred in his case. Further, the defendant continues, even if this court does not apply the conclusive presumption, it still should determine that, because there was both direct and circumstantial evidence suggesting that Farak\u2019s misconduct antedated the entry of his guilty pleas, misconduct must have occurred in his case. We conclude that the evidence on which the defendant relies is not sufficient, at this juncture, to establish either that Farak\u2019s misconduct constituted a systemic problem warranting application of the conclusive presumption, or that her misconduct antedated the entry of the defendant\u2019s guilty pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">In <em>Scott, </em>we determined that \u201cfurnishing a drug certificate signed by Dookhan as a primary or secondary chemist in the defendant\u2019s case [was] sufficient to establish the requisite nexus between the defendant\u2019s case and Dookhan\u2019s misconduct.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass. at 354. Our bases for establishing a conclusive presumption that \u201cegregious government misconduct occurred in the defendant\u2019s case\u201d were our reasonable certainty that Dookhan\u2019s misconduct \u201ctouched a great number of cases,\u201d and that it was a \u201clapse of systemic magnitude in the criminal justice system\u201d that \u201cbelie[d] reconstruction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352. In the present case, no such reasonable certainty exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Unlike the circumstances in <em>Scott </em>where the State police detective unit of the Attorney General\u2019s office conducted a broad formal investigation into Dookhan and her practices at the Hinton drug lab, see <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass. at 339, the Commonwealth\u2019s investigation into the timing and scope of Farak\u2019s misconduct has been cursory at best. Nonetheless, based on the record before us, only eight cases thus far have surfaced in which it appears that Farak tampered with evidence at the Amherst drug lab, beginning perhaps in the summer of 2012<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and continuing until January, 2013.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It goes without saying that eight cases are eight cases too many. However, the scope of Farak\u2019s misconduct does not appear to be, at this point in time, comparable to the enormity of Dookhan\u2019s misconduct at the Hinton drug lab. Among other wrongdoing, Dookhan admitted to \u201cdry labbing,\u201d contaminating drug samples (including converting negative samples into positive samples), removing drug samples from the lab\u2019s evidence locker in violation of protocol, failing to verify the proper functioning of lab equipment, and falsifying reports to hide her misconduct. See <em>Scott, supra </em>at 339-341. In addition, Dookhan \u201cacknowledged to investigators that she [might] not be able to identify those cases in which she tested the samples properly and those in which she did not,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 339, rendering it virtually impossible to ascertain the full extent of Dookhan\u2019s misconduct during her tenure at the Hinton drug lab, which spanned approximately ten years. There is no indication on the record before us that Farak\u2019s misconduct presents a comparable situation. Therefore, the defendant is not entitled to the benefit of the conclusive presumption articulated in <em>Scott, supra </em>at 352-353, that egregious misconduct by Farak occurred in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">That said, the systemic nature of Dookhan\u2019s misconduct only came to light following a thorough investigation of the Hinton drug lab by the State police detective unit of the Attorney General\u2019s office. See <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass. at 339-341. As far as we are able to discern, no such investigation of the Amherst drug lab has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>occurred. In another case decided today concerning Farak\u2019s misconduct at that facility, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>471 Mass. 85, 95 (2015), we stated that \u201cthe Commonwealth ha[s] a duty to conduct a thorough investigation to determine the nature and extent of [Farak\u2019s] misconduct, and its effect both on pending cases and on cases in which defendants already had been convicted of crimes involving controlled substances that Farak had analyzed.\u201d The Commonwealth\u2019s obligation to conduct an investigation is premised on a prosecutor\u2019s \u201cduty to learn of and disclose to a defendant any exculpatory evidence that is \u2018held by agents of the prosecution team,\u2019 \u201d who include chemists working in State drug laboratories. <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beal, </em>429 Mass. 530, 532 (1999). It is incumbent on the Commonwealth to perform this duty in a timely fashion. The burden of ascertaining whether Farak\u2019s misconduct at the Amherst drug lab has created a problem of systemic proportions is not one that should be shouldered by defendants in drug cases. See generally <em>Scott, supra </em>at 353. At the same time, given what we know, we have no basis for concluding in the present case that Farak\u2019s misconduct is a \u201clapse of systemic magnitude in the criminal justice system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">In a related vein, when considering the nexus between the government misconduct and the defendant\u2019s case, we agree with the motion judge that, although there is compelling evidence that Farak was stealing cocaine and replacing it with counterfeit substances, the defendant has not shown that Farak\u2019s misconduct antedated the entry of his guilty pleas and, therefore, must have occurred in his case. Farak analyzed the drugs in the defendant\u2019s case on June 8, 2007. The defendant pleaded guilty to trafficking in cocaine (fourteen to twenty-eight grams) and unlawful possession of ammunition on April 13, 2009. Farak was arrested on January 19, 2013, for misconduct that was alleged to have occurred the previous day. The judge stated that powerful circumstantial evidence suggested that this was not the first time that Farak had tampered with drug samples at the Amherst drug lab. The judge pointed out that the retesting of a small number of drug samples that originally had been analyzed by Farak indicated that she was tampering with evidence during the summer of 2012. Moreover, during the fall of 2012, Farak\u2019s coworkers began to observe a change in her behavior, including frequent unexplained absences from her work station and a decrease in productivity. From these facts and all of the physical evidence seized in connection with the criminal investigation of Farak, the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>concluded that Farak\u2019s misconduct postdated the defendant\u2019s guilty pleas by almost three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The defendant contends that the judge abused his discretion by not considering \u201cstrong circumstantial evidence of malfeasance\u201d by Farak dating back to the start of her tenure as an analyst, suggesting a prolonged period of wrongdoing. The defendant posits that Farak must have engaged in misconduct while she was working at the Hinton drug lab from the summer of 2003 until the summer of 2004, see note 1, <em>supra, </em>because her high volume of drug testing rivaled that of Dookhan, who admitted to \u201cdry labbing.\u201d The defendant has offered no supporting evidence to substantiate this claim, and in our view, it is wholly speculative. With respect to Farak\u2019s work at the Amherst drug lab, her supervisor testified at the evidentiary hearing, see note 5, <em>supra, </em>that Farak\u2019s productivity was comparable to that of her colleague in the lab. The defendant also claims that there was evidence that Farak used cocaine in 2000. Even if that were true, it does not support an inference that Farak must have been tampering with evidence in the Amherst drug lab prior to April 13, 2009. We conclude that the judge did not abuse his discretion in determining that the defendant failed to show that egregious misconduct by Farak antedated the entry of his guilty pleas and, therefore, must have occurred in his case.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Based on the <em>Ferrara-Scott </em>framework for reviewing a defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty pleas, the defendant here has not satisfied his burden of establishing each element of the first prong of the analysis. That said, it is clear from the record that Farak engaged in egregious misconduct at the Amherst drug lab, and that any deficiencies in the evidence as to the scope and timing of her misconduct are attributable to the Commonwealth in light of its failure to conduct a thorough investigation of the matter. Therefore, \u201cit is incumbent upon us to exercise our superintendence power to fashion a workable approach\u201d for giving defendants whose evidence samples were analyzed by Farak at the Amherst drug lab an opportunity to discover whether, in fact, their cases were affected by her misconduct. <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass. at 352. Clearly, the scope of Farak\u2019s misconduct was wider than the ten charges to which she pleaded guilty, given that at least four additional cases have surfaced in which it appears that she tampered with evidence, but with respect to which no charges were filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">In the absence of a thorough investigation by the Commonwealth into Farak\u2019s misconduct, we conclude that the following procedures should be implemented. In cases where a defendant seeks to vacate a guilty plea under Mass. R. Crim. R 30 (b) as a result of the revelation of Farak\u2019s misconduct at the Amherst drug lab, where the defendant proffers a drug certificate from the defendant\u2019s case signed by Farak on the line labeled \u201cAssistant Analyst,\u201d and where the drug samples have not yet been destroyed, the defendant is entitled to retest those samples. Drug samples that are part of a defendant\u2019s case are \u201ctangible objects\u201d subject to mandatory discovery under Mass. R. Crim. P. 14 (a) (1) (A) (vii), as amended, 442 Mass. 1518 (2004). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>456 Mass. 857, 870-871 (2010) (\u201cThe Commonwealth\u2019s responsibility to provide discovery to the defendant extends to material in its possession, custody, or control, and includes information in the possession of persons who have participated in the investigation or evaluation of the case and who report to the prosecutor\u2019s office concerning the case\u201d). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>444 Mass. 786, 795 (2005) (defendant has \u201cunquestioned right, under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>obtain relevant evidence that bears on the question of his guilt or innocence or which otherwise will help his defense\u201d). By such retesting, a defendant can ascertain definitively whether Farak tampered with the drag samples that were used to convict, thereby establishing the requisite \u201cnexus between the government misconduct and the defendant\u2019s own case.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass. at 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">More problematic are those cases, like the present one, where a defendant seeks to vacate a guilty plea under rale 30 (b) as a result of the revelation of Farak\u2019s misconduct, but the defendant\u2019s drag samples have been destroyed. See note 9, <em>supra. </em>It is imperative that the Commonwealth thoroughly investigate the timing and scope of Farak\u2019s misconduct at the Amherst drug lab in order to remove the cloud that has been cast over the integrity of the work performed at that facility, which has serious implications for the entire criminal justice system. Within one month of the issuance of this opinion, the Commonwealth shall notify the judge below whether it intends to undertake such an investigation. If so, the investigation shall begin promptly and shall be completed in an expeditious manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">As just stated, in our view, a thorough and timely investigation would be the appropriate course to follow in the circumstances. In the absence of such an investigation, however, and where an individual defendant\u2019s drag samples have been destroyed, the judge, among other options, may entertain discovery motions to retest randomly selected drag samples that were tested by Farak and are still in existence in an effort to determine whether evidence of tampering can be identified and to establish the time frame of Farak\u2019s misconduct. The results of the Commonwealth\u2019s investigation, or the evidence that can be gleaned from retesting, will dictate how the judge shall proceed, and we leave that matter to the judge\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">We reiterate that under the first prong of the <em>Ferrara-Scott </em>analysis, a defendant must show egregious misconduct by the government that preceded the entry of the defendant\u2019s guilty pleas, and occurred in the defendant\u2019s case. See <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass. at 347-354. See also <em>Ferrara, </em>456 F.3d at 290. In the absence of evidence suggesting a problem of systemic magnitude at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Amherst drug lab, but nonetheless indicating a serious problem of undefined proportions, we afford the defendant here, and others in a similar position, the opportunity to show, through the retesting of drug samples, that Farak\u2019s misconduct preceded the entry of his guilty pleas and occurred in his own case. Satisfaction of the first prong of the <em>Ferrara-Scott </em>analysis is not, however, the end of the judge\u2019s inquiry regarding whether to allow the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty pleas under Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b). We turn now to the second prong of the <em>Ferrara-Scott </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">b. <em>Prong two of the </em>Ferrara-Scott <em>analysis: material influence on the defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty. </em>The defendant contends that the judge erred in determining that, even if Farak\u2019s misconduct had antedated the defendant\u2019s guilty pleas, he still would have entered into the plea agreement. In the defendant\u2019s view, the judge wholly minimized the scope of Farak\u2019s misconduct and, as a consequence, improperly assessed its impact on the defendant\u2019s decision whether to plead guilty or go to trial. The Commonwealth acknowledges that the judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty pleas in significant part because there was no evidence that the drug analyses in the defendant\u2019s case were inaccurate, or that Farak was involved in misconduct at the time the defendant pleaded guilty. Notwithstanding evidence of misconduct by Farak, the Commonwealth contends that there were good reasons for the defendant to accept the plea agreement, including the strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s case (including the defendant\u2019s own incriminating statements), and the significant concessions made by the Commonwealth regarding the charges and the defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">In <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass. at 354, this court pointed out that satisfaction of the first prong of the <em>Ferrara </em>analysis did not \u201crelieve the defendant of his burden under the second <em>Ferrara </em>prong to particularize Dookhan\u2019s misconduct to his decision to tender a guilty plea.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chatman, </em>466 Mass. 327, 333 (2013) (\u201cThe defendant has the burden of proving facts upon which he relies in support of his motion for a new trial\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lewin, </em>405 Mass. 566, 584-585 (1989) (charges against defendant need not be dismissed where police misconduct was egregious but not prejudicial to fair trial). The same principle is applicable here with respect to Farak\u2019s misconduct. \u201c[Ejvidence of the circumstances surrounding [a] defendant\u2019s decision to tender a guilty plea should be well within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>defendant\u2019s reach.\u201d <em>Scott, supra </em>at 354 n.11. Accordingly, under the second prong of the <em>Ferrara-Scott </em>framework, \u201cthe defendant must demonstrate a reasonable probability that he would not have pleaded guilty had he known of [Farak\u2019s] misconduct.\u201d <em>Scott, supra </em>at 354-355. See <em>Ferrara, </em>456 F.3d at 290, 294. This court identified in <em>Scott </em>a number of factors that might be relevant to a defendant\u2019s showing under this second prong of analysis. See <em>Scott, supra </em>at 355-356. We emphasized in that case that \u201cthe full context of the defendant\u2019s decision to enter a plea agreement will dictate the assessment of his claim that knowledge of Dookhan\u2019s misconduct would have influenced the defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 357. See <em>Ferrara, supra </em>at 294. Here, the same analysis is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">We recognize that the motion judge considered whether the defendant would have pleaded guilty even if Farak\u2019s misconduct had antedated his guilty pleas. However, the judge did so without the benefit of our opinion in <em>Scott, </em>and without our assessment of the potential implications of the Commonwealth\u2019s cursory investigation of Farak\u2019s misconduct at the Amherst drug lab. In significant part, the judge determined that Farak\u2019s misconduct would not have materially influenced the defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty because there was no evidence that the drug analyses in the defendant\u2019s case were inaccurate, or that Farak was tampering with evidence at the time the defendant tendered his guilty pleas. Given the absence of a thorough investigation by the Commonwealth into Farak\u2019s misconduct, we cannot ascertain whether the foundation for the judge\u2019s resolution of this issue is solid. Therefore, following his resolution of the first prong of the <em>FerraraScott </em>analysis, the judge should reconsider the second prong of that analysis \u201cto determine whether, in the totality of the circumstances, the defendant can demonstrate a reasonable probability that had he known of [Farak\u2019s] misconduct, he would not have [pleaded guilty] and would have insisted on taking his chances at trial.\u201d <em>Scott, 461 </em>Mass. at 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">c. <em>Subpoena to establish scope and timing of Farak\u2019s misconduct. </em>In an effort to develop the facts necessary to establish the timing and scope of Farak\u2019s misconduct, the defendant subpoenaed Farak\u2019s spouse, Nikki Lee, to testify at the evidentiary hearing. See note 5, <em>supra. </em>The defendant wanted to show that Farak had a history of cocaine use dating back to 2000, and he sought to question Lee about Farak\u2019s drug use before and during her employment at the Amherst drug lab. Lee\u2019s testimony, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>defendant\u2019s view, would be highly probative of when Farak became motivated to tamper with evidence. In response, Lee filed a notice of her intent to invoke her privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, as well as spousal privilege under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20, Second.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Construing Lee\u2019s notice of her intent to invoke certain privileges as a motion to quash the subpoena, the judge allowed the motion on the basis of spousal privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">On appeal, the defendant contends that the judge erred in quashing the subpoena because the evidentiary hearing was not a criminal proceeding against Farak and, therefore, the spousal privilege was inapplicable. The propriety of asserting a testimonial privilege is a matter of statutory interpretation, presenting a pure question of law that is subject to de novo review. See <em>Matter of a Grand Jury Subpoena, </em>447 Mass. 88, 90 (2006). See also <em>Bridgewater State Univ. Found. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Bridgewater, </em>463 Mass. 154, 156 (2012). Based on our review, we agree with the defendant that the spousal privilege was not applicable in the circumstances of this case. However, we affirm the judge\u2019s decision on other grounds. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Va Meng Joe, </em>425 Mass. 99, 102 (1997) (\u201cAn appellate court is free to affirm a ruling on grounds different from those relied on by the motion judge if the correct or preferred basis for affirmance is supported by the record and the findings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">General Laws c. 233, \u00a7 20, Second, provides (with certain exceptions not relevant here): \u201c[Njeither husband nor wife shall be compelled to testify in the trial of an indictment, complaint or other criminal proceeding against the other.\u201d See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 504(a) (2014). \u201cThe purpose of the spousal privilege is to protect the relationship of marriage from the potential harm of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>one spouse giving adverse testimony against the other.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Szerlong, </em>457 Mass. 858, 869 (2010), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 1494 (2011). See <em>Matter of a Grand Jury Subpoena, </em>447 Mass. at 96. Because \u201c[testimonial privileges \u2018are exceptions to the general duty imposed on all people to testify,\u2019 \u201d they \u201cmust be strictly construed.\u201d <em>Three Juveniles </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>390 Mass. 357, 359 (1983), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Keefe </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>465 U.S. 1068 (1984), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corsetti, </em>387 Mass. 1, 5 (1982). See <em>Matter of a Grand Jury Subpoena, supra </em>at 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">When considering the meaning of a testimonial privilege, \u201cwe look first and foremost to the language of the statute as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Generally speaking, the spousal privilege applies to testimony that would be given by one spouse in a criminal trial against the other spouse.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>at 90-93. Here, Lee would not be testifying at a criminal trial against Farak. Rather, the defendant sought her testimony at an evidentiary hearing pertaining to postconviction motions filed by fifteen defendants who claimed that alleged criminal conduct by Farak rendered their guilty pleas to various drug charges unknowing, unintelligent, and involuntary. See note 5, <em>supra. </em>Lee\u2019s testimony at such a proceeding cannot be barred by invocation of the spousal privilege under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20, Second. Accordingly, the judge erred in quashing the defendant\u2019s subpoena on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">That said, based on our review of the record, the judge properly could have quashed the defendant\u2019s subpoena on the basis of Lee\u2019s invocation of her privilege against self-incrimination.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> \u201cThe proscription of the Fifth Amendment that \u2018[n]o person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself\u2019 may be invoked whenever a witness reasonably believes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>that the testimony could be used in a criminal prosecution or could lead to other evidence that might be so used.\u201d <em>Pixley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>453 Mass. 827, 832 (2009), citing <em>Kastigar </em>v. <em>United States, </em>406 U.S. 441, 444-445 (1972). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>348 Mass. 60, 62-63 (1964). Because the privilege against self-incrimination is a \u201cfundamental principle\u201d of our judicial system, it \u201cis to be construed liberally in favor of\u2019 the person claiming it. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borans, </em>388 Mass. 453, 455 (1983). \u201cA witness may refuse to testify unless it is <em>\u2018perfectly clear, </em>from a careful consideration of all the circumstances in the case, that the witness is mistaken, and that the answer[s] <em>cannot possibly </em>have such tendency\u2019 to incriminate (emphasis in original).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Funches, </em>379 Mass. 283, 289 (1979), quoting <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>341 U.S. 479, 488 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">By subpoenaing Lee, the defendant sought to elicit testimony at the evidentiary hearing regarding Farak\u2019s cocaine use before and during her employment at the Amherst drug lab. During her testimony before the grand jury, Lee stated that she herself had tried cocaine, that she had observed Farak using cocaine in 2000, and that she had marijuana in her house when police officers arrived to search the premises as part of their investigation of Farak.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> To the extent that Lee testified about her own drug possession in relation to that of Farak, it is not \u201cperfectly clear\u201d that such testimony could not possibly have the tendency to incriminate Lee and subject her to criminal prosecution. Therefore, Lee\u2019s invocation of her privilege against self-incrimination would have been a proper basis for the judge to quash the defendant\u2019s subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>The order denying the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty pleas pursuant to Mass.

The evidence presented at the hearing was limited to (1) the timing and scope of Farak\u2019s alleged criminal conduct; (2) the timing and scope of conduct underlying negative findings in an October 10, 2012, quality assurance audit of the Amherst drug lab by the State police (see note 11, <em>infra)-, </em>and (3) the extent to which Farak\u2019s alleged criminal conduct and the audit findings might relate to the testing of drug evidence in the fifteen defendants\u2019 cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b114-8\">On July 1, 2012, the responsibility for oversight of the Amherst drug lab was transferred from the Department of Public Health to the State police.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b115-7\">One of the newspaper articles, dated March 29, 2011, had been printed from a computer on September 20, 2011, and was a story about the illegal possession of steroids by law enforcement officers.

It was a routine matter in the sense that quality assurance audits are conducted at all State police laboratories every year, but this facility never had been audited. See note 6, <em>supra. </em>Among other purposes, the audit was designed to determine what steps the Amherst drug lab would have to take in order to meet accreditation standards required by the American Society of Crime Lab Directors/Laboratory Accreditation Board. The Amherst drug lab <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>had not been accredited since it began operation in 1987, and in fact, all State police laboratories operated without accreditation prior to 2002. The negative findings in the October, 2012, audit of the Amherst drug lab included the following: chain of custody with respect to evidence kept in short-term overnight storage was not documented appropriately, and evidence retained in such storage was not sealed properly; evidence seals were initialed, but not dated, by the chemists; variances between weights of substances on arrival and weights at testing were not documented; and inventory discrepancies were not verified. In addition, so-called \u201creagents\u201d were not regularly tested, and known drug standards were not verified on a daily basis. The audit team recommended steps to remediate each of these problems, and personnel at the Amherst drug lab took measures to address the negative findings. Cathleen Morrison, a member of the audit team and an author of the audit report, testified at the evidentiary hearing, see note 5, <em>supra, </em>that the audit did not raise any questions regarding the reliability of the testing performed at the Amherst drug lab. The judge concluded that, although the negative findings in the audit \u201creflect[ed] a lax atmosphere in which theft of controlled substances could go undetected for a period of time, the audit did not reveal any unreliable testing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b121-6\">In <em>Scott, </em>the defendant argued that \u201crelief [might] be available to him under <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963), as a result of the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose the potentially exculpatory evidence of Dookhan\u2019s misconduct to the defendant prior to his guilty plea.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass. at 346 n.5. In the present case, the defendant has not raised such an argument, presumably because evidence of misconduct by Farak had not yet come to light at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>the defendant pleaded guilty on April 13, 2009. As such, there was nothing for the Commonwealth to disclose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The motion judge was not persuaded that it was reasonable to infer from Farak\u2019s possession of the newspaper articles that were printed in the fall of 2011, see note 7, <em>supra, </em>that she was stealing controlled substances at that time. We conclude that the judge did not abuse his discretion in making this determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b125-7\">As far as we can tell, Farak has not provided any details concerning the timing and scope of her misconduct, apart from pleading guilty to the ten indictments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The defendant also directs our attention to other purported evidence of likely tampering that, in his view, demonstrates that Farak was engaged in misconduct at the Amherst drug lab long before the summer of 2012. In the so-called Finch and Espinosa cases, a Springfield police detective on March 17, 2012, submitted suspected Oxycodone pills to the Amherst drug lab for testing, but after analysis, Farak concluded that the pills did not contain any controlled substances. In Commonwealth vs. Berube, Hampden Super. Ct., No. 2011-00355 (Oct. 30, 2013), a Springfield police officer testified that not all of the controlled substances presented at the trial were in the same condition as when the officer had seized them. Farak analyzed the substances in that case on May 12, 2011. Similarly, in Commonwealth vs. Carter, Hampden Super. Ct., No. 2010-00115 (Nov. 15, 2013), the evidence presented at the trial (whitish pills) appeared to be different from the evidence that was seized by the police (blue pills). Farak analyzed the substances in that case on December 17,2009. Finally, photocopies of three newspaper articles about individuals who had been investigated, charged, or sentenced for the illegal possession or theft of controlled substances had been printed from a computer in the fall of 2011 and were found in Farak\u2019s vehicle. See note 7, <em>supra. </em>Farak tested the substances in the defendant\u2019s case on June 8, 2007. Given that the defendant pleaded guilty on April 13, 2009, and that all of this purported evidence relates to activities that occurred thereafter, it does not support the defendant\u2019s contention that Farak\u2019s misconduct antedated the entry of his guilty pleas, which is the relevant inquiry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>under the <em>Ferrara-Scott </em>framework. See <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass. at 350-354.

Trial judges should be very cautious in allowing motions to destroy such evidence where the narcotics have been analyzed at the Amherst drug lab.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b132-7\">In her notice of intent to invoke certain privileges, Nikki Lee also asked that she be excused from testifying at the evidentiary hearing because, among other reasons, her sworn testimony before the State grand jury investigating Farak\u2019s misconduct at the Amherst drug lab already had been provided to the defendant. Lee testified before the grand jury that she had tried cocaine, and that she had observed Farak using cocaine in 2000, although not since that time. We note that the spousal privilege set forth in G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20, Second, cannot be invoked in proceedings before a grand jury. See <em>Matter of a Grand Jury Subpoena, </em>447 Mass. 88, 99 (2006). A spouse who testifies before a grand jury will not be deemed to have waived the spousal privilege at a later proceeding because \u201cif there is no privilege not to testify before a grand jury, then no privilege has been waived by giving such testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b133-7\">In <em>Matter of a Grand Jury Subpoena, </em>447 Mass. at 99, this court did not decide \u201cwhether, or to what extent, the spousal privilege may be invoked in pretrial (or posttrial) proceedings.\u201d Given that the evidentiary hearing at issue in the present case was not a pretrial proceeding against Farak, we do not consider the scope of the spousal privilege beyond the plain language of the statute, which resolves the matter at hand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Lee\u2019s testimony before the grand jury did not constitute a waiver of her privilege against self-incrimination with regard to the evidentiary hearing. \u201cThe waiver [of a testimonial privilege], once made, waives the privilege only with respect to the same proceeding; the witness may once again invoke the privilege in any subsequent proceeding.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>436 Mass. 252, 258 n.6 (2002).
