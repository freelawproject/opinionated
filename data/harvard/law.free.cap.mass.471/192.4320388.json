The motion judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, and after a jury-waived trial before a different judge, the defendant was convicted of trafficking in heroin and cocaine, and of unlawful possession of marijuana with intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>to distribute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant appealed, and we granted his application for direct appellate review. We conclude that where, as here, the Commonwealth applies for an anticipatory search warrant and the judicial authorization to execute the search is conditioned on the occurrence of a specific future event, the search is authorized by the warrant where there is equivalent compliance with that condition precedent. Because we conclude that, in this case, there was both equivalent compliance with the warrant\u2019s condition precedent and probable cause to search the defendant\u2019s residence once equivalent compliance was achieved, we affirm the denial of the motion to suppress and the resulting convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\"><em>Background. </em>The facts are not in dispute. The search of the defendant\u2019s apartment at 250 Oakgrove Avenue in Springfield arose out of an investigation by the Springfield police department of the defendant\u2019s nephew, Carlos Colondres.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As detailed in the affidavit by Officer John Wadlegger in support of the application for the warrant to search the defendant\u2019s apartment, the police were investigating the sale of cocaine and heroin by a man known as \u201cLoso.\u201d The investigation was assisted by an anonymous \u201ccooperating source\u201d (CS), who informed Officer Wadlegger that the CS had purchased cocaine from Loso \u201cnumerous times over the past month.\u201d The CS provided Officer Wadlegger with Loso\u2019s cellular telephone number and the license plate numbers of the two vehicles Loso operated, one of which the CS identified as belonging to Loso\u2019s girl friend. The CS informed Officer Wadlegger that Loso lived with his girl friend \u201con a side street off of St. James Ave. in Springfield.\u201d The CS also informed Officer Wadlegger that the CS had seen Loso in possession of heroin for sale, and that Loso had offered to sell heroin to the CS.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">After conducting a registry of motor vehicles inquiry, Officer Wadlegger determined that one of the vehicles identified by the CS was registered to Carlos, and the second vehicle was registered to a woman named Mychael Barnett who lived at 14 Berke<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>ley Street in Springfield.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When Officer Wadlegger showed the CS the registry of motor vehicles photograph of Carlos, the CS positively identified Carlos as Loso. Officer Wadlegger conducted a surveillance of 14 Berkeley Street and observed both vehicles parked in front of the address. He also observed Carlos leave that address, travel to 250 Oakgrove Avenue, and enter the building at that address. Carlos reemerged a short time later and returned to 14 Berkeley Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Officer Wadlegger arranged for the CS to conduct two \u201ccontrolled buys\u201d of narcotics from Carlos. The first was initiated \u201c[d]uring the week of December 25, 2011,\u201d when the CS telephoned Carlos and asked to purchase heroin from him; the second was initiated \u201c[d]uring the week of January 8, 2012,\u201d when the CS telephoned Carlos and asked to purchase cocaine. During both initiating telephone calls, Carlos told the CS to meet him at a prearranged location; during the conversation initiating the second controlled purchase, Carlos explained that he \u201chad to go and pick up the cocaine for the sale.\u201d Following the telephone conversations, police conducted a surveillance of Carlos\u2019s movements, observing the same sequence of events on both occasions. Carlos traveled to 250 Oakgrove Avenue in Springfield, where he parked his vehicle and entered the building. Carlos took the elevator to the third floor and entered apartment 304 with a set of keys.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A short time later, Carlos left the building and traveled to the arranged meeting location, where he met with the CS. After the meetings, Carlos returned to 14 Berkeley Street, and the CS met with Officer Wadlegger to turn over the drugs that the CS had purchased from Carlos using \u201cbuy money\u201d the CS had been provided by the police.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">On January 19, 2012, Officer Wadlegger applied for a search warrant for the defendant\u2019s apartment. In his affidavit, Officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Wadlegger said that, based on his training and experience and on the information obtained through his investigation, the defendant\u2019s apartment was being used as a \u201cstash house\u201d to store narcotics and cash.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He stated in the affidavit that he was \u201crequesting an anticipatory search warrant for 250 Oakgrove Ave., Apt. #304.\u201d He also attested that, between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. that day, he received information from the CS that Carlos \u201cwould be making a delivery of cocaine to the South End section of the city,\u201d and \u201cwould be leaving 14 Berkeley St. and then going to 250 Oakgrove Ave., Apt 304 to retrieve the cocaine,\u201d which Carlos would then deliver to the customer. Officer Wadlegger declared in his affidavit, \u201cIf this occurs, this will trigger probable cause to believe that cocaine is being kept inside 250 Oakgrove Ave., Apt #304.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Based on the affidavit, a warrant was issued by an assistant clerk-magistrate of the Springfield Division of the District Court Department to search the defendant\u2019s apartment for cocaine, as well as for drug paraphernalia, monies, and personal papers. Later that day, the police observed Carlos travel from 14 Berkeley Street to the defendant\u2019s apartment, leave a short time later, and reenter his vehicle. At that time, not waiting for Carlos to make the anticipated delivery of cocaine, the police approached Carlos, removed him from the vehicle, and placed him under arrest. During the search incident to arrest, two bags of cocaine, one weighing approximately 57 grams and the other 4.5 grams, were seized from Carlos\u2019s person. The police then executed the search warrant for the defendant\u2019s apartment, seizing approximately 1,700 grams of cocaine, 878 tablets of \u201cEcstasy,\u201d 101 grams of heroin, one pound of marijuana, and drug packaging paraphernalia.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The defendant moved to suppress the evidence obtained from the search, claiming that the search was not authorized by the warrant because it was conducted without the occurrence of the warrant\u2019s triggering event, i.e., the delivery of cocaine by Carlos <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>to someone in the South End of Springfield. In denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the motion judge concluded that the warrant to search the defendant\u2019s apartment was not an anticipatory search warrant. He recognized that \u201cthe affiant . . . viewed probable cause as anticipatory,\u201d but found \u201cno such limitation in the warrant itself,\u201d which commanded a search of the apartment within a reasonable time within seven days and \u201cwas not predicated on the occurrence of any triggering event.\u201d The judge also found that the search warrant affidavit \u201cestablished probable cause that evidence of criminal activity would be found\u201d at the apartment, \u201cwhether or not the triggering events occurred.\u201d Having found that the search warrant was not anticipatory and that there was probable cause to support the warrant regardless of whether the triggering events occurred, the judge denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>We address first the judge\u2019s conclusion that the search warrant was not anticipatory because the warrant itself did not declare that a triggering event was a condition precedent to the execution of the search. An anticipatory search warrant is \u201cnot require[d] ... to contain on its face explicit directions about the triggering event, as long as the conditions precedent to the warrant\u2019s execution are contained in the affidavit supporting the application for the warrant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Williams, 431 Mass. 71, 73 (2000). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Grubbs, </em>547 U.S. 90, 97-99 (2006); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gauthier, </em>425 Mass. 37, 41-45 (1997). Because the affidavit here set forth the triggering events that were the conditions precedent to execution of the warrant, the failure of the warrant to recite those events on its face did not prevent the warrant from being an anticipatory search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">\u201cAn anticipatory search warrant is a warrant that takes effect at a specified future time and not on its issuance.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Staines, </em>441 Mass. 521, 525 (2004). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>430 Mass. 838, 844 n.3 (2000), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>882 F.2d 699, 702 (2d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Grant </em>v. <em>United States, </em>493 U.S. 943 (1989) (\u201cAn anticipatory warrant, by definition, is a warrant that has been issued before the necessary events have occurred which will allow a constitutional search of the premises; if those events do not transpire, the warrant is void\u201d). See also <em>Grubbs, </em>547 U.S. at 94, quoting 2 W.R. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 3.7(c), at 398 (4th ed. 2004) (\u201cAn anticipatory warrant is \u2018a warrant based upon an affidavit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>showing probable cause that at some future time [but not presently] certain evidence of crime will be located at a specific place\u2019 \u201d). Implicit in this definition is that the occurrence of the \u201cso-called \u2018triggering condition\u2019 \u201d specified in the affidavit is necessary to establish probable cause and therefore is a condition precedent to the execution of the warrant. See <em>Grubbs, supra </em>(\u201cby definition, the triggering condition which establishes probable cause has not yet been satisfied when the warrant is issued\u201d). Cf. <em>Cruz, supra </em>at 843-844 (\u201cBecause probable cause existed at the time the warrant was issued, it was not an anticipatory warrant\u201d). The judge or clerk-magistrate who authorizes an anticipatory warrant must find probable cause to believe that the evidence particularized in the warrant \u201cwill be found <em>when the search is conducted\u2019 </em>(emphasis in original), <em>Grubbs, supra </em>at 95, not when the search is authorized. See <em>Staines, supra. </em>The authorization of the search, therefore, is conditioned on the occurrence of the triggering condition, because only then will the judge\u2019s or clerk-magistrate\u2019s \u201cprobable cause determination at the time of issuance [have] reached fruition.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rowland, </em>145 F.3d 1194, 1202 (10th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Because judicial authorization for the search depends on the occurrence of the condition precedent, the triggering condition must be \u201cclearly and narrowly defined,\u201d <em>Gauthier, </em>425 Mass. at 43, both \u201cto avoid misunderstanding or manipulation by government agents,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 44, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ricciardelli, </em>998 F.2d 8, 12 (1st Cir. 1993), and to permit a court to determine whether the triggering condition has occurred. See <em>Gauthier, supra. </em>Here, the triggering conditions were clearly defined: Carlos would leave his residence at 14 Berkeley Street, travel to the defendant\u2019s apartment at 250 Oakgrove Avenue, and then make a delivery to the customer. The first two conditions occurred; the third did not because Carlos was arrested after he left the defendant\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">If <em>strict </em>compliance with the triggering conditions is required, the conditions were not met and the search of the defendant\u2019s apartment was not authorized by the warrant. However, if <em>equivalent </em>compliance is required, the triggering conditions were met because Carlos\u2019s delivery of the cocaine was instrumental in establishing probable cause only because it would have demonstrated that Carlos had obtained cocaine from the apartment, and that was demonstrated without a delivery once two bags of cocaine were found on his person during the search incident to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>arrest. In effect, the police substituted the discovery of the bags of cocaine on Carlos\u2019s person for the delivery of at least some of that cocaine to a third person.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">We conclude that the execution of a search is authorized by an anticipatory search warrant once there is equivalent compliance, albeit not strict compliance, with the triggering conditions in the affidavit. An anticipatory search warrant, by definition, \u201ctakes effect at a specified future time,\u201d <em>Staines, </em>441 Mass. at 525, which means that the affidavit supporting it must make a prediction about the future events that will trigger the warrant. Because the future rarely goes exactly according to plan, the benefits of an anticipatory warrant would too often be lost if we required that the triggering conditions be satisfied to the letter before the warrant takes effect.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">In determining whether there has been equivalent compliance, we look to the inference that would have been drawn had the triggering conditions stated in the affidavit occurred \u2014 here, that the cocaine in Carlos\u2019s possession was obtained from a stash in the defendant\u2019s apartment \u2014 and determine whether the weight of that inference is as strong or stronger under the actual conditions. The Commonwealth bears the burden of proving that the conditions that actually gave rise to the search were as or more likely to establish probable cause as the triggering conditions stated in the affidavit. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Miggins, </em>302 F.3d 384, 394-397 (6th Cir.), cert. denied sub. nom. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>United States, </em>537 U.S. 1097 (2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1130, and cert. denied sub. nom. <em>McDaniels </em>v. <em>United States, </em>538 U.S. 971 (2003) (reading affidavit in \u201ccommonsense fashion\u201d and concluding that triggering condition, which required delivery and acceptance of parcel containing cocaine by someone inside residence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>was met where someone who had been previously inside residence greeted delivery person outside, accepted parcel, and immediately left with it in vehicle, because these events \u201csufficiently established] a connection between the parcel and someone who ha[d] access to the residence to which the parcel [was] addressed\u201d); <em>People </em>v. <em>Martini, </em>265 Ill. App. 3d 698, 708-710 (1994) (\u201cthe standard to be adhered to in the context of police execution of \u2018anticipatory\u2019 search warrants is the substantial compliance standard,\u201d and was satisfied where \u201cstrict compliance\u201d was \u201cnot necessary\u201d). Although here, by arresting Carlos, the police actively interrupted the sequence of events that the affidavit had said would trigger the warrant, that should not prevent the warrant from taking effect where the police otherwise established facts that provided equal support for the same inference on which the probable cause determination approved by the clerk-magistrate had been based.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The requirement of equivalent compliance comports with our opinion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gauthier, </em>425 Mass. 37 (1997). Under the anticipatory warrant authorized in that case, there were three triggering conditions for the execution of the search warrant of the defendant\u2019s residence: (1) the confidential informant was to place an order to purchase marijuana from the dealer identified in the affidavit, (2) the dealer was to enter the defendant\u2019s residence (where marijuana was allegedly stored), and (3) marijuana was to be found on the dealer after he was searched upon leaving the residence. <em>Id. </em>at 39. The first two conditions were met, but we concluded that the third was not, because the police officer did not search the dealer as he was leaving the residence but instead waited until the officer saw him enter the vehicle that he had driven to the defendant\u2019s residence and place something on the floor behind the driver\u2019s seat.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 40-41. We declared, \u201cThe triggering event language in warrants such as this one should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>read sensibly and in context, and, when that is done, we must conclude that the triggering event failed to materialize here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41. We reached that conclusion not simply because the delay in searching the dealer departed from the letter of the third condition, but because the actual evidence of probable cause was significantly weaker where the marijuana was found in the dealer\u2019s vehicle rather than on his person as he was leaving the defendant\u2019s residence. We noted that the police officer did not testify that he saw the dealer carry the package as he left the defendant\u2019s residence, and we further noted that where the driver of the vehicle \u201cwas himself an active dealer in narcotics,\u201d it was \u201cpossible that he had that particular bag of narcotics in the car all along.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Our conclusion that equivalent compliance with the triggering conditions is sufficient to authorize the execution of the search warrant does not give \u201cunfettered discretion\u201d to the police. See <em>Ricciardelli, </em>998 F.2d. at 12 (\u201cmagistrates who are asked to issue such warrants must be particularly vigilant in ensuring that the opportunities for exercising unfettered discretion are eliminated\u201d). Although the police are not bound to the strict letter of the triggering conditions, they are very much fettered: where probable cause depends on compliance with the triggering conditions and the police do not strictly comply with those conditions, the Commonwealth must demonstrate at the motion to suppress hearing that the inference supporting probable cause was at least as strong from the conditions that actually gave rise to the search as it would have been from the triggering conditions stated in the affidavit. Failing that, the motion judge will rule that the execution of the search was not authorized by the warrant, and any fruits will be suppressed unless the Commonwealth proves that the search was lawful as a warrantless search.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Having found equivalent compliance with the triggering conditions, we conclude that compliance with those conditions provided probable cause to believe that evidence of Carlos\u2019s drug trafficking would be located at the defendant\u2019s residence, which Carlos appeared to use as a \u201cstash house.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Where, as here, \u201cthe place to be searched is a residence,\u201d a showing of probable cause requires that the affidavit establish \u201ca sufficient nexus\u201d connecting the residence with evidence of criminal activity, by \u201cprovid[ing] a substantial basis for concluding that [such] evidence\u201d will be found at the residence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tapia, </em>463 Mass. 721, 725-726 (2012), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pina, </em>453 Mass. 438, 441 (2009), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>430 Mass. 710, 712 (2000). This nexus \u201cneed not be based on direct observation,\u201d <em>Donahue, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cinelli, </em>389 Mass. 197, 213, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 860 (1983), but \u201cmay be found in \u2018 . . . normal inferences as to where a criminal would be likely to hide\u2019 the drugs he sells.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Day, </em>440 Mass. 296, 302 (2003), quoting <em>Cinelli, supra. </em>Although \u201c[n]o bright-line rule can establish whether there is a nexus between suspected drug dealing and a defendant\u2019s home ...[,] [observations by police of a suspect on multiple occasions leaving his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>residence and proceeding directly to a prearranged location to sell drugs can support a reasonable inference that the suspect is a drug dealer who stores drugs or packages drugs for resale in his residence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Escalera, 462 Mass. 636, 643 (2012) (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Officer Wadlegger\u2019s affidavit specified that during two controlled purchases, one during \u201cthe week of December 25, 2011,\u201d and the second during \u201cthe week of January 8, 2012,\u201d the police observed that, shortly after the CS had telephoned Carlos to initiate the purchase of heroin or cocaine, Carlos left his residence and stopped briefly at the defendant\u2019s apartment before delivering the heroin or cocaine to the CS.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> If there was any risk that the information regarding the earlier controlled purchases was stale or that it was insufficient to establish a pattern connecting the defendant\u2019s residence with Carlos\u2019s drug trafficking, that risk was eliminated when, in equivalent compliance with the triggering conditions for execution of the search, the same pattern was repeated by Carlos before he was found with two bags of cocaine on his person outside the defendant\u2019s apartment. Considered together with Officer Wadlegger\u2019s statement that, based on his experience, narcotics dealers commonly store drugs at \u201cstash houses\u201d located somewhere other than their primary residences, this evidence provided probable cause to believe that Carlos used the defendant\u2019s residence as a \u201cstash house\u201d from which he retrieved drugs when he needed them for a sale.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We therefore conclude, for reasons other than those found by the motion judge, that the defendant\u2019s motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>suppress was properly denied.

See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vigneau, </em>187 F.3d 70, 80 (1st Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1172 (2000) (\u201cwhether the condition was satisfied ... is beside the point\u201d where \u201cleaving the package at the door did nothing to establish probable cause to search the premises\u201d and \u201cprobable cause existed to search the premises <em>without </em>delivery of the package [emphasis in original]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Where an affiant believes that there might be probable cause to conduct a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>search without any triggering conditions but that probable cause would be stronger with triggering conditions (e.g., where an affiant believes that the evidence described in the affidavit might be regarded as stale), the affiant may request in the affidavit both an anticipatory and a traditional warrant to search the premises. A judge or clerk-magistrate will determine whether to issue an anticipatory search warrant based on whether there will be probable cause for the search once the triggering condition is satisfied, and whether there is probable cause to believe that the triggering condition will occur. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Grubbs, </em>547 U.S. 90, 96-97 (2006), quoting <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 238 (1983) (\u201c[F]or a conditioned anticipatory warrant to comply with the Fourth Amendment\u2019s requirement of probable cause, two prerequisites of probability must be satisfied. It must be true not only that \u00bf7 the triggering condition occurs \u2018there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place,\u2019 . . . but also that there is probable cause to believe the triggering condition <em>will </em>occur\u201d [emphasis in original]). The judge or clerk-magistrate will determine whether to issue a traditional search warrant based on whether there is probable cause for the search at the time of the warrant request. If the warrant is allowed as both an anticipatory and a traditional warrant (and the judge or clerk-magistrate should so specify), a judge deciding a motion to suppress the search should treat the warrant as an anticipatory warrant if there is equivalent compliance with the triggering condition and as a traditional warrant if there is not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The defendant does not contend that there was not probable cause to believe that Carlos was engaged in drug trafficking at the time of his arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Carlos told the CS prior to one of these controlled purchases that Carlos \u201chad to go and pick up the cocaine.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b216-8\">For an anticipatory warrant to comply with the Fourth Amendment, there must not only be probable cause for the search once the triggering condition is satisfied; there must also be probable cause to believe that the triggering condition will occur. See <em>Grubbs, </em>547 U.S. at 95-97. The defendant does not specifically challenge on appeal whether there was probable cause to believe that the triggering conditions set forth in the affidavit would occur. Even if he had, such a challenge would fail, because the belief that the triggering conditions would occur was based on information from the CS, and in denying the motion to suppress, the motion judge implicitly found that the CS\u2019s basis of knowledge and veracity had been established in the affidavit (as required to show probable cause) from the corroboration obtained through independent police investigation of the information provided by the CS and through the two controlled purchases.
