The victim was a man with whom the defendant believed his wife was romantically involved. The defendant took the stand and testified on his own behalf, asserting that he had requested only that the victim be threatened or beaten, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>and that subsequently he had withdrawn from the arrangement altogether. The defendant was cross-examined on the same day and on the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">After the jury were charged, the defendant was taken to the hospital, where it was determined that he had suffered a stroke. Testing later revealed that the stroke had occurred on the night between the first and second days of the defendant\u2019s testimony. The jury, who never learned of the defendant\u2019s stroke, returned guilty verdicts on both indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The defendant filed a motion for a new trial. Because the trial judge had retired, the motion was assigned to another judge, who held a four-day evidentiary hearing and issued a detailed written decision. The judge determined that the defendant\u2019s then-undetected stroke had affected the course of his testimony in a manner that well might have damaged his credibility in the jury\u2019s eyes. The outcome of the trial, the judge explained, had turned in large measure on the jury\u2019s assessments of credibility. Concluding essentially that \u201cjustice may not have been done,\u201d Mass. R. Crim. R 30 (b), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001), the judge ordered a new trial. The Commonwealth appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">We discern no significant error of law or abuse of discretion in the judge\u2019s decision that a new trial was warranted, and we therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">1. <em>Background, </em>a. <em>The Commonwealth\u2019s case. </em>We describe the evidence presented by the Commonwealth in some detail. The defendant and his wife were married in 1998. In 2003, the defendant\u2019s wife filed for divorce; that action was soon withdrawn, and the couple attempted to reconcile. The defendant\u2019s wife again filed for divorce in June, 2005. At about the same time, she renewed an acquaintance with the victim, whom she had dated intermittently from 1984 to 1996. The two again began to meet in person in June or July of 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">The defendant learned of the rekindled connection between the victim and his wife. He and his wife fought often about this subject. The defendant\u2019s wife testified that the defendant told her, on one occasion, that \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be good for [the victim\u2019s] health\u201d if the victim and the defendant\u2019s wife ended up together; when the defendant\u2019s wife told him not to do something \u201cstupid,\u201d the defendant responded, \u201cit won\u2019t be [me] who does it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">The defendant hired a private investigator to follow his wife. In September, 2005, he also purchased records concerning the victim from an Internet search company.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>The defendant heard about Scott Foxworth, allegedly the assassin who killed the victim,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from a coworker, Nancy Campbell. Campbell previously had dated Foxworth. The defendant learned, among other things, that Foxworth had been incarcerated for murder, and that he once had offered to have Campbell\u2019s husband \u201cbeaten up.\u201d The defendant asked Campbell to contact Foxworth, saying that he \u201cwanted somebody taken care of.\u201d Instead, Campbell gave the defendant Foxworth\u2019s telephone numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The defendant contacted Foxworth in October, 2005. The content of the arrangement made between Foxworth and the defendant was the key point of dispute at trial. According to Campbell\u2019s testimony, the defendant spoke, at first, of wanting to have the victim \u201cbeaten up\u201d; but later, in approximately December, 2005, the defendant said that \u201ca beating wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d and that if the victim were to die, the crime could not be traced back to the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The defendant telephoned Foxworth sixty-four times over the months following their initial contact in October, 2005. He made these calls from pay telephones, using coins and prepaid cards he purchased for this purpose. On October 14, the defendant and his mother cashed a check in the amount of $4,459; the next day, Fox-worth made a cash deposit of $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Sometime in September, 2005, the defendant had left the home he had shared with his wife. From Christmas Eve of that year to New Year\u2019s Day, however, the defendant stayed at that house with his wife and their children. The defendant and his wife were sexually intimate during this period. His wife told him, however, that she still intended to move forward with a divorce. Soon thereafter, the defendant wrote to his wife that their time together over the holidays had intensified his confusion and his emotions for her. The defendant also sent a series of electronic mail messages in the same vein to his wife\u2019s sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">On January 13, 2006, the victim was found dead in his automobile, parked in a parking garage in Newton next door to the building where he worked. The cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head. The victim\u2019s wallet, which contained credit cards and $541 in cash, was recovered from the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>A red vehicle was seen at the victim\u2019s workplace on the morning of the shooting. A witness thought that the vehicle might have been a Ford Taurus. None of the individuals who worked in that building drove a vehicle of that description. Foxworth owned a red Taurus, and sometime in 2006, his daughter saw him in that vehicle with a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">On January 15, 2006, the defendant asked Charles Merkle, an acquaintance of his, for $2,500 that Merkle was holding for the defendant in an envelope.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant said that he needed the money to pay a lawyer. Merkle accompanied the defendant to a fast food restaurant in Andover. The defendant entered the restaurant with the envelope containing the money, and left without it.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">b. <em>The defense. </em>The defendant testified on his own behalf, relating the following version of events. The defendant learned that his wife had reconnected with the victim. He knew that the victim had a history of drug abuse and drug offenses, felt that the victim was not a good role model, and \u201cdidn\u2019t want [his] children to be around any[body] like that.\u201d When the defendant first spoke to Foxworth, he mentioned that it \u201cwouldn\u2019t bother [him]\u201d to see the victim \u201cget beat up or something.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Later on, according to the defendant, he asked Foxworth to \u201capproach[ ]\u201d the victim and to \u201cengage.\u201d Foxworth asked to be paid $2,000, and the defendant \u201claughed and . . . said[,] 2,000 dollars just to go talk to somebody?\u201d Foxworth suggested that the defendant pay him $1,000 in advance and another $1,000 if \u201cit stops.\u201d In October, 2005, the defendant agreed, and he paid Foxworth $1,000 in cash. The defendant\u2019s understanding was that Foxworth would \u201cthreaten\u201d the victim, and perhaps \u201cbeat him if it came to that\u201d; he never asked Foxworth to kill the victim. The defendant continued to speak to Foxworth on the telephone, usually about Foxworth\u2019s desire to date Campbell again and his hope that the defendant would intercede with Campbell on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">By early December, 2005, the defendant testified, it appeared to him that Foxworth was not \u201cinterested in doing anything.\u201d The defendant asked Foxworth to return his money and to \u201cforget this whole thing.\u201d The defendant reiterated this request several times in late December, 2005, and early January, 2006, telling Foxworth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>also that \u201cthings were going well with the family and ... it didn\u2019t appear that [the defendant] needed to do anything like that anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">After he found out that the victim had been killed, the defendant called Foxworth, who said, \u201c[W]ell, at least your problem\u2019s taken care of now.\u201d The defendant was \u201cflabbergasted.\u201d Fox-worth then asked the defendant for the \u201cother thousand dollars,\u201d and told the defendant that if he didn\u2019t pay, \u201cthe same would end up happening to [him].\u201d The defendant obtained the envelope containing $2,500 from Merkle, paid Foxworth $1,000, and kept the remaining $1,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">c. <em>Conclusion of the trial. </em>The direct examination of the defendant took place on June 19, 2008, a Thursday. The defendant was cross-examined on that afternoon and on the following day. The jury were charged on Monday, June 23, 2008. The next morning, the judge and the attorneys were informed that the defendant had suffered a stroke and had been taken to the hospital. The jury began their deliberations that day without entering the court room and, therefore, without learning that anything out of the ordinary had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The defendant\u2019s attorney visited the hospital, where he spoke with the defendant and with the defendant\u2019s doctor. Upon returning to the court house, defense counsel reported that the defendant had communicated with him \u201cwithout obvious difficulty.\u201d The defendant told his attorney that he waived his right to be present for the remainder of the trial. Defense counsel\u2019s assessment was that this waiver \u201cwas made knowingly and intelligently.\u201d Later that day, the jury found the defendant guilty of both murder in the first degree and conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">d. <em>Postconviction proceedings. </em>The defendant moved for a new trial, arguing that (a) a crucial stage of the trial had been conducted while he was incompetent; (b) the judge did not ensure that the defendant validly waived his right to be present; and (c) the defendant was deprived of his right to the effective assistance of counsel, because his attorney failed to seek an examination of the defendant\u2019s competency, waived the defendant\u2019s right to be present for the end of the trial, and did not move for a mistrial after learning of the defendant\u2019s stroke. The defendant also filed his direct appeal, which was stayed pending resolution of the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">The motion judge held a four-day evidentiary hearing. The judge heard testimony from the defendant, his trial attorney, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>court officer, the court reporter who had transcribed the trial, a jailhouse nurse, two medical experts called by the defendant (a neurologist and a forensic psychiatrist), and a neurologist called by the Commonwealth. The trial had been videotaped by a network television station, and the judge thus was able to consult high-quality video recordings of the defendant\u2019s two days of testimony (as was this court).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The motion judge made the following findings of fact, which are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Beginning in the early morning hours of June 20, 2008, the defendant suffered at least one stroke, \u201cischemic in nature, caused by an embolus that blocked blood flow to areas of the brain.\u201d The stroke was not diagnosed when the defendant\u2019s symptoms first arose, but ultimately it was confirmed by a magnetic resonance imaging scan and by expert analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The first symptom of the defendant\u2019s stroke was a severe headache, which interfered with his sleep on the night following his first day on the stand. The defendant\u2019s headache continued during the ensuing day. He twice complained to a court officer, and was told both times that he could not be given aspirin.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">On the defendant\u2019s second day of testimony, the court reporter noticed that the defendant was confusing syntax, pronouns, names, and the like. During a break, the court reporter asked the defendant\u2019s attorney, \u201cWhat\u2019s up with your guy?\u201d Defense counsel responded that the defendant was acting as usual.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">The motion judge found that, in hindsight, the court reporter had been correct. As reflected in the transcripts and the video recordings, the defendant\u2019s \u201cability to testify was reduced\u201d on his second day of testimony, as compared both to the previous day and to the defendant\u2019s \u201cusual capabilities.\u201d The defendant sometimes appeared \u201cuncomprehending or hesitant.\u201d He had \u201cdifficulty understanding the questions being asked of him,\u201d and \u201c[ajfter understanding the questions, the defendant. . . had more difficulty than usual in finding and saying the words he wanted to use.\u201d The defendant did not, however, present incriminating testimony or testimony that was inconsistent with his theory of defense; his deficits \u201cwent to the manner and timing of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>testimony . . . not to the substance.\u201d On the basis of the expert testimony presented, the judge found that these deficits had been caused by the defendant\u2019s stroke.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Proceeding from these findings of fact, the motion judge rejected the defendant\u2019s arguments for a new trial based on alleged constitutional errors. The judge determined that (a) the defendant was competent to stand trial at all relevant times; (b) the trial judge conducted an appropriate inquiry into the defendant\u2019s competency, and her decisions on the basis of that inquiry involved no error or abuse of discretion; (c) the defendant executed a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to be present at the final stages of his trial; and (d) the assistance provided by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel was not unconstitutionally ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Nevertheless, the judge concluded that a new trial was warranted \u201cunder the test of Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b) (\u2019justice may not have been done\u2019).\u201d The judge explained that \u201c[t]he jury could have viewed the defendant\u2019s non-responsiveness, claimed lack of memory and requests for repetition of the question [on his second day of testimony] as disingenuous or intentionally evasive and therefore as undermining his credibility.\u201d In closing argument, \u201c[t]he Commonwealth . . . seized upon those difficulties and the defendant\u2019s demeanor as proof of mendacity.\u201d And the trial judge instructed the jury, consistent with the model jury instructions, that a witness\u2019s demeanor on the stand is a factor relevant to assessing his or her credibility. Given that the defense had \u201cturned upon whether the defendant\u2019s testimony created a reasonable doubt for the jury,\u201d the judge concluded that the unusual circumstances gave rise to a \u201cbasic unfairness or potential for injustice,\u201d requiring a new trial. The Commonwealth timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">2. <em>Applicable standards. </em>It is well established that, \u201c[i]n reviewing the denial or grant of a new trial motion, we \u2018examine the motion judge\u2019s conclusion only to determine whether there has been a significant error of law or other abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Wright, 469 Mass. 447, 461 (2014), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weichell, </em>446 Mass. 785, 799 (2006).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A judge\u2019s findings of fact made after an evidentiary hearing \u201cwill be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>accepted if supported by the record.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>443 Mass. 213, 224 (2005), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bernier, </em>359 Mass. 13, 16 (1971). If the motion judge did not preside at the trial, we \u201cregard ourselves in as good a position as the motion judge to assess the trial record.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weichell, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The parties disagree about the standard that the judge should have applied in reviewing the motion for a new trial. As noted, the judge did not find that the defendant\u2019s trial had been infected by error; the defendant does not challenge this determination. The Commonwealth argues that, under these circumstances, a new trial would be warranted only upon a showing of a \u201csubstantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d Alternatively, the Commonwealth suggests that the defendant should be held to the standard applicable when a new trial is sought on the basis of newly discovered evidence. The defendant, on the other hand, contends that the judge was permitted \u201cto consider the essentially case-specific issue of whether there has been a miscarriage of justice on a highly discretionary standard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">For the reasons we describe, our view is essentially that taken by the motion judge and urged by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The point of departure for the resolution of a motion for a new trial is Rule 30 (b) of the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure, which provides that, upon a motion in writing, a judge \u201cmay grant a new trial at any time if it appears that justice may not have been done.\u201d The fundamental principle established by Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b) is that, if it appears that justice may not have been done, the valuable finality of judicial proceedings must yield to our system\u2019s reluctance to countenance significant individual injustices.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Our decisions have crafted a latticework of more specific standards designed to guide judges\u2019 determinations, in various types of situations, as to whether a new trial should be ordered. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>new trial is required if prejudicial constitutional error occurred at trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>467 Mass. 291, 316 (2014); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>385 Mass. 497, 503 (1982). If a motion for a new trial rests on an unpreserved claim of nonconstitutional error, a new trial should be granted only if the defendant demonstrates a \u201csubstantial risk of a miscarriage of justice,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Childs, </em>445 Mass. 529, 530 (2005), namely, \u201ca serious doubt whether the result of the trial might have been different had the error not been made.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>438 Mass. 290, 297 (2002), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Azar, </em>435 Mass. 675, 687 (2002).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Newly discovered evidence warrants a new trial if that evidence \u201ccasts real doubt on the justice of the conviction,\u201d in the sense that the evidence \u201cwould probably have been a real factor in the jury\u2019s deliberations.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cowels, </em>470 Mass. 607, 616-617 (2015), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass. 303, 305-306 (1986).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">These specific standards, and others,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> have not eclipsed the broader principle that a new trial may be ordered if \u201cit appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>that justice may not have been done.\u201d This point is illustrated by our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pring-Wilson, </em>448 Mass. 718 (2007) (Pring-Wilson). The trial judge there excluded probative evidence that the victims had histories of violence, reasoning that the defendant knew nothing of those histories. See <em>id. </em>at 719. This ruling was correct, since we had not yet held, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adjutant, </em>443 Mass. 649, 664 (2005), that judges would thereafter have discretion to admit such evidence. The judge in <em>PringWilson </em>nevertheless ordered a new trial after we decided <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adjutant, supra, </em>stating that, in light of the concerns we recognized there, \u201cthe integrity of the defendant\u2019s trial was compromised.\u201d <em>Pring-Wilson, supra </em>at 720. We affirmed the grant of a new trial; although no error had been made and the defendant presented no newly discovered evidence of his innocence, we could not \u201csay that the judge\u2019s conclusion that \u2018fairness require[d]\u2019 granting the defendant a new trial was an abuse of her broad discretion to see that justice is done\u201d (alteration in original). <em>Id. </em>at 737.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Some guidance as to how judges should decide if \u201cjustice may not have been done,\u201d in the absence of error or new evidence, is provided by our older decision <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lombardi, </em>378 Mass. 612 (1979) <em>(Lombardi). </em>The defendant there suffered from permanent amnesia, which destroyed his ability to remember the events of the crime he was charged with committing. We held that amnesia does not itself render a defendant incompetent to stand trial; but that \u201c[t]he appropriate test ... is whether a defendant can receive, or has received, a fair trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 615. We stressed that \u201c[sjuch a question of fundamental fairness can only be determined on a case by case basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 616. We also provided a nonexhaustive list of factors to be considered, including</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-6\">\u201cthe nature of the crime, the extent to which the prosecution makes a full disclosure of its case . . . , the degree to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>which the evidence establishes the defendant\u2019s guilt, the likelihood that ... [a] defense could be established but for [the defendant\u2019s condition], and the extent and effect of [the condition].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-5\"><em>Id. A </em>judge weighing whether a new trial is warranted in light of these and similar factors must keep in mind that \u201c[a] defendant is entitled to a fair trial but not a perfect one, \u2018for there are no perfect trials.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graves, </em>363 Mass. 863, 872-873 (1973), quoting <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United States, </em>411 U.S. 223, 231-232 (1973). The judge also must focus on the probable effect of the circumstances on the jury\u2019s decision-making, and not on his or her own \u201cpersonal assessment of the trial record,\u201d see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tucceri, </em>412 Mass. 401, 411 (1992), in order to \u201cpreserve[ ] ... the defendant\u2019s right to the judgment of his peers.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">In sum, extraordinary fact patterns can frustrate even meticulous efforts to do justice. Situations that are not encompassed by the more specific standards delineated in our case law nevertheless may require judges to exercise their \u201cbroad discretion to see that justice is done.\u201d <em>Pring-Wilson, </em>448 Mass. at 737. In such cases, judges must determine whether the defendant \u201ccan receive, or has received, a fair trial.\u201d <em>Lombardi, </em>378 Mass. at 615. This determination must be made \u201con a case by case basis,\u201d taking into account a number of specific factors. <em>Id. </em>at 616.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>3. <em>Application. </em>In view of the foregoing principles, we conclude that the motion judge made no significant error of law and that he did not abuse his discretion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>469 Mass. 447, 461 (2014), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weichell, </em>446 Mass. 785, 799 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The motion judge applied essentially the framework we have just described. He stressed that he was relying on the rule that a new trial may be ordered if \u201cjustice may not have been done.\u201d \u201cUltimately,\u201d the judge wrote, \u201cthe [mjotion raises the issue whether justice may not have been done, given the nearly unique facts of this case.\u201d The judge stated that, in addressing this issue, he drew \u201chelpful guidance\u201d from our decision in <em>Lombardi, </em>378 Mass. at 616, in which we asked \u201cwhether a trial of the defendant would be unfair in a due process sense.\u201d The judge did not assume that the defendant is entitled to a perfect trial, but rather to one that is \u201cfundamental[ly] fair[ ].\u201d He noted also that \u201c[i]t is not for a judge to say whether a reasonable doubt exists as to the fact or degree of [the defendant\u2019s] guilt after reweighing the evidence, credibility and arguments in light of what we now know.\u201d These statements correctly describe the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The decision that the judge was required to make was a difficult one. The \u201cnature of the crime\u201d with which the defendant was charged was heinous. See <em>Lombardi, supra. </em>There was no suggestion that the prosecution had provided imperfect \u201cdisclosure of its case,\u201d or that it had engaged in any misconduct whatsoever. See <em>id. </em>Moreover, as the judge recognized, \u201cthe Commonwealth\u2019s case was strong, particularly regarding the defendant\u2019s motive and contacts with Foxworth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The evidence about the nature of the defendant\u2019s arrangement with Foxworth was somewhat weaker, however. The Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>wealth\u2019s most direct evidence on this point was provided by Campbell, the defendant\u2019s coworker, who testified that the defendant eventually told her that \u201ca beating wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d and that (in essence) it would be better if the victim were to die. Campbell was testifying pursuant to a grant of immunity, which might have led the jury to question her credibility. And as cross-examination revealed, she at first told police that the defendant had never said to her that he wanted the victim killed. In fact, Campbell did not inform police that the defendant had wanted Foxworth to kill the victim in any of her first three interviews with police, or in a twenty-two-page document that she wrote, after her third interview, detailing her discussions concerning Foxworth with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The remainder of the evidence presented by the Commonwealth arguably was consistent with the defendant\u2019s own account. The jury could have accepted the defendant\u2019s explanation that his frequent conversations with Foxworth were not about a plot to kill the victim, but rather often concerned Foxworth\u2019s wishes that the defendant help him reconnect with Campbell, or the defendant\u2019s inquiries as to when Foxworth was planning to take action. Similarly, the jury could have believed that, in late December, 2005, and early January, 2006, the defendant had withdrawn from the agreement, as he claimed, and was seeking a refund of the money he had paid Foxworth. Moreover, they could have \u201cbelieve[d] all, some, or none of the testimony of any witness,\u201d including the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>470 Mass. 163, 167 (2014), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gomes, </em>459 Mass. 194, 203 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Under these circumstances, the likelihood that \u201c[a] defense could be established\u201d by the defendant, see <em>Lombardi, </em>378 Mass. at 616, turned on whether the jury would believe the defendant\u2019s testimony that he had not asked Foxworth to kill the victim. Various aspects of a witness\u2019s testimony on the stand, including his demeanor, whether his answers are consistent with prior statements, and whether he appears to be avoiding the questions asked, can affect the jury\u2019s determinations of credibility. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Louraine, </em>390 Mass. 28, 37-38 (1983). We agree with the motion judge\u2019s determination that, in essence, the \u201cextent and effect\u201d of the defendant\u2019s stroke materially affected his chances of mounting a successful defense. See <em>Lombardi, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The defendant\u2019s difficulty understanding questions and communicating answers on the second day of his testimony are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>apparent from the video recording and transcript of that day\u2019s proceedings. A few illustrations among many are reproduced in the margin.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The written transcript attaches the annotation <em>\u201c[sic]\u201d </em>to the defendant\u2019s testimony seventeen times; no such annotations appear in the transcription of his testimony on the previous day, either on direct examination or on cross-examination. Fifteen times, the defendant asked that a question be repeated, or expressed confusion about its meaning; this had happened once on the previous day. Almost three dozen times, the defendant responded to questions by saying that he did not know the answer; this, too, had happened once on the previous day. In other instances, the defendant appeared to answer an entirely different question from the one that had just been posed. Many of these exchanges could have suggested deliberate evasiveness to the jury.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The manner in which the prosecutor framed and delivered her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>questions on cross-examination suggested time and again that, in the prosecutor\u2019s view, the defendant was not answering her questions responsively. On one such occasion, when the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>failed to provide an appropriate answer, the prosecutor said, \u201cWait. Did you testify here yesterday? Do you remember that?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The inference that the pattern of the defendant\u2019s testimony indicated prevarication was pressed more explicitly in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, delivered before the defendant\u2019s stroke was discovered. The prosecutor said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">\u201cLet\u2019s look at the defendant\u2019s testimony. Make no mistake about it, he wasn\u2019t confused by the questions that were being asked him. He couldn\u2019t keep his story straight from one minute to the next. It\u2019s hard to keep track of what you\u2019re saying when you\u2019re just making it up as you go along .... He certainly was able to answer the questions his attorney asked him. Some of the questions I asked him, answers didn\u2019t come easy. To some of them, they didn\u2019t come at all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">The prosecutor\u2019s argument also drew on the defendant\u2019s stated inability to recall important details:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-8\">\u201c[The defendant] didn\u2019t remember when he approached Foxworth. He didn\u2019t remember where he approached Fox-worth. He didn\u2019t remember when he decided and he didn\u2019t remember when he paid the one half up front .... Is that believable?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">The trial judge\u2019s instructions would have permitted the jury to draw the inferences invited by the prosecutor. \u201cIn determining the credibility of a witness,\u201d the judge said, the jury could consider, among other things, \u201cthe demeanor of the witness as the witness spoke to you from the witness stand,\u201d as well as \u201cthe accuracy of the witness\u2019[s] recollection and the degree of intelligence shown by the witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">Again, the defendant\u2019s request for a new trial posed a close question. The Commonwealth had painstakingly presented a powerful case. The damage wrought by the defendant\u2019s stroke was concentrated primarily in the manner and style of his testimony, rather than its substance. Still, we do not think that the motion judge\u2019s conclusion that a new trial is warranted was an abuse of discretion. See <em>L.L. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>470 Mass. 169, 185 n.27 (2014). The fairness of the defendant\u2019s trial was hampered by an extraordinary confluence of factors: the second day of the defendant\u2019s testimony addressed issues that lay at the heart of the case against him. In the words of the motion judge, the symptoms of the defendant\u2019s stroke were severe enough on that day to injure his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number><em>\u201capparent </em>credibility for medical reasons unrelated to his <em>actual </em>credibility.\u201d Yet those symptoms were not of a kind that could have prompted the judge or the attorneys to postpone the remainder of the defendant\u2019s testimony. The defendant\u2019s symptoms also would not have communicated to the jury that his failure to answer questions cogently was the result of a physical impairment. The fact that the defendant had been healthy on his first day of testimony created what the jury could have seen as a suspicious contrast between the defendant\u2019s relative ease in answering his own attorney\u2019s questions and his greater difficulty in answering those posed by the prosecutor. Finally, it is not likely that these weaknesses in the defendant\u2019s testimony went unnoticed by the jury, given that they were highlighted by the prosecutor both during cross-examination and in closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">In the highly unusual circumstances presented, there was no abuse of discretion in the judge\u2019s decision that \u201cit appears that justice may not have been done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">\n<em>Order allowing motion for a new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-9\">Scott Foxworth was subsequently convicted of murder in the first degree in a separate trial.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pring-Wilson, </em>448 Mass. 718, 732 n.14 (2007), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doucette, </em>408 Mass. 454, 455-456 (1990), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>392 Mass. 493, 497 (1984) (\u201cA judge has similar broad discretion to grant a new trial in the interests of justice under both rules\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>447 Mass. 161, 165-169 (2006) (motions brought under either rule may result either in new trial or in reduction of conviction to lesser charged offense).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The Appeals Court has said, in dicta, that \u201c[w]hen the basis alleged in the new trial motion is not prejudicial constitutional error, but some other manifest injustice, then the determination that justice may not have been done equates with a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 631, 636 n.9 (2001), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeFave, </em>430 Mass. 169, 171-174 (1999). But in the decision on which this statement relies, our reason for applying the \u201csubstantial risk of a miscarriage of justice\u201d standard was that the argument presented had been waived by the defendant in earlier proceedings. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeFave, supra </em>at 173-174.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b403-7\">For at least two reasons, we do not think that the standard applicable to motions for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence would be appropriate here. First, the basic facts concerning the defendant\u2019s stroke were known to the judge and the attorneys before the jury had returned a verdict. It is therefore doubtful that the defendant could \u201cestablish that the evidence was unknown . . . and not reasonably discoverable at the time of trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cowels, </em>470 Mass. 607, 616 (2015), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shuman, </em>445 Mass. 268, 271 (2005). Second, the information as to the stroke that the defendant suffered during the course of trial does not itself directly concern the crime of which he stood accused at trial. In that sense, it is quite unlike the type of evidence that ordinarily is examined to see if it might have been \u201ca real factor in the jury\u2019s deliberations.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cowels, supra </em>at 617, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass. 303, 306 (1986). That being said, we do not consider whether, in the singular circumstances of this case, a new trial would have been warranted had the jury been informed of the stroke and its effects on the defendant before they began deliberations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b403-8\">See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>461 Mass. 10, 20-21 (2011) (where Commonwealth withheld exculpatory evidence not specifically requested, applicable standard is \u201cthe same standard used to assess the impact of newly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>discovered evidence\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>445 Mass. 392, 404 (2005), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tucceri, </em>412 Mass. 401, 412 (1992) (where Commonwealth withheld exculpatory evidence that was specifically requested, defendant seeking new trial \u201cneed only demonstrate that a substantial basis exists for claiming prejudice from the nondisclosure\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Comita, </em>441 Mass. 86, 90 (2004), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96-97 (1974) (motion for new trial based on ineffective assistance of counsel must establish \u201cthat the behavior of counsel fell below that of an ordinary, fallible lawyer and that such failing \u2018likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b405-7\"> Judges weighing whether justice may not have been done in those rare cases not governed by more specific standards may, in some instances, find direction in our body of decisions reviewing capital convictions pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. We have noted certain points of similarity between our authority under \u00a7 33E and that of judges deciding motions for postconviction relief. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>427 Mass. 659, 668-669 (1998) (postconviction judge may, and we must, consider all evidence); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>423 Mass. 506, 513 (1996) (both \u00a7 33E and Mass. R. Crim. R 25 [b] [2] provide variety of remedies including reduction of conviction to lesser charged offense). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rolon, </em>438 Mass. 808, 820 (2003), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaulden, </em>383 Mass. 543, 555 (1981) (decision whether to reduce verdict \u201cshould be guided by the same considerations\u201d in both contexts). See also note 7, <em>supra. </em>Importantly, like judges deciding if \u201cjustice may not have been done,\u201d we grant relief under \u00a7 33E not only because of errors at trial, but also \u201cfor any . . . reason that justice may require.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colleran, </em>452 Mass. 417, 431 (2008). In \u00a7 33E appeals, we review every issue for \u2014 at a minimum \u2014 a \u201csubstantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d \u201cUnder that standard, \u2018a new trial is called for unless we are substantially confident that, if the error had not been made, the jury verdict would have been the same.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>468 Mass. 204, 229 (2014), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number><em>Ruddock, </em>428 Mass. 288, 292 n.3 (1998). We never have held that postconviction judges should apply the \u201csubstantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice\u201d standard to determine whether a new trial (or another remedy) is warranted. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marrero, </em>459 Mass. 235, 244 (2011), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>453 Mass. 203, 204-205 (2009) (ineffective assistance of counsel claims are subject, on \u00a7 33E review, to test \u201cmore favorable to a defendant\u201d than that of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, supra </em>at 96, applied by postconviction judges). Nevertheless, where no more specific standard applies, judges\u2019 decisions as to whether justice may not have been done may benefit from consideration of whether it is possible to be \u201csubstantially confident\u201d that \u201cthe jury verdict would have been the same\u201d if not for a problem that occurred at trial, and from our cases answering that question in a variety of situations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The cross-examination of the defendant on that day began as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cI\u2019d like to talk to you about your relationship with Scott Foxworth ....
