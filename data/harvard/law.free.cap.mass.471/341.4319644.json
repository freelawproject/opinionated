In accord with cases relating to other types of license regimes, we conclude that, if police seek a warrant to search such a property for evidence of illegal marijuana possession or cultivation, they must offer information sufficient to provide probable cause to believe the individual is not properly registered under the act to possess or cultivate the suspected substance. In this case, a judge in the District Court allowed the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized by police during a search of the defendant\u2019s property conducted pursuant to a warrant in May of 2013, after the act went into effect. We agree with the motion judge that the affidavit filed in support of the search warrant application demonstrated probable cause that the defendant was cultivating marijuana at the property, but that, in light of the act, the affidavit failed to establish probable cause to believe that the defendant was not authorized to do so and therefore was committing a crime. We affirm the order allowing the motion to suppress.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\"><em>Background. </em>On May 30, 2013, a three-count complaint issued from the Orleans Division of the District Court Department charging the defendant, Josiah H. Canning, with possession with the intent to distribute marijuana, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32C (a); distribution of marijuana, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32C (a); and conspiracy to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>violate the drug laws, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 40.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The complaint\u2019s issuance followed a search of the defendant\u2019s property in Brewster conducted May 30, 2013, pursuant to a search warrant issued on May 29. The affidavit submitted by Detective Christopher Kent of the Yarmouth police department in support of the warrant application recited the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">During the week of May 19,2013, Kent met with a confidential informant, who told Kent that the owner of certain property in Brewster (property) \u2014\u25a0 whom Kent later determined from town records to be the defendant \u2022\u2014 and another male were involved in an indoor \u201cmarijuana grow\u201d operation located at the property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On May 21, Kent and another detective observed the property from a nearby driveway, and noticed that windows of the addition to the house on the property were obscured by dark material, saw an aluminum flexible hose protruding out of one of the windows, and also observed a pickup truck registered to the defendant in front of the house. On May 24 and 28, Kent and one or more additional police officers returned to observe the property; on both occasions, they smelled a strong odor of \u201cfreshly cultivated\u201d marijuana emanating from the house, noticed the aluminum hose coming out of the window of the addition, heard the sound of fans, and, using night vision goggles, saw light emanating from another window. Also on May 28, Kent was provided information from a police officer in another town that that officer previously had observed the defendant and another man purchasing \u201ca large amount of indoor [marijuana] grow materials\u201d from a \u201chydroponic shop\u201d in Foxborough and then loading the materials into an automobile registered to the defendant. On May 29, Kent obtained utility bills relating to electrical service for the property and neighboring homes on Main Street in Brewster. These records revealed that for the previous six months, the average kilowatt usage for three neighboring homes was 542.3 kilowatt hours (kWh), 23.3 kWh, and 246.6 kWh, respectively; the average kilowatt usage for the defendant\u2019s property for the same time period was 3,116.5 kWh. Based on his training and experience, Kent was aware that because marijuana growing operations require different types of electrical equipment, e.g., \u201chigh intensity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>discharge lamps, fluorescent lights, fans, reflectors, irrigation and ventilation equipment such as aluminum flexible hose\u201d to be operating consistently, high usage of electricity \u2014 a \u201cnoticeable increase in kilowatt usage\u201d \u2014 is to be expected.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">When the police executed the search warrant that, based on the affidavit, a judge in the District Court had issued, the defendant was present. Seized during the search, among other items, were seventy marijuana plants, eleven fluorescent industrial lights, an aluminum flexible hose, a digital scale, approximately 1.2 pounds of marijuana, and $2,697. The defendant was placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The defendant filed a motion to suppress the seized evidence, and also to suppress statements he made at the time of the search and his arrest. A different District Court judge allowed the motion in a written memorandum of decision. The judge concluded that the search warrant affidavit \u201cestablished] probable cause that marijuana was being cultivated indoors at the defendant!\u2019]s home,\u201d but concluded in substance that in light of the act, the affidavit failed to establish probable cause that the cultivation was for more than a sixty-day supply of marijuana or that the defendant was not authorized to grow that amount \u2022\u2014 and therefore that the cultivation was illegal. The Commonwealth filed a timely application for leave to file an interlocutory appeal of the judge\u2019s suppression order and motion to stay further proceedings in the case. See Mass. R. Crim. R 15 (a) (2), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996). A single justice of this court allowed the application and reported the case to the Appeals Court. Thereafter, we allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Overview of the act. </em>The voters approved the act as a ballot measure in 2012, and the act went into effect on January 1, 2013. St. 2012, c. 369. Section 1 of the act sets out a statement of purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-8\">\u201cThe citizens of Massachusetts intend that there should be no punishment under state law for qualifying patients, physicians and health care professionals, personal caregivers for patients, or medical marijuana treatment center agents for the medical use of marijuana, as defined herein\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">The term \u201cmedical use of marijuana\u201d is defined in the act as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-10\">\u201c \u2018Medical use of marijuana\u2019 shall mean the acquisition, <em>cultivation, </em>possession, processing (including development <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>of related products such as food, tinctures, aerosols, oils, or ointments), transfer, transportation, sale, distribution, dispensing, or administration of marijuana, for the benefit of qualifying patients in the treatment of debilitating medical conditions, or the symptoms thereof\u2019 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">St. 2012, c. 369, \u00a7 2 (I). The substantive provisions of the act that follow the definitional section first set out the parameters of protection from State prosecution and penalties that the act respectively gives to physicians and health care professionals, qualifying patients and their personal caregivers, and licensed dispensary agents. See <em>id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 3-5.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See also <em>id. </em>\u00a7 6 (A) (\u201cThe lawful possession, cultivation, transfer, transport, distribution, or manufacture of medical marijuana as authorized by this law shall not result in the forfeiture or seizure of any property\u201d). These provisions are followed by a section specifying \u201climitations\u201d of the act, including the following: \u201cNothing in [the act] supersedes Massachusetts law prohibiting the possession, cultivation, transport, distribution, or sale of marijuana for nonmedical purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 7 (E). Thereafter, the act establishes a medical marijuana registration or licensing regime that is to be set up and administered by the Department of Public Health (department), and that covers nonprofit medical marijuana treatment centers, medical marijuana center dispensary agents, and qualifying patients and personal caregivers. See <em>id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 9-12. Under the act, it is clear that the principal source of medical marijuana is intended to be the nonprofit medical marijuana treatment centers, or dispensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>ties, that are to be registered by the department. See <em>id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 2 (H), 9 (B), (C). To that end, the act directed that during the first year the act was in effect, the department \u201cshall\u201d have registered up to thirty-five of these centers, with at least one in every county, and further states that \u201c[i]n the event the [djepartment determines in a future year that the number of treatment centers is insufficient to meet patient needs, the [djepartment shall have the power to increase or modify the number of registered treatment centers.\u201d See <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 9 (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Of particular relevance here are the act\u2019s provisions relating to qualifying patients and personal caregivers as well as to hardship cultivation registrations. A \u201cqualifying patient\u201d is defined as \u201ca person who has been diagnosed by a licensed physician as having a debilitating medical condition.\u201d St. 2012, c. 369, \u00a7 2 (K). The act requires a qualifying patient or a personal caregiver<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to obtain from the department a \u201cregistration card,\u201d which is a personal identification card issued by the department that serves both to \u201cverify that a physician has provided a written certification to the qualifying patient,\u201d and to \u201cidentify for the [djepartment and law enforcement those individuals who are exempt from Massachusetts criminal and civil penalties for conduct pursuant to the medical use of marijuana.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2 (L). See <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 12 (describing application requirements for medical marijuana registration card for qualifying patients and personal caregivers). A qualifying patient or his or her personal caregiver is permitted to possess up to a sixty-day supply of marijuana necessary for the patient\u2019s personal medical use. See <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 4 (A). In addition, a qualifying patient whose access to a licensed medical marijuana treatment center is limited by finances or an inability to travel to a licensed center may obtain a \u201chardship cultivation registration\u201d that allows the patient or the patient\u2019s personal caregiver to cultivate a suffcient number of marijuana plants to produce and maintain a sixty-day supply of marijuana. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 11. The act tasks the department with defining \u201cthe quantity of marijuana that could reasonably be presumed to be a sixty-day supply for qualifying patients.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 8.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>The act provides that the department was to issue regulations to govern implementation of all the registration provisions in the act. St. 2012, c. 369, \u00a7 13. These regulations were to be published within 120 days of the act\u2019s effective date, May 1, 2013. The act also provides, however, that \u201c[u]ntil the approval of final regulations, written certification by a physician shall have constituted a registration card for a qualifying patient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 2 (N) (definition of \u201cwritten certification\u201d). Additionally, until final regulations were in place, \u201cthe written recommendation of a qualifying patient\u2019s physician shall have constituted a limited [i.e., hardship] cultivation registration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 ll.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The department issued its final medical marijuana regulations on May 8, 2013. 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 725.000 (2013). But of significance to the present case, \u00a7 725.015 of these regulations, which defines the registration requirements for a qualifying patient, provides that if a qualifying patient received an initial written certification signed by a physician before the department was accepting registration applications, \u201cthe initial certification will remain valid until the application for the registration card is approved or denied by the [department.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The same holds true for limited cultivation registrations: a qualifying patient who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>received written certification from a physician is entitled to continue to use that written certification as a hardship cultivation registration \u201cuntil the application for the hardship cultivation registration card is approved or denied by the [department.\u201d 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 725.035(L) (2013). The parties do not dispute that at the time of the search of the property, the department was not yet approving or denying any applications for registration, and there were no registered medical marijuana treatment centers in operation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, a qualified physician\u2019s written recommendation, undocumented in any database, sufficed as both a medical marijuana registration card and a limited medical marijuana cultivation registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">2. <em>Search warrant and application. </em>\u201cOur inquiry as to the sufficiency of the search warrant application always begins and ends with the four corners of the affidavit. . . . The magistrate considers a question of law: whether the facts presented in the affidavit and the reasonable inferences therefrom constitute probable cause. . . . [W]e determine whether, based on the affidavit in its entirety, the magistrate had a substantial basis to conclude that a crime had been committed, . . . and that the items described in the warrant were related to the criminal activity and probably in the place to be searched\u201d (quotations and citations omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. O\u2019Day, 440 Mass. 296, 297-298 (2003). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Donahue, 430 Mass. 710, 711-712 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">The Commonwealth contends that Kent\u2019s affidavit established probable cause for the search because, as the motion judge concluded, the affidavit provided probable cause to believe that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>the defendant was engaged in cultivating marijuana at the property, and in the Commonwealth\u2019s view all-or-any cultivation of marijuana remains illegal even under the act. To the extent that the act permits a limited class of properly licensed or registered persons to grow marijuana, the argument continues, the existence of a license or registration is an affirmative defense for a defendant charged with unlawful cultivation to raise at trial \u2014 the Commonwealth is not obligated to disprove such a status in order to conduct a search at the outset of an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">We disagree. Although as a general matter, marijuana cultivation is a crime, see G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32C <em>(a); Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>464 Mass. 773, <em>777 </em>(2013), and the act specifies generally that it remains so, see St. 2012, c. 369, \u00a7 7 (E), the Commonwealth is incorrect that the act has not effected any change in the statutory and regulatory landscape relevant to establishing probable cause for a search targeting such cultivation. What \u00a7 7 (E) states is that nothing in the act \u201csupersedes Massachusetts law prohibiting the . . . cultivation ... of marijuana <em>for nonmedical </em>purposes\u201d (emphasis added). Under the act, cultivation of marijuana is expressly permitted if a person or entity is properly registered to do so, and the cultivation does not exceed the amount necessary to yield a sixty-day supply of medical marijuana. See St. 2012, c. 369, \u00a7\u00a7 9 (B), (D), 11. See also <em>id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 4-6. As previously stated, when the search at issue here took place, the act was not fully implemented; no marijuana treatment centers were operating; and therefore, pursuant to the act\u2019s express provisions, see <em>id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 11, 13, <em>every </em>person who was certified as a qualifying patient or the patient\u2019s personal caregiver was authorized to cultivate a sufficient quantity of marijuana to produce a sixty-day supply \u2014 presumptively ten ounces.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">In these circumstances, as the motion judge suggested, our cases involving searches for firearms that may be legally possessed with a license but are illegal in the absence of one provide an appropriate analytic framework. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toole, </em>389 Mass. 159, 163 (1983).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nowells, </em>390 Mass. 621, 627 (1983) (search warrant affidavit did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>establish probable cause for search of defendant\u2019s apartment for illegal firearms where informants only indicated they had seen guns there: \u201cThe ownership or possession of a handgun [or a rifle] is not a crime and standing alone creates no probable cause\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>407 Mass. 178, 181, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 951 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>361 Mass. 868 (1972). As these cases indicate, although firearms cannot legally be carried without a license to carry, see G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(a), </em>in the absence of any evidence beyond the \u201cunadorned fact,\u201d <em>Couture, supra, </em>that the defendant was carrying a gun, there was no probable cause to suspect a crime was being committed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 956, 956-957 (1981) (defendant convicted of storing dynamite without license; conviction reversed where search warrant authorizing search of defendant\u2019s trailer for dynamite was not based on probable cause: \u201cThe observation of a box containing [dynamite] blasting caps, without more, to indicate that their storage was unlicensed, does not provide probable cause for entry into the [defendant\u2019s] trailer\u201d where no circumstances set out in affidavit indicated blasting caps were, or were reasonably likely to be, unlicensed).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>The Commonwealth again misses the mark in seeking to distinguish these cases and arguing that the existence of a registration card or written certification, like the existence of a license, constitutes an affirmative defense that the defendant himself is obliged to raise in the first instance \u2014 at trial. A license does constitute an affirmative defense at trial to be raised by the defendant. See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 7.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gouse, </em>461 Mass. 787, 804-808 (2012); <em>Couture, </em>407 Mass. at 181-182; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>372 Mass. 403, 405-406 (1977). But this case is not about defenses at trial; the issue is probable cause to conduct an investigatory search. At the trial of a case in which the existence or nonexistence of a license defines whether the charged conduct was legal or instead a crime, as <em>Couture </em>explains, the defendant \u201chas every opportunity to respond\u201d by producing the license authorizing his conduct, and in the absence of the defendant\u2019s doing so, it is not unfair for the jury to presume in accordance with c. 278, \u00a7 7, that the defendant did not have a license. <em>Couture, supra </em>at 182. Accord <em>Gouse, supra </em>at 806. At the time of a search, however, such a defendant is in a very different position: the police arrive, armed with (among other things) a warrant authorizing the search; the defendant has no right to object or respond, and indeed may not even be present. Cf. <em>Couture, supra </em>at 182-183 (contrasting position of defendant at trial with defendant\u2019s position when confronted by police stopping defendant\u2019s truck, removing him from it at gunpoint, and conducting warrantless search of truck to locate pistol police suspected would be present). Cf. also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Landry, </em>438 Mass. 206, 211 (2002) (charge of unlawful possession of hypodermic needle; contrasting defendant\u2019s burden to raise affirmative defense of license at trial with question whether probable cause existed for unlawful possession at time of arrest).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The firearms and other license cases just discussed govern the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>result here. Beginning with the initial statement of purpose, the act\u2019s provisions make it abundantly clear that its intent is to protect the lawful operation of the medical marijuana program established by the legislation from all aspects of criminal prosecution and punishment, including search and seizure of property as part of a criminal investigation. See St. 2012, c. 369, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3-6. The act\u2019s medical marijuana program is structured as a licensing or registration system, and expressly contemplates the lawful possession, cultivation, and distribution of marijuana for medical purposes by a number of different individuals (and certain nonprofit entities), as long as they are registered to do so. In light of the statutory and regulatory framework created by the act, a search warrant affidavit setting out facts that simply establish probable cause to believe the owner is growing marijuana on the property in question, without more, is insufficient to establish probable cause to believe that the suspected cultivation is a crime. Missing are facts indicating that the person owning or in control of the property is not or probably not registered to cultivate the marijuana at issue.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Detective Kent\u2019s affidavit filed in support of the search warrant in this case did not contain any information at all addressing whether the defendant was or was not registered as a qualifying patient or personal caregiver to grow the marijuana the police reasonably suspected was growing on the property.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Nor, as the motion judge observed, did it contain other facts or qualified opinions that might supply an alternate basis to establish the necessary probable cause to believe the cultivation was unlawful. See note 15, <em>supra. </em>As such, the affidavit failed to establish prob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>able cause for the search.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">We disagree with the Commonwealth that the result we reach imposes an impossible burden on police to search for elusive and difficult-to-locate information about whether a person suspected of growing marijuana is registered to do so. Although not available in 2013 when the search here was conducted, we assume that with the introduction of the electronic registration system, see note 10, <em>supra, </em>there is or soon will be available to law enforcement officers an accessible list of \u201cthe persons issued medical marijuana registration cards\u201d as provided in \u00a7 15 of the act.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Moreover, as we have suggested (see note 15, <em>supra), </em>information independent of registration status may also be presented to establish probable cause concerning the suspected unlawful cultivation of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The order allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-8\">The measure was placed before the voters at the Statewide election held November 6, 2012, pursuant to art. 48, The Initiative, Part V, \u00a7 1, amended by art. 81, \u00a7 2, of the Amendments of the Massachusetts Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b356-9\">We acknowledge the amicus briefs submitted by Daniel J.

The empty holster and ammunition found on the defendant certainly created probable cause to believe that there was a gun in the cab. But carrying a .45 caliber revolver is not necessarily a crime. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>possible crime was carrying a gun without a license to carry firearms, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(a). </em>However, the police did not learn that the defendant had no firearm identification card until after the search. They apparently never asked the defendant whether he had a license to carry a firearm\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toole, </em>389 Mass. 159, 163 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b364-6\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gouse, </em>461 Mass. 787 (2012), a case on which the Commonwealth relies, is inapposite. In <em>Gouse, </em>the defendant attacked the victim, his former girl friend, on the street and left the scene; the investigating police were told by bystanders as well as the defendant\u2019s father that he might be armed; the police also had information that he had been released recently from prison, and had been observed armed with a weapon and dealing \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine. <em>Id. </em>at 788, 790-791. On the same day as the attack of the victim, the defendant was stopped by the police while driving in a vehicle, removed from the vehicle, and arrested, and the vehicle was impounded. <em>Id. </em>at 791. The police thereafter, during a warrantless search of the vehicle, found a gun in a bag that had been placed in the trunk of the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 791-792. Before trial, the defendant unsuccessfully moved to suppress evidence of the gun, but <em>not </em>on the ground that probable cause did not exist to believe he was not licensed to carry the weapon. See <em>id. </em>at 792-794. (Indeed, such an argument would have been highly problematic, given that the defendant at the time, in the court\u2019s words, was \u201ca fleeing felon.\u201d See <em>id. </em>at 794. A felon, by definition, may not be licensed to carry a firearm. See G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 <em>[d] </em>[i].) The defendant in <em>Gouse </em>did raise a challenge related to the license issue, but the challenge concerned the allocation of the burden of proof between the defendant and the Commonwealth at trial concerning the existence of a license.

For example, except for registered medical marijuana treatment centers, it remains unlawful to cultivate marijuana for sale. Facts indicating that a confidential informant recently purchased marijuana from the owner of the property where the cultivation operation is suspected to be taking place would likely supply the requisite probable cause to search that property for evidence of unlawful cultivation, as would information that police recently had observed marijuana plants growing on the property and that, in the opinion of a properly qualified affiant, the number of plants exceeded the quantity necessary to grow a sixty-day supply of ten ounces.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b366-8\">From start to finish, the affidavit reads as though the act did not exist.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b367-8\">In arguing against this conclusion, the Commonwealth relies heavily on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>464 Mass. 773, 775-778 (2013). The reliance is misplaced. In <em>Palmer, </em>we considered what impact, if any, the decriminalization of possession of one ounce or less of marijuana, a ballot measure approved by the voters in 2008, had on G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32C (a), which defines the offense of cultivation of marijuana. See <em>Palmer, supra </em>at 775. We concluded that the decriminalization measure did not affect the cultivation statute, and that cultivation of marijuana of one ounce or less remained a crime. <em>Id. </em>at 774, <em>777, </em>779. But the events giving rise to the criminal charges at issue in <em>Palmer </em>occurred in 2010, see <em>id. </em>at 774, no issue concerning the medical marijuana act, passed in 2012, was raised in <em>Palmer, </em>and the court did not consider the relationship of the medical marijuana act to \u00a7 32C <em>(a) </em>in any respect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Section 15 of the act states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-10\">\u201cThe department shall maintain a confidential list of the persons issued medical marijuana registration cards.
