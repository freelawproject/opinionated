The recommended sentence pursuant to the negotiated disposition was imposed, and defendant was sentenced to three years probation including the service of 364 days in the county jail as a condition of probation and to undergo anger management and counseling. Defendant slapped his girlfriend\u2019s four year old child leaving \u201cred marks\u201d on his face, and was also ordered to have \u201cno contact\u201d with the victim nor the children in the victim\u2019s family except as ordered by the Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">Defendant received 207 days of jail credits and has served his custodial sentence. We find no basis on which to modify the sentence. <em>See State v. Bienick, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>601, 607-08, 985 A.2d 1251 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">The real issue defendant advances on this appeal is the denial of his request that the plea or his factual basis for the plea, as acknowledged at sentencing, not be admissible in any subsequent proceeding. Specifically he contends that it should not be used against him by DYFS with respect to visitation or other proceedings that are pending.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\"><em>Rule </em>3:9-2 provides in part that \u201c[fjor good cause shown, the court may, in accepting a plea of guilty, order that such plea not be evidential in any civil proceeding.\u201d That provision has been in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>the Rules since the 1969 revision, but there is no commentary as to its intended scope. <em>See B. </em>3:5-2 (1953); <em>Proposed Revision of the Rules Governing the Courts of the State of New Jersey, R. </em>3:9\u2014 2, 211-13 (1966). The <em>Rule </em>governs guilty pleas entered in the Superior Court and on indictable offenses in the municipal court. <em>See State v. Tsilimidos, </em>364 <em>N.J.Super. </em>454, 458-60, 837 A.2d 373 (App.Div.2003); <em>R. </em>3:1-1. <em>See also State v. Haulaway, Inc., </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>506, 508, 608 A.2d 964 (App.Div.1992) (purpose of <em>R. </em>3:9-2 is to avoid unnecessary trial of defendants who fear use of their plea).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Defendant is concerned that DYFS may endeavor to use the plea against him, as a statement of a party in DYFS proceedings, or by the affirmative use of collateral estoppel, in some Title 9, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21 to -8.73, or Title 30, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-1 to -40, action, and perhaps by others in actions before the Family Part. <em>See generally, Eaton v. Eaton, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>628, 643-45, 575 A.2d 858 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">As we have said in <em>State v. Tsilimidos, supra, </em>364 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 458-60, 837 A.2d 373, under <em>Rule </em>3:9-2, the defendant has the burden to show a \u201creason sufficient to warrant the granting of his application.\u201d <em>See also State v. LaResca, </em>267 <em>N.J.Super. </em>411, 421, 631 A.2d 986 (App.Div.1993). Here, no reason was given or adequately explained to justify the relief. Moreover, we do not deem a Title 9 or Title 30 action commenced by DYFS to be a \u201ccivil proceeding\u201d for which the rule of preclusion was intended to apply. An action commenced by DYFS is an action by the State against a parent or guardian designed to protect the best interests of the child; it is not an action for money damages or other traditional relief in a \u201ccivil proceeding.\u201d The \u201cbest interests\u201d of a child, and the State\u2019s parens patriae obligation to protect children, simply cannot be compromised by the exclusion of the plea colloquy entered as a matter of public record in open court. Of course, the admission of the plea, when not subject to the \u201cnon-evidential\u201d preclusion, is subject to the New Jersey Rules of Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>There is no suggestion in this case that such a preclusion was part of defendant\u2019s negotiated plea, so defendant has no right to withdraw his plea. <em>State v. LaResca, supra, </em>267 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 421, 631 A.2d 986.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b153-12\"> Defendant\u2019s girlfriend delivered their daughter after this assault.
