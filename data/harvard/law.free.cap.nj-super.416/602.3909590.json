In addition, where an employee now claims that she has waived her privilege as to her \u201cpersonnel records\u201d but did not raise the issue before the Council, we remand this matter to the Council to determine whether the employee waived the confidentiality under the \u201cpersonnel records\u201d exception or whether there are countervailing concerns or policies that would preclude release of such records. We affirm in part, and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Complainant Joan McGee appeals from a final decision of respondent Council of September 30, 2009, denying her request for reconsideration of the Council\u2019s determination that certain records of custodian Township of East Amwell (East Amwell) were exempt from disclosure under OPRA. Specifically, McGee seeks access to twelve e-mails circulated among a group of individuals affiliated with the East Amwell municipal government.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">These are the relevant facts. East Amwell Township is organized as a township with a five-member Township Committee pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>40A:63-1 to -9. By ordinance, East Amwell created the position of Township Administrator, who manages the township\u2019s personnel, and a Planning Board, which oversees the township\u2019s \u201cphysical development.\u201d <em>E. Amwell, N.J.Code </em>\u00a7\u00a7 24-20 (creating and detailing the duties of the Township Administrator), 92-14 (creating and explaining the duties of the Planning Board). The term of a Planning Board member runs from January 1 of the year in which the appointment was made. <em>E. Amwell N.J.Code </em>\u00a7 92-14(B)(2); <em>see also N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-23(c). McGee was employed by East Amwell as \u201cplanning board administrator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Apparently McGee has had an ongoing dispute with various individuals who were office holders or appointees in East Amwell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>in 2006. The specific nature of the dispute and the facts relevant to the friction between the parties are not a part of the record. We do glean from the facts a dissatisfaction with McGee\u2019s conduct; however, the details of the dispute are not relevant to our ultimate determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">McGee filed work-related complaints with both the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the courts of New Jersey. As a result, certain e-mails were circulated among various township officials, employees or appointees. These e-mails form the gravamen of the dispute on appeal. The individuals who either authored, were the recipients of or were the subjects of these e-mails include Richard Cushing, the township attorney; Tim Matheny, the township administrator; Donald Reilly, a member of both the Township Committee and the Planning Board; Larry Tatsch, a member of the Township Committee<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; and Barbara Wolfe, the chair of the Planning Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">On October 23, 2007, McGee filed a \u201crequest for access to government records\u201d with East Amwell demanding the record of a Township Committee meeting in October 2007 and all e-mails sent after December 31, 2006, \u201cbetween/among Barbara Wolfe ... and Tim Matheny, Don Reilly, Larry Tatsch and any other member of [the Township Committee] and Richard Cushing, Esq.\u201d Theresa Stahl, East Amwell\u2019s municipal clerk, responded to McGee\u2019s request by telephone on November 1, 2007, and informed her that the requested records were ready for review. Several days later, on November 6, 2007, McGee met with Stahl to view and obtain copies of the approved correspondence. Stahl confirmed this meeting in a letter dated November 9, 2007, reiterating that she informed McGee at their meeting that some of the requested emails were protected by the attorney-client privilege. On November 27, 2007, Stahl issued a written \u201cgovernment records request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>response\u201d granting access to seven additional e-mails and denying McGee access to any privileged attorney-client communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Following this rejection, on December 6, 2007, McGee filed a \u201cdenial of access complaint\u201d with the GRC requesting review of East Amwell\u2019s decision. McGee alleged that (1) Cushing, Mathe-ny and Reilly were \u201cwillfully withholding\u201d their communications with Wolfe and should be sanctioned; (2) Wolfe\u2019s communications were not protected because she was not a township official after December 31, 2006; (3) no privilege existed between Wolfe and Cushing because they never shared an attorney-client relationship; (4) no attorney-client privilege protected communications between Wolfe and Matheny because neither was an attorney; (5) any privilege between township officials and Cushing was waived by the inclusion of Wolfe on their e-mails; and (6) Reilly violated state law by failing to maintain copies of all documents pertaining to official township business.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Responding to these claims, Cushing, as township attorney, asserted that he had been designated to advise township officials, including those specified in McGee\u2019s request, regarding a lawsuit that McGee had filed against the municipal government and several individuals therein. As a result, Cushing claimed to represent all parties designated in the requested e-mails. In addition, Cushing contended that the undisclosed e-mails were protected under the OPRA\u2019s \u201cadvisory, consultative, and deliberative exemption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">On April 29, 2009, the GRC\u2019s executive director, Catherine Starghill, issued her findings and recommendations. Starghill found that the custodian\u2019s failure to provide McGee with a written response within seven business days was \u201cdeemed\u201d a denial. More importantly, Starghill recommended that the GRC conduct an in camera review of the twenty remaining undisclosed e-mails to determine whether any privilege applied. That same day, the GRC voted unanimously to adopt Starghill\u2019s findings and recommendations, ordering East Amwell to deliver the withheld e-mails for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Starghill completed her findings and recommendations on nineteen <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> undisclosed e-mails on August 4, 2009. In an interim order dated August 11, 2009, the GRC unanimously adopted these findings, making the determinations below.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-5\">1. The first e-mail was sent by Wolfe to Cushing at 10:04 a.m. on January 2, 2007. The Council ordered disclosure of this message with all personal information redacted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-6\">2. The second e-mail was sent by Wolfe to Cushing at 9:40 p.m. on January 12, 2007.

The nineteenth e-mail was sent by Reilly to Wolfe at 8:30 p.m. on January 25, 2007. The Council ordered it disclosed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-14\">Following notice of the GRC\u2019s decision, McGee moved for reconsideration, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:105-2.10, asserting mistake and extraordinary circumstances. In support of her motion, McGee focused on Wolfe\u2019s status as a private citizen at the time of the emails. Because Wolfe\u2019s official position terminated on December 31, 2006, McGee argued, her inclusion on communications with the township attorney resulted in a waiver of the attorney-client privilege. Moreover, as an ordinary resident, Wolfe could neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>participate in any advisory, consultative or deliberative discussions within the government, nor affect personnel matters in any way. According to McGee, any e-mail involving Wolfe constituted a nonofficial conversation analogous to a private citizen\u2019s complaints at a public meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">East Amwell opposed McGee\u2019s motion, stating that she \u201cmerely repealed] the arguments she made in her Denial of Access Complaint without demonstrating either an extraordinary circumstance or a mistake by the Council____\u201d East Amwell also challenged McGee\u2019s characterization of Wolfe as simply a \u201crandom resident,\u201d highlighting Wolfe\u2019s \u201cfirst hand knowledge of the issues and the people\u201d relevant to the time period discussed in the emails. Moreover, East Amwell claimed, Wolfe\u2019s former position made her \u201ccentral to the Township\u2019s defense\u201d against McGee\u2019s previous lawsuit, rendering her inclusion in privileged attorney-client communications \u201ccompletely appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The GRC denied McGee\u2019s request for reconsideration. Citing <em>Cummings v. Bahr, </em>295 <em>N.J.Super. </em>374, 685 A.2d 60 (App.Div. 1996), the Council held that McGee \u201cfailed to establish ... that 1) the GRC\u2019s decision is based upon a \u2018palpably incorrect or irrational basis\u2019 or 2) it is obvious that the GRC did not consider the significance of probative, competent evidence, and rendered an arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable decision.... \u201d More specifically, the Council found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-8\">[T]he personnel matter which is the subject of the requested e-mails obviously began while Ms. Wolfe was chair of the Planning Board, involved the Planning Board matters and required Ms. Wolfe\u2019s continued involvement due to anticipated or on-going litigation including on-going negotiations with the Complainant\u2019s attorney regarding said personal matter. Therefore, it is conceivable that Ms. Wolfe\u2019s participation in the requested e-mails is essential given her official position which had only ended one month or less before the creation of the requested e-mails.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">McGee filed a notice of appeal on November 5, 2009, seeking review of the GRC\u2019s decision to deny her access to e-mail messages nos. 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 15.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Following the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>perfection of this appeal, we requested that the GRC provide us with a copy of the disputed records for our in camera review. The documents were provided to us, reviewed and remain under seal.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">On appeal, McGee asserts that (1) the Council relied on a nonexistent exception for \u201cpersonnel matters\u201d; (2) the OPRA exception for \u201cpersonnel records\u201d protects only those documents found in a personnel file; (3) the OPRA exception for \u201cpersonnel records\u201d may be waived by the employee who is the subject of the requested documents; and (4) neither the \u201cpersonnel\u201d nor the \u201cadvisory, consultative, or deliberative\u201d exception applies to communications to or from a private resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Our standard review, critical to our consideration of the issues raised on appeal, focuses our analysis. We will \u201caccord deference to final agency actions, reversing those actions if they are \u2018arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable or [if the action] is not supported by substantial credible evidence in the record as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>N.J. Soc\u2019y for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Agric., </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>366, 384-85, 955 A.2d 886 (2008) (quoting <em>Henry v. Rahway State Prison, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>571, 579-80, 410 A.2d 686 (1980)) (alteration in original). The New Jersey Supreme Court has held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">[A]n appellate court ordinarily should not disturb an administrative agency\u2019s determinations or findings unless there is a clear showing that (1) the agency did not follow the law; (2) the decision was arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable; or (3) the decision was not supported by substantial evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-7\"><em>In re Virtua-West Jersey Hosp. Voorhees, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>413, 422, 945 A.2d 692 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Furthermore, when an agency is authorized to interpret and apply a statute, it must do so \u201cin a manner that is reasonable, not arbitrary or capricious, and not contrary to the evident purpose of the statute, that interpretation should be upheld, irrespective of how the forum court would interpret the same statute in the absence of regulatory history.\u201d <em>Blecker v. State, </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>434, 442, 733 A.2d 540 (App.Div.1999), <em>quoted in Reck v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>345 <em>N.J.Super. </em>443, 448, 785 A.2d 476 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>(App.Div.2001), <em>aff'd, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>54, 811 A.2d 458 (2002). The GRC is authorized to interpret OPRA, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-7(b), and this deferential standard has been applied to its holdings. <em>See Fisher v. Div. of Law, </em>400 <em>N.J.Super. </em>61, 70, 946 A.2d 53 (App.Div.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The GRC is an administrative agency created to, among other things, adjudicate disputes concerning access to public records under OPRA. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-7(b) (\u201cThe Government Records Council shall ... receive, hear, review and adjudicate a complaint filed by any person concerning a denial of access to a government record by a records custodian.... \u201d). A party aggrieved by a custodian\u2019s decision to withhold requested records has the option to seek review of the custodian\u2019s decision in either the Superior Court or the GRC. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-6. The Council is empowered to render decisions \u201cas to whether the record which is the subject of the complaint is a government record which must be made available for public access____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-7(e). The Council must \u201cprovide reasons for its rulings on each document.\u201d <em>Paff v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>346, 355, 878 A.2d 31 (App. Div.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">The GRC has the authority to review requested documents in camera in order to determine whether they were properly withheld. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-7(f) (\u201c[T]he council may go into closed session during that portion of any proceeding during which the contents of a contested record would be disclosed.\u201d); <em>see also Paff, supra, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super </em>at 355, 878 A.2d 31. Such review is not required for every denial, but the Council should conduct in camera review \u201cwhen necessary to resolution of the appeal.\u201d <em>Paff, supra, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 355, 878 A.2d 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">McGee claims that the GRC erred by relying upon a \u201cpersonnel matters\u201d exception to OPRA. McGee asserts that the Act only exempts \u201cpersonnel records.\u201d According to McGee, the Council denied her access to government records based on an erroneous interpretation of OPRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>We deem it irrelevant that the GRC used the phrase \u201cpersonnel matters\u201d instead of \u201cpersonnel record,\u201d particularly because the Council cited to the proper statute in its decision. This inadvertent reference had no impact on the substance of the GRC\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">McGee\u2019s assertion that the term \u201cpersonnel record\u201d encompasses only those documents that would be contained in a personnel file merits closer examination. She claims that because \u201c[n]one of the requested e-mails were contained in [her] personnel record or personnel file,\u201d they cannot fall under the umbrella of the \u201cpersonnel records\u201d exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">OPRA defines \u201cgovernment record\u201d very broadly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-6\">\u201cGovernment record\u201d or \u201crecord\u201d means any paper, written or printed book, document, drawing, map, plan, photograph, microfilm, data processed or image processed document, information stored or maintained electronically or by sound-recording or in a similar device, or any copy thereof, that has been made, maintained or kept on file in the course of his or its official business by any officer, commission, agency or authority of the State or of any political subdivision thereof, including subordinate boards thereof, or that has been received in the course of his or its official business by any such officer, commission, agency, or authority of the State or of any political subdivision thereof, including subordinate boards thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-7\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.1J</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">As is the case with other forms of communication, e-mails fall within the scope of this expansive provision. <em>See, e.g., Wilson v. Brown, </em>404 <em>N.J.Super. 557, 563, </em>962 A.2d 1122 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>473, 968 A.2d 1189 (2009) (considering an OPRA request for e-mails); <em>Fisher v. Div. of Law, supra, </em>400 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 66, 946 A.2d 53 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">However, this broad definition is tempered by a number of exceptions within OPRA itself. One such provision excludes \u201cpersonnel or pension records,\u201d stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-10\">[T]he personnel or pension records of any individual in the possession of a public agency, including but not limited to records relating to any grievance filed by or against an individual, shall not be considered a government record and shall not be made available for public access____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-12\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>47UA-10.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>While the statute limits this exception, it does not define precisely what information is covered by the phrase \u201cpersonnel record.\u201d Although case law interpreting this provision is sparse, courts have tended to favor the protection of employee confidentiality.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">For example, in <em>North Jersey Media Group, Inc. v. Bergen County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, </em>405 <em>N.J.Super. </em>386, 964 A.2d 842 (App.Div.2009), we considered a newspaper\u2019s request for information regarding the outside employment of prosecutor\u2019s office employees. The trial court in that case determined that requests to engage in outside employment were so similar to the documents contained in personnel files that they deserved similar protection. <em>Id. </em>at 389, 964 A.2d 842. We affirmed, noting, \u201cThe dangers inherent in disclosure of confidential information for public dissemination are so obvious that we are compelled to conclude that the privacy interests of [prosecutorialj employees prevail over the public interest in disclosing the information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 391, 964 A.2d 842.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Similarly, in <em>Michelson v. Wyatt, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>611, 880 A.2d 458 (App.Div.2005), we considered a request that demanded, among other things, documentation of individual insurance claims filed by employees of the city of Plainfield. <em>Id. </em>at 615-16, 880 A.2d 458. The custodian refused to provide any individualized information, and the trial court dismissed the requestor\u2019s ensuing claim. <em>Id. </em>at 616-17, 880 A.2d 458. Affirming this decision, we held that the requestor\u2019s right to access was outweighed by the employees\u2019 right to privacy. <em>Id. </em>at 625, 880 A.2d 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>McGee\u2019s record request is far narrower than those considered in <em>North Jersey Media Group </em>and <em>Michelson. </em>She has not requested detailed information about a large group of public employees. Rather, she demands access to communications that she suspects concern her own job performance. Nonetheless, these communications implicate important privacy concerns. While a public employee\u2019s conduct is inherently open to a degree of public observation, it is reasonable for a public employee to expect conversations about his or her performance by his or her superiors to remain confidential. This applies regardless of whether any memorialization of these discussions physically enters an employee\u2019s personnel record.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Moreover, under our deferential standard of review, we give weight to the GRC\u2019s interpretation of OPRA. <em>See, e.g., Blecker v. State, supra, </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 442, 733 A.2d 540. The GRC\u2019s determination that the \u201cpersonnel records\u201d exception is not limited to the items included in a personnel file is reasonable and does not run contrary to the purposes of OPRA Despite the Act\u2019s broad objective of promoting disclosure, the balance tips in favor of protecting private personnel information regarding a particular employee. We find no error here.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">McGee also avers that even if the communications in question are \u201cpersonnel records,\u201d East Amwell may not withhold them once she has waived her right to confidentiality. Regarding all twelve e-mails withheld based on the \u201cpersonnel records\u201d exception, McGee states that she waives any such right. Furthermore, McGee claims that any personnel-related discussion of her required the use of a <em>\u201cRice </em>notice,\u201d which she never received. Therefore, McGee reasons, \u201cBy sending e-mails about me, and then declaring that they are a personnel matter which is exempt from disclosure, East [Amwell] Township Officials have denied me ... my right to due process, and have violated the public policy of this state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">As a preliminary matter, McGee\u2019s reliance on <em>\u201cRice </em>notices\u201d is misplaced. Those documents refer to the Senator Byron M. Baer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Open Public Meetings Act<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (OPMA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:4-6 to -21, and <em>Rice v. Union County Regional High School Board of Education, </em>155 <em>N.J.Super. </em>64, 382 A.2d 386 (App.Div.1977). The thrust of OPMA is that \u201cno public body shall hold a meeting unless adequate notice thereof has been provided to the public.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:4-9(a). \u201cMeeting\u201d is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">[Ajny gathering whether corporeal or by means of communication equipment, which is attended by, or open to, all of the members of a public body, held with the intent, on the part of the members of the body present, to discuss or act as a unit upon the specific public business of that body. Meeting does not mean or include any such gathering (1) attended by less than an effective majority of the members of a public body, or (2) attended by or open to all the members of three or more similar public bodies at a convention or similar gathering.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-8\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>10:4-8(b)J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">In <em>Rice, </em>we considered a portion of OPMA allowing a public body to discuss personnel matters in a closed session unless all affected employees requested an open meeting. 155 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 70-71, 382 A.2d 386 (considering <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:4-12(b)). We held that this provision obliged the public body to give affected employees adequate notice of the discussion, so that they would have the opportunity to \u201cmake a decision on whether they desire a public discussion and ... prepare and present an appropriate request in writing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 73, 382 A.2d 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">OPMA does not apply here. By its very terms, that act excludes any gathering \u201cattended by less than an effective majority of the members of a public body____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:4-8(b). The conversation here included, at most, three of the nine members of the Planning Board (Reilly, Tatsch and Gardner) and two of the five members of the Township Committee (Reilly and Tatsch), neither of which would constitute an \u201ceffective majority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">However, OPRA does include a provision relevant to McGee\u2019s claim. One caveat to the \u201cpersonnel records\u201d exception is that \u201cpersonnel or pension records of any individual shall be accessible ... when authorized by an individual in interest____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>47:1A-10. McGee asserts that she has expressly waived her right to confidentiality. Moreover, the act of filing a request for records containing her own personnel information may constitute an implied waiver. Regardless of whether this waiver is express or implied, we are concerned that a provision intended to protect public employees can be utilized to justify denying them access to information concerning their employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">The GRC\u2019s interpretation runs contrary to the express legislative policy of OPRA, <em>see Fisher v. Div. of Law, supra, </em>400 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 70, 946 A.2d 53, which includes the \u201cpersonnel records\u201d exception purely to protect public employees. McGee may be entitled to access those four e-mails that the GRC has determined concern purely \u201cpersonnel matters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Unfortunately, this argument was not raised by McGee before the GRC. We deem it appropriate to remand to afford East Amwell the opportunity to present arguments against waiver before the GRC. On remand, the GRC shall determine whether McGee effectively waived the confidentiality accorded her by the \u201cpersonnel records\u201d exception or whether there are countervailing concerns or policies that would preclude release of the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">McGee further asserts that neither the \u201cpersonnel records\u201d nor the \u201cadvisory, consultative, or deliberative\u201d exception protects the requested e-mails because they include Wolfe as a sender or recipient. Because Wolfe\u2019s term on the Planning Board ended on December 31, 2006, \u201cher status was that of a resident only,\u201d not a public official. Therefore, McGee urges that any communications in which Wolfe took part cannot be considered \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency\u201d pursuant to OPRA. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">OPRA exempts from the definition of \u201cgovernment record\u201d any \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency advisory, consultative, or deliberative material.\u201d N.J.S.A 47:1A-1.1. Because this provision has long been understood to encompass the common-law deliberative process privilege, New Jersey courts \u201chave turned to federal deliberative process jurisprudence ... for guidance in ascertaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>[its] scope____\u201d <em>Educ. Law Ctr. ex rel. Abbott v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>274, 285, 966 A.2d 1054 (2009); see <em>also In re Liquidation of Integrity Ins. Co., </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>75, 83-84, 754 A.2d 1177 (2000) (using federal standards to define the deliberative process exemption).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">\u201cThe deliberative process privilege \u2018permits the government to withhold documents that reflect advisory opinions, recommendations, and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Educ. Law Ctr., supra, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>at 285, 966 A.2d 1054 (quoting <em>Integrity, supra, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>at 83, 754 A.2d 1177). The privilege exists \u201cto ensure free and uninhibited communication within governmental agencies so that the best possible decisions can be reached____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 286, 966 A.2d 1054 (citing <em>Kaiser Aluminum, &amp; Chem. Corp. v. United States, </em>157 <em>F.Supp. </em>939, 945-46 (Ct.C1.1958)).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">In order to claim the protection of this provision, a custodian must satisfy two requirements. <em>Integrity, supra, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>at 84-85, 754 A.2d 1177. First, the custodian must show that the document is \u201cpre-decisional,\u201d or \u201cgenerated before the adoption of an agency\u2019s policy or decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 84, 754 A.2d 1177. Second, the custodian must establish that the document is \u201cdeliberative in nature, containing opinions, recommendations, or advice about agency policies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 84-85, 754 A.2d 1177. Satisfaction of these two prerequisites creates a \u201cpresumption of confidentiality,\u201d shifting the burden to the requestor to show that his or her interest in disclosure outweighs the government\u2019s interest in confidentiality. <em>Educ. Law Ctr., supra, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>at 286-87, 966 A.2d 1054.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">To determine the boundaries of \u201cdeliberative\u201d material, the Court embraced the test formulated by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in <em>Mapother v. Department of Justice, </em>3 F.3d 1533, 1535 (1993). <em>Educ. Law Ctr., supra, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>at 294, 966 A.2d 1054. Under this formulation, \u201cthe key to identifying deliberative material must be how closely the material ... relates to the \u2018formulation or exercise of ... policy-oriented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>judgment or [to] the process by which policy is formulated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 295, 966 A.2d 1054 (quoting <em>Mapother, supra, </em>3 A.3d at 1539) (alteration and second omission in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Applying this reasoning to OPRA, the Court adopted a two-factor test. <em>Ibid. </em>The first factor is \u201cwhether the information sought is a part of the process leading to formulation of an agency\u2019s decision,\u201d regardless of whether the document contains fact or opinion; and the second is \u201cthe material\u2019s ability to reflect or to expose the deliberative aspects of that process.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In implementing this test, the Court took particular care to protect the \u201cfull and frank discussion of ideas when developing new policies, or in examining existing policies and procedures----\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Allowing the public eye too far into the inner workings of policy-formulation, the Court reasoned, could prevent the best possible decision from being reached. <em>Id. </em>at 286, 966 A.2d 1054 (citing <em>Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chem. Corp. v. United States, supra, </em>157 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 945-46).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Once again, we review the GRC\u2019s legal interpretation of OPRA under a deferential standard. <em>See, e.g., Blecker v. State, supra, </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 442, 733 A.2d 540. Adopting the findings and recommendations of its executive director, the GRC concluded</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">[T]he personnel matter which is the subject of the requested e-mails obviously began while Ms. Wolfe was chair of the Planning Board, involved ... Planning Board matters and required Ms. Wolfe\u2019s continued involvement due to anticipated or on-going litigation including on-going negotiations with [McGeej\u2019s attorney regarding said personnel matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">As a result, the Council found it \u201cconceivable that Ms. Wolfe\u2019s participation in the requested e-mails is essential\u201d as a result of the official position that she had very recently held. The GRC concluded that communication about official government business in which a recent former official participated could nonetheless constitute \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency\u201d deliberation for the purposes of the OPRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">Given the purpose and application of the deliberative process privilege, the Council\u2019s interpretation of the law is a reasonable accommodation to satisfy the intent of OPRA The e-mails held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>subject to this privilege consist almost entirely of preparations for the upcoming Planning Board meeting, at which the participants intended to discuss McGee. As McGee\u2019s former supervisor, Wolfe\u2019s input on this issue was critical. Moreover, to hold that Wolfe\u2019s departure from public office precluded her from engaging in \u201cadvisory, consultative, or deliberative\u201d communications would ignore the evolving nature of the policy-making process that this exception is intended to protect. We conclude that the Council correctly determined this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The communications are protected under the threshold test enunciated in <em>Integrity </em>and the factors listed in <em>Education Law Center. </em>They were created in advance of an action by a public body, the Planning Board, rendering them \u201cpre-deeisional,\u201d and they contained \u201copinions, recommendations, [and] advice\u201d about what the policy of that body should be in the future. <em>See Integrity, supra, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>at 84-85, 754 A.2d 1177. Furthermore, the e-mails are clearly part of a \u201cprocess leading to formulation\u201d of a decision about the upcoming meeting, and absolutely \u201cexpose the deliberative aspects of that process\u201d by spelling out the cumulative formulation of ideas among the participants. <em>See Educ. Law Ctr., supra, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>at 295, 966 A.2d 1054. To conclude otherwise would promote a chilling effect on the willingness of participants to share policy concerns and considerations in the sphere of their governmental activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">We conclude that the Council correctly identified the relevant emails as protected under the OPRA exception for \u201cadvisory, consultative, or deliberative\u201d documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The GRC exercised sound discretion in rejecting McGee\u2019s claims. The Council\u2019s broad interpretations of OPRA\u2019s \u201cpersonnel records\u201d and \u201cadvisory, consultative, or deliberative\u201d exceptions are entirely consistent with the purposes of the statute. However, OPRA explicitly provides for the release of personnel records with the consent of the individual in question. Because East Amwell had no opportunity to present evidence before the GRC on this issue, we remand this case to the GRC solely to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>whether McGee effectively waived her right to confidentiality under OPRA as to those records so designated.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Affirmed in part, reversed and remanded in part. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b635-8\"> The record is not clear as to Tatsch's position at the time.
