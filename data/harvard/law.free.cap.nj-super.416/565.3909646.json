(Speetraserv) appeals from an order of the Law Division denying its request for attorney\u2019s fees of $121,520 as the claimed \u201cprevailing party\u201d in litigation it instituted against defendant Middlesex County Utilities Authority (MCUA) under New Jersey\u2019s Open Public Records Act (OPRA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1 to -13. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-12\">The MCUA is a governmental entity responsible for, among other things, wastewater management in Middlesex County and portions of Union and Somerset counties. It services about 750,000 residents and businesses in central New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Sometime ago, the MCUA evaluated potential process modifications to its main wastewater treatment plant in Sayreville to reduce the amount of sludge product and minimize transportation, thereby cutting costs. The modification ultimately chosen was based on a patented process known as \u201cbiopHast duopHase,\u201d which creates a sludge product substantially reduced in volume and water. R3 Management, Ltd. (R3 Management), an engineering firm based in the United Kingdom, held the patent for this technology in the United States and Europe.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">On June 21, 2001, the MCUA entered into a licensing and confidentiality agreement with R3 Management wherein the MCUA was granted \u201ca nontransferable, nonexclusive, and irrevocable license\u201d to implement this technology at its wastewater treatment plant. The agreement also obligated the MCUA \u201cto treat as secret and confidential the R3 Management Technology which is disclosed to [the MCUA] by [R3 Management],\u201d and \u201cnot at any time to disclose or permit or allow to be disclosed the R3 Management Technology or any part thereof to any third party, except any necessary disclosure to clients and sub-contractors of [the MCUA] or as required by law or court, governmental or administrative order or directive.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">On March 17, 2003, Spectraserv, a New Jersey-based general contractor with experience in the construction and rehabilitation of sewerage and wastewater treatment facilities, bid on the MCUA project. As the lowest bidder, Spectraserv was awarded and signed an engineering contract with the MCUA on May 16, 2003. This contract required the design of an integrated system of equipment and controls that, upon completion, would transfer and process sewage sludge from the MCUA\u2019s existing conveyor and dewatering equipment through the patented biopHast duopHase process, drying the sludge with heat and mixing it with an alkaline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>based-additive. At the end of the process, the treated sludge would be appropriate for use and disposal under applicable government regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Disputes between the parties arose thereafter. The contract between the MCUA and Spectraserv contained milestones that were to be met by May 31, 2005, but when Spectraserv allegedly fell behind schedule, the parties agreed to a change order on March 24, 2005 that settled delays and liquidated damage claims through the end of February 2005. The parties also agreed to extend the last milestone completion date to December 14, 2005, which, according to the MCUA, Spectraserv also failed to meet. Eventually, the MCUA terminated its contract with Spectraserv for default, claiming unexeused completion delays and failure to meet contract specifications. On March 2, 2007, Spectraserv filed a lawsuit against the MCUA in the Law Division, asserting various claims arising under the parties\u2019 engineering contract (the construction litigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Beginning in October 2005, two months shy of the contract\u2019s completion deadline, Spectraserv made several OPRA requests of the MCUA, the last of which is the subject of this appeal. Its initial request on October 7, 2005 sought to inspect any and all documents, contracts, resolutions, and copies of payments relating to R3M Engineering and its president, Michael J. Samuel, for the period from January 2003 to present. On October 18, 2005, the MCUA made the requested documents available for inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">A second OPRA request on January 11, 2007, more than one year after the December 31, 2005 contract completion date had passed, sought the MCUA\u2019s \u201centire project file\u201d on the construction and improvements of the agency\u2019s wastewater treatment plant in Sayreville, which was designed in the 1950s. Counsel for the MCUA timely responded that the request \u201cencompasses hundreds of thousands of documents and records that have been generated over a period of 50 years or more.\u201d Since the request was not \u201climited in either time or scope\u201d and \u201ccontain[ed] broad and expansive language such as \u2018in connection with,\u2019 \u2018referring or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>relating to,\u2019 and \u2018or other services,\u2019 \u201d the MCUA could not project when it could produce the records. Accordingly, the MCUA inquired of Speetraserv whether \u201ca more tailored and complete request\u201d could be submitted and advised that it would await Spectraserv\u2019s answer before deciding whether to proceed with the original request.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Less than one month after this inquiry, on February 22, 2007, Speetraserv submitted its final OPRA request, which the MCUA received via counsel on February 26, 2007. Apparently intended to supplement its earlier request, this latest version included a government records request form and a four-page attachment, consisting of sixteen separate requests in paragraph form, some with multiple subparts. Among other things, this request sought, once again, the \u201centire project file\u201d pertaining to the contract between Speetraserv and the MCUA, as well as \u201c[a]ny and all contracts performed with or for the benefit of the MCUA\u201d or thirteen other named individuals and entities since January 1998. In addition, Speetraserv sought the complete engineering design of the project\u2019s improvements, the engineer\u2019s \u201cDevelopment of Design Concept,\u201d and \u201cany and all documents detailing design, engineering, construction and/or management plans\u201d as to the Speetraserv contract or \u201cprepared in connection with\u201d certain scientific processes named in the Speetraserv contract.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Only eight days after it submitted its third OPRA request to the MCUA, Spectraserv, as noted, filed its construction lawsuit against the MCUA. Four days later, and within six business days of receiving this request, the MCUA responded by letter dated March 6, 2007. In what it termed its \u201cpreliminary response,\u201d the MCUA characterized the request as \u201cvague, overbroad and unreasonable\u201d in requiring the examination of \u201cover nine years worth of files.\u201d Having met with agency employees on March 1, 2007 to begin identifying thirty file cabinets of documents and assessing the administrative burden of their review, counsel for the MCUA, in his response, also noted that \u201cunder relevant case law a public agency is not obligated to perform research assignments in response to an OPRA request but is only required to produce reasonably identified documents.\u201d Viewing many of the requested documents as confidential, proprietary or trade secrets under its licensing agreement with R3 Management, or otherwise privileged, the MCUA expressed its intention to withhold some of the requested records and to produce those it deemed exempt. In light of the construction complaint with which it had been served that very same week, alleging, in part, the inadequacy of the overall design, the MCUA proposed a compromise\u2014a coordinated production of documents, with Bates numbering for tracking compliance, to satisfy both the OPRA request and the anticipated discovery demands in litigation. Although no date was set for document production, the MCUA represented that it would endeavor to produce some or all of the records requested under OPRA in advance of any discovery deadline set in the construction lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Spectraserv rejected the MCUA\u2019s proposal by letter of March 15, 2007 and demanded that the agency \u201cmake available for inspection within ten (10) days, all documents ... that ... are not subject to any claim of privilege or protection.\u201d Thirteen days later, on March 28, 2007, Spectraserv filed the instant OPRA action by way of verified complaint and order to show cause, seeking, in addition to the requested documents, a statutory civil penalty of $1,000 and a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-11 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-6, respectively. The court set a return date of June 1, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Meanwhile, the MCUA began identifying, from the estimated 97,000 documents covered by the OPRA request, those it deemed confidential or privileged and advised Spectraserv on May 2, 2007 that it would make the remainder available for production upon a deposit for the copying costs. On May 7, 2007, Spectraserv objected to the MCUA scanning, copying or Bates numbering of any documents, asserting that inspection could easily be done on-site without sacrificing control, and demanded immediate access to all non-exempt documents. Thereafter, on May 18, 2007, the MCUA invited Spectraserv to inspect documents the agency deemed responsive after its review of four filing cabinet drawers of records and ten boxes of shop drawings. Spectraserv inspected these documents on May 31, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Just one week prior to that inspection, on May 24, 2007, the managing director of BiopHast wrote the MCUA, objecting to its production of any documents related to the R3 Management technology covered by the confidentiality agreement as such records fell within OPRA\u2019s exception for \u201ctrade secrets and proprietary commercial or financial information obtained from any source.\u201d <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.1. As a result of BiopHast\u2019s position, the number of documents available for review on May 31st was greatly reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">The June 1st return date was rescheduled to June 6th and converted into a ease management conference, at the conclusion of which the parties agreed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-9\">The Authority will produce for inspection pursuant to Spectraserv\u2019s OPRA request all public records, that is, responsive documents that are neither privileged nor over which BiopHast has claimed confidentiality, within seven to ten business days....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">The MCUA was directed to produce confidentiality and privilege logs of all exempted documents within thirty days, by July 6, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-11\">Further inspection of documents by Spectraserv occurred on June 26, 2007 and July 2, 2007. Due to the volume of documents, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>the MCUA requested and was granted an extension of time for submitting its confidentiality and privilege logs. The agency produced these master logs on August 7, 2007, consisting of two volumes totaling 590 pages and listing 596 documents as privileged and 1848 documents as confidential. Thus, the MCUA originally withheld, as privileged or confidential, a total of 2444 documents out of approximately 150,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Thereafter, on September 12, 2007, BiopHast\u2019s counsel wrote the court advising that the licensor generally did not \u201cobject to Spectraserv\u2019s review of these documents subject to the entry of an appropriate protective order by this Court.\u201d This response prompted the judge to order the licensor to file a notice of motion to intervene in the pending litigation by November 5, 2007. Failure to do so would result in a waiver of BiopHast\u2019s right to object to the MCUA\u2019s production of any records protected under the licensing agreement. The licensor did not intervene by November 5, 2007, thus resolving all confidentiality issues. Consequently, the MCUA made the 1848 documents, once classified as \u201cconfidential,\u201d available for inspection and Spectraserv inspected these documents on November 15, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">On December 14, 2007, over four months after the privilege log was produced, Spectraserv objected to more than half of the privilege designations. On February 7, 2008, the MCUA agreed to make available for inspection \u201ccertain correspondence and attachments\u201d to 172 of the documents listed on the privilege log. Spectraserv then moved to compel the production of 167 other documents designated as privileged, which the MCUA opposed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As a result, on May 9, 2008, the court appointed a special master to review the challenged documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">The special master issued a privilege report on July 28, 2008, concluding that of the 347 documents reviewed, 171 of the with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>held documents should have been produced in whole or in part. The MCUA filed objections with the judge, who, by order of October 24, 2008, affirmed the special master\u2019s findings and ordered the MCUA to produce the remaining documents as improperly withheld. The agency fully complied. Thus, the MCUA ultimately produced 2239 of the 2444 documents originally designated as privileged or confidential, with the remaining 205 documents exempt from disclosure. Of the 2239 documents disclosed, only 171 documents were compelled by court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Spectraserv\u2019s December 24, 2008 application for attorney\u2019s fees and costs as a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-6 was also referred to the special master, who, on February 27, 2009, found that Spectraserv was entitled to the full amount of $121,520 it claimed as reimbursement. On October 7, 2009, the Law Division rejected the special master\u2019s finding and held that Spectraserv was not entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees because (1) its OPRA request was improper as overly broad and non-specific; and (2) the MCUA\u2019s March 6, 2007 response, suggesting a single production of records in response to both the OPRA request and discovery demands in the construction litigation, was reasonable. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">OPRA was intended to complement, enhance and maximize New Jersey\u2019s common law protections by providing its citizenry statutory rights to government maintained records. <em>Educ. Law Ctr. v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>274, 283, 966 A.2d 1054 (2009); <em>Mason v. City of Hoboken, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>51, 57, 951 A.2d 1017 (2008). Thus, unless otherwise exempted, OPRA requires that government records \u201cbe readily accessible for inspection, copying, or <em>examination____\u2019\u2019N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">The statute establishes specific means to effectuate this mandate. Custodians of public records must develop forms for OPRA requests that \u201cprovide space for ... a brief description of the government record sought.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-5(f). In turn, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>the requestor must \u201csubmit the request with information that is essential to permit the custodian to comply with its obligations.\u201d <em>N.J. Builders Ass\u2019n v. N.J. Council on Affordable Hous., </em>390 <em>N.J.Super. </em>166, 177, 915 A.2d 23 (App.Div.) (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-5(f), (g), (i)), <em>certif. denied, </em>190 <em>N.J. </em>394, 921 A.2d 448 (2007). In this regard, OPRA does not countenance \u201c[wholesale requests for general information,\u201d <em>MAG Entm\u2019t, LLC v. Div. of Alcoholic Beverage Control, </em>375 <em>N.J.Super. </em>534, 549, 868 A.2d 1067 (App. Div.2005), or open-ended demands \u201cfor every document a public agency has on file.\u201d <em>Bent v. Stafford Twp. Police Dep\u2019t, </em>381 <em>N.J.Super. </em>30, 37, 884 A.2d 240 (App.Div.2005). Rather, \u201cOPRA requires a party requesting access to a public record to specifically describe the document sought,\u201d <em>Gannett N.J. Partners L.P. v. County of Middlesex, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>205, 212, 877 A.2d 330 (App.Div.2005), so that the records may be readily and reasonably identified within the short time frame within which government custodians must respond. <em>Bent, supra, </em>381 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 36-37, 884 A.2d 240. \u201cAs such, a proper request under OPRA must identify with reasonable clarity those documents that are desired, and a party cannot satisfy this requirement by simply requesting <em>all </em>of an agency\u2019s documents.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">The government custodian, on the other hand, must \u201clocate and redact [the requested] documents, isolate exempt documents, ... identify requests that require \u2018extraordinary expenditure of time and effort\u2019 and warrant assessment of a \u2018service charge,\u2019 and, when unable to comply with a request, \u2018indicate the specific basis.\u2019 \u201d <em>N.J. Builders Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>390 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 177, 915 A.2d 23 (quoting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-5(a)-(j)). Unless a shorter time is otherwise prescribed, \u201ca custodian of a government record shall grant access to a government record or deny a request for access to a government record as soon as possible, but not later than seven business days after receiving the request, provided that the record is currently available and not in storage or archived.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-5(i). An exception to the seven-day business rule exists where the request for access \u201cwould substantially disrupt agency operations,\u201d in which event \u201cthe custodian may deny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>access to the record after attempting to reach a reasonable solution with the requestor that accommodates the interests of the requestor and the agency.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-5(g). Failure to respond within the allowable time, however, is the equivalent of a denial of the request. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-5(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">A person denied access may either institute an action in the Law Division or file a complaint with the Government Records Council (GRC). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-6. A requestor who \u201cprevails\u201d is \u201centitled to a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">In adopting OPRA, the Legislature declared that it is the public policy of this State to provide its citizens with the right to access government records. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1. The fee-shifting provisions in OPRA are a vital means of fulfilling this promise. Without these provisions, the ordinary citizen would be waging a quixotic battle against a public entity vested with almost inexhaustible resources. By making the custodian of the government record responsible for the payment of counsel fees to a prevailing requestor, the Legislature intended to even the fight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"a3d-dedup-0\"><em>[Courier News v. Hunterdon County Prosecutor,\u2019s Office, </em>378 <em>N.J.Super. </em>539, 546, 876 A.2d 806 (App.Div.2005).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">Spectraserv\u2019s claim of entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees is based upon its contention that the MCUA\u2019s March 6, 2007 response did not conform to OPRA\u2019s seven-day business rule because it neither provided prompt access to the government records sought nor otherwise fixed a date certain for the production of non-exempt documents. The rule, however, applies only if a proper OPRA request has been made. <em>See N.J. Builders Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>390 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 179, 915 A.2d 23 (noting that \u201cwhen a request is \u2018complex\u2019 because it fails to specifically identify the documents sought, then that request is not \u2018encompassed\u2019 by OPRA and OPRA\u2019s deadlines do not apply\u201d). There, we found the requestor\u2019s five-page document listing thirty-eight separate requests for \u201cany and all documents and data,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 172, 915 A.2d 23, and requiring a survey of agency employees to determine which documents they relied upon, considered or used in the agency\u2019s fair-share housing methodology, to be outside OPRA\u2019s scope. <em>Id. </em>at 179, 915 A.2d 23. Because the request in that case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>did not specifically identify the documents sought, \u201cOPRA did not require [the agency] to produce the records within seven business days, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-5(i).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171, 915 A.2d 23. For that very same reason, we also found that OPRA\u2019s related fee shifting provision had no application, <em>id. </em>at 179, 915 A.2d 23, and therefore held that the requestor \u201cwas not entitled to fees as a prevailing party under OPRA\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171, 915 A.2d 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The instant matter is strikingly similar. Thirteen of Spectra-serv\u2019s sixteen requests with multiple subparts sought \u201cany and all\u201d documents from the MCUA. Of those, several requests failed to specify a specific document by date, title, and author and instead sought records that \u201creflect,\u201d \u201cexplain,\u201d \u201cdetail,\u201d or \u201cdemonstrate\u201d the \u201crationale,\u201d \u201cdecision,\u201d or \u201cpurpose\u201d of, among other things, various chemical processes of a highly technical and complex nature. As if this were not sufficiently inclusive, Spectraserv\u2019s last request sought the agency\u2019s \u201centire project file.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">We view Spectraserv\u2019s request as overly broad and generalized and therefore improper under OPRA First, the sheer enormity and complexity of the request, involving approximately 150,000 documents, rendered agency compliance cumbersome and time consuming, involving an \u201cextraordinary expenditure of time and effort.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-5(c). Moreover, Spectraserv\u2019s failure in many instances to clearly specify the documents sought necessitated the deployment of indisputably limited agency resources to sift through the MCUA\u2019s vast files and identify, analyze and select potentially relevant and responsive public records. Yet OPRA imposes no such obligation upon government custodians. <em>See MAG, supra, </em>375 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 549-50, 868 A.2d 1067. Relatedly, Spectraserv\u2019s request was also overbroad because it encompassed records that were exempt from disclosure under OPRA, as ultimately found by both the special master and the trial court, and which required further agency efforts to cull, isolate and evaluate. Indeed, of the 596 documents originally identified by the MCUA as privileged, 205 were eventually upheld by the court as exempt from disclosure and only 171, at most, were deemed otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Although the impropriety of the OPRA request is sufficient, in itself, to warrant denial of Spectraserv\u2019s counsel fee application, we do not rely on this reason alone in upholding the trial court\u2019s decision. We also find that the MCUA\u2019s March 6, 2007 reply was responsive to Spectraserv\u2019s demand and reasonable under the circumstances. Therein, the MCUA, in a timely manner, articulated a specific basis for its objection, characterizing the request as \u201cvague, overbroad and unreasonable.\u201d Yet despite these reservations, the MCUA represented that it would withhold only those documents it deemed protected by the attorney-client privilege or that were confidential under its licensing agreement with R3 Management, and produce the rest. As to the latter, in light of the construction lawsuit just then commenced by Spectraserv, the MCUA recommended a coordinated production of documents to satisfy both the OPRA request and anticipated discovery demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">As noted, OPRA recognizes an exception to the seven-day business rule and \u201cauthorizes custodians to propose a broad range of \u2018reasonable solutions\u2019 that accommodate competing interests when compliance would substantially disrupt agency operations\u201d and \u201cclearly permits outright denial of these requests after an attempt to reach a reasonable and mutually accommodating solution.\u201d <em>N.J. Builders Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>390 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 183, 915 A.2d 23 (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-5(g)). OPRA most certainly permits \u201cconsideration of demands on agency operations,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 184, 915 A.2d 23, and \u201cencourages compromise and efforts to work through certain problematic requests\u201d by \u201caccommodating one another.\u201d <em>Mason, supra, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>at 76, 78, 951 A.2d 1017.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Contrary to Spectraserv\u2019s intimation, there is adequate proof that agency operations would be substantially disrupted by full compliance with the requestor\u2019s expansive document demands and truncated time frame. Spectraserv itself acknowledged the administrative burden in its March 15, 2007 rejection of the MCUA\u2019s counter-proposal. Aside from this concession, disruption may simply be inferred from the breadth, generality and complexity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>the request at issue, which \u201cnecessitates work by [agency] employees that is neither assigned by the agency nor envisioned by OPRA.\u201d <em>N.J. Builders Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>390 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 181, 915 A.2d 23 (\u201cA request that does not comply with OPRA and demands assessment and preliminary inquiry of the sort required by NJBA\u2019s demand is sufficient to give rise to an inference that compliance will \u2018disrupt agency operations.\u2019 \u201d). Here, it is undisputed that the MCUA had only very limited resources to sift through 150,000 documents, including highly technical materials, evaluate and identify those exempt from disclosure, and assess the remainder for relevance and responsiveness to Spectraserv\u2019s demands. This monumental task necessarily entailed a substantial disruption of agency operations and Spectraserv presents no proof to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">We also conclude that the MCUA offered a reasonable compromise to the unrealistically abbreviated temporal demands imposed by Speetraserv\u2019s OPRA request. Given the built-in delay occasioned by both the nature of the request itself and the involvement of an outside party (BiopHast) in its resolution, as well as the pendency of simultaneous litigation in the same forum, the alternative of a coordinated approach offered an effective and orderly mechanism for scheduling and tracking the production of documents and addressing any challenges thereto. The MCUA\u2019s solution was all the more reasonable given the likelihood that most, if not all, of the non-exempt documents covered by the OPRA request would have been discoverable in the construction litigation instituted by Spectraserv.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">We fully recognize, of course, that \u201c[a] party\u2019s right to access public records is not abridged because it may be involved in other litigation with the governmental agency required to respond to the OPRA request.\u201d <em>MAG, supra, </em>375 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 545, 868 A.2d 1067. In <em>MAG, </em>we noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">The fact that litigation was pending between the ABC and MAG when MAG made its public records request does not, in itself, relieve the government agency of its obligation to comply with OPRA Documents that are \u201cgovernmental records\u201d and subject to public access under OPRA are no less subject to public access because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>the requesting party is opposing the public entity in possession o\u00ed material sought in collateral litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 544-45, 868 A.2d 1067 (internal citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">Indeed, OPRA contemplates <em>prompt </em>production of documents well in advance of what the discovery rules command. <em>Compare N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-5(i) (requiring a response to an OPRA request within seven business days) <em>with Rule </em>4:18-l(b)(2) (requiring parties to respond to document demands within thirty-five to fifty days after service).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">Although the pendency of collateral litigation \u201cneither diminishes nor expands the requestor\u2019s right of access to government records under OPRA,\u201d <em>N.J. Builders Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>390 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 182, 915 A.2d 23, it is not a fact to be ignored. <em>MAG, supra, </em>375 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 549-50, 868 A.2d 1067. In <em>MAG, </em>we expressly disapproved of the use of OPRA \u201cas an alternative to civil discovery, to obtain information previously denied\u201d in an administrative enforcement action. <em>Id. </em>at 550. <em>MAG </em>involved an OPRA request by a retail liquor licensee for disclosure by the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control, during pendency of the Division\u2019s enforcement action against the licensee, of records regarding the Division\u2019s handling of other enforcement actions against similarly situated liquor licensees. <em>Id. </em>at 539-40, 868 A.2d 1067. In denying the OPRA request as \u201ca broad-based demand for research and analysis, decidedly outside the statutory ambit,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 550, 868 A.2d 1067, we noted: \u201cAlthough the purpose or motive for which information is sought is generally immaterial to the disclosure determination under OPRA, here the manner in which [the requestor] attempted to use OPRA as a vehicle to transfer management of the discovery process in the administrative proceeding from the ALJ to the Law Division was patently improper.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 543, 868 A.2d 1067.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">Here, the MCUA complains that Spectraserv improperly used OPRA as a means of achieving an unfair advantage in the construction litigation and recouping its discovery costs therein. Certainly, misuse of OPRA as a calculated, tactical discovery weapon in pending litigation to obtain the reward of \u201cprevailing party\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>fees is not -within the statute\u2019s intendment and should not be countenanced. While we venture no opinion as to the true purpose of the OPRA request in this instance, we simply note that there appears to be no identifiable documents available to Speetra-serv under OPRA that would not have otherwise been discoverable in the construction lawsuit. And although OPRA clearly contemplates the production of such records on an accelerated basis, Spectraserv\u2019s demand does not so qualify because, for reasons already stated, it was not authorized by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Speetraserv nevertheless argues that because the MCUA never flatly rejected the OPRA request, the agency relinquished its right to later challenge the demand as improper. In other words, since the request was subject to outright denial in the first instance, any agency response short of straightforward rejection constitutes a waiver of its right to thereafter object to the request as invalid. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">\u201cCommon sense precludes an assumption that the Legislature would intend to permit denial but prohibit reasonable solutions that involve brief delay.\u201d <em>N.J. Builders Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>390 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 183, 915 A.2d 23. Indeed, such an assumption goes against the \u201ccooperative balance\u201d OPRA strives to attain. <em>Mason, supra, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>at 78, 951 A.2d 1017. Under Spectraserv\u2019s argument,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-8\">plaintiffs would have an incentive to file suit immediately after a request for disclosure is denied or not responded to in a timely fashion, based in part on the expectation of an award of attorney\u2019s fees. Agencies, in turn, would have reason not to disclose documents voluntarily after the filing of a lawsuit. If they did, they would be presumed liable for fees. As a result, courts could expect to see more aggressive litigation tactics and fewer efforts at accommodation. And in the former instances, OPRA cases designed to obtain swift access to government records would end up as battles over attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 78-79, 951 A.2d 1017.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">These are consequences not contemplated by OPRA and therefore we reject Spectraserv\u2019s waiver argument as unsound and without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">To reiterate, Spectraserv is not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees because its OPRA request was improper and the MCUA\u2019s response was reasonable. To be sure, \u201c[a] requestor is not outright disqualified from entitlement to fees because the original request was too broad____\u201d <em>Asbury Park Press v. County of Monmouth, </em>406 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 12, 966 A.2d 75 (App.Div.2009), <em>aff'd, </em>201 <em>N.J. </em>5, 986 A.2d 678 (2010). Spectraserv, however, never conformed its demand to OPRA\u2019s requirements and therefore cannot be considered a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">\u201cIn determining the propriety of an award of attorney fees, the court must first determine whether one qualifies as a \u2018prevailing party.\u2019 \u201d <em>N. Jersey Media Group Inc. v. Stale, Dep\u2019t of Personnel, </em>389 <em>N.J.Super. </em>527, 540, 913 A.2d 853 (Law Div.2006) (quoting <em>Dunn v. Dep\u2019t of Human Seras., </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>321, 332, 711 A.2d 944 (App.Div.1998)) (finding that, despite entitlement to some information within government records, the plaintiff was not considered a prevailing party). A requestor, however, is not a prevailing party simply because the agency produced documents after an OPRA suit was filed. <em>Mason, supra., </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>at 78, 951 A.2d 1017. Rather, a complainant is a \u201cprevailing party\u201d if he or she achieves the desired result because the complaint brought about change (voluntary or otherwise) in the custodian\u2019s conduct. <em>Teeters v. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Seras., </em>387 <em>N.J.Super. </em>423, 432, 904 A.2d 747 (App.Div.2006) (quoting <em>Warrington v. Vill.

In <em>Mason, su-pra, </em>the Court held that \u201crequestors are entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under OPRA, absent a judgment or an enforceable consent decree, when they can demonstrate (1) \u2018a factual causal nexus between plaintiffs litigation and the relief ultimately achieved\u2019; and (2) \u2018that the relief ultimately secured by plaintiffs had a basis in law.\u2019 \u201d 196 <em>N.J. </em>at 76, 951 A.2d 1017 (quoting <em>Singer v. State, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>487, 494, 472 A.2d 138 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>Aside from the lack of any legal basis for the relief sought, absent here is any causal connection between Spectraserv\u2019s OPRA complaint and the production of documents by the MCUA. From the very inception, in its initial response of March 2007 to Speetraserv\u2019s letter request, the MCUA acknowledged its obligation to produce non-exempt documents and, in fact, made many of these documents available for inspection in advance of any court intervention or directive. As for the remainder, three weeks before Spectraserv filed its OPRA complaint, the MCUA proposed the very solution ultimately adopted, in large measure, by the trial court to address disclosure issues common to both lawsuits. The MCUA also immediately took steps to cull and isolate from its voluminous records those it deemed privileged and confidential. As to the latter, as soon as its licensor withdrew its objection by failing to intervene, the MCUA made available all 1848 documents once considered confidential. In fact, in the interim, the court itself allowed the MCUA to withhold these documents while it gave BiopHast forty-five days to intervene and assert confidentiality. As for the other 347 records designated \u201cprivileged,\u201d given the commonality of subject matter, the court would have had to make the same determination in the context of litigation discovery under <em>Rule </em>4:10-2. Thus, under the circumstances, it cannot be said that Spectraserv\u2019s OPRA complaint caused the production of documents that would not have been produced otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b597-8\"> BiopHast Technologies Ltd.
