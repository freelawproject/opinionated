As part of the fraud, Smith instructed plaintiffs to convey the invested funds to an account he maintained with defendant Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith (Merrill Lynch). Because plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>tiffs had no relationship with Merrill Lynch, and because Smith had no relationship with Merrill Lynch other than as owner of the account into which the funds were placed, we conclude that, as a matter of law, no duty should be imposed on Merrill Lynch to periodically examine the account\u2019s activities for indicia of fraud and, therefore, affirm the order dismissing the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">In April and June of 2009, these four separate actions were filed against Smith, his wife Holly Smith, and several investment advisor firms, alleging Smith created and orchestrated a scheme to defraud them. After the actions were consolidated, Merrill Lynch moved for dismissal pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e). Plaintiffs opposed the motion and cross-moved for an order compelling arbitration. Merrill Lynch\u2019s motion was granted and plaintiffs\u2019 cross-motion was denied on October 23, 2009. When the remaining issues in these actions were later resolved, plaintiffs filed this appeal, seeking our review of the order dismissing the negligence claims asserted against Merrill Lynch and the order denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">A complaint should be dismissed for failure to state a claim pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e) only if \u201cthe factual allegations are palpably insufficient to support a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d <em>Rieder v. State Dep\u2019t of Tramp., </em>221 <em>N.J.Super. </em>547, 552, 535 A.2d 512 (App.Div.1987). This standard requires that \u201cthe pleading be searched in depth and with liberality to determine whether a cause of action can be gleaned even from an obscure statement.\u201d <em>Seidenberg v. Summit Bank, </em>348 <em>N.J.Super. </em>243, 250, 791 A.2d 1068 (App.Div.2002) (citing <em>Printing Mart-Morristown v. Sharp Elecs. Corp., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>739, 746, 563 A.2d 31 (1989)). The pleader is entitled to \u201cthe most favorable inferences which may be reasonably drawn from\u201d the pleading\u2019s allegations, <em>Rappaport v. Nichols, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>188, 193, 156 A.2d 1 (1959), and, in reviewing a <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e) dismissal, we apply the same standard, <em>Seidenberg, supra, </em>348 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 250, 791 A.2d 1068; <em>Donato v. Moldow, </em>374 <em>N.J.Super. </em>475, 483, 865 A.2d 711 (App.Div.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>As part of their negligence claims, plaintiffs alleged that Smith convinced them to invest in HFP, which he claimed was \u201ca secure tax-free investment which paid a high level of interest through investment in a diversified portfolio of high yielding income projects.\u201d According to their complaints, plaintiffs collectively invested approximately $10 million in HFP over a number of years. Smith obtained these funds by instructing plaintiffs to make their checks payable to \u201cMerrill Lynch A/C #36641\u201d or \u201cdirectly to Merrill Lynch,\u201d misrepresenting to plaintiffs that Merrill Lynch was the security\u2019s underwriter. According to plaintiffs, the referenced account was a personal account Smith opened at Merrill Lynch \u201cfor the sole purpose of furthering the Ponzi scheme.\u201d Once plaintiffs\u2019 cheeks were deposited in Smith\u2019s personal Merrill Lynch account, Smith remitted to plaintiffs phony correspondence memorializing the deposit and then used the funds for his own benefit. By the time plaintiffs discovered what was happening, they had lost nearly their entire investments.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The complaints alleged that while Smith was orchestrating his fraud, he was employed by: defendant Hilliard W.L. Lyons, Inc., from 1999-2003; defendant PNC Investments from 2004-2005; and defendant Cantone Research, Inc., from 2005-2009. Plaintiffs do not allege Smith was ever employed by Merrill Lynch. Notwithstanding the lack of any relationship between Merrill Lynch and Smith or the lack of any relationship between plaintiffs and Merrill Lynch, plaintiffs alleged Merrill Lynch was negligent for failing to discover Smith\u2019s use of his Merrill Lynch account to perpetrate a fraud.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs acknowledged that ordinarily a bank only owes duties to its customers, but claimed that a fiduciary relationship was established in this ease because they wrote checks directly to Merrill Lynch when investing in HFP.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Although Judge W. Hunt Dumont mentioned that plaintiffs\u2019 claims \u201c[did] have a certain superficial appeal,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> he interpreted the applicable law as limiting a brokerage firm\u2019s duty to only its customers and dismissed the negligence claims asserted by plaintiffs against Merrill Lynch. In appealing, plaintiffs argue that although a bank or brokerage firm does not typically owe a duty to non-customers, Merrill Lynch owed them a duty in this case because it \u201caccepted more than $9 million of [p]laintiff[s\u2019] money ... by way of checks payable to Merrill Lynch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Whether a duty should be imposed is a matter of law, <em>Keman v. One Washington Park Urban Renewal Associates, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>437, 445, 713 A.2d 411 (1998); <em>Arvanitis v. Hios, </em>307 <em>N.J.Super. </em>577, 581, 705 A.2d 355 (App.Div.1998), that poses \u201c \u2018a question of fairness\u2019 \u201d involving \u201c \u2018a weighing of the relationship of the parties, the nature of the risk, and the public interest in the proposed solution,\u2019 \u201d <em>Kelly v. Gwinnett, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>538, 544, 476 A.2d 1219 (1984) (quoting <em>Goldberg v. Hous. Auth. of Newark, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>578, 583, 186 A.2d 291 (1962)). In reviewing a trial judge\u2019s determination that a duty does or does not arise in a particular situation, we are bound neither by the trial judge\u2019s interpretation of the law nor the judge\u2019s view of the legal consequences of the alleged facts. <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Although our courts have not previously considered whether a brokerage firm owes a duty towards non-customers in this context, our Supreme Court has expressed a \u201creluctance to impose a duty of care on banks in respect of a total stranger.\u201d <em>Brunson v. Affinity Fed. Credit Union, </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>381, 403, 972 A.2d 1112 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>(2009); <em>see also City Check Cashing v. Mfrs. Hanover Trust Co., </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>49, 60, 764 A.2d 411 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The Court\u2019s decision in <em>City Check Cashing </em>is particularly instructive. There, a cheek cashing business was presented with a forged check appearing to have been marked certified by the defendant bank. <em>Id. </em>at 52-53, 764 A.2d 411. Before cashing the check, the manager contacted a bank representative who initially expressed concerns about the check\u2019s legitimacy and promised to look at it more closely. <em>Id. </em>at 53-54, 764 A 2d 411. Not hearing from the bank representative for several hours, the store manager cashed the check. <em>Id. </em>at 55, 764 A.2d 411. In finding no maintainable negligence claim against the bank, the Court held that \u201c[ajbsent a special relationship, courts will typically bar claims of non-customers against banks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60, 764 A.2d 411. That is, the Court held that absent some \u201cagreement, undertaking or contract\u201d between the parties, a bank does not owe a duty to a non-customer, <em>id. </em>at 62, 764 A.2d 411, explaining that \u201c[i]n actions based on nonfeasance,\u201d there must be \u201csome definite relation between the parties, of such a character that social policy justifies the imposition of a duty to act,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 59, 764 A.2d 411 (quoting W. Page Keeton et al., <em>Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts </em>\u00a7 56 at 374 (5th ed. 1984)). <em>See also Pennsylvania Nat'l Turf Club v. Bank of W. Jersey, </em>158 <em>N.J.Super. </em>196, 203, 385 A.2d 932 (App. Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>506, 391 A.2d 520 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Plaintiffs have not demonstrated why some other rule should apply to a brokerage firm with regard to an individual\u2019s personal brokerage account. Indeed, we are impressed by the fact that plaintiffs\u2019 theory appeal\u2019s never to have been accepted by any of the federal courts that have considered it; those federal courts, including the federal district court in this State, <em>Riggs v. Schappell, </em>939 <em>F.Supp. </em>321, 329-30 (D.N.J.1996), that have explored the issue, have held that a brokerage firm is under no obligation to be a fraud watchdog for non-customers. <em>See In re Agape Litig., </em>681 F.Supp.2d 352, 361 (E.D.N.Y.2010); <em>Kolbeck v. LIT Am., </em>923 <em>F.Supp. </em>557, 571-72 (S.D.N.Y.1996), <em>affd, </em>152 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>918 (2d Cir.1998); <em>Guidry v. Bank of LaPlace, </em>740 <em>F.Supp. </em>1208, 1218-19 (E.D.La.1990), <em>aff'd as modified, </em>954 F.2d 278 (5th Cir. 1992). The common theme in all these cases is that a duty arises only \u201cwhen the broker does business with the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Kolbeck, supra, </em>923 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 572 (S.D.N.Y.1996). That theme is consistent with the common law approach, expressed in <em>Brunson </em>and <em>City Check Cashing, </em>that precludes claims made by non-customers against banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">In applying these principles, we conclude that the absence of any relationship between plaintiffs and Merrill Lynch precludes the imposition of a duty on Merrill Lynch to periodically or regularly police the personal account maintained by Smith for indicia of fraud. Furthermore, the fact that plaintiffs may have at times submitted checks directly to Merrill Lynch, as instructed by Smith, did not create a relationship where none previously existed. Merrill Lynch deposited the checks in Smith\u2019s account as directed; it issued no statements to plaintiffs and derived no financial benefit from the fact that checks may have been written directly to Merrill Lynch instead of Smith. In the absence of no greater nexus between plaintiffs and Merrill Lynch, or between Smith and Merrill Lynch, plaintiffs possessed no viable negligence claim against Merrill Lynch. Accordingly, the order of dismissal must be affirmed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">We lastly observe that plaintiffs also argue the judge erred in denying their cross-motion to compel arbitration of their claims against Merrill Lynch\u2014an argument without sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11\u20143(e)(1)(E). We note only that in light of our disposition of the negligence claim, plaintiffs have no viable cause of action to be arbitrated even if we were to ignore the other insurmountable burden that plaintiffs and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Merrill Lynch never entered into an agreement to arbitrate any disputes that might later arise between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-13\"> The four actions before <em>us\u2014Leonard L.
