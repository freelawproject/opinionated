The motion judge found such circumstances did exist. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">These appeals were calendared back-to-back and are being consolidated for purposes of this opinion. Defendants, City of Brigantine, Brigantine Rescue Squad, and Greg Goff, appeal the March 2, 2010 order of the Law Division granting plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>motions to file late Tort Claims notices against them. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:8-9. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">On March 3, 2009, Juan Mendez and his minor passenger Colleen Curran (referred to as \u201cFelix,\u201d her guardian ad litem\u2019s name) were seriously injured when Mendez\u2019s vehicle struck a snow removal truck owned by the South Jersey Transportation Authority (SJTA) and parked on the left shoulder in the Atlantic City Expressway/Brigantine Connector Tunnel. Plaintiffs promptly filed Tort Claims notices against the SJTA, Atlantic City, Atlantic County, and the State of New Jersey based on the ownership of the vehicle and the location of the tunnel. <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:8-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">On December 22 and 23, 2009, Felix and Mendez, respectively, filed Tort Claims notices against appellants, and shortly after-wards each filed suit for personal injuries. Plaintiffs then each filed a motion seeking: (1) a declaration that any cause of action against appellants accrued in mid-October 2009, when they received the videotape depicting the Brigantine ambulance operated by Goff attempting a lane change immediately prior to the accident, or, alternatively, (2) permission to file the late notices of claim against appellants. On February 19, 2010, the court issued identical letter opinions finding both plaintiffs had demonstrated \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d for the filing of their Tort Claims notices against appellants beyond the ninety-day deadline. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:8-8; -9. The decision was memorialized in orders of March 2,2010.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This appeal ensued.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>The record reflects that when the police arrived at the scene, both plaintiffs were unconscious, having suffered severe head trauma and requiring ambulance transport to a nearby trauma center. They spent considerable time in hospitals and rehabilitation facilities and they had no recollection of events occurring immediately before or after the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">An investigation of the scene revealed that Mendez\u2019s vehicle was traveling southbound on the Atlantic City Expressway Connector and upon entrance to the tunnel he lost control of his vehicle, spun, ran off the road to the left, and struck the truck that was parked on the shoulder. The driver of the track represented that he was standing outside his vehicle, speaking to the other snow plow drivers, and heard a crash but did not witness the collision. The initial police report also reflected that there wei\u2019e no witnesses to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">A supplemental police report, designated a \u201cchange report,\u201d was prepared the following day by State Police Detective I. Richard Brunett. Pertinent to this appeal, the report discussed video footage recorded by two cameras located in the tunnel, which the detective described as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">The first camera depicts an Ambulance traveling southbound within the left lane and the Mendez Saturn traveling in the right lane approximately 2 car lengths behind the ambulance. The Mendez Saturn appears to be traveling at the same speed as the ambulance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">The 2nd camera depicts the three International Dump Trucks within the left shoulder and their occupants standing between the 2nd and 3rd International dump track. The camera then captures the Ambulance passing the International dump trucks and the last International dump truck rocks from side to side from an apparent impact. The camera then depicts the occupants that were operating the three International dump trucks go to the rear of the last Dump track to render aid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">The report continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-10\">The occupant\u2019s (sic) of the three parked maintenance trucks were standing between the second and third truck awaiting the arrival of a supervisor to determine if the Brigantine Connector needed another pass to clear the slush in the roadway. At this time, video evidence depicts an ambulance with its emergency lamps in operation traveling in the left lane with the Mendez Saturn approximately two car lengths behind the ambulance in the right lane.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>As per video evidence, the ambulance continued in the left lane and travels past the parked trucks. At this point in the video, the Mendez Saturn is not observed, but the last Atlantic City Expressway track is impacted and slightly rocks from left to right. The video then depicts the Atlantic City Expressway driver\u2019s (sic) walking to the rear of the last truck to render aid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Greg Goff, a Brigantine EMS, was identified as the driver of the ambulance and interviewed by Detective Brunett the day of the accident. According to the report, Goff advised he was transporting a cardiac patient from Brigantine to the Atlanticare Medical Center, with emergency lights activated. He stated that as he passed the three snow plows stopped in the left shoulder, \u201che heard a loud noise.\u201d He asked the paramedic treating the patient in the back to see what the noise was but the paramedic was unable to see anything because of the dirty windows in the ambulance. Goff further advised he attributed the loud noise to the snow plows being lowered and making contact with the roadway, and he continued to the medical center. He did not remember seeing any vehicles in the right lane as he entered and proceeded through the tunnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">As a result of the accident, Mendez was charged with a motor vehicle offense. Mendez\u2019s attorney made three written requests of the municipal prosecutor for discovery: May 5, June 16, and June 29, 2009. Following several adjournments by the municipal court as a result of the lack of discovery, on September 4, 2009, the judge advised Mendez\u2019s attorney she could submit an order compelling discovery, which she sent promptly. In the interim, the municipal prosecutor forwarded the written discovery materials and advised of the cost and procedure for obtaining videotapes. On September 10, 2009, Mendez\u2019s attorney requested copies of the two videotapes from the tunnel and enclosed the appropriate check. However, she was provided the wrong tape, and on October 5, 2009, she again requested the proper tapes. On October 19, 2009, when Mendez\u2019s attorney arrived at court, the municipal prosecutor gave her the correct videotapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">Felix\u2019s attorney also made multiple requests for the videotapes. By letter of March 17, 2009, he requested that SJTA produce and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>preserve the specifically identified videotapes. The request was repeated to counsel for the SJTA by letters of May 7, May 20, and June 22, 2009, as well as telephone conversations during that time. Felix\u2019s attorney ultimately received the videotapes from Mendez\u2019s attorney on October 21, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Plaintiffs served Tort Claims notices on appellants in December 2009, and then filed their personal injury actions. In January, plaintiffs filed the subject motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">The Law Division judge found extraordinary circumstances to allow the late filing. Noting that <em>\u201cN.J.S.A. </em>59:8-9 allows the court in its discretion to permit the filing of tort claims beyond the 90 day rule for extraordinary circumstances,\u201d the judge found compelling plaintiffs\u2019 injuries and their effect on plaintiffs\u2019 memories, and the delay in their obtaining of the videotapes. The judge reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">Plaintiffs] did not simply need to know that the Brigantine ambulance was in the area of the accident, [they] would have to have been aware that the ambulance may have contributed to the accident. This information was not known until the video was received and reviewed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">The judge further noted plaintiffs had timely brought the motion. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>59:8-9 (requiring the filing of the notice within one year of the accident).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">Appellants challenge the court\u2019s finding of extraordinary circumstances, urging that plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys were apprised of the existence of Goff and the related public entity in the change report issued shortly after the accident in March 2009. According to appellants, plaintiffs should have relied on the detective\u2019s narrative description of the videotapes contained in his change report and filed Tort Claims notices within the ninety-day deadline, and their failure to do so should preclude plaintiffs from relief. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">The decision to grant permission to file a late notice under the Tori Claims Act \u201cwithin the one year period is a matter left to the sound discretion of the trial court, and will be sustained on appeal in the absence of a showing of an abuse thereof.\u201d <em>Lamb </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number><em>v. Global Landfill Reclaiming, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>134, 146, 543 A.2d 443 (1988). Furthermore, a reviewing court is to \u201cexamine more carefully cases in which permission to file a late claim has been denied than those in which it has been granted, to the end that wherever possible eases may be heard on their merits, and any doubts which may exist should be resolved in favor of the application.\u201d <em>Lowe v. Zarghami, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>606, 629, 731 A.2d 14 (1999) (quoting <em>Feinberg v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot., </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>126, 135, 644 A.2d 593 (1994)) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">What constitutes extraordinary circumstances is not statutorily defined, and is determined on a case-by-case basis after consideration of the facts. <em>Lowe, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 626, 731 A.2d 14. For example, extraordinary circumstances can be found based on the severity of a party\u2019s injuries. <em>See Maher v. County of Mercer, </em>384 <em>N.J.Super. </em>182, 184, 189-90, 894 A.2d 100 (App.Div. 2006) (finding extraordinary circumstances where a plaintiff was hospitalized with a life-threatening infection, was in an induced coma and thereafter suffered from severe memory deficits). In determining whether extraordinary circumstances exist, \u201ca judge must consider the collective impact of the circumstances offered as reasons for the delay.\u201d <em>R.L. v. State-Operated Sch. Dist., </em>387 <em>N.J.Super. </em>331, 341, 903 A.2d 1110 (App.Div.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">We have also held that where discovering the identity of a responsible party is not thwarted by the original defendants, the issue becomes \u201cwhether plaintiff was diligent and made reasonable efforts to discover the identity of the true tortfeasor.\u201d <em>Leidy v. County of Ocean, </em>398 <em>N.J.Super. </em>449, 461, 942 A.2d 112 (App.Div. 2008). A key factor in determining whether a plaintiff acted with diligence in pursuing his or her claim is the promptness in contacting and retaining counsel to pursue plaintiffs rights. <em>Lowe, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 626-30, 731 A.2d 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Analogous to <em>Ma,her, </em>both Mendez and his passenger were hospitalized for a number of weeks and continued, at the time of the motion, to suffer memory deficits. Nevertheless, attorneys <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>were retained on their behalf within a month of the accident. Both attorneys served initial Tort Claims notices within the ninety-day period and certified to their multiple attempts, both within and after that time, to obtain the videotapes of the accident scene. It is undisputed the SJTA never responded to the numerous requests from Felix\u2019s attorney, and Mendez\u2019s attorney was unsuccessful in obtaining the tapes from the municipal prosecutor until October 19, 2009, which she promptly provided to Felix\u2019s attorney. Thus, through reasonable diligence, neither attorney was able to view the videotapes until mid-to-late October 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Plaintiffs contend the videotape provides the first basis for a potential claim against appellants. Felix\u2019s counsel describes his observations of the videotape, which are similarly described by Mendez\u2019s attorney as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">A careful review of the video shows the ambulance as it approaches the area of the Tunnel where the three SJTA trucks [were] parked in the left-hand shoulder. As the ambulance approaches the tracks, it moves from the left-lane of travel to the right-lane of travel directly in front of the Mendez vehicle. This lane change by the ambulance may have caused Mendez to take an evasive maneuver, which ultimately caused his vehicle to rotate and collide with the trucks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Appellants\u2019 position would encourage whimsical filings of Tort Claims notices to beat the ninety-day deadline. Absent the videotapes, the four-corners of the change report provided insufficient evidential support regarding the potential involvement of the ambulance in the accident. Due to the severity of them injuries, Mendez and his passenger had no recollection of the events leading up to the accident or the accident itself. There were no eyewitnesses, as no observations were made by the truck drivers or the other paramedic in Goffs ambulance. Goff did not observe Mendez\u2019s car and did not remember there being any vehicles in the right lane as he entered and proceeded through the tunnel. Although Goff stated to the trooper that he heard a \u201cloud noise\u201d when he passed the trucks, he attributed the noise to the snow plow being lowered to the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">Moreover, the trooper\u2019s report of the depictions from the second camera only described the ambulance passing the SJTA trucks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>and did not describe the ambulance\u2019s operation beyond that or any action taken by its driver. It also appears, based on plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 representations of the events depicted on the videotape, the trooper omitted the critical fact of the ambulance\u2019s lane change.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Rather than relying on a narrative of an officer\u2019s perception of a videotape, particularly in a situation where there were no eyewitnesses to the collision, we would expect a diligent attorney to view the videotape firsthand to be able to file a Torts Claims notice in good faith. There is no question plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys promptly and continuously sought to obtain the surveillance videotapes, with which they were not supplied until four and one-half months after expiration of the statutory deadline for filing Torts Claims notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Appellants further assert the burden is on plaintiffs to demonstrate that the public entity or public employee will not be \u201csubstantially prejudiced\u201d by the late claims notice. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>59:8-9 (providing that late-notice relief will be accorded only, if the public entity or its employee will not be \u201csubstantially prejudiced\u201d thereby). Appellants additionally contend that burden was not met. We again disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\"> We have construed the \u201csubstantial prejudice\u201d prong of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:8-9 as placing on the public entity the burdens of production and persuasion on the question of prejudice. <em>Blank v. City of Elizabeth, </em>318 <em>N.J.Super. </em>106, 114, 723 A.2d 75 (App.Div.), <em>aff'd as mod., </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>150, 742 A.2d 540 (1999). \u201cSubstantial prejudice in this context means substantial prejudice in maintaining one\u2019s defense,\u201d such as \u201cthe loss of witnesses, the loss of evidence, fading memories, and the like.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114-115, 723 A.2d 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">Appellants\u2019 sole assertion of prejudice is the passage of time. They contend they were \u201ctotally unaware of the accident\u201d and \u201clost a critical opportunity to engage in a timely investigation.\u201d We deem that insufficient. The fact of delay alone does not give rise to the assumption of prejudice; the public entity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>must present a factual basis for the claim of substantial prejudice. <em>Kleinke v. City of Ocean City, </em>147 <em>N.J.Super. </em>575, 581, 371 A.2d 785 (App.Div.1977). . Substantial prejudice must be shown by \u201cspecificity and not by general allegation____\u201d <em>Blank, supra, </em>318 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 115, 723 A.2d 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">We initially question appellants\u2019 ignorance of the accident as Goff was questioned the day after the accident. Nevertheless, there has been no representation that evidence has been lost. Photographs were taken of the damage to Mendez\u2019s vehicle and the SJTA truck.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, as there were no eyewitnesses to the accident, all pertinent information is still available to the defense as contained on the videotapes. The motions were also brought within a year of the accident, and thus within the one-year time period mandated by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:8-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Where there is no evidence in the record of prejudice to the public entity occasioned by the delay in filing the claim and extraordinary circumstances are shown, granting leave to file a late notice is appropriate, as it allows eases to be heard on their merits. <em>Maher, supra, </em>384 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 190, 894 A.2d 100; <em>Lowe, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 629, 731 A.2d 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b557-8\"> The orders do not accurately depict the court\u2019s decision, which does not reach the accrual issue. It is clear, however, the court granted relief to plaintiffs based on demonstrations of \"extraordinary circumstances\u201d under <em>NJ.S.A. </em>59:8\u2014 9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b557-9\"> Pursuant to <em>Rule </em>2:2-3(a)(3), effective September 1, 2006, superseding <em>Moon v.
