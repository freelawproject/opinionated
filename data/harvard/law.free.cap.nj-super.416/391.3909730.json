We affirm defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">Defendant was first convicted of DWI in 1994. On June 28, 2005, he entered a plea of guilty to a second charge of DWI in the Municipal Court of Gloucester Township. Because more than ten years had elapsed since his first DWI conviction, defendant was sentenced as a first offender pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">On July 1, 2008, defendant was again arrested and charged with DWI, this time in Hamilton Township. He was also charged with careless driving, reckless driving, failure to maintain his lane, and operating an unregistered vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-13\">The following facts were developed at trial and at a suppression hearing. At approximately 9:15 p.m. on July 1, 2008, Officer Eric Bittman of the Hamilton Township Police Department was dispatched to investigate a tip received by telephone that there was an erratic driver on the road. The tipster was an off-duty law enforcement officer for the Camden County Prosecutor\u2019s Office. Bittman located the vehicle, a Ford pickup, traveling eastbound on Route 322. Bittman observed the vehicle \u201cstraddling the fog line ... drift to the shoulder ... and cross the\u2014the two lane dividing lanes.\u201d Bittman activated his lights and sirens. The vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>\u201cdrifted over towards the shoulder, slowly drifted back, it did put its left-hand turn signal on and then it slowly drifted across both lanes, across the painted median, across both westbound lanes of travel and the shoulder, and finally turned into the parking lot of a restaurant along 322.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Bittman approached the vehicle and asked defendant for his credentials. Defendant\u2019s \u201cface appeared to be flush, his eyes were watery____ His speech appeared to be slurred.\u201d Although the two had never met, defendant said to Bittman: \u201cYou know who I am. You know where I\u2019m coming from.\u201d Bittman smelled a strong odor of alcohol coming from the vehicle. He asked defendant if he had consumed any alcoholic beverages. Defendant answered that he had \u201ca few.\u201d Sergeant Greg Ciambron arrived as backup, and the officers ordered defendant out of his vehicle to administer field sobriety tests. While stepping out, defendant grabbed the door of his truck for support and was \u201cstaggering, he had a very spread stance. It appeared he had a hard time just standing up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">Bittman asked defendant if he had any injuries or anything that would prevent him from performing the field sobriety tests, and defendant replied no. Defendant was unable to complete the one-leg stand test, dropping his foot after only a few moments on both attempts. Bittman then administered the walk-and-turn test, instructing defendant to take nine steps forward and nine steps back in a straight line in heel to toe fashion with his arms at his sides. Defendant did not walk heel to toe and raised his arms to gain balance several times. He was unable to walk in a straight line.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">Defendant was then arrested. Bittman could smell the odor of alcohol \u201cfilling\u201d his police car on the way to the station. Defendant was given an Alcotest, but the State did not present the test results in evidence at trial because the officer did not observe defendant for twenty minutes before administering the test, as required by <em>State v. Chun, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>54, 943 A.2d 114, <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 129 <em>S.Ct. </em>158, 172 L.Ed.2d 41 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Russell Dorris testified for the defense as a fact witness. Dorris worked with defendant and was with him on the night of the arrest. Dorris and defendant had gone to a bar named Platinum Playground at approximately 6:00 p.m. to fix a gas line and install a propane tank. They finished the job at 7:15 and went inside and had \u201ca couple drinks.\u201d The two left at about 9:00 p.m. Dorris did not have concerns about defendant driving because \u201che looked normal.\u201d He did not believe defendant was under the influence of alcohol. Dorris had been driving behind defendant when defendant was pulled over by Officer Bittman.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Defendant testified that, while at the Platinum Playground, he had three bottles of Budweiser and then three bottles of O\u2019Doul\u2019s, a non-alcoholic beverage. He said he was not drunk. Defendant admitted he could not perform the walk-and-turn test. He claimed he suffered from arthritis and psoriasis. He said when Bittman asked him if he had any injuries he answered no because he did not \u201chave any broken legs or sprained ankles or anything like that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The municipal court found defendant guilty of DWI and failure to maintain his lane. Defendant was sentenced as a third offender on the DWI charge to serve 180 days in county jail, his driver\u2019s license was suspended for ten years, and he was ordered to have an alcohol ignition interlock for one year. Fines and penalties were also imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Defendant filed for a trial de novo in the Law Division pursuant to <em>Rule </em>3:23. Judge Robert Neustadter of the Superior Court heard the case on April 2, 2009. Judge Neustadter also found defendant guilty of DWI, and he reimposed the same sentence as the municipal court on April 15, 2009, except that the lane violation was merged into the DWI charge. The custodial portion of defendant\u2019s sentence was stayed pending appeal. Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">On January 21, 2009, after his conviction in the municipal court but before the proceedings in the Law Division, defendant filed a petition for post-conviction relief (PCR) from his 2005 conviction in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>the Gloucester Township Municipal Court. That conviction had not been appealed, and defendant had completed that sentence at the time of his PCR petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">In his petition, defendant argued that the Gloucester Township court had failed to adhere to procedural safeguards in 2005 and failed to review penalties with defendant before accepting his guilty plea to DWI. He also argued ineffective assistance of counsel and insufficient evidence. After two postponements, defendant\u2019s petition was heard on June 2, 2009. The Gloucester Township Municipal Court granted defendant\u2019s petition in part and denied it in part. It issued an order on June 3, 2009, stating,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeZ\">[T]he plea entered in this court on June 28, 2005, remains in effect. However, this plea will not be evidential in sentencing on any violation under [N.J.S.A.] 39:4-50, and no court may use this plea to enhance the custodial aspects of any sentence imposed pursuant to [N.J.S.A] 39:4-50 arising after the date of the present plea\u2014 <em>i.e., </em>June 28,2005.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">We then granted defendant\u2019s application for emergent relief to remand to the Law Division to reconsider the Hamilton Township sentence following the granting of partial PCR in Gloucester Township. On June 18, 2009, Judge Neustadter denied defendant\u2019s application to change his sentence, stating that the Law Division is not bound by the order of municipal court. Judge Neustadter again stayed defendant\u2019s jail sentence pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">On appeal, defendant raises the following points:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\">A. HAMILTON TOWNSHIP</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-9\">I. THIS COURT SHOULD VACATE DEFENDANT\u2019S CONVICTION AND REMAND HIS CASE FOR A JURY TRIAL BECAUSE HE FACES MORE THAN SIX MONTHS IN JAIL AND SERIOUS QUASI-CRIMINAL AND CIVIL CONSEQUENCES IF CONVICTED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-10\">II.

The notice of appeal before us is only from the Hamilton Township conviction. The only issue cognizable on this appeal relating to the Gloucester Township conviction is whether the municipal court\u2019s order of June 3, 2009, could effectively control Judge Neustadter\u2019s sentencing of defendant as a third offender for his Hamilton Township conviction. We agree with Judge Neustadter that it could not.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">The June 3, 2009 order stated that defendant\u2019s 2005 conviction could not be used to enhance a custodial sentence on a subsequent conviction. In issuing that order, the municipal court judge did not find that defendant\u2019s 2005 conviction was \u201cuncounseled.\u201d In fact, there is no dispute that defendant was represented by an attorney for his Gloucester Township DWI charge. Nor did the judge conclude that defendant had received ineffective assistance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>of counsel in entering his guilty plea. Nevertheless, the municipal court granted partial relief to defendant, stating that the ruling was pursuant to <em>State v. Laurick, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>1, 575 A.2d 1340, <em>cert. denied, </em>498 <em>U.S. </em>967, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>429, 112 L.Ed.2d 413 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The PCR record does not include adequate reasons for the unusual order of June 3, 2009. We can discern from the brief oral statement of the judge that he granted partial relief to defendant only on the ground that defendant was not advised of \u201crights\u201d before he entered his plea of guilty to the DWI charge. Defendant, however, was aware of his right to assistance of counsel because he requested time to retain an attorney and did so before his guilty plea. In addition, the record does not demonstrate any other violation of defendant\u2019s rights, such as the right to remain silent. <em>See R. </em>7:3-2 (On first appearance, defendant must be advised of the charges against him, the penalties that apply, the right to remain silent, and the right to be represented by counsel even if indigent.).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The municipal court incorrectly relied on <em>Laurick, supra, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>1, 575 A.2d 1340, to grant partial relief to defendant. Nothing in that opinion authorizes a municipal court to order that a guilty plea with the assistance of counsel be excluded from enhancement of a subsequent sentence under the DWI statute. The Court in <em>Laurick </em>held that a defendant may not be sentenced to an enhanced period of incarceration based on a previous <em>uncounseled </em>conviction where the trial court failed to comply with court policy established in <em>Rodriguez v. Rosenblatt, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>281, 277 A.2d 216 (1971), to notify an indigent defendant of his right to counsel for a DWI offense. <em>Laurick, supra, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>at 16-17, 575 A.2d 1340. The Court did not hold that any alleged infirmity in a prior conviction would result in the same relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">In <em>State v. Hrycak, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>351, 877 A.2d 1209 (2005), the Court set forth the elements that a defendant must prove to avoid an increased sentence based on a prior conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-8\">As a threshold matter, the defendant has the burden of proving in a second or subsequent DWI proceeding that he or she did not receive notice of the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>counsel in the prior case.... In that vein, if defendant proves that notice of the right to counsel was not provided, the inquiry is then bifurcated into whether the defendant was indigent or not indigent. \u201c[I]f [the] defendant [was] indigent, [the defendant must prove that] the DWI conviction was a product of an absence of notice of the right to assignment of counsel and non-assignment of such counsel without waiver.\u201d On the other hand, if the defendant was not indigent at the time of the prior uncounseled conviction, [the] defendant should have the right to establish such lack of notice as well as the absence of knowledge of the right to be represented by counsel of one\u2019s choosing and to prove that the absence of such counsel had an impact on the guilt or innocence of the accused or otherwise wrought a miscarriage of justice for the individual defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\"><em>[Hrycak, supra, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>at 363, 877 A.2d 1209 (quoting <em>Laurick, supra, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>at 11, 575 A.2d 1340 (quotation marks omitted)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Essential to each potential contingency is the absence of counsel at the time of the earlier DWI conviction. Here, defendant has not claimed indigency, and he was represented by an attorney for the Gloucester Township charge. Furthermore, there was no finding of ineffective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">Even if grounds other than absence of counsel should be applied by analogy to the holdings of <em>Launch </em>and <em>Hrycak, </em>the transcript dated May 24, 2005, before defendant\u2019s plea in Gloucester Township, shows that defendant was informed of the penalties he faced on his charges, and he requested time to retain an attorney, which the court granted. On June 28, 2005, defendant appeared with his attorney and pleaded guilty to DWI. He was sentenced the same day as a first offender because of the passage of ten years since his 1994 DWI conviction. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>There is no evidence in the record before us that defendant was prejudiced in any manner as a result of the alleged failure to provide advice in the courtroom about defendant\u2019s \u201crights.\u201d Nothing in the record suggests that defendant was indigent and could not afford to hire an attorney. Moreover, there is no evidence that defendant was unaware of his right to stand trial or to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Additionally, in ruling on the PCR application, the municipal court itself said there was \u201cno indication from the defense that should this have been tried there may have been a different result.\u201d In other words, defendant\u2019s PCR petition failed to establish any prejudice as a result of the procedural deficiency, which in any event did not affect his right to counsel. Without a showing of prejudice, defendant was not entitled to set aside his Gloucester Township conviction, and the court so ruled. Defendant has not appealed that ruling.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Because defendant\u2019s Gloucester Township plea and conviction were not uncounseled, there was no basis under <em>Launch </em>and <em>Hrycah </em>to order that the conviction could not be considered for purposes of an increased sentence on a subsequent conviction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>We conclude that the municipal court\u2019s partial grant of PCR was contrary to law and was not binding on the Law Division in its assessment of the appropriate penalty to be imposed under the DWI statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Turning next to the Hamilton Township proceedings, defendant argues that he was entitled to a jury trial because he faced more than 180 days in jail. He contends that he could have been sentenced to 180 days for DWI, fifteen days for careless driving, sixty days for reckless driving, and up to seventy additional days if he was unable to pay the mandated fines.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">[A] jury trial is not required unless the maximum penalty to which the defendant is exposed exceeds six months incarceration and a fine of $1,000. Where factually related petty offenses are tried together whose maximum sentences total more than six months, and the defendant is not offered a jury trial, the sentences may not total more than six months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\"><em>[State v. </em>Hamm, 121 <em>N.J. </em>109, 112, 577 A.2d 1259 (1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>499 <em>U.S. </em>947, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>1413, 113 L.Ed.2d 466 (1991) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Upon conviction on DWI and the lane violation, defendant was sentenced to 180 days in jail. There was no violation of his Sixth Amendment right to a trial by a jury. <em>See Lewis v. United States, </em>518 <em>U.S. </em>322, 328, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>2163, 2167, 135 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>590, 596-97 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">Defendant argues next that the trial court\u2019s denial of his discovery requests before trial violated his due process rights. At the time of defendant\u2019s first appearance, his attorney requested \u201cto know what manual the officer considers authoritative so that I know which one to pull out of my library to prepare my cross examination of the officer.\u201d He also requested \u201ccopies of previous test administrations\u201d by the officer. In his brief on appeal, defendant claims the field sobriety test manual was relevant to the test\u2019s acceptance in the scientific community and its weight and admissibility at trial and that the prior test administration reports were relevant to the officer\u2019s credibility since \u201c[o]n rare occasions, certain officers may repeat either verbatim or with disturbing similarity the same observation from ease to ease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>We review the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s discovery requests under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Wilson v. Amerada Hess Corp., </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>236, 253, 773 A.2d 1121 (2001); <em>Connolly v. Burger King Corp., </em>306 <em>N.J.Super. </em>344, 349, 703 A.2d 941 (App.Div.1997); <em>State v. Ford, </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>44, 50, 572 A.2d 640 (App.Div.1990). \u201c[D]efendants\u2019 discovery in DWI eases is limited to those relevant items, within the limitations of <em>Rule </em>3:13-3(a), which there is a reasonable] basis to believe will assist a defendant\u2019s defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49, 572 A.2d 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Nothing prevented defense counsel from cross-examining the officer on the basis of manuals and treatises that defense counsel considered to be authoritative for field sobriety testing. The officer\u2019s training would not affect whether the particular testing methodology he used was reliable or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">As to prior police reports involving DWI suspects other than defendant, \u201callowing a defendant to forage for evidence without a <em>reasonable basis </em>is not an ingredient of either due process or fundamental fairness in the administration of the criminal laws.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s discovery rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Defendant also argues that admission of Officer Bittman\u2019s testimony that he was led to defendant\u2019s vehicle by a tip violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him because the off-duty officer was not called to testify at trial. Officer Bittman\u2019s testimony was originally offered during the suppression hearing to establish reasonable suspicion for making the motor vehicle stop. The parties agreed that the record of the suppression hearing would be incorporated into the trial record. There is no indication that the municipal court judge relied on the tip as substantive evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">On de novo review, the Law Division stated that the evidence of the tip was also admissible under the hearsay exception for present sense impression. <em>See N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(1). Because de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>fendant has not challenged that evidentiary ruling, we consider only defendant\u2019s constitutional argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Hearsay testimony violates a defendant\u2019s right to confront witnesses only when the out-of-court declaration is testimonial in nature and the declarant does not testify at the trial. <em>State v. Coder, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>451, 460-61, 968 A.2d 1175 (2009); <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>547 <em>U.S. </em>813, 822, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>2266, 2273-74, 165 L.Ed.2d 224, 237 (2006).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">Statements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. They are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax9y\"><em>[Coder, supra, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>at 460-61, 968 A.2d 1175 (quoting <em>Davis, supra, </em>547 <em>U.S. </em>at 822, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2273-74, 165 L.Ed.2d at 237).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">The tip in this case was from an off-duty law enforcement officer who was driving along defendant\u2019s route and observed his erratic driving. It was not a statement made during police interrogation to serve a future prosecution. The tip was given to assist the local police in meeting an ongoing emergency, an intoxicated driver on the road. Defendant\u2019s right to confrontation was not violated by admission of the off-duty officer\u2019s tip.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Defendant also argues that he was improperly sentenced as a third offender because his second conviction in 2005 occurred more than ten years after his first conviction. We rejected a similar argument in <em>State v. Burroughs, </em>349 <em>N.J.Super. </em>225, 793 A.2d 137 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>43, 803 A.2d 638 (2002). <em>See also State v. Ciancaglini, </em>411 <em>N.J.Super. </em>280, 288 n. 4, 986 A.2d 1, <em>certif. granted, </em>202 <em>N.J. </em>43, 994 A.2d 1039 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">Under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50a(3), when a defendant is convicted of a third DWI less than ten years after his second DWI conviction, the \u201cstep-down\u201d provision of the statute does not apply. The conviction is treated as a third offense for purposes of sentencing. <em>Burroughs, </em>349 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 227, 793 A.2d 137. \u201cHaving been granted leniency by virtue of the infraction-free lapse of time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>between the two earlier violations, the offender has received his reward for good conduct and is entitled to no farther consideration.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We find no reason to depart from our holding in <em>Burroughs. </em>Defendant was correctly sentenced as a third offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-9\"> Defendant asks this court to remand to the Gloucester Township Municipal Court for a hearing on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. He argues that \u201cthere is no record of the extent to which defense counsel reviewed discovery or constitutional rights to trial, confrontation, and testimony so as to determine whether Enright's plea was truly knowing and intelligent.\u201d He argues further that \"[t]he present record ... is silent about either the existence of discovery ... or Enright\u2019s knowledge and understanding of the significance of such discovery.\u201d These allegations are not sufficient to establish a prima facie case of ineffective assistance of counsel under the two-part test established by <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>668, 689-92, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2052, 2065-67, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, 694-96 (1984), and adopted by our courts in <em>State v. Fritz, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>42, 58, 519 A.2d 336 (1987), such that a hearing is warranted. See <em>State v. Preciose, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>451, 462, 609 A.2d 1280 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b430-7\"> We note that a factual basis for a plea of guilty is constitutionally required only where defendant accompanies the plea with a claim of innocence. <em>State v. Mitchell, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>565, 577-78, 601 A.2d 198 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Barboza, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>415, 421 n. 1, 558 A.2d 1303 (1989). Vacating a plea is only warranted where the error in taking the plea results in a \"manifest injustice.\u201d See <em>State v. Johnson, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>232, 237, 864 A.2d 400 (2005). Defendant showed no manifest injustice in his Gloucester Township plea, in particular, because he was represented, and there was a factual basis for his plea of guilty.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">Also, a claim based on insufficiency of evidence is not cognizable on a PCR petition because it can and should be raised on direct appeal. <em>See R. </em>7:10-2(b)(3) and (d)(1); <em>R. </em>3:22-3 and -4; <em>State v. Morales, </em>120 <em>N.J.Super. </em>197, 200, 293 A.2d 672 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>77, 299 A.2d 75 (1972); <em>see also State v. Murray, </em>315 <em>N.J.Super. </em>535, 539-40, 719 A.2d 190 (App.Div. 1998) (matters that could have been raised on direct appeal normally may not be considered in a PCR petition), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>240, 744 A.2d 131 (2000). In any event, such a claim is waived by a guilty plea. <em>See R. </em>3:9\u20143(f); <em>State </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>449, 470, 874 A.2d 546 (2005); <em>State v. Crawley, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>310, 316, 693 A.2d 859 (1997).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
