Although the law firms are principally located in Pennsylvania, each of them has bona fide offices in this State, and has one or more partners and associates admitted to the New Jersey bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-12\">Plaintiffs complaint arises out of allegedly negligent omissions by a patent attorney who had worked, in succession, at the two law firms. The complaint alleges that the patent attorney, who is now deceased, failed to assure that certain renewal fees necessary to maintain plaintiffs patent were paid to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cthe USPTO\u201d). Consequently, the patent expired, and plaintiff was unable to get it reinstated. As a result, plaintiff claims that it suffered economic harm in this State. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>The trial court dismissed the complaint because plaintiff had not served an affidavit of merit upon defendants in accordance with the time limits prescribed by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">On the circumstances presented by this record, we sustain the Law Division judge\u2019s legal conclusion that plaintiff was obligated to serve a timely affidavit of merit upon the defendant law firms. However, we vacate the dismissal order on equitable grounds, particularly because the case law in our State was unsettled to date as to whether an affidavit of merit is required in such circumstances, and the federal decisions on the subject attempting to apply New Jersey law have taken arguably divergent approaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">Plaintiff, Shamrock Lacrosse, Inc., is a New Jersey corporation that has its principal place of business in East Hanover Township in Morris County. Plaintiff is in the business of manufacturing and selling athletic apparel and equipment, with a particular emphasis on the sport of lacrosse. As part of its business, plaintiff manufactures specialized lacrosse sticks.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">Defendant Klehr, Harrison, Harvey, Branzburg &amp; Ellers, LLP (\u201cKlehr\u201d), is a large law firm with its principal offices in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Klehr is a limited liability partnership organized under Pennsylvania law. At the times relevant to this action, Klehr maintained a bona fide office in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, where one or more partners and associates admitted to the New Jersey bar principally conducted their law practices. Similarly, defendant Obermayer Rebmann Maxwell &amp; Hippel, LLP (\u201cObermayer\u201d), is a large law firm headquartered in Philadelphia. Obermayer is also a Pennsylvania limited liability partnership. At the times relevant to this action, Obermayer likewise maintained a bona fide office in Cherry Hill, where apparently several of its partners and associates admitted in New Jersey principally worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">A. <em>Plaintiffs Patent and Its Expiration Due To Non-Payment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>On August 2, 1994, Ron MaeNeil, an inventor, filed a patent application with the USPTO for a lacrosse stick head. The patent, number 5494297, (the \u201c'297 patent\u201d) was issued on February 27, 1996. Two months later, in April 1996, MaeNeil assigned the rights to the patent to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">In August 1997, plaintiff retained a patent attorney, Jeff Navon, Esq., and his law firm, defendant Klehr, to represent it before the USPTO concerning the '297 patent. At that time, another patent attorney, Scott J. Fields, Esq., was also employed at the Klehr firm. Both Navon and Fields worked out of Klehr\u2019s offices in Philadelphia. According to a letter in the record from Fields, plaintiff \u201cwas referred into [Klehr] via a contact of Jeff Navon and [was], prior to his [Navon\u2019s] departure, his client.\u201d That same letter from Fields further states that plaintiff specifically retained Klehr \u201cto pursue the matter of [a] reissue application [before the USPTO for the '297 patent].\u201d Plaintiff was pursuing the reissue application to cure a previous defect in the '297 patent, a defect that is not specified in the record or germane to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">After Navon departed from Klehr in 1999, Fields assumed the responsibility to represent plaintiff in connection with the reissue patent. At that time, Fields was an attorney licensed to practice before the USPTO, and admitted to the bar of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Fields also had passed the New Jersey bar examination and was admitted to practice in New Jersey in 1987. However, on October 26, 1989, the Supreme Court of New Jersey declared Fields ineligible to practice because of his non-payment of annual fees to the New Jersey Lawyer\u2019s Fund for Client Protection (\u201cClient Protection Fund\u201d), pursuant to <em>Rule </em>1:20-1 and <em>Rule </em>1:28-2. Fields did not thereafter cure the non-payment deficiency, so he continued to remain each year\u2019 after 1989 on the ineligibility list.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">In late August 1999, the first maintenance payment on the '297 patent was due in the USPTO office. After it did not receive that required maintenance fee, the USPTO sent a reminder notice in September 1999 to the address that it had on file for the '297 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>patent. The address was that of inventor MacNeil in Milton, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">On February 27, 2000, the '297 patent expired, due to the failure to pay the required maintenance fees to the USPTO. The limited record before us contains no indication of whether Fields was specifically notified of the patent\u2019s expiration at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">In May 2000, Fields left Klehr and joined Obermayer, at the latter\u2019s Philadelphia offices. The following month, June 2000, Fields filed a notice of change of firm with the USPTO to reflect his new professional affiliation. Subsequently, in January 2001, plaintiffs client file was transferred from Klehr to Obermayer, where Fields continued to serve as plaintiffs patent attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">On April 2, 2002, the USPTO granted an allowance for a reissue of the '297 patent, allowing the cure of the previously-identified defect. Apparently, this administrative action by the USPTO was a mistake, as the '297 patent actually had expired more than two years earlier, in February 2000, because of the non-payment of the maintenance fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">On October 22, 2002, the USPTO issued patent RE37,894E (the \u201creissue patent\u201d), ostensibly reissuing the '297 patent. Obermayer forwarded that reissue patent to plaintiff, along with a letter from Debbie A. Oshansky, a paralegal with the firm. Oshansky\u2019s letter advised plaintiff (apparently incorrectly) that the patent remained \u201cin force until October 22, 2019.\u201d Her letter also stated to plaintiff that Obermayer was \u201cnot responsible for the payment of annuities,\u201d and that \u201cthe payment dates have not been entered into [Obermayer\u2019s] computer.\u201d Receipt of Oshansky\u2019s letter was acknowledged by a return signature of Peter Rogers, plaintiffs company president, on October 30, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">There is no indication in the record, at least as it is presently developed, that any licensed New Jersey attorneys at Klehr or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Obermayer supervised Fields\u2019s work on plaintiffs patent. Nor is there any present indication that any other attorney at those firms who had been admitted to the New Jersey bar participated in plaintiffs representation. The record is silent as to which attorney or attorneys supervised Oshansky, the paralegal at Obermayer who sent plaintiff the October 2002 letter concerning the reissue patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Fields left the employ of Obermayer in 2003 and started his own firm, National IP Rights Center, LLC (\u201cNational\u201d), also based in Philadelphia. Plaintiff followed Fields to his new firm, severing its client relationship with Obermayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">In August 2003, the second maintenance fee on the '297 patent would have become due, had the patent not expired in February 2000. The grace period for a late payment of that second fee would have expired on February 27, 2004. Evidently this second maintenance fee also was never paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">On September 26, 2005, Fields\u2019s license to practice in New Jersey was administratively revoked by an order of the Supreme Court, pursuant to 2004 amendments to <em>Rule </em>1:20\u20141(d) and <em>Rule </em>l:28-2(c), because Fields had been on the ineligible list for a period of more than seven consecutive years. As a consequence of this revocation, Fields\u2019s membership in the New Jersey bar terminated. <em>See R. </em>l:28-2(c) (providing that \u201c[o]n the entry of a license revocation [o]rder pursuant to this <em>Rule, </em>the attorney\u2019s membership in the [b]ar of this State shall cease.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">In January 2007, plaintiff entered into negotiations with a third party on a potential contract involving the '297 patent. During the course of those negotiations, plaintiff discovered that the '297 patent had expired in 2000 and that its reissue patent was therefore invalid.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This adverse revelation aborted the contract negotiations between plaintiff and the third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Plaintiff then retained separate counsel\u2014apparently one not affiliated with Fields, Klehr, or Obermayer\u2014to attempt to reinstate the '297 patent with the USPTO. That effort ultimately proved unsuccessful, and plaintiff consequently lost its patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">On April 23, 2007, Fields died. In the aftermath of Fields\u2019s death, National dissolved as an entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">B. <em>Plaintiffs Complaint, Defendants\u2019 Answers and the Ensuing Motions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">After losing its patent, plaintiff filed a complaint in the Law Division on June 4, 2008, against Klehr, Obermayer, and National.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, plaintiff alleged that the law firms: (1) were negligent or grossly negligent in the preparation and protection of plaintiffs intellectual property; (2) breached their contractual obligations to represent plaintiff diligently before the USPTO; (3) committed legal malpractice in not diligently maintaining the '297 patent; and (4) breached their fiduciary duties owed to plaintiff as a client. Plaintiff did not name Fields, or his estate, as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">Obermayer filed an answer to plaintiffs complaint on July 29, 2008, asserting seventeen separate defenses. Among those defenses, Obermayer asserted that plaintiff failed to state a claim, was untimely in its filing of the claim, was comparatively negligent in the actions that resulted in the harm, and that Obermayer did not deviate \u201cfrom accepted professional standards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">On September 26, 2008, Klehr filed its own answer to the complaint. Klehr denied plaintiffs substantive allegations. It also presented numerous affirmative defenses, similar to those asserted by Obermayer. In addition, Klehr filed a demand for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>affidavit <em>of </em>merit pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:53A-27, and \u201creserved] the right to move to dismiss based upon plaintiffs failure to file\u201d such an affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Neither Obermayer nor Klehr filed a third-party complaint against Fields or his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">After three months of discovery, Klehr filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs complaint for lack of service of an affidavit of merit. The dismissal motion was filed by Klehr on January 9, 2009, some 104 days beyond the date of its answer and well beyond the 60-day affidavit deadline prescribed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-27. That same week, Obermayer, which had answered the complaint 162 days earlier, filed a cross-motion, likewise seeking to have the case dismissed for lack of an affidavit of merit. Both dismissal motions were initially returnable on February 20, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">While the dismissal motions were pending, a partner in the Dallas intellectual property law firm of Munck Carter, P.C., sent letters on behalf of plaintiff to defense counsel for Klehr and Obermayer, respectively. The letters requested defendants to identify, within their respective firms, the attorney or attorneys admitted to practice law in New Jersey who had engaged in the negligent conduct alleged in plaintiffs complaint. Klehr responded that Fields was the attorney in question, asserting that he was licensed in New Jersey at the time of the relevant events. Klehr further asserted that, as a partnership with several members who were licensed in New Jersey, Klehr itself should be treated as a \u201clicensed person\u201d under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">Obermayer similarly responded that it qualified as a \u201clicensed person\u201d under the statute, by virtue of its offices in New Jersey and its attorneys who are licensed in this state. Obermayer did not identify any particular attorney within its offices as the individual responsible for plaintiffs representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">Plaintiff opposed the dismissal motions, arguing that the Klehr and Obermayer law firms were not \u201clicensed persons\u201d for which an affidavit of merit was required under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-27. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>However, anticipating the possibility that the court might not adopt its legal argument of non-necessity, plaintiff filed a cross-motion on February 12, 2009, provisionally requesting leave to serve an affidavit of merit. The cross-motion was filed 190 days after Obermayer had filed its answer and 138 days after Klehr had filed its answer, beyond the 120-day maximum extended<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> time period set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">With its cross-motion, plaintiff supplied an affidavit of merit from John G. Fischer, an attorney who practices intellectual property law. Fischer is a partner in Storm LLP, a law firm in Texas. He is admitted to practice law in Texas, Colorado, the District of Columbia, and also before the USPTO. In his affidavit of merit, Fischer specifically averred that plaintiffs complaint for legal malpractice against both Klehr and Obermayer, alleging mishandling of the '297 patent, had a \u201creasonable probability of success.\u201d He further attested that \u201ca reasonable probability exists that the care, skill, or knowledge exercised or exhibited by [djefendants in the treatment, practice, and/or work that is the subject of the Complaint fell outside acceptable professional standards and/or practices.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">C. <em>The Motion Judge\u2019s Rulings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">After initially hearing oral argument on defendants\u2019 dismissal motions and plaintiffs cross-motion, the motion judge invited supplemental briefs. Among other things, the supplemental briefs addressed the impact, if any, of the court\u2019s failure to convene a case management conference under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ferreira v. Rancocas Orthopedic </em>Assocs., 178 <em>N.J. </em>144, 836 A.2d 779 (2003), which could have alerted plaintiff sooner to the potential need for an affidavit. The supplemental briefs also addressed whether the affidavit of merit statute applied to law firms in a situation where the individual lawyer within those firms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>accused of malpractice is not licensed in New Jersey. Additionally, as requested by the court, the supplemental briefs discussed the pertinent federal statutes and regulations governing the payment of patent maintenance fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Upon hearing a second round of oral argument, the motion judge granted defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the complaint for failure to serve an affidavit of merit. Simultaneously, the judge also denied plaintiffs cross-motion for leave to serve a late affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">In his bench ruling, the motion judge concluded that the defendant law firms should be treated as \u201clicensed persons\u201d under a \u201csensible construction\u201d of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-27. He noted that it would be \u201centirely anomalous\u201d to allow a plaintiff to evade the affidavit requirement by suing only the professional entities (here the law firms), and not the principals, partners, shareholders, and employees of those firms who actually provided the professional services in question. The judge found that the law firms should have the protection of the affidavit requirement when they are sued in New Jersey, even though the lawsuit grew out of the alleged negligence of an attorney who was licensed by, and physically located in, another state.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">The motion judge rejected plaintiffs contention that the \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d exception to the affidavit of merit statute applied. The judge observed that \u201clegally there is a complex statutory matrix involving these [renewal] fees ... under the patent laws as administered to patent grants from the [USPTO].\u201d Given that complex regulatory scheme, the judge ruled that the applicable standards of care for a patent attorney were \u201ccomplicated\u201d and \u201cnot something ... that would be within the ken of the average lay person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">The judge disagreed with plaintiffs argument that the complaint fell, at least in part, outside of the scope of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-27 because it substantively asserted various other causes of action in addition to legal malpractice. The judge described those other claims as \u201csimply labels for a cause of action, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>essence of which is one sounding in legal [malpractice.\u201d Citing the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Couri v. Gardner, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>328, 801 A.2d 1134 (2002), the judge found that the nature of the legal inquiry involved in all of the claims asserted by plaintiff was \u201cwhether [defendants] would have met their duty of care, whatever that may have been, the standard of care in advising a client in the field of patent and trademark law, patent law here specifically[&gt;] within the general heading of intellectual property.\u201d Consequently, the judge found that the affidavit of merit obligation applied to the entire complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Lastly, the judge determined that no \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d were present to excuse the lateness of plaintiffs affidavit of merit, notwithstanding the lack of a <em>Ferreira </em>conference. In this regard, the judge noted plaintiffs \u201csteadfast view until the 136th day after the ... due date for the affidavit of merit ... that there was no obligation on its part to file and serve an affidavit of merit.\u201d The judge reasoned that allowing plaintiff to serve a belated affidavit in this case would be inconsistent with the policies of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Based on these various determinations, the motion judge dismissed plaintiffs complaint with prejudice, as to both Klehr and Obermayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">D. <em>The Present Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">Plaintiff now appeals. Most fundamentally, plaintiff contends that the motion judge erred in his interpretation and application of the affidavit of merit statute. It argues that the defendant law firms do not fit the statutory definition of \u201clicensed persons\u201d because neither of those entities are, nor could they be, \u201can attorney admitted to practice law in New Jersey\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-26(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">Plaintiff further emphasizes that Fields, whose inattentive conduct allegedly caused the loss of its patent, was not authorized to practice law in New Jersey at the time of the operative events. Plaintiff urges that the defendant law firms should not derivatively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>benefit under the statute from Fields\u2019s prior admission to the New Jersey bar, given his inactivated status.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Furthermore, plaintiff reiterates on appeal its contentions that the need for any affidavit is excused here under the common knowledge exception, and also should be excused because of equitable considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">In response, defendants maintain that the motion judge\u2019s interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-26 to -29, and his application of the affidavit of merit requirement to the circumstances of this ease, was legally correct. They further argue that the strong public policies underlying the statute mandate that they and other comparable law firms headquartered outside of New Jersey\u2014having responsibly established bona fide offices in this State managed by attorneys duly admitted to the New Jersey bar\u2014deserve the full protections of the statute, at least in malpractice eases brought against them in our state courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">First enacted by the Legislature in 1995, the affidavit of merit statute imposes a special requirement upon plaintiffs bringing lawsuits claiming malpractice or negligence by certain enumerated professionals. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-26 to -29. The basic objective of the statute is \u201cto require plaintiffs in malpractice cases to make a threshold showing that their claim is meritorious, in order that meritless lawsuits readily could be identified at an early stage of litigation.\u201d <em>In re Petition of Hall, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>379, 391, 688 A.2d 81 (1997) (citing Peter Verniero, Chief Counsel to the Governor, <em>Report to the Governor on the Subject of Tort Reform </em>(Sept. 13, 1994)); <em>see also Couri, supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 333, 801 A.2d 1134. \u201cThe statute\u2019s essential goal is to put to rest unmeritorious and frivolous malpractice lawsuits at an early stage of litigation while allowing worthy claims to proceed through discovery and, if warranted, to trial.\u201d <em>Knorr v. Smeal, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>169, 176, 836 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>794 (2003) (citing <em>Palanque v. Lambert-Woolley, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>398, 404, 774 A.2d 501 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">To satisfy these policy objectives, \u201ca plaintiff must file an affidavit of merit within 120 days of the filing of the answer or face dismissal of the complaint with prejudice, absent some equitable justification.\u201d <em>Knorr, supra, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>at 176, 836 A.2d 794 (citing <em>Tischler v. Watts, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>243, 246, 827 A.2d 1036 (2003)). \u201cThe salutary benefit to both sides in eliminating a non-genuine malpractice claim early on [by requiring an affidavit of merit] is the conservation of resources. Plaintiffs and defendants should not be dragged through an expensive and burdensome discovery process ... if the plaintiffs cannot produce an expert to support their claims.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cIn this way, the resources and time of the parties will not be wasted by the continuation of unnecessary litigation.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-27 specifically prescribes that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-8\">In any action for damages for personal injuries, wrongful death or property damage <em>resulting from an alleged act of malpractice or negligence by a licensed person in kis profession or occupation, </em>the plaintiff shall, within 60 days following the date of filing of the answer to the complaint by the defendant, provide each defendant with an affidavit of an appropriate licensed person that there exists a reasonable probability that the care, skill or knowledge exercised or exhibited in the treatment, practice or work that is the subject of the complaint, fell outside acceptable professional or occupational standards or treatment practices. The court may grant no more than one additional period, not to exceed 60 days, to file the affidavit pursuant to this section, upon a finding of good cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-9\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-27 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">A \u201clicensed person\u201d is particularly defined in the statute as a defendant on an enumerated list of professionals, including \u201cany person who is licensed as ... <em>an attorney admitted to practice law in New Jersey.\u201d N.J.S.A </em>2A:53A-26(e) (emphasis added). If a plaintiff does not file and serve a timely affidavit of merit as required under the statute, \u201cit shall be deemed a failure to state a cause of action,\u201d thereby subjecting the malpractice complaint to dismissal. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Plaintiff asserts that Klehr and Obermayer are not \u201clicensed persons\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-27 entitled to the beneficial screening function provided by an affidavit of merit. Plaintiff argues that neither Klehr nor Obermayer qualifies as an \u201cattorney admitted to practice law in New Jersey\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-26(c). Rather, plaintiff contends, Klehr and Obermayer are legal organizations which, although staffed by individual attorneys, do not hold licenses to practice law. Plaintiff argues that the words in the statute, when given their plain meaning, protect only individual licensed attorneys, not the business entities for whom those attorneys work. Because Klehr and Obermayer are not covered by the statute, plaintiffs complaint against those law firms therefore was improperly dismissed for non-compliance with the affidavit requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">On the other hand, defendants emphasize that even though they are not, as entities, literally \u201cadmitted to practice law\u201d in New Jersey, they have properly established bona fide offices to serve clients in this State. Several of the attorneys who regularly work in those bona fide offices are admitted members of the New Jersey bar. By fully complying with the rules of practice to serve the public in New Jersey, defendants contend that they deseive to be treated under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-27, at least functionally if not literally, in the same manner as an individual lawyer who is a member of the New Jersey bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">Although a handful of reported opinions in our State applying the affidavit of merit statute have involved law firm defendants, and some decisions from the federal courts have dealt with similar or related issues, no New Jersey precedent has squarely resolved the applicability of the affidavit requirement to a scenario such as the one presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>In <em>Hyman Zamft &amp; Manard, L.L.C. v. Cornell, </em>309 <em>N.J.Super. </em>586, 591-95, 707 A.2d 1068 (App.Div.1998), we permitted litigants asserting malpractice claims against both a law firm and an attorney associated with that firm to tender a late affidavit of merit because of equitable factors. We did not treat the defendant law firm in <em>Hyman Zamft </em>any differently under the statute than the individual attorney co-defendant, nor did we discuss whether or not the firm constituted a \u201clicensed person.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Additionally, in <em>Diver v. Gross, Hanlon, Truss &amp; Messer, P.C., </em>317 <em>N.J.Super. </em>547, 550-51, 722 A.2d 623 (Law Div.1998), a legal malpractice ease brought against a defendant law firm and two co-defendant lawyers within that firm, the court considered only the timing of the allegedly negligent conduct, so as to determine whether the conduct occurred before or after the effective date of the affidavit of merit statute. In its analysis, <em>Diver </em>treated the law firm and the individual lawyers synonymously, without explicitly considering whether the firm should be considered beyond the purview of the statute. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Federal cases applying the affidavit of merit of statute are somewhat more instructive on the \u201centity defendant\u201d issue, although the eases are not uniform. For example, in <em>Martin v. Perinni Corp., </em>37 F.Supp.2d 362 (D.N.J.1999), the United States District Court applied the affidavit of merit statute to a claim of architectural malpractice arising out of a defective parking garage in Atlantic City. Plaintiffs, the estates of two sisters who died when their car dropped four stories within the garage, sued the project architect, Michael Demling (\u201cDemling\u201d), and his company, Michael Demling Associates (\u201cMDA\u201d). Demling and MDA moved to dismiss the negligence claims against them because plaintiff had not served a timely affidavit of merit. The District Court granted the motion, in an opinion by Judge Brotman.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">With respect to Demling himself, Judge Brotman noted in <em>Martin </em>that Demling was an architect licensed by the State of New Jersey, and thus covered by the affidavit of merit requirement under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-26(b). As to MDA, the entity defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>dant, Judge Brotman observed that not all corporations that perform architectural services in New Jersey need to obtain a license from the State Board of Architects, although their shareholders must be so licensed. Although MDA did not itself hold an architect\u2019s license, its principal, Demling, did. Given those circumstances, and considering the state courts\u2019 implicit application of the affidavit of merit statute to the entity defendants in <em>Diver, supra, </em>and <em>Hyman Zamft, supra, </em>Judge Brotman concluded that the affidavit requirement likewise extended to MDA. <em>Martin, supra, </em>37 F.Supp.2d at 366. The court inferred that \u201ca business organization whose leadership is composed of \u2018licensed persons\u2019 within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:53A-26 is also considered a \u2018licensed person\u2019 for purposes of the [affidavit of [m]erit statute.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">In reaching his legal conclusions in <em>Martin, </em>Judge Brotman underscored the public policies underpinning the affidavit of merit statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-7\">This result is consistent with the purpose of the [affidavit of [m]erit statute. <em>The statute was designed to require plaintiffs to make a threshold, showing that their claims have merit. It would thwart this purpose </em>to require plaintiffs who make negligence claims against architectural corporations organized under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:3-18 [which obtain architect licenses] to file affidavits of merit while excusing plaintiffs who make negligence claims against architectural corporations organized under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>14A:17-5 [which are not so licensed] from satisfying this requirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-8\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">A different outcome was reached two years earlier in another decision from the United States District Court, <em>RTC Mortgage Trust 1994 N-1 v. Fid. Nat\u2019l Title Ins. Co., </em>981 <em>F.Supp. </em>334, 347-50 (D.N.J.1997). In <em>RTC, </em>a Pennsylvania law firm having no offices in New Jersey provided an allegedly erroneous opinion letter to its client on the requirements of New Jersey law applicable to a real estate transaction involving acreage in Mount Laurel. <em>Id. </em>at 337. After financial harm resulted from the law firm\u2019s poor advice, the mortgage assignee, RTC, sued various parties, including a claim against the law firm for legal malpractice. The law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>firm moved, to dismiss the complaint for lack of service of an affidavit of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Applying New Jersey law in a diversity jurisdiction context, the District Court, in an opinion of Judge Orlofsky, found in <em>RTC </em>that the affidavit of merit potentially applied to the situation. However, the court held that the defendant law firm was not entitled to the protection of the statute because it was not a \u201clicensed professional\u201d in New Jersey at the time the legal advice was rendered. Although members of the law firm held themselves out as \u201cmembers of the bar of New Jersey,\u201d the firm had no office in New Jersey, and thus was in violation of the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cbona fide office\u201d requirement in effect at the time. <em>Id. </em>at 348 (citing <em>Rule </em>l:21-l(a) of the 1998 Court Rules, which then required licensed attorneys to maintain a bona fide office physically located within New Jersey). Consequently, the law firm was not qualified to practice law in New Jersey and the affidavit of merit statute should not apply. <em>Id. </em>at 348. Specifically, Judge Orlofsky stated that \u201can examination of the other categories of professions listed in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-26 reveals that behind the use of the term \u2018licensed\u2019 is a fairly clear legislative intent to reach those who could <em>lawfully </em>practice their professions in New Jersey.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 349 (emphasis added). The judge added the following policy observations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">Additionally, in limiting the instances where an affidavit of merit is required to those practicing within the parameters established by the New Jersey Supreme Court, <em>the statute may easily be read as providing a, \u201cshield\u201d available only to those othenvise complying with state-mandated prerequisites to practice. </em>Allowing those professionals who do not comply with such prerequisites to claim the protections of the statute seems, at best, anomalous, if not in direct contravention of the state\u2019s policies regarding professional qualifications.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 349 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">Apart from <em>Martin </em>and <em>RTC, </em>we have also considered the United States District Court\u2019s opinion in <em>In re Cendant Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>139 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>585 (D.N.J. 2001) <em>(\u201cCendant II\u201d), </em>a case relied upon here by plaintiff. Shareholders in Cendant Corporation (\u201cCendant\u201d) brought suit against various parties, including Ernst &amp; Young, LLP (\u201cE &amp; Y\u201d), an accounting firm that provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>services in connection with Cendant\u2019s merger. <em>See In re Cendant Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>109 F.Supp.2d 235, 239-40 (D.N.J.2000) <em>(\u201cCendant </em>/\u201d), <em>aff'd </em>264 F.3d 201 (3d Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied sub nom., Mark v. Cal. Pub. Employees Ret. Sys., </em>535 <em>U.S. </em>929, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>1300, 152 L.Ed.2d 212 (2002). The shareholders alleged that the company\u2019s directors and accountants had knowingly misstated earnings during the period when the merger was being contemplated and completed. <em>Id. </em>at 240. Cendant filed cross-claims against E &amp; Y, alleging, among other things, that E &amp; Y committed professional malpractice in preparing financial statements for the merger. <em>Cendant II, supra, </em>139 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>at 588. E &amp; Y moved to dismiss the claims of malpractice on the ground that Cendant had not filed an affidavit of merit. <em>Ibid. </em>In response, Cendant primarily asserted that, because Connecticut law should govern the federal ease, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-27 did not apply, and thus the cross-claim should not be dismissed. <em>Id. </em>at 601. Cendant also pointed out that, although E &amp; Y had a New Jersey office, that office apparently had nothing to do with the transaction, a merger between two Connecticut-based companies, which was serviced by accountants in E &amp; Y\u2019s Connecticut office. <em>Id. </em>at 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">In an opinion by Judge Walls, the District Court in <em>Cendant II </em>ruled, as a threshold matter, that Connecticut law applied to the matter. <em>Id. </em>at 603. Judge Walls found that the New Jersey affidavit of merit statute conflicted with relevant Connecticut laws, and therefore was inapplicable. <em>Id. </em>at 603-04. The judge specifically declined to address E &amp; Y\u2019s status as a \u201clicensed person\u201d under the statute, noting that \u201c[bjecause this [cjourt agrees with Cendant that the [affidavit of [m]erit statute is inapplicable, it need not address Cendant\u2019s other arguments why its state law claims are not barred by the [New Jersey] statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 601. In a footnote to that observation, the judge identified one of \u201cCendant\u2019s other arguments\u201d as \u201cthat E &amp; Y is not a \u2018licensed person\u2019 within the meaning of the [affidavit of merit] statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 601 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Hence, <em>Cendant II </em>provides us with little guidance, as it simply identifies issues of statutory interpretation under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-26 and -27 without actually deciding them. Moreover, the facts in <em>Cendant II </em>are dissimilar from the present case (as well as largely different from those in <em>Martin </em>and <em>RTC), </em>where the client injured by the alleged professional malpractice is from New Jersey and significant harm occurred within this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">In the absence of controlling precedent, we conduct our own examination of the statute and of the discrete circumstances before us. We perform that analysis mindful that the intent of the Legislature must be honored when construing a statute. \u201c \u2018The Legislature\u2019s intent is the paramount goal when interpreting a statute and, generally, the best indicator of that intent is the statutory language.\u2019 \u201d <em>Soto v. Scaringelli, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>558, 569, 917 A.2d 734 (2007) (quoting <em>DiProspero v. Penn, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>477, 492, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005)); <em>see also State v. Gandhi, </em>201 <em>N.J. </em>161, 167, 989 A.2d 256 (2010). A court should \u201c \u2018ascribe to the statutory words their ordinary meaning and significance, and read them in context with related provisions so as to give sense to the legislation as a whole.\u2019\u201d <em>Soto, supra, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>at 569, 917 A.2d 734 (quoting <em>DiProspero, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 492, 874 A.2d 1039). \u201cUltimately, a court\u2019s role when analyzing a statute is to give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent as evidenced by the \u2018language of [the] statute, the policy behind it, concepts of reasonableness and legislative history.\u2019 \u201d <em>D\u2019Ambrosio v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Senior Servs., </em>403 <em>N.J.Super. </em>321, 334, 958 A.2d 110 (App.Div.2008) (quoting <em>Johnson Mach. Co. v. Manville Sales Corp., </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>285, 303-04, 590 A.2d 1206 (App.Div.1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">We appreciate plaintiffs literal argument that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-26(c) statutorily defines a \u201clicensed person\u201d, in the context of a complaint for legal malpractice, as \u201can attorney admitted to practice law in New Jersey.\u201d We also recognize, as plaintiff emphasizes, that, under the <em>Court Rules </em>adopted by the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Court, individual attorneys, not law firms, are literally \u201cadmitted\u201d to practice law in this State. However, the <em>Rules </em>also recognize the lawful ability of attorneys to organize themselves in the practice of law in the form of various business organizations, such as law firm partnerships, limited liability companies, and professional corporations. <em>See R. </em>1:21-1A to -1C.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">It is an undeniable reality of the modern practice of law that attorneys ordinarily ply their craft within business entities. Those business entities have been created to serve clients more effectively, and also, in some respects, to limit the lawyers\u2019 personal liabilities to creditors as the risks of the profession have expanded. The days in which the private practice of law was almost exclusively populated by individual practitioners has long passed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That being so, we doubt that the Legislature intended to penalize the legal profession by confining the important protections of the affidavit of merit statute to single-attorney law offices.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">To be sure, individual attorneys admitted to the New Jersey bar are clearly embraced by the affidavit of merit statute by virtue of the definition in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-26(c). But, if plaintiff\u2019s reading of the statute were accepted, that individualized protection would provide no solace to a law firm that could have vicarious liability for the actions or inactions of the licensed attorneys employed by, or affiliated with, that firm. <em>See, e.g., Falzarano v. Leo, </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>315, 320, 635 A.2d 547 (App.Div.1993) (citing <em>Malanga v. Mfrs. Cas. Ins. Co., </em>28 <em>N.J. </em>220, 227, 146 A.2d 105 (1958)) (noting that \u201c[i]t is fundamental that every member of a partnership is jointly and severally liable for torts committed by other members of the partnership acting within the scope of the firm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>business, even though they do not participate in, or ratify, or have knowledge of such negligence or legal malpractice\u201d); <em>see also R. </em>l:21C-l(a)(l) (applying \u201c[a]ll provisions of the Uniform Partnership Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>42:1A-1 through 56\u201d to the practice of law by a limited liability partnership). Plaintiff presumably wishes to invoke principles of vicarious liability against Klehr and Obermayer to make those law firms financially accountable for the harm that Fields, or any of the law firms\u2019 other employees, caused by failing to assure that the '297 patent\u2019s renewal fees were timely paid to the USPTO.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Indeed, the wording of the affidavit of merit statute contemplates such potential vicarious liability. Section 27 of the statute makes the affidavit requirement applicable to \u201cany action for damages for personal injuries, wrongful death or property damage <em>resulting from, </em>an alleged act of malpractice or negligence by a licensed person in his profession or occupation[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:53A-27 (emphasis added). The provision\u2019s focus is on the resulting harm, not on the business forms of the named defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">The vicarious nature of the statute\u2019s intended effect was underscored in <em>Martin, swpra, </em>by Judge Brotman. The judge noted that the affidavit of merit requirement would apply even where an unlicensed person employed by a licensed professional negligently caused harm. As Judge Brotman aptly wrote, \u201c[bjeeause of the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior, </em>an affidavit [of merit] must also be provided where a negligent act committed by an unlicensed person in the course of his employment may be imputed to a licensed person.\u201d <em>Martin, supra, </em>37 F.Supp.2d at 365. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">Here, the errors or omissions that evidently led to the irrevocable loss of plaintiffs patent trace back to the time when Fields <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>represented plaintiff while he was employed by Klehr in 1999 and in the first few months of 2000, and thereafter at Obermayer from May 2000 through his departure from that latter firm in 2003.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> During that 1999-2003 period, Fields remained an attorney who had been \u201cadmitted to practice law in New Jersey.\u201d To be sure, he became ineligible to practice law in the courts of this State, or to engage in non-federal practice in New Jersey, because of his failure to pay annual fees to the Client Protection Fund. However, Fields was not disbarred during that critical time period. Instead, by operation of the express terms of the <em>Court Rules, </em>his \u201cmembership in the [b]ar of this State\u201d did not cease until September 26, 2005, when his license was revoked by the Supreme Court. <em>R. </em>l:20-l(d). The amendment authorizing such revocation for attorneys who had not paid their annual fees for seven consecutive years, <em>Rule </em>l:28-2(e), did not even come into effect until September 1, 2004, after the 1999-2003 conduct at issue in this lawsuit. <em>See </em>Pressler, <em>2005 N.J. Court Rules </em>at 256, <em>R. </em>l:20-l(d) (2005). We also note that in paragraph 12 of its complaint, plaintiff asserted that \u201c[p]rior to his death on or about April 23, 2007, Fields was licensed to practice law in both Pennsylvania and New Jersey, as well as registered to practice before the USPTO.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The fact that Fields was on the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s ineligible list while he was employed at Klehr and Obermayer did not necessarily mean that he was unauthorized to serve as plaintiffs patent attorney before the USPTO. A patent attorney is a designation exclusive to the federal patent bar. 37 <em>C.F.R. </em>11.6(a). In order to maintain eligibility to practice nationally as a patent attorney before the USPTO, the lawyer only needed to remain in good standing of the bar of one state. 37 <em>C.F.R. </em>ll.l.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>In this instance, it is undisputed that Fields maintained his admission in good standing at the relevant times in the bar of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. That active Pennsylvania license, coupled with Fields\u2019s ongoing federal credential as a patent attorney, allowed him to continue to represent clients before the USPTO, including plaintiff, notwithstanding his inactive status within the New Jersey bar. The Supreme Court of New Jersey, by virtue of the Supremacy Clause, could not compel a federal agency or the federal court to enjoin Fields from practicing in those federal fora.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Hence, this is not a scenario akin to <em>RTC, </em>in which there was an evasion of the applicable \u201cprerequisites to practice.\u201d <em>RTC, supra, </em>981 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">While Fields was still employed by Obermayer and a dispute had arisen concerning plaintiffs obligation to pay counsel fees, in light of Fields\u2019s inactive New Jersey status, Fields sent a letter to plaintiff on July 18, 2001. In that letter, Fields \u201cemphatically state[d] that the work [he] performed for [plaintiff] was pursuant to [his capacity] as a registered patent attorney and member of the Pennsylvania bar.\u201d Fields added that he \u201cwant[ed] to make it abundantly clear,\u201d notwithstanding his inactive status in the New Jersey bar, \u201cthat in no way has [his] representation of [plaintiff] been anything other than a proper representation of clients before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Because, as plaintiff conceded in its complaint, Fields was authorized to practice before the USPTO as a patent attorney and to represent a New Jersey client in that capacity, the affidavit of merit statute most sensibly should be construed to treat the law firms by whom Fields was so employed as \u201clicensed persons\u201d covered by the affidavit of merit statute. This conclusion is bolstered by the fact that both law firms, Klehr and Obermayer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>had lawfully established branch offices in this State staffed by resident attorneys admitted to the New Jersey bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">We are not confronted here with a situation in which there was a surreptitious endeavor to evade or abuse the Supreme Court\u2019s practice requirements. Indeed, since 2004 the Court has relaxed the bona fide office rule so as to only require the licensee to maintain a qualified physical office in some state, not necessarily in New Jersey. <em>R. </em>l:21-l(a). <em>See </em>Pressler <em>Current N.J. Court Rules </em>at 331, comment 1 to <em>R. </em>1:21-1 (2010). Additionally, as in <em>Martin, </em>it has been represented to us, and not factually controverted by plaintiff, that one or more attorneys within each law firm\u2019s leadership was stationed in Cherry Hill. That added New Jersey nexus strengthens the propriety of requiring an affidavit of merit in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Considering the record as a whole, we are persuaded that the Legislature would not have intended this scenario to be exempted from the rigors of the affidavit of merit requirement. As the motion judge rightly observed, it would be \u201centirely anomalous\u201d to allow a plaintiff to circumvent the affidavit requirement by naming only law firms as defendants in a legal malpractice complaint and not the individual attorneys who performed the services. A statute should not be read in a crabbed fashion that leads to anomalous results. <em>Cesare v. Cesare, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>394, 405, 713 A.2d 390 (1998). The \u201csalutary benefit\u201d of the affidavit of merit\u2014in winnowing out unfounded malpractice claims, and in reducing burdens on parties, counsel, witnesses, jurors, and our publicly-funded state court system\u2014logically should apply to this case. <em>Knorr, supra, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>at 176, 836 A.2d 794.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">We need not imagine or resolve today other hypothetical situations that might warrant a different analysis of the statute\u2019s applicability. Our holding should not, for example, lead to an automatic inference that all out-of-state law firms with bona fide offices or resident attorneys in New Jersey will be entitled to the protection of the affidavit of merit statute in any legal malpractice cases brought against such firms arising out of the conduct of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>attorney employed by such firms, regardless of that attorney\u2019s state(s) of licensure. Nor does this opinion resolve the question of whether the statute would protect an attorney on the Supreme Court\u2019s ineligibility list who, unlike Fields, was not functioning as a patent attorney, but who instead was unlawfully representing clients in the state courts or in non-patent matters. Also, our disposition is limited to the necessity of an affidavit of merit in the discrete context of legal malpractice, and does not resolve the need for an affidavit in situations involving claims against the various business organizations of other licensed professionals. These and other hypothetical scenarios must await another day, or, alternatively, the prospect of legislative clarification through an amendment to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">By no means do we intend our analysis to discourage attorneys admitted to the New Jersey bar from paying their annual fees to the Client Protection Fund. Those fees must be paid, as the <em>Court Rules </em>require, in order for an attorney to maintain his or her good standing to practice law in this State, unless such practice is otherwise authorized by federal law. In the present ease, we have a distinctive circumstance in which Fields, as a duly-licensed patent attorney, could represent New Jersey clients lawfully before the USPTO without continuing to pay his annual fees to the Client Protection Fund. Because of that special USPTO status, the fact that Fields was on the New Jersey ineligible list is not dispositive of plaintiff\u2019s claims that an affidavit was not necessary. If, on the other hand, Fields had strayed from the boundaries of patent representation, and, in performing such tasks, caused harm to a New Jersey client, the need for an affidavit in that situation is far less apparent. In any event, we need not conclusively address such nuances here, except to caution New Jersey practitioners not to presume that ignoring their fee payment responsibilities will be inconsequential under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">We therefore affirm the motion judge\u2019s determination that the affidavit of merit statute applies to defendants Klehr and Ober-mayer in the particular setting of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>We also reject, substantially for the reasons that the judge recited in his bench opinion, plaintiffs alternative argument that the affidavit of merit does not apply to its complaint because of the common knowledge doctrine. Although the parties agree that this state court has subject matter jurisdiction over the issues in this case,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the milieu of the alleged malpractice, involving technical matters such as patent registration fees,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> takes this case well out of the ken of an average juror. <em>Hubbard ex. rel. Hubbard v. Reed, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>387, 394, 774 A.2d 495 (2001). We likewise concur with the trial court\u2019s application of the affidavit of merit statute to all of the claims asserted in the complaint, including those asserting more extreme forms of negligence or breach of duty. <em>Couri, supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 338-39, 801 A.2d 1134.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Having concluded that the affidavit of merit obligation applies here as a matter of law, we turn to questions of remedy. Plaintiff argues, among other things, that it equitably should be excused from not tendering a timely affidavit because the trial court did not seasonably conduct a case management conference pursuant to <em>Ferreira, supra, </em>before the date upon which the affidavit would have become due. We need not adopt or reject that argument under <em>Ferreira </em>because there are independent and sufficient equitable grounds for affording plaintiff relief, partieu-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>larly the unsettled state of the law at the time that defendants\u2019 answers were filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">As we have already noted, until the instant opinion, there was no controlling precedent in our State\u2019s published case law providing a clear answer as to the necessity of an affidavit in a comparable scenario. The non-binding federal cases of potential relevance applying New Jersey law were not factually identical to the present case, and those cases arguably pointed to disparate results. <em>Compare RTC, supra, </em>981 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 347-50 (finding the affidavit of merit statute inapplicable to the defendant law firm) <em>with Martin, supra, </em>37 F.Supp.2d at 366 (finding the affidavit necessary). Although we ultimately were not persuaded by the legal arguments advanced by plaintiff for its interpretation of the statute, those arguments were not frivolous or insubstantial. We further note Fields\u2019s disavowal of active New Jersey licensure in his July 18, 2001 letter to plaintiff, an assertion which plaintiff could reasonably (albeit, in light of today\u2019s holding, mistakenly) have relied upon in initially assuming that an affidavit of merit was not required in this case. We also are mindful that plaintiff belatedly tendered in the Law Division an affidavit of merit, the contents of which have not been assailed by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Given the sparse and murky nature of prior decisional law, and the arguable ambiguity of the statute, we conclude in this unique setting that the dismissal orders entered by the trial court against both Klehr and Obermayer should be equitably vacated, and that the interests of justice require that the case be remanded for discovery and other further proceedings. <em>See Tischler, supra, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>at 246-47, 827 A.2d 1036 (noting that equitable factors may be applied in appropriate exceptional instances to excuse strict compliance with affidavit of merit requirements).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b35-11\"> The limited record before us does not indicate whether MacNeil forwarded the USPTO's reminder notice to plaintiff or Klehr, or whether he otherwise alerted them to the non-payment problem.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b36-10\"> The invalidity of the reissue patent is not disputed for the purposes of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b37-11\"> Plaintiff was unable to perfect service upon National, a defunct entity. Consequently, its claims against National were dismissed by the court pursuant to <em>Rule </em>1:13-7 for lack of prosecution.

As of 2008, about one-third of the 34,154 attorneys in private practice in New Jersey identified themselves as solo practitioners. Office of Attorney Ethics, <em>2008 State of the Attorney Disciplinary System Report </em>119 (2009). That statistic does not signify, however, that the Legislature intended to limit the affidavit of merit statute, a sweeping tort reform measure, to law practices that are so organized.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b51-9\"> Our comments should not, of course, be construed as any definitive ruling as to whether Klehr or Obermayer actually has vicarious liability for the errors and omissions that have been alleged in this case. Such a determination would require factual development and appropriate findings in the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b52-6\"> We ignore any potential negligence by Fields subsequently at National, since it is defunct and no longer a party to the litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b52-7\"> Under 37 <em>C.F.R. </em>11.6(b), any individual who fulfills the technical and character requirements, but is not an attorney, may serve as a \"patent agent\" before the USPTO.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b53-8\"> <em>Cf.
