K.A., </em>413 <em>N.J.Super. </em>504, 996 A.2d 1040 (App.Div.2010). Relying upon <em>K.A., </em>C.H. argues that we: (1) erred in not applying the standard established in <em>K.A.; </em>(2) erred in \u201caccepting the Director\u2019s findings, which were arbitrary and unreasonable, and relying upon previous unsubstantiated allegations as evidence of prior abuse\u201d; and (3) committed reversible error in relying so heavily on Doctor Vitale\u2019s report, which was not properly admitted. We grant reconsidera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>tion and conclude that <em>K.A. </em>is factually distinguishable and therefore reaffirm the Director\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">In <em>K.A. </em>we found that a mother who struck her child several times on the shoulder, causing visible bruises after the child refused to complete her homework and to remain in her room during a \u201ctime out\u201d punishment, did not inflict excessive corporal punishment within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21(e)(4)(b). Rather, we found the record demonstrated that the mother\u2019s use of corporal punishment was an \u201cisolated event\u201d and \u201cthe type of incident that appears to be aberrational to this family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">In <em>K.A., </em>we reiterated that \u201c \u2018[t]he main goal of Title 9 is to protect children,\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 511, 996 A.2d 1040 (quoting <em>G.S. v. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>161, 176, 723 A.2d 612 (1999)). Hence, resolving whether abuse has occurred focuses upon the harm to the child \u201crather than the mental state of the accused abuser[.]\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Nonetheless, the factors we considered before reaching our conclusion that K.A had not inflicted excessive corporal punishment upon her daughter examined KA\u2019s conduct, including: \u201c(1) the reasons underlying KA\u2019s action; (2) the isolation of the incident; and (3) the trying circumstances which KA was undergoing due to [her ehild]\u2019s psychological disorder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 512, 996 A.2d 1040. We stated that these factors \u201cform the prism through which we determine whether KA\u2019s actions were indeed \u2018excessive.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Here, we considered similar factors. Not only did C.H. inflict corporal punishment upon T.H. multiple times during the underlying incident, but unlike in <em>KA, id. </em>at 508, 996 A.2d 1040, C.H. struck T.H. in multiple locations, including a vulnerable area. The school nurse observed red demarcations on the right side of T.H.\u2019s face, three to four inches long, and also observed dark red scratches, two inches in length, on T.H.\u2019s right elbow and left cheek, as well as a greenish demarcation on the middle of the child\u2019s back. Athough denying responsibility for any of the injuries the school nurse observed, C.H. admitted that she did spank T.H. for reporting to a neighbor that they did not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>electricity, an explanation the Director concluded was completely unreasonable and did not justify inflicting corporal punishment upon a five-year-old child. C.H. also admitted to inflicting corporal punishment upon T.H. when the child was as young as three years old and continuing to do so once or twice per month as her way to ensure that T.H. would not \u201cend up on the streets or doing drugs.\u201d The Director found C.H.\u2019s conduct established a \u201cpattern of corporal punishment on such a young child [that] is troubling and, when considered in concert with [the underlying] matter,\u201d provided \u201cample support to uphold this substantiation.\u201d Finally, C.H. exhibited no remorse for her conduct and was not receptive to any counseling recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">These facts demonstrated that T.H.\u2019s \u201cphysical, mental, or emotional condition ... is in imminent danger of becoming impaired as the result of the failure of [C.H.] ... to exercise a minimum degree of care ... by unreasonably inflicting ... excessive corporal punishment\u201d upon C.H. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">The remaining points raised in the motion for reconsideration are without sufficient merit to warrant further discussion beyond the following brief remarks. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(D) and (E). Dr. Vitale\u2019s report was admitted without objection. Contrary to C.H.\u2019s assertion, the Director did not rely exclusively upon Dr. Vitale\u2019s report in reaching her decision. The Director considered other competent evidence, including C.H.\u2019s admission that she previously used corporal punishment to discipline her daughter as early as when the child was three years old. Hence, there was sufficient credible evidence in the record establishing that the underlying incident was not an isolated event.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">We are satisfied that our decision in the within matter fully comports with the law and therefore we reaffirm our decision affirming the Director\u2019s determination that C.H. committed an act of child abuse as defined by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21(c)(4)(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
