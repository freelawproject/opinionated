The facts underlying this case are so uniquely challenging that they have the feel of an academic exercise, designed by a law professor to test the limits of a student\u2019s understanding of probate law. But this case is not, of course, a mere didactic exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">We are confronted here with the real life story of Louise R. Macool, a woman who sadly died before she had the opportunity to definitively indicate whether the document drafted by her attorney accurately reflected her wishes as to the disposition of her estate. In this context, our task is to determine whether the Chancery Division correctly construed and applied the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. SB-.S-3.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>After examining the record developed before the trial court, we affirm the court\u2019s judgment declining to admit into probate a will that was not reviewed by decedent before her demise. We reject, however, the part of the court\u2019s ruling that construes <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:3-3 as requiring that the writing offered as a will under the statute bear in some form the signature of the testator as a prerequisite to its admission to probate. On the question of counsel fees, we affirm the court\u2019s decision granting plaintiffs application for fees under <em>Rule </em>4:42-9(3), but remand for the court to reconsider the amount of the award.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">As correctly found by the trial court, the salient facts of this case are undisputed. Louise and Elmer Macool were married for forty years; this was, for both, their second marriage. Although they did not have biological children together, Louise raised Elmer\u2019s seven children from his prior marriage as if they were her own. These children are defendants Muriel Carolfi <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Michael Macool, as well as James Macool, William Macool, Helen Wilson, Isabel Macool, and Mary Ann McCart. In addition to her seven step-children, Louise also had a very close relationship with her niece, plaintiff Mary Rescigno, whose mother died in childbirth.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">Attorney Kenneth Calloway drafted wills for both Elmer and Louise Macool. On September 13, 1995, Louise executed a will naming her husband Elmer as the sole beneficiary of her entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>estate, and also naming her seven step-children, step-granddaughter Theresa Stefanowiez,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and step-great-grandson Alexander Ste-fanowicz<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as contingent beneficiaries. Elmer Macool was named as executor of her estate, and her stepsons James and Michael Macool were named as contingent eo-exeeutors.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">On May 23, 2007, Louise executed a codicil to her will naming her stepchildren Muriel Carolfi and Michael Macool as contingent co-executors. Calloway drafted and witnessed both the September 13,1995 will and the May 23, 2007 codicil.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Elmer Macool died on April 26, 2008. Less than a month later, on May 21, 2008, Louise went to Calloway\u2019s law office with the intent of changing her will. Toward that end, she gave Calloway a handwritten note that read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\">get the same as the family <em>Macool gets </em>Niece</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">Mary Rescigno [indicating address] If any thing happen[s] to Maiy Rescigno[,] her share goes to he[r] daughter Angela Rescigno. If anything happen[s] to her it goes to her 2 children. 1. Nikos Stylon 2. Jade Stylon</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-9\">Niece + Godchild LeNora Distasio [indicating address] if anything happe[ns] to [her] it goes back in the pot</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-10\">I [would] like to have the house to be left in the family Macool.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-11\">I [would] like to have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-12\">1. Mike Macool [indicating address]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-13\">2. Merle Caroffi [indicating address]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-14\">3. Bill Macool [indicating address]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-15\">Take</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-16\">According to Calloway, after discussing the matter with Louise and using her handwritten notes as a guide, he \u201cdictated the entire will while she was there.\u201d Either later that afternoon or the next morning, Calloway\u2019s secretary typed a draft version of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Louise\u2019s will, with the word \u201cRough\u201d handwritten on the top left corner of the document. When asked to explain what the word \u201crough\u201d meant in this context, Calloway indicated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">I meant ] it was the rough will. It had not been reviewed by me to make changes if I deemed any changes had to be made from what I believed I dictated. And I had reviewed it but I never got a chance to even tell my secretary to do it up and let\u2019s move.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">The draft will names as residuary beneficiaries<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Louise\u2019s nieces Mary Reseigno and Lenora Distasio, as well as all of her stepchildren, Theresa Stefanowiez, and Alexander Stefanowicz. Although the draft will substantially reflects Louise\u2019s handwritten notes, it does not provide a statement naming Angela Reseigno\u2019s two children as contingent beneficiaries of Rescigno\u2019s share of the estate. In addition, the draft makes only an oblique reference to the provision in the handwritten document to keep the house \u201cin the family Macool,\u201d stating that \u201cMichael Macool, Merle Caroffi, and William Macool be responsible to maintain ... and to <em>try </em>to keep the home in the family <em>as long as possible.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">Louise left Calloway\u2019s office with the intention of having lunch nearby. Calloway expected her to make an appointment to review the draft will sometime after he had reviewed it. Sadly, Louise died approximately one hour after her meeting with Calloway. She thus never had the opportunity to see the draft will.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">This matter came before the trial court as an action filed by plaintiff Mary Reseigno seeking to invalidate decedent\u2019s 1995 will and 2007 codicil, admit into probate the 2008 draft will that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>decedent neither read nor signed before her death, and for an award of counsel fees pursuant to Rule 4:42-9(a)(3).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The case was tried before the Chancery Division in one day. In addition to plaintiffs testimony, the court also heard from decedent\u2019s step-daughters Helen Wilson, Mary Ann McCart, and Isabel Macool. Decedent\u2019s step-granddaughter Theresa Stefanowicz submitted an affidavit urging the court to recognize the May 21, 2008 draft will and handwritten notes as Louise\u2019s will. Calloway testified as to his history of service to the Macool family, his preparation of both the 1995 will and the 2007 codicil, and his meeting with decedent on May 21, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Plaintiffs principal argument in support of her position is grounded on <em>N.J.S.A </em>3B:3-3, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">Although a document or wilting added upon a document was not executed in compliance with <em>N.J.S.A </em>3B:3-2, the document or wilting is treated as if it had been executed in compliance with <em>N.J.S.A </em>3B:3-2 if the proponent of the document or wilting establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the decedent intended the document or writing to constitute: (1) the decedent\u2019s will; (2) a partial or complete revocation of the will; (3) an addition to or an alteration of the will; or (4) a partial or complete revival of his formerly revoked will or of a formerly revoked portion of the will.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">The trial court issued a comprehensive oral decision rejecting plaintiffs argument that the 2008 draft will met the requirements of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:3-3. As a threshold issue, the court found that plaintiff had established, by clear and convincing evidence, \u201cthat as of the moment Ms. Macool met with Mr. Calloway it was her intention to have her testamentary plan altered to include Ms. Rescigno and Ms. Distasio.\u201d However, the court found insufficient evidence from which to conclude that decedent intended the particular draft document that Calloway prepared to be her will. Although this ruling conclusively disposed of plaintiffs claims, the court nevertheless construed <em>N.J.S.A </em>3B:3-3 \u201cas requiring that any document which is going to be treated as a will based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>provisions of those statutes had to have been executed or signed in some fashion by the testator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Plaintiff now argues that decedent clearly expressed her testamentary intent through the handwritten notes she gave to Callo-way. According to plaintiff, this writing formed the basis of Calloway\u2019s draft will. Although this draft document was not read by decedent, plaintiff nevertheless argues that it should be admitted under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:3-3 because it was dictated in her presence and comports in all material respects with decedent\u2019s testamentary wishes. Plaintiff also argues that the trial court erred in interpreting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:3-3 as requiring that the proposed document be executed or otherwise signed in some fashion by the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">We will start our analysis by acknowledging that this is the first time an appellate court in this State has reviewed <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:3-3 in a published opinion. We thus plow this virgin soil guided by our jurisprudential experience and mindful that, in addition to discerning the intent of the Legislature, <em>Bd. of Educ. of Sea Isle City v. Kennedy, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>1, 12, 951 A.2d 987 (2008), a court\u2019s duty in probate matters is \u201cto ascertain and give effect to the probable intention of the testator.\u201d <em>Fidelity Union Trust v. Robert, </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>561, 564, 178 A.2d 185 (1962) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">The trial court found that plaintiff failed to establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that the draft will prepared by Calloway met the requirements for admissibility to probate under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:3-3. In so doing, the court focused on the statutory language requiring \u201cthe proponent of the document or writing [to establish] by clear and convincing evidence that the decedent intended <em>the document or writing </em>to constitute [her will].\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Before we address the court\u2019s ruling with respect to the draft will, we must first distinguish decedent\u2019s handwritten notes from what was once commonly referred to as a \u201cholographic will.\u201d <em>See In re Will of Smith, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>257, 262, 528 A.2d 918 (1987). Under <em>N.J.S.A </em>3B:3-2a, a will must meet three specific requirements: it must be \u201c(1) in writing; (2) signed by the testator or in the testator\u2019s name by some other individual in the testator\u2019s conscious presence and at the testator\u2019s direction; and (3) signed by at least two individuals, each of whom signed within a reasonable time after each witnessed either the signing of the will as described in paragraph (2) or the testator\u2019s acknowledgment of that signature or acknowledgment of the will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Under the current provisions in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:3-2b, \u201c[a] will that does not comply with [the requirements of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:3-2a] is valid as a writing intended as a will, whether or not witnessed, if the signature and material portions of the document are in the testator\u2019s handwriting.\u201d Stated differently, a so-called holographic will must have all material testamentary provisions in the handwriting of the testator and must also be signed by the testator. Here, although decedent\u2019s handwritten notes arguably meet the first requirement, they fail to meet the second one because decedent did not sign her notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">We next address plaintiffs argument that under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:3-3, the draft will should be admitted because thei\u2019e is clear and convincing evidence that decedent intended this document to constitute her will, or alternatively, a partial revocation of her prior will. In addressing this argument, we distinguish between evidence showing decedent\u2019s general disposition to alter her testamentary plans and evidence establishing, by clear and convincing evidence, that decedent intended the draft will prepared by Callo-way to constitute her binding and final will.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">In this respect, we agree with the trial court that the record clearly and convincingly shows that decedent intended to alter her testamentary plan to include Rescigno and Distasio when she met with Calloway in 2008. Decedent\u2019s handwritten notes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Calloway\u2019s testimony, and the draft will itself all support this finding. <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974). The court found, however, that plaintiff failed to establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that decedent intended the document denoted by Calloway as a \u201crough\u201d draft to be her last and binding will. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Decedent\u2019s untimely demise prevented her from reading the draft will prepared by her attorney. She never had the opportunity to confer with counsel after reviewing the document to clear up any ambiguity, modify any provision, or express her final assent to this \u201crough\u201d draft. Indeed, Calloway testified that although decedent\u2019s handwritten notes named Angela Reseigno\u2019s two children as contingent beneficiaries, he intentionally did not include them in the draft will because it was his practice to exclude \u201ca third generation unless she told me that the first two were very old.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The trial court treated this omission as a minor discrepancy. We view it as evidence that this document was a work in progress, subject to reasonable revisions and fine tuning. Calloway\u2019s customary procedure or \u201cpractice\u201d notwithstanding, decedent\u2019s notes clearly indicate that she wanted these two children specifically named as contingent beneficiaries. We have no way of knowing whether decedent would have approved of Calloway\u2019s approach or insisted that her wishes be strictly followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">We reach a similar conclusion with respect to Calloway\u2019s attempt to include in the draft will two items specifically mentioned in decedent\u2019s notes: a provision keeping decedent\u2019s house \u201cin the family Macool;\u201d and a provision referencing Mike Macool, Muriel Carolfi (or \u201cMerle Carofi,\u201d as written) and Bill Macool. We recognize that decedent\u2019s intentions with respect to these two items are unclear. It is precisely this lack of clarity that renders their inclusion in the draft will problematic. We do not know what practical arrangement or ownership concept decedent envisioned to keep the house \u201cin the family Macool.\u201d Although the will drafted by Calloway reflects one possible interpretation of decedent\u2019s otherwise cryptic and ambiguous reference, we cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>conclude, with any degree of reasonable certainty, that this approach would have met with decedent\u2019s approval. Nor do we know whether she intended that the three named individuals receive a particular bequest. Her untimely death deprives us of any reasonably reliable means of determining decedent\u2019s testamentary intent as to these two items and whether she would have viewed their inclusion in the draft will as written as acceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">We hold that for a writing to be admitted into probate as a will under <em>N.J.S.A </em>3B:3-3, the proponent of the writing intended to constitute such a will must prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that: (1) the decedent actually reviewed the document in question; and (2) thereafter gave his or her final assent to it. Absent either one of these two elements, a trier of fact can only speculate as to whether the proposed writing accurately reflects the decedent\u2019s final testamentary wishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Although this holding effectively disposes of plaintiff\u2019s case, in the interest of completeness we will address the trial court\u2019s ruling requiring that a writing offered under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:3-3 be signed by the testator. Here again we are confronted with a dearth of case law authority. We will thus apply the following well-established canons of statutory construction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">To discern the Legislature\u2019s intent, courts first turn to the plain language of the statute in question. In reading the language used by the Legislature, the court will give words their ordinary meaning absent any direction from the Legislature to the contrary. If the plain language leads to a clear and unambiguous result, then [the] interpretive process is over.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\"><em>[Klumb v. Bd. of Educ. of Manalapan-Englishtown Reg\u2019l High Sch. Dist., </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>14, 23-24, 970 A.2d 354 (2009) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the words chosen by the Legislature when it amended <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:3-3:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-9\">Although <em>a document </em>or wilting added upon a document was <em>not executed in compliance with N.J.S.A. </em>3B:3-2, the document or writing is <em>treated as if it had been executed in compliance with N.J.S.A. </em>3B:3-2 <em>if the proponent of the document </em>or writing <em>establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the decedent intended the document </em>or wilting <em>to constitute: (1) the decedent\u2019s will; </em>(2) a partial or complete revocation of the will; (3) an addition to or an alteration of the will; or (4) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>a partial or complete revival of his formerly revoked will or of a formerly revoked portion of the will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">[ (Emphasis added.) ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Applying the words and phrases emphasized to the facts of this case, we can reach the following result: plaintiff offered the draft will as a document \u201cnot executed in compliance with the <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:3-2.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>As we noted earlier, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:3-2 describes the requirements for two types of wills: the traditional will, <em>N.J.S.A </em>3B:3-2a, and that previously referred to as a holographic will, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:3-2b. Both of these statutorily sanctioned forms of wills share one common requirement: the writing in question must be signed by the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:3-3 addresses a form of testamentary document that \u201cwas not <em>executed </em>in compliance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:3-2.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In this context, the term \u201cexecuted\u201d is not synonymous with \u201csigned.\u201d A will \u201cexecuted\u201d in compliance with the requirements of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3:3-2a means a will prepared in accordance with the dictates of the statute. Such a will must be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-9\">(1) in writing (2); signed by the testator or in the testator\u2019s name by some other individual in the testator\u2019s conscious presence and at the testator\u2019s direction; and (3) signed by at least two individuals, each of whom signed within a reasonable time after each witnessed either the signing of the will as described in paragraph (2) or the testator\u2019s acknowledgment of that signature or acknowledgment of the will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-7\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-10\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:3-2b has equally strict requirements for the admission to probate of a holographic will. In such a writing, all the material testamentary provisions must be in the testator\u2019s handwriting and the writing must be signed by the testator. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">Against this backdrop, we are satisfied that a writing offered under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:3-3 need not be signed by the testator in order to be admitted to probate. To hold otherwise would render the relaxation available in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:3-3 inapplicable to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:3-2b. Stated differently, because the essence of a holographic will is that it must be in the testator\u2019s handwriting, the only conceivable relief offered by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:3-3 to this form of will must be that it need not be signed by the testator. As we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>recently reaffirmed, a court\u2019s interpretation of a statute should not lead to an absurd or unreasonable result. <em>In re Johnny Popper, Inc., </em>413 <em>N.J.Super. </em>580, 589, 997 A.2d 257 (App.Div.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">A variation of the facts presented here offers a compelling case for construing <em>N.J.S.A </em>3B:3-3 as not requiring the testator\u2019s signature. Had decedent been able to read the draft will prepared by Calloway and thereafter express her assent to its content in the presence of witnesses or by any other reasonably reliable means, the trial court\u2019s misgivings concerning the absence of her signature would have been seen as needlessly formalistic and against the remedial purpose that animates <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:3-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Finally, we address the trial court\u2019s award of counsel fees to plaintiff under <em>Rule </em>4:42-9(a)(3). Plaintiff requested $34,433. After hearing the arguments of counsel, reviewing the documentation submitted by plaintiff\u2019s attorney, and considering what the trial judge characterized as his own \u201cpolicy reasons,\u201d the court awarded plaintiffs counsel $28,974.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Defendants argue that plaintiff is not entitled to have her attorneys\u2019 fees paid by the estate because her action was motivated by a desire to advance her own interest rather than to vindicate the testator\u2019s intent. Alternatively, defendants argue that even if plaintiff was entitled to an award of counsel fees, the court abused its discretion in the amount of fees awarded, which defendants characterize as exorbitant. Plaintiff argues that the trial judge abused his discretion by considering his own personal policy reasons as a basis for reducing her application for counsel fees under <em>Rule </em>4:42-9(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">We affirm the trial court\u2019s decision to grant plaintiffs counsel fees application but remand for the court to reconsider the amount of fees plaintiff is entitled to receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\"><em>Rule </em>4:42-9(a)(3) allows the court to award attorneys\u2019 fees \u201cin probate actions.\u201d \u201cIf probate is granted, and it shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>appear that the contestant had reasonable cause for contesting the validity of the will or codicil, the court may make an allowance to the proponent and the contestant, to be paid out of the estate.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>To satisfy the rule\u2019s \u201creasonable cause\u201d requirement, those petitioning for an award of counsel fees must provide the court with \u201ca factual background reasonably justifying the inquiry as to the testamentary sufficiency of the instrument by the legal process.\u201d <em>In re Caruso, </em>18 <em>N.J. </em>26, 35, 112 A.2d 532 (1955). That being said, \u201c[ejxcept in a weak or meretricious case, courts will normally allow counsel fees to both proponent and contestant in a will dispute.\u201d <em>In re Reisdorf, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>319, 326, 403 A.2d 873 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The trial judge found plaintiff had \u201creasonable cause\u201d for contesting the validity of the will. The court emphasized the \u201cunique facts\u201d presented by this ease and the lack of appellate authority addressing the applicability of <em>N.J.S.A </em>3B:3-3 and found that plaintiff made this challenge to decedent\u2019s prior will in good faith. In short, although plaintiff would have benefited if she had succeeded in this legal challenge, there is no factual or legal basis to deny her request for counsel fees. <em>See In re Farnkopf, </em>363 <em>N.J.Super. </em>382, 395, 833 A.2d 89 (App.Div.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">We are compelled to remand for the court to reconsider the amount of fees awarded, however, because the court\u2019s analysis included policy questions that are not relevant or appropriate considerations in determining the amount of fees plaintiff is entitled to receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">When, as here, there is explicit legal authority for the court to award counsel fees, the court calculates the award of counsel fees by determining the \u201clodestar,\u201d i.e. a reasonable hourly charge multiplied by the number of hours expended. <em>Rendine v. Pantzer, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>292, 334-35, 661 A.2d 1202 (1995). In determining the lodestar, the court should compare the hourly rate of the attorney to the rates charged for similar services of attorneys in the community with \u201ccomparable skill, experience, and reputation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 337, 661 A.2d 1202 (internal citations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>omitted). The court must determine reasonable hourly billing rates that are \u201cfair, realistic, and accurate.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">After applying the <em>Rendine </em>factors, the trial judge made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\">I am satisfied generally that the hourly rate used was appropriate. I am satisfied that the time devoted to the various matters that are referred to in the billing records was appropriate. And I have no reason to question that the time that\u2019s alleged was in fact devoted to the matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Despite these findings, the judge arbitrarily deducted fifteen percent from plaintiffs counsel\u2019s otherwise valid request of $33,500 to reflect what the judge deemed his personal policy of discouraging or \u201cdeterring\u201d these type of fee-shifting cases. Thus, labeling this arbitrary deduction as \u201crelatively modest,\u201d the judge reduced plaintiffs request by $5000, ultimately awarding $28,350; after adding costs in the amount of $624.13, the total award was $28,974.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The approach adopted by the trial court here is legally untenable. In determining the amount of an award of counsel fees a litigant is entitled to receive, a trial judge may not impose his or her own policy considerations to arbitrarily reduce a litigant\u2019s otherwise legally justifiable application. The judge\u2019s personal views about the need to generally discourage fee-shifting cases is not a valid factor and cannot be included in the analysis mandated by the Court in <em>Rendine. See Walker v. Giuffre, </em>415 <em>N.J.Super. </em>597, 608,2 A.3d 1165 (App.Div.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">We thus remand for the court to reconsider the amount of counsel fees plaintiff is entitled to receive after conducting the analysis mandated by the Court in <em>Rendine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">Y</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">By way of summary, we affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling denying plaintiffs application to probate a draft will that was never read by decedent Louise Macool. To be admitted into probate under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:3-3, the proponent of a writing intended to constitute the testator\u2019s will must prove, by clear and convincing evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>that: (1) the decedent actually reviewed the document in question; and (2) thereafter expressed his or her final assent to it. We further affirm the trial court\u2019s decision to grant plaintiffs application for counsel fees but remand for the court to reconsider the amount of the award.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b330-12\"> The specific language in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:3~3 was part of a legislative effort to amend our State's probate laws \"concerning wills and estates, amending and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>supplementing various sections of Title 3B.\" L. 2004 c. 132, \u00a7 10, eff.
