Because the doctrine of standing derives from the case-or-controversy requirement, and because that requirement in turn is grounded in historical practice,\n   <em>\n    it is instructive to consider whether an alleged intangible harm has a close relationship to a harm that has traditionally been regarded as providing a basis for a lawsuit in English or American courts\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v.

For example,\n   <em>\n    even if a consumer reporting agency fails to provide the required notice to a user of the agency's consumer information, that information regardless may be entirely accurate\n   </em>\n   .

Ultimately, the Court finds that Ms. Taylor's allegations that Fred's provided\n   <em>\n    her\n   </em>\n   with electronic receipt(s) revealing the first six digits of her debit card number (and the statutorily permissible last four digits) are,\n   in the absence of any non-speculative facts about card fraud or identity theft, insufficiently concrete and/or imminent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Ms. Taylor has failed to carry her burden of demonstrating an injury-in-fact for this FACTA violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Ms. Taylor initially maintains that such a statutory violation of FACTA (by itself) is sufficient to meet concreteness. Under this view, Ms. Taylor's non-compliant receipt-an intangible injury-is the concrete injury. More specifically, Ms. Taylor contends that in passing FACTA, Congress has elevated the card-truncation violation to that constitutional status by transforming it into a substantive right and obviating any need for Ms. Taylor to show additional harm to satisfy constitutional concreteness.

We therefore agree with Susinno that\n   <em>\n    in asserting \"nuisance and invasion of privacy\" resulting from a single prerecorded telephone call, her complaint asserts \"the very harm that Congress sought to prevent,\" arising from prototypical conduct proscribed by the TCPA\n   </em>\n   .

We think Susinno has satisfied this test as well.

Second, the legislative history of the TCPA expressly linked the statutory violation created by Congress to privacy interests.

(Doc. 34 at 3). Second, Ms. Taylor maintains that this statutory violation exposes her to an imminent, increased risk of identity theft or payment card fraud.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206835084\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Consistent with the Court's reasoning regarding her card-truncation claim, Ms. Taylor has not carried her jurisdictional burden with either statement of an injury-in-fact.

Consequently,\n   a plaintiff must, at a minimum, identify some additional harm flowing from that FACTA violation to establish concreteness. The Court is persuaded by\n   <em>\n    Meyers\n   </em>\n   and those authorities that have followed it. Stated differently, to the extent that Congress intended to elevate the expiration-date violation to concrete status through the passage of FACTA, Congress demoted that violation's status by virtue of its reasoning for subsequently passing the Clarification Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Importantly, nowhere does Ms. Taylor allege that she ever received a receipt from Fred's that included both her expiration date\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   more than the last five digits of her card. In light of the Clarification Act, those two violations of FACTA\n   <em>\n    combined\n   </em>\n   might very well satisfy constitutional concreteness without any showing of additional harm, but Ms. Taylor's facts do not present that case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681n(d) (providing that \"a person who printed an expiration date on any receipt\" during the Clarification Act's grace period, \"\n   <em>\n    but otherwise complied with the requirements of section 1681c(g)\n   </em>\n   ...shall not be in willful noncompliance with section 1681c(g)\") (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    cf. also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fullwood v.

Therefore, the Court rejects Ms. Taylor's substantive-rights approach to establishing concreteness for Fred's alleged expiration-date violation of FACTA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Ms. Taylor secondarily maintains that Fred's FACTA expiration-date violation constitutes an injury-in-fact because it has caused her the additional harm of \"an imminent, increased risk of identity theft or payment card fraud.\" (Doc. 34 at 3). As\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   indicates, \"[a] violation of one of [a statute]'s procedural requirements may result in no harm\" or no \"material risk of harm.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Ms. Taylor has alleged injuries flowing from the latter category-a purported increased risk of material harm (as well as stress over that risk and actions taken to reduce that risk) attributable to Fred's expiration-date violation of FACTA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Admittedly, the scope of\n   <em>\n    Meyers\n   </em>\n   does not involve any alleged additional injuries or preventive actions taken that are tied to a non-compliant FACTA receipt. Nonetheless, the above\n   <em>\n    Meyers\n   </em>\n   -based reasoning applies equally to Ms. Taylor's second version of an injury-in-fact. In passing the Clarification Act, Congress recognized that merely including an expiration date on a printed receipt does not materially impact the likelihood that a plaintiff will be a victim of identity theft or financial fraud so long as that receipt is otherwise FACTA-compliant. Therefore, in the judgment of Congress, there is an insufficient link between an expiration-date violation of FACTA and an increased risk of real harm in the form of identity theft (or any need to reduce that risk).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Further, Ms. Taylor's speculation that Fred's \"likely\" has violated the expiration-date provision throughout the proposed class period by giving her other similarly non-compliant receipts that she subsequently lost or discarded (doc. 34 at 17), does not alter this Court's view about her inability to show an injury-in-fact. Importantly, there is an absence of any factual allegations indicating why the risk of identity theft is imminent or heightened for Ms. Taylor because of any \"likely\" lost/discarded non-compliant receipts from Fred's containing her card's expiration date. Instead, that link is left to uncertainty and speculation whether measured by the FAC or Ms. Taylor's opposition brief. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 34 at 21 (\"Plaintiff further alleged Defendants provided her with numerous other non-compliant receipts that were either lost of discarded (FAC \u00b6 36), which\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have been-and\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   already have been-\n   <em>\n    observed by a non-party and used in furtherance of payment card fraud or identity theft\n   </em>\n   .\") (emphasis added) );\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kamal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206133827\">\n    2016 WL 6133827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (finding allegations about \"identity thieves called 'carders' or 'dumpster divers,' who supposedly cob[b]le together credit card numbers from lost or discarded receipts\" too \"attenuated\" to establish standing in light of \"\n   <em>\n    Reilly\n   </em>\n   and other risk-of-harm cases\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   According to her FAC, the only receipt from Fred's that Ms. Taylor knows for certain contained an expiration-date violation she neither lost nor discarded. Further, she alleges no facts from which an imminent risk of material harm in the form of identity theft could have flowed from that retained receipt despite its non-compliant status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Additionally, even assuming that Ms. Taylor knew for certain that Fred's violated the expiration-date provision on other occasions and that someone else in her household mistakenly threw away all of those non-compliant receipts, \"[i]t is difficult to imagine how the [losing or discarding] of [receipts revealing her card's expiration date information], without more, could work any concrete harm.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is particularly true in light of the straightforward legislative reasoning behind the amnesty period created by the Clarification Act-\n   <em>\n    printing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    expiration dates on otherwise compliant FACTA receipts does not escalate or make more likely the risk of identity theft\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Llewellyn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201437632\">\n    2017 WL 1437632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (\"[E]ven if Plaintiff had alleged that a third party had viewed a receipt with his expiration date-which he does not-he would not without more have alleged an actual risk of fraud or identity theft.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Finally, Ms. Taylor's allegations of additional intangible harm in the form of stress over the prospect of card fraud and identity theft and preventative actions taken to monitor her credit do not show an injury-in-fact for her FACTA expiration-date claim. For the same\n   <em>\n    Reilly\n   </em>\n   -based reasons discussed in the context of her card-truncation claim, any state-of-mind or monitoring-related injuries are premised upon a theoretical future harm of identity theft and are too speculatively supported to be imminent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Therefore, the Court finds that Ms. Taylor has not carried her burden of showing an injury-in-fact with respect to Fred's alleged expiration-date violation of FACTA. Further, in the absence of establishing an injury-in-fact under either FACTA's card-truncation or expiration-date provision, Ms. Taylor's case is due to be dismissed without prejudice for lack of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Court Does Not Reach the Remaining Issues Raised in Fred's Motion.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Fred's alternatively contends that, even if Ms. Taylor satisfies particularity, concreteness,\n   and imminence, she still lacks standing because she cannot show that her injury is tracebable to its alleged conduct. (Doc. 32-1 at 21-22). Fred's also argues that if standing is satisfied, this Court should dismiss Ms. Taylor's FAC for failure to state a claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-27). Having found the absence of an injury-in-fact for both of Ms. Taylor's FACTA claims due to a lack of concreteness and/or imminence, this Court does not reach those additional issues. Accordingly, the remainder of Fred's Motion is due to be termed as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
