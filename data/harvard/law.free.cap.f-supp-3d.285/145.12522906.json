Kemper, appearing\n   <em>\n    pro se,\n   </em>\n   has sued the Department of Education and current or former Department employees for injunctive relief and monetary damages. Plaintiff seeks to prevent the Department of Treasury from garnishing his social security payments to satisfy a student loan he alleges was paid in full in the mid-1980s. Pending are Defendants' Motion to Dismiss under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) [Dkt. #13], Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction/Temporary Restraining Order [Dkt. #3], and Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment [Dkt. # 10]. For the reasons explained below, subject matter jurisdiction is lacking. Consequently, Defendants' motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) is GRANTED, Plaintiff's motions are DENIED, and the case is DISMISSED without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that he was \"introduced\" to student loans in 1974 while attending a local university in Sacramento, California. Am. Compl. at 1 [Dkt. # 5], \"In the mid 1980's,\" Plaintiff tendered what he believed to be his \"final loan payment of about $250\" by way of \"a check endorsed 'cashing this check denotes that the account is paid in full.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Plaintiff did not receive a response from the Department of Education (DOE), but he \"presumed that was their standard procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff surmises that, \"[b]eginning in the 1990's,\" DOE \"felt they were not paid off entirely and instead of communicating with the Plaintiff, sent a presumed bill ... to a local collection agency who sent their developed copy to the Plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff \"responded immediately to the Collection Agency that there was no money due [because] the debt was paid in total in the 1980's\"; as a result, the collection notices stopped coming to Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But a \"few years later, another notice came from another collection agency for approximately $19,000,\" even though Plaintiff's debt \"never was higher than $3200.00.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 3, 2017, the Treasury Department notified Plaintiff that his debt to DOE was referred for collection action, whereby 15 percent of Plaintiff's monthly Social Security benefit payments would be withheld to satisfy the debt. Compl. Attachment [Dkt. #1 at 5]. The withholding was to begin no sooner than April 2017, but the notice also included information about how \"[t]o prevent this collection action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff commenced this civil action on March 20, 2017, to enjoin Treasury's proposed action. The case was formally filed on April 17, 2017, after the court's grant of Plaintiff's motion to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   submitted with the original complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Tucker Act and Little Tucker Act waive the United States's immunity as to certain claims for monetary damages. The Little Tucker Act confers concurrent jurisdiction upon the United States district courts and the Court of Federal Claims to hear claims \"not exceeding $10,000,\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201346\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(2), whereas the Tucker Act confers exclusive jurisdiction upon the Court of Federal Claims to hear claims exceeding $10,000,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201491\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(1). A \"claim is subject to the Tucker Act and its jurisdictional consequences if, in whole or in part, it explicitly or 'in essence' seeks more than $10,000 in monetary relief from the federal government.\"\n    <em>\n     Kidwell v. Dep't of the Army, Bd. for Corr. of Military Records\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11324668,3619790\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/56/279/\">\n     56 F.3d 279\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 284 (D.C. Cir. 1995). Plaintiff's demand for damages exceeds the Little Tucker Act's $10,000 limit. Accordingly, I lack subject matter jurisdiction over any non-tort claims in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
