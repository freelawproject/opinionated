Gorton, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case involves allegations of employment discrimination and failure to ameliorate\n   a hostile work environment. Plaintiff Ulas Avci (\"Avci\" or \"plaintiff\"), proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   , claims that Megan L. Brennan, Postmaster General, United States Postal Service (\"Postal Service\" or \"defendant\") unlawfully discriminated against him on the basis of race and national origin when Avci was not hired as a Postal Support Employee Custodian. In addition, Avci alleges that, during the time he was employed by the Postal Service, he was subjected to a hostile work environment in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Defendant's motion for summary judgment is currently pending before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background:\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Avci is a naturalized United States citizen who describes himself as \"a Kurdish American from Turkey\". From sometime in 2010 until August, 2011, he was employed by the Postal Service as a \"Casual-Maintenance Building Services Custodian\" at the Brockton Processing and Distribution Center in Brockton, Massachusetts (\"the Brockton facility\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Avci resided in Brockton at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In July, 2011, plaintiff applied for the position of Postal Support Employee (\"PSE\") Custodian in Brockton. He took the applicable assessment examination and obtained a score of 88/100, which placed him seventh out of seven applicants on defendant's hiring list.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In August, 2011, the Postal Service terminated the employment of all Casual-Maintenance Building Services Custodians nationwide, including Mr. Avci. In September, 2011, plaintiff moved to Germany and ultimately returned to Turkey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The dispute in this case focuses on defendant's purported attempt to rehire plaintiff for the position of PSE Custodian in Brockton after the nationwide Casual Custodian lay-off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Avci provided his cell phone number on his employment application. Joseph A. Campbell, the Supervisor of Maintenance Operations at the Brockton facility, who was plaintiff's immediate supervisor while he was a Casual Custodian at that facility, attempted to reach plaintiff by telephone. Avci and the Postal Service disagree about what happened next. Defendant submits that Campbell attempted to contact plaintiff by calling him on his cell phone. Avci notes that Campbell did not call the number he listed on his application. Defendant's extension detail report confirms that Campbell did not dial plaintiff's number. As stated in defendant's memorandum in support of its motion for summary judgment,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Campbell attempted to contact all of the applicants on the Hiring List by telephone and/or email.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   That is not quite Campbell's recollection. In the EEO Investigative Affidavit, Campbell stated that \"all PSE candidate were contacted via phone/email.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant also maintains that one of Avci's co-workers, Alan Voll, unsuccessfully attempted to contact him. Plaintiff insists that he did not receive a call and correctly notes that \"there is no record of [the call] and the co-worker is not an official.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In March, 2012, Tony McGuire, defendant's Manager of Maintenance Operations for the Boston Processing and Distribution Center emailed plaintiff to schedule an interview for the PSE Custodian job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   McGuire contends that Avci would have been hired as a PSE Custodian at the Brockton facility if Avci had completed the interview process. Defendant avers that Avci declined the interview although it provides no record of that communication. Plaintiff disputes that contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff claims he was discriminated against when the Postal Service intentionally avoided contacting him about the PSE Custodian interview because of his Turkish national origin. As plaintiff tells it, 1) he provided his phone number on the job application, 2) Campbell intentionally dialed the wrong phone number because of his bias against the plaintiff and 3) plaintiff's co-worker also failed to contact him about the interview for the same reason. Finally, Avci maintains that the interview email he received was a \"deliberate effort by defendant to mislead the EEO investigation.\" Avci was eligible for employment at the Brockton facility, not the Boston facility, he explains, so that email was merely a ruse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff's second amended complaint contains a plethora of counts.

Some disputed facts that he points to, such as Campbell's alleged misinformation about his phone number, while relevant to Avci's failure-to-hire claim, do not constitute severe or pervasive harassment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   A nonmoving party must produce more than \"conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, acrimonious invective, or rank speculation.\"\n   <em>\n    Ahern\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Shinseki\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4078339\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/49/#p54\">\n    629 F.3d 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 54 (1st Cir. 2010). Avci alleges facts sufficient to constitute a claim of hostile work environment in his complaint but his burden at the summary judgment stage is higher. Facts must be \"set forth in affidavits, depositions and the like.\"\n   <em>\n    Noviello\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    City of Boston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9027614\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/398/76/#p84\">\n    398 F.3d 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 84 (1st Cir. 2005). Plaintiff has not done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Although the record consists of over 900 pages, plaintiff failed to identify any specific facts demonstrating the existence of a hostile work environment in his opposition to defendant's motion for summary judgment. Because Avci has failed to \"produce specific facts, in suitable evidentiary form, to establish the presence of a trailworthy issue,\" summary judgment for the Postal Service is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clifford\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Barnhart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5410609\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/449/276/#p280\">\n    449 F.3d 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 280 (1st Cir. 2006) (internal citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The record includes EEOC investigative affidavits submitted in May and June of 2012 by plaintiff, Campbell, Manager of Maintenance Operations Emilia Keefe, Human Resources Generalist Patricia Barnard and co-worker Alan Voll. Those affidavits are limited to a discussion of the failure-to-hire claim. None discusses alleged harassment in the workplace. Plaintiff describes incidents of alleged harassment in the pre-complaint stage of the EEOC process. The EEOC investigation, however, was limited to the alleged discriminatory failure-to-hire claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Because plaintiff has failed to set forth specific facts establishing pervasive harassment, he has failed to set out a\n   <em>\n    prima\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    facie\n   </em>\n   case of hostile work environment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Defendant's motion for summary judgment will, with respect to plaintiff's hostile work environment claim, be allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Counts II-XII\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Title VII requires an employee to file a charge with the EEOC before commencing a civil action. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f). To provide the employer notice and an opportunity to take necessary corrective action, the civil complaint is then limited to \"the charge filed with the EEOC and the investigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge.\"\n   <em>\n    Thornton\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United Parcel Serv., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5680886\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/587/27/#p31\">\n    587 F.3d 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 31 (1st Cir. 2009) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Powers\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Grinnell Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530108\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/915/34/#p38\">\n    915 F.2d 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 38 (1st Cir. 1990) ). Where the plaintiff proceeds\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   , the charge is \"liberally construed in order to afford the complainant the benefit of any reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    Lattimore\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Polaroid Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7650412\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/99/456/#p464\">\n    99 F.3d 456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 464 (1st Cir. 1996).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The EEOC understood plaintiff's complaint to be limited to his failure-to-hire claim. This Court has liberally construed plaintiff's administrative charge to include a hostile work environment claim. Counts II through XII of plaintiff's second amended complaint are not, however, related to or supported by his EEOC complaint.\n   <em>\n    Pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   status\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   does not relieve an employee of the obligation to meet procedural requirements established by law ...
