(Doc. 7.) Plaintiff responded in\n   opposition (Doc. 16); State Farm replied. (Doc. 26.) The motion is now ripe for review. For the foregoing reasons, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   State Farm's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Juna Mathurin, the personal representative of the estate of Decedent Fluerinat Estephene, brings her two-count complaint for underinsured motorist benefits and statutory bad faith pursuant to Florida Statute \u00a7 624.155 arising out of a fatal motor vehicle accident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 2.) Although State Farm paid Plaintiff the policy limit of $10,000 under the policy at issue (Kwavnick Aff., Doc. 7-6 \u00b6 4), Plaintiff is pursuing an underinsured motorist claim to obtain a determination on the full amount of damages to serve as the recovery amount on the bad faith count. (Doc. 2 at 8.) Plaintiff seeks damages, pre- and post-judgment interest, attorneys' fees, and costs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) State Farm seeks summary judgment on Plaintiff's bad faith count. (Doc. 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 6, 2011, while working as a taxicab driver, Fleurinat Estephene (\"Decedent\") was killed when a dump truck owned by an underinsured company struck Decedent's taxi.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 2 at 2; Doc. 16-1 at 13-14; Mathurin Dep., Doc. 7 at 53, 58.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the time of Decedent's accident, he resided with the Plaintiff, his girlfriend. (Doc. 7-1 at 62-63.) Decedent owned a 1994 Honda Civic and Plaintiff owned a 2000 Nissan Quest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27.) State Farm issued two separate policies for these vehicles. (Owen Affs., Doc. 3-1 &amp; 3-2.) State Farm assigned the policy number 406-8935-C21-59B to the policy on Plaintiff's vehicle (\"Nissan Quest Policy\"). The policy provided nonstacking underinsured/uninsured motorist (\"UM\") coverage with policy limits of $50,000 per person and $100,000 per accident. (Doc. 3-2 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For the policy covering Decedent's Honda Civic (\"Honda Civic Policy\"), State Farm assigned the policy number 698-7601-F19-59. (Doc. 3-1 at 2.) The Honda Civic Policy provided nonstacking UM policy limits of $10,000 per person and $20,000 per accident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On both policies, Plaintiff was the first named insured and Decedent was the second named insured. (Doc. 16-1 at 1, 3.) In a state action, the court determined that Decedent should have been the first named insured on the Honda Civic Policy since he was the owner and principal operator of the Honda Civic. (Doc. 7-8 at 51-52.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the June 6, 2011 accident, Plaintiff sought UM benefits as Decedent's personal representative from State Farm. On June 24, 2011, State Farm sent a letter to Plaintiff\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   as a follow up on a telephone call between Plaintiff and State Farm. (Doc. 16-1 at 5.) In the letter, State Farm assigned the claim number \"59-A820-386\" to Plaintiff's claim and listed the policy number of the Nissan Quest Policy with the higher limits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On June 27, 2011, Plaintiff sent a letter to State Farm, notifying State Farm that Plaintiff would proceed with an uninsured motorist claim and requesting proof of UM coverage that was provided to Plaintiff and the UM rejection sheet if coverage was denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 16-1 at 7.) In response, on July 18, 2011, State Farm sent two letters to Plaintiff, one containing policy information for the Nissan Quest Policy and another for the Honda Civic Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 18, 2011, Plaintiff sent a demand letter to State Farm offering to settle the claim for the UM policy limits; while Plaintiff included the claim number, she did not specify under which policy she was claiming coverage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) On September 9, 2011, State Farm sent a letter to Plaintiff denying coverage for the accident without specifying the policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.) State Farm stated that the vehicle Decedent was driving at the time of the accident did not qualify for coverage under the liability portion of the policy and \"[Decedent] [did] not meet the definition of an insured under the uninsured motorist coverage.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 27, 2012, pursuant to Florida Statute \u00a7 624.155, Plaintiff filed a civil remedy notice (\"CRN\") under the Nissan Quest Policy with the Florida Department of Financial Services based on State Farm's alleged failure to settle Plaintiff's claim in good faith (Doc. 2-2), and provided State Farm with a copy of the CRN. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In the CRN, Plaintiff listed State Farm's assigned claim number but not the Honda Civic Policy number. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.) It is undisputed that Plaintiff never provided State Farm with a CRN under the Honda Civic Policy for this claim. (Wallace Aff., Doc. 7-7 \u00b6 6.) On March 6, 2012, State Farm responded to the CRN by denying the allegations in the CRN and asserting that Decedent was not entitled to UM coverage under the Nissan Quest Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Doc. 16-1 at 20-21.) \"On April 1, 2013, State Farm (through its counsel) paid Plaintiff the $10,000 each-person policy limit under the Honda [Civic] Policy.\" (Doc. 7 \u00b6 6; Doc. 7-6 \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    1. 2012 State Case\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff has brought multiple lawsuits against State Farm stemming from the accident and State Farm's denial of coverage. On November 15, 2012, Plaintiff filed suit against State Farm in the Palm Beach County Circuit Court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the Honda Civic Policy provided UM coverage for the accident. (Doc. 7-8 at 2-5.) On December 14, 2012, Plaintiff amended her complaint and sought a declaratory judgment for coverage under both the Honda Civic Policy and Nissan Quest Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.) On January 30, 2013, in State Farm's Answer and Affirmative Defenses, it agreed that the Honda Civic Policy provided UM coverage for the accident, but it denied that the Nissan Quest Policy provided coverage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-29.) On April 30, 2013, pursuant to an agreed order by the parties, the case was transferred to the Orange County Circuit Court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-31.) Nearly three years later, on January 1, 2016, Plaintiff amended her complaint and sought a declaratory judgment for UM coverage only under the Honda Civic Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32-36.) On April 11, 2017, the state court issued a Final Declaratory Judgment, declaring that the Estate of Estephene was deemed an insured under the Honda Civic Policy's UM coverage because Decedent should have been listed as the first named insured on the policy since he was the owner and principal operator of the Honda Civic (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51-52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    2. 2013 Federal Case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On July 16, 2013, Plaintiff filed a separate action seeking UM coverage benefits and bad faith under the Nissan Quest Policy in state court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mathurin v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 6:13-cv-01263-CEH-GJK (M.D. Fla. July 16, 2013) (M.D. Fla. July 16, 2013) (Doc. 3). On August 19, 2013, State Farm removed Plaintiff's case to this Court. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at Doc. 1.) On September 25, 2013, the Court granted the parties' Joint Motion for Dismissal of Action and dismissed the case without prejudice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Doc. 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    3. The Present Case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Four years later, on September 6, 2017, Plaintiff filed her second action in state court seeking UM coverage benefits and bad faith but this time under the\n   <em>\n    Honda Civic Policy\n   </em>\n   . (Doc. 2.) For the UM benefits claim, Plaintiff alleges that \"[State Farm] has unjustifiably refused to honor its contractual obligations by denying coverage under the Policy and failing to pay the uninsured motorist benefits owed to [Plaintiff].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) However, it is undisputed that on April 1, 2013, State Farm paid Plaintiff the $10,000 UM policy limit under the Honda Civic Policy. (Doc. 7-6 at 4; Doc. 7 \u00b6 6; Doc. 16 \u00b6 6.) Plaintiff alleges statutory bad faith under Florida Statutes \u00a7 624.55 for State Farm's alleged acts during the handling of Plaintiff's claim, such as State Farm failing to attempt in good faith to settle Plaintiff's claim and placing its own financial interests before Plaintiff's. (Doc. 2 at 9.) In support of her\n   Complaint, Plaintiff attached her previously filed CRN under the Nissan Quest Policy. (Doc. 2-2 at 15-17.) On October 12, 2017, State Farm removed the present case to this Court based on diversity jurisdiction. (Doc. 1.) On October 20, 2017, State Farm moved for summary judgment on Plaintiff's bad faith count. (Doc. 7.) On November 17, 2017, Plaintiff responded to State Farm's Motion for Summary Judgment. (Doc. 16.) On December 5, 2017, State Farm replied to Plaintiff's Response. (Doc. 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

State Farm emphasizes that it would have cost State Farm $50,000 to cure Plaintiff's CRN under the Nissan Quest Policy to avoid Plaintiff's bad faith claim\n   under the Honda Civic Policy with a limit of $10,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) State Farm argues that it was not afforded the opportunity to cure a CRN by paying only the Honda Civic Policy's $10,000 limit, which is now the basis of the Plaintiff's lawsuit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) State Farm argues that Plaintiff cannot cure the defects of its bad faith count because State Farm has already paid Plaintiff $10,000 under the Honda Civic Policy's UM limits and the matter is resolved. (Doc. 7 at 10.) State Farm, relying on\n   <em>\n    Talat\n   </em>\n   , asserts that if Plaintiff were to now file a CRN under the Honda Civic Policy, the CRN could not perfect her current bad faith claim because it would automatically be cured by State Farm's previous payment of UM benefits under the Honda Civic Policy on April 1, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In response, Plaintiff asserts that Florida Statute \u00a7 624.155 does not require the policy number be on the CRN and that its CRN complied with the notice requirements. (Doc. 16 at 8-9.) Plaintiff further contends that her identification of the incorrect\n   <em>\n    policy\n   </em>\n   number is immaterial and points to communication between State Farm and Plaintiff in which the Nissan Quest and Honda Civic Policy were associated with the same\n   <em>\n    claim\n   </em>\n   number. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12.) Plaintiff argues that State Farm cannot now argue that State Farm was unaware of the claim under the Honda Civic Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) Plaintiff further argues that State Farm waived the issue of what she characterizes as the \"incorrect\" policy number on the CRN by failing to raise it in State Farm's response to Plaintiff's CRN. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In reply, State Farm argues that \u00a7 624.155 requires an insured's representative to state a policy number on the CRN. (Doc. 26 at 2.) Alternatively, State Farm argues that even if the policy number were optional, Plaintiff's CRN under the Nissan Quest Policy would satisfy the condition precedent for bringing a bad faith claim under the Nissan Quest Policy; however, it would not satisfy the condition precedent for a bad faith claim \"under a different policy insuring a different vehicle belonging to a different person.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) State Farm emphasizes that the CRN's purpose is to put the insurer on notice that it potentially improperly denied a claim and to give the insurer sixty days to preclude a bad faith action by paying the policy limits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) State Farm contends that, when an insurer receives a CRN with a specific policy number on it, the insurer is expected to examine its coverage decision on the policy specifically identified in the CRN. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the plain language of \u00a7 624.155(3)(b) does not state that a policy number is required and Defendant has provided no evidence to show what information the Department requires. (Doc. 16 at 11.) Plaintiff is correct that the plain language of the statute does not state that a policy number is required. However, the Court finds that a policy number is required for an acceptable CRN under \u00a7 624.155(3)(b). State Farm points to the language of \u00a7 624.155(3)(b), which states: \"The notice shall be\n   <em>\n    on a form provided by the [Department of Financial Services]\n   </em>\n   and shall state with specificity the following information, and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     such other information as the department may require:\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \" (Doc. 26 at 2) (emphasis in original). In this case, Plaintiff's CRN, submitted on the form created by the Department of Financial Services, contains a field that asks for the \"Policy # \" and provides a blank space for claimants to enter a policy number (Doc. 2-2 at 16.) As State Farm correctly highlights, the statute contains a provision that allows the Department of Financial Services to create the CRN form and require additional information. Plaintiff's CRN clearly shows\n   a place for claimants to enter a policy number. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In this case, Plaintiff's CRN is sufficient for State Farm to meet its burden on summary judgment because Plaintiff's CRN shows the information that the Department of Financial Services requires from claimants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Leary v. First Liberty Ins. Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No. 8:10-CV-1625-T-23TBM,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%203610446\">\n    2010 WL 3610446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 14, 2010) (finding that the insureds' CRN satisfied the statute and provided sufficient notice because it included the policy number along with other information).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   State Farm also argues that even if a policy number is optional, a CRN under one policy cannot perfect a statutory bad faith claim under another policy. (Doc. 26 at 3.) The Court agrees. While Plaintiff filed a CRN under the Nissan Quest Policy, it now brings a bad faith claim premised on the Honda Civic Policy. Neither the parties nor the Court found a case involving this particular issue. However, under Florida law, since \u00a7 624.155 is in derogation of the common law, courts have strictly construed the statute and required strict compliance with the statute's notice requirements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Estate of Jorge Luis Arroyo, Jr. v.

Therefore, Plaintiff argues,\n   <em>\n    Nowak\n   </em>\n   is irrelevant and moot.

It is well-settled that \u00a7 624.155 must be strictly construed and\n   <em>\n    Nowak\n   </em>\n   is merely an illustration of this principle.

Sept. 13, 2012) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). As in the present case, it is not uncommon for members of a household to have their own individual vehicles with separate insurance policies. If an insured places a particular policy number on a CRN, then it is reasonable for an insurer to expect a potential bad faith action based on that particular policy. However, if an insured were allowed\n   to bring a bad faith claim based on a different policy number from the one stated in the CRN simply because policyholders share the same address, then insurers would have to play the guessing game as to what policy to cure within the sixty day window to avoid a bad faith claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   This problem is heightened in the situation present here-with two vastly disparate policy limits. The Nissan Quest Policy covers Plaintiff's vehicle and provides UM coverage with policy limits of $50,000 per person and $100,000 per accident. (Doc. 3-2 at 2.) The Honda Civic Policy covered Decedent's vehicle and provided UM policy limits of $10,000 per person and $20,000 per accident. (Doc. 3-1 at 2.) The policies at issue offered nonstacking UM benefits. (Docs. 3-1 at 2; 3-2 at 2.) As State Farm points out, since the policies are nonstacking only one of the policies could cover the accident. (Doc. 16-1 at 12.) Plaintiff filed a CRN only under the Nissan Quest Policy, essentially asserting that the Nissan Quest Policy covered the accident and not the Honda Civic Policy. However, Plaintiff now belatedly seeks to use that CRN for the Nissan Quest Policy to support a bad faith action under the theory that the Honda Civic Policy covers the accident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff could have filed a CRN under the Honda Civic Policy at any time because neither the plain language of \u00a7 624.155\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   nor the case law limit plaintiffs to only filing one CRN per incident.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Estate of Jorge Luis Arroyo, Jr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204401051\">\n    2016 WL 4401051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (the plaintiff filed two CRNs) ;\n   <em>\n    Ardrey,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20831620\">\n    2012 WL 831620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (the plaintiff filed three CRNs). For example, Plaintiff could have filed a CRN under the Honda Civic Policy when she first sued State Farm under the Honda Civic Policy on November 15, 2012. However, from Plaintiff's initial action against State Farm on November 15, 2012 to the present-an over five year period-Plaintiff has failed to file a CRN under the Honda Civic Policy and now relies on her CRN under the Nissan Quest Policy to perfect a bad faith claim based on the Honda Civic Policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given how strictly courts have interpreted the notice requirements, Plaintiff's CRN under the Nissan Quest Policy cannot perfect its bad faith claim under the Honda Civic Policy.

However, State Farm has a stronger case than the insurer in\n   <em>\n    Erhard\n   </em>\n   because as discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the Department of Financial Services specifically requires a policy number on an acceptable CRN.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   State Farm argues that it was never given the opportunity to cure a CRN by paying the $10,000 limit under the Honda Civic Policy on which Plaintiff now bases its bad faith claim. (Doc. 7 at 9.) State Farm argues that, since the Nissan Quest Policy's limit was $50,000-as opposed to the $10,000 Honda Civic Policy-State Farm would have had to pay $50,000 to cure Plaintiff's CRN \"to avoid a claim under a policy whose limit was only $10,000.\" (Doc. 7 at 9.) In response, relying on\n   <em>\n    Hunt v. State Farm Florida Insurance Company\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7003724\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/112/547/\">\n    112 So.3d 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 2d DCA 2013), Plaintiff argues that the court should reject State Farm's \"cure amount\" argument because a CRN is not required to state a specific cure amount. (Doc. 16 at 13.) While Plaintiff relies on\n   <em>\n    Hunt\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that an acceptable CRN does not have to state a specific cure amount, State Farm does not argue that Plaintiff was required to state a specific cure amount in her CRN. Instead, State Farm argues that it was denied the opportunity to cure a CRN for the Honda Civic Policy and thus, avoid this bad faith action by paying the Honda Civic Policy's $10,000 UM limit within the sixty day window from the time the CRN was filed. This clearly contradicts the intent of the statute and illustrates why Plaintiff should not be allowed to use its CRN under the Nissan Quest Policy to perfect a bad faith claim under the Honda Civic Policy. It is irrational that State Farm could have precluded this bad faith claim based on the Honda Civic Policy with a $10,000 UM policy limit by paying $50,000 to cure the CRN under the Nissan Quest Policy. Plaintiff had years to file a CRN under the Honda Civic Policy but chose to only file a CRN for the Nissan Quest Policy with the considerably higher UM policy limits. Additionally, State Farm argues,\n   <em>\n    Hunt\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the present case. In\n   <em>\n    Hunt\n   </em>\n   , the same insurance policy was the basis of the plaintiff's CRN and complaint. (Doc. 26 at 9.) However, here, Plaintiff's Complaint and CRN \"list two insurance policies on two different vehicles with two different policy limits.\" (Doc. 26 at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Moreover, as State Farm emphasizes, the policies provide non-stacking UM benefits, which means only one could cover the accident. Because Plaintiff, through her former counsel, chose to list the Nissan Quest Policy in her CRN, with its higher limits, Plaintiff is bound by that decision. (Doc. 26 at 10.) State Farm argues that the difference between UM policy limits under\n   the Nissan Quest Policy, which has a limit of $50,000, and the Honda Civic Policy, which has a limit of $10,000, shows the flaw in allowing a plaintiff to file a CRN based on one policy and then subsequently file a bad faith claim under a different policy. (Doc. 26 at 11-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   One of State Farm's well-reasoned arguments provides a possible answer as to why Plaintiff never filed a CRN for the Honda Civic Policy. State Farm, relying on\n   <em>\n    Talat Enterprises, Inc. v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11471741\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/753/1278/\">\n    753 So.2d 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 2000), argues that \"when an insurer pays the policy limit before a CRN is filed, the CRN is deemed automatically cured upon filing, and the cause of action never comes into existence.\" (Doc. 7 at 10.) Therefore, State Farm argues if Plaintiff were to file a CRN under the Honda Civic Policy now, Plaintiff would still not be able to pursue a bad faith action under the Honda Civic Policy and her subsequent pleading would not cure the defects in Plaintiff's bad faith count because State Farm's previous payment of $10,000 on April 1, 2013 under the Honda Civic Policy's UM limit would retroactively cure the CRN. (Doc. 7 at 10.) The Court agrees. Logically, if an insurer pays the policy limits before the CRN is filed then its payment is clearly before the expiration of the sixty day period, thus precluding a bad faith action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiff next argues that the\n   <em>\n    claim\n   </em>\n   number in the CRN put State Farm on notice that she was making a claim under the correct\n   <em>\n    policy\n   </em>\n   number for the Honda Civic Policy and its $10,000 UM limit. (Doc. 16 at 12-13.) Plaintiff emphasizes letters from State Farm to Plaintiff on July 18, 2011, which show the two different policies for the Honda Civic and Nissan Quest were associated with the same claim number. (Doc. 16 at 12.) In reply, State Farm argues that the Plaintiff's CRN only stated\n   <em>\n    one\n   </em>\n   policy (for the Nissan Quest) and not the policy for the Honda Civic; because the policies offer nonstacking UM coverage, they are mutually exclusive. (Doc. 26 at 6.) The Court agrees. Although these policies may have been associated with the same\n   <em>\n    claim\n   </em>\n   number, Plaintiff only filed a CRN under the Nissan Quest\n   <em>\n    Policy\n   </em>\n   . Since these policies offer nonstacking UM coverage, Plaintiff implicitly stated that the Honda Civic Policy did not cover the accident by filing its CRN under the Nissan Quest Policy. Moreover, while Plaintiff points to letters as proof that State Farm was on notice of the \"correct\" policy number, neither the statute nor case law support the argument that outside communication can provide \"notice.\" The statute focuses on the filing of the CRN and the requirements for an acceptable CRN, not the contents of other communication between parties. Further, in\n   <em>\n    Nowak\n   </em>\n   discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , based on the principle of strict construction of the statute, the court rejected the plaintiff's argument that the insurer had actual notice based on correspondence between the parties that plaintiff planned to allege violations not mentioned in plaintiff's CRN.\n   <em>\n    Nowak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2584627\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/464/1248/\">\n    464 F.Supp.2d 1248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Nowak\n   </em>\n   court focused on the violations the plaintiff alleged in the CRN.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2584627\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/464/1248/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2584627\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/464/1248/\">\n    at 1251-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, in looking to Plaintiff's CRN, Plaintiff chose to include the Nissan Quest Policy's number, not the Honda Civic Policy's number. Also, similar to the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Nowak\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff fails to cite to any legal authority to support its position. Additionally, correspondence between Plaintiff and State Farm undercuts Plaintiff's argument. In response to Plaintiff's demand for policy information, State Farm sent Plaintiff information on\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   policies. (Doc. 16-1 at 8-13.) Plaintiff then chose to file a CRN only on the Nissan Quest Policy with the higher policy limit. (Doc. 2-2 at 16-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In the alternative, Plaintiff argues that State Farm's Motion for Summary Judgment\n   is premature and should be denied because no discovery has yet been conducted in this case. (Doc. 16 at 6.) Plaintiff emphasizes that State Farm moved for summary judgment only eight days after this case had been removed from state court to this Court, the parties had not submitted a case management report at the time of the motion, and Plaintiff had no opportunity to conduct discovery. (Doc. 16 at 6.) In reply, State Farm counters that there is no second CRN at issue. (Doc. 26 at 8.) State Farm asserts that all the Court needs to decide this case is the Complaint, policies, and the CRN. (Doc. 26 at 8.) State Farm also argues that Plaintiff failed to comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d) by failing to file an affidavit or declaration specifying any particular fact that could not be presented to the Court in opposition to State Farm's Motion for Summary Judgment. (Doc. 26 at 8-9.) State Farm further argues that the only evidence that could change the Court's analysis is a second CRN under the Honda Civic Policy and Plaintiff does not need to conduct discovery to determine whether Plaintiff filed a second CRN because Plaintiff knows that one does not exist. (Doc. 26 at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiff cites a number of cases finding a summary judgment motion is premature when made before discovery and should be denied. (Doc. 16 at 6.) \"Although courts generally refrain from granting summary judgment 'until the party opposing the motion has had an adequate opportunity to conduct discovery,' the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals has rejected adopting a 'blanket prohibition on the granting of summary judgment motions before discovery' has occurred or concluded.\"\n   <em>\n    Rinderknecht v.

(Doc. 7-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Most importantly, at this point, there are no genuine issues of material fact to preclude summary judgment. It is undisputed that Plaintiff only provided State Farm with a CRN under the Nissan Quest Policy, which is attached to the Complaint. (Doc. 7-7 \u00b6 6; Doc. 7 \u00b6 5; Doc. 16 \u00b6 5). Plaintiff is now solely relying on this CRN to perfect its bad faith claim under the Honda Civic Policy. As State Farm correctly argues, all the Court needs to rule on State Farm's Motion for Summary Judgment is the Complaint, Plaintiff's CRN, and the policies.

Therefore, the Court will not delay granting State Farm's Motion for Summary Judgment based on the lack of any reasoned argument from Plaintiff to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiff argues that in State Farm's response to Plaintiff's CRN, State Farm failed to object to the identification of what she characterizes as the \"incorrect\" policy number, although State Farm had notice that the Honda Civic Policy was associated with the same claim number. (Doc. 16 at 13.) Plaintiff asserts that State Farm waived the issue of Plaintiff's filing the CRN under the Nissan Quest Policy by failing to raise it in its response and by paying the $10,000 policy limit on April 1, 2013\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff filed a declaratory judgment action on\n   <em>\n    November 15, 2012\n   </em>\n   . (Doc. 16 at 13) (citing\n   <em>\n    State Farm Ins. Co. v.

In reply, State Farm argues that it did not waive the CRN requirement and the policy number on Plaintiff's CRN did not become \"incorrect\" until more than five years later when Plaintiff filed this bad faith action under a\n   <em>\n    different\n   </em>\n   policy. (Doc. 26 at 7.) State Farm also argues that the holding in\n   <em>\n    State Farm Insurance Co. v. Ulrich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6999198\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/120/217/\">\n    120 So.3d 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 4th DCA 2013) does not support Plaintiff's waiver argument because the court dismissed the insurer's petition without addressing the merits and that case involved the distinguishable issue of a CRN not being specific\n   enough. (Doc. 26 at 7-8.) As State Farm emphasizes, in this case, the CRN under the Nissan Quest Policy cannot be used to perfect a bad faith action \"under a different policy covering a different vehicle belonging to a different person.\" (Doc. 26 at 8.) The Court agrees with State Farm's arguments against waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   State Farm did not waive its objection to Plaintiff filing a CRN under the Nissan Quest Policy and bringing this bad faith action under the Honda Civic Policy. An insurer can detect a \"lack of specificity\" from the face of the CRN when an insurer receives the CRN. However, as in this case, an insurer cannot detect an incorrect policy number from the face of the CRN when the plaintiff provides a valid insurance policy number on the CRN, but the plaintiff subsequently decides to file a bad faith action under a totally different policy. It would be inequitable to find an insurer's objection against a plaintiff's policy switching is waived when a plaintiff made the conscious choice to switch the policy under which the plaintiff alleges bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Court also need not address the parties' arguments that the Court abate the bad faith count until the resolution of Count I on UM coverage, because the Court is granting State Farm's Motion for Summary Judgment. (Doc. 7 at 11; Doc. 16 at 13-14.) Since the Court is granting State Farm's Motion for Summary Judgment, the parties' other arguments are moot.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

(Doc. 16 at 9.) In\n    <em>\n     Clohessy\n    </em>\n    , the defendants' bad faith counterclaim was dismissed because the defendants failed to notify the court in their complaint how they complied with the CRN requirements.\n    <em>\n     Clohessy\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"424573\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/32/1328/\">\n     32 F.Supp.2d at 1333\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

However, Plaintiff filed her current action for bad faith under the Honda Civic Policy on September 6, 2017. (Doc. 2.) She had approximately five months between the state court's decision and filing the Complaint in the present action to submit a CRN under the Honda Civic Policy.
