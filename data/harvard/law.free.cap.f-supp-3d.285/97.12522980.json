Caldwell alleges that he was injured in July 2009 while employed at the National Gallery of Art.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint at 2, 12, ECF No. 1-1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After incurring the injury, Mr. Caldwell claimed that he was unable to work and sought compensation from the government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint at 11-13, 16. Although Mr. Caldwell's barebones complaint does not specify the avenues through which he sought compensation for his disability, papers attached to the complaint do make clear that, in December 2016, Mr. Caldwell filed an appeal of his disability compensation decision with the Employees' Compensation Appeals Board (\"ECAB\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint at 8, 11. Apparently unhappy with ECAB's decision, Mr. Caldwell filed a lawsuit against ECAB in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint at 2. ECAB subsequently removed the action to federal court and filed the instant motion to dismiss\n   Mr. Caldwell's complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants defendant's motion and dismisses this case for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant ECAB moves to dismiss Mr. Caldwell's complaint on the ground that this Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction. According to ECAB, Mr. Caldwell's exclusive remedy for any alleged injury incurred while he was working at the National Gallery of Art-a federal government institution-is through the administrative process set forth in the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (\"FECA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 3-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   FECA is the exclusive remedy for a federal employee injured \"while in the performance of his duty.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%208102\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%208102\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8116 (\"The liability of the United States or an instrumentality thereof under this subchapter or any extension thereof with respect to the injury or death of an employee is exclusive and instead of all other liability of the United States or the instrumentality to the employee[.]\");\n   <em>\n    Johansen v.

FECA sets forth a process for federal employees seeking compensation for injuries sustained in the workplace, and the Act provides for an administrative review through the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs and ultimately ending in an appeal to ECAB for an employee dissatisfied with the determination of his or her claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2010.625\">\n    10 C.F.R. \u00a7 10.625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Gallucci v.

Apr. 20, 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Here, Mr. Caldwell concedes that his injury was sustained at the National Gallery of Art while he was an employee there.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint at 11, ECF No. 1-1. Accordingly, his claim for any resulting disability was subject to FECA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%208102\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Indeed, Mr. Caldwell appears to have sought compensation through the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, which ultimately resulted in an appeal of the decision on his claim to ECAB.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 11-12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss at 1 (explaining that Mr. Caldwell filed a claim with the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs \"based upon his claim that there was a power outage at work, fumes ensued and as a result, his eyes were burned\"), ECF No. 1-1. Mr. Caldwell does not contest any of these facts.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Supp. to Notice of Removal, ECF No. 6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Moreover, although it appears that Mr. Caldwell was ultimately denied compensation under FECA,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Complaint at 2 (alleging that he \"never receive[d] any compensation for\" his injury), that does not change this Court's jurisdictional inquiry.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Spinelli v.

Accordingly, this Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants the Employees' Compensation Appeals Board's motion to dismiss Mr. Caldwell's complaint for lack of jurisdiction.

Having not received any opposition within the time prescribed, the Court directed Mr. Caldwell to respond to ECAB's motion by no later than July 19, 2017.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Minute Order, June 30, 2017, ECF No. 5. On July 13, Mr. Caldwell filed an amalgamation of documents-including a copy of defendant's notice of removal, various medical records, administrative records, and documents from his case in D.C. Superior Court-on one of which he wrote \"I'm responding to the defendant [sic] motion!\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Supp. to Notice of Removal, ECF No. 6. The Court construes this document as Mr. Caldwell's opposition to ECAB's motion to dismiss.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
