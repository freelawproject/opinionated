Non-party Townmaker, L.L.C. contracted with Above It All for Above It All to remove and replace the roof system on certain real property owned by Townmaker and located at 521 Kihehah, Pawhuska, Oklahoma 74056 (\"Property\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Doc. # 24, p. 2 \u00b6 4; Doc. # 24-4]. At the time Above It All was hired, the first floor of the Property was leased to Julie O'Keefe, who operated in the leased space a business named The Cedar Chest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Doc. # 24, p. 2 \u00b6 5].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   On December 8, 2015, O'Keefe filed a civil lawsuit, designated case no. CJ-2015-220, against Above It All and Townmaker in the District Court of Osage County, State of Oklahoma (\"Underlying Lawsuit\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Doc. # 14, p. 2]. The Petition in the Underlying Lawsuit asserted three (3) causes of action: (1) negligence-landlord liability against Townmaker; (2) negligence\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201910.1001\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j)(3)(i)(ii)(iii) against Townmaker; and (3) negligence against Above It All. [Doc. # 24-1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The original Petition in the Underlying Lawsuit alleges the following \"facts\":\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   \u2022 On February 3, 2015, during the term of the lease, The Cedar Chest was open for business. Without notice from either Defendant, Defendant Above It All Roofing and Construction began roofing construction on the building in which The Cedar Chest was located. [Doc. # 24-1, \u00b6 20].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   \u2022 While tearing off the old roof, an approximately 24 foot lead pipe fell through the ceiling of The Cedar\n   Chest and landed about 2 feet from one of The Cedar Chest's employees. [Doc. # 24-1, \u00b6 21].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   \u2022 The roofers removed the pipe but left a hole in the ceiling and a broken ceiling tile hanging open from the ceiling of The Cedar Chest. [Doc. # 24-1, \u00b6 22].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   \u2022 As removal of the old roof continued, silt, dirt, dust and debris fell from the hole in the ceiling, ceiling tiles and molding of the walls around the leased space of The Cedar Chest and covered the clothing, fixtures, display cases, furniture, and floor and floated in the air of The Cedar Chest's store exposing the employees of The Cedar Chest and Julie O'Keefe to the debris. [Doc. # 24-1, \u00b6 23].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   \u2022 Neither Defendant placed a tarp or any other contaminant device on the second floor of the building to preclude the falling silt, dirt, dust and debris into The Cedar Chest's store. [Doc. # 24-1, \u00b6 24].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   \u2022 As a result, silt, dirt, dust, and debris continued to fall into the store and there was no protection from further pipes or objects falling through the ceiling of The Cedar Chest's store. Therefore, The Cedar Chest was forced to close its business during the roofing job. [Doc. # 24-1, \u00b6 27].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   \u2022 Initially, The Cedar Chest, its co-owner Julie O'Keefe, and its employees began to clean up the dust covering the store. However, The Cedar Chest and Julie O'Keefe were concerned that the dirt, silt, dust and debris covering the store may be harmful to the Cedar Chest's employees, customers and Julie O'Keefe and decided to have professional testing done of the leased premises. [Doc. # 24-1, \u00b6 29].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   \u2022 The testing determined that the dust covering the store contained asbestos from the old roofing materials being torn out and replaced and was extremely harmful, even deadly. [Doc. # 24-1, \u00b6 30].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   \u2022 The Cedar Chest leased business space had to be professionally cleaned and most of the items in the store were too contaminated to be salvaged. [Doc. # 24-1, \u00b6 31].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   \u2022 The Cedar Chest had to remain closed and had to move its business to another location where its merchandize [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] was limited to only one table rather than an entire store. [Doc. # 24-1, \u00b6 32].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   \u2022 As a result of the Defendants' actions and inactions, Plaintiff, Julie O'Keefe d/b/a The Cedar Chest, has suffered great financial harm. The Cedar Chest was forced to close its business, turn customers away, hire a professional to conduct testing for asbestos, hire a professional to abate the asbestos, and relocate its business to a much smaller consignment store where it was limited to one table for all its remaining merchandize [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] that was not totally destroyed by contamination. The Cedar Chest has suffered lost sales, destruction of irreplaceable one of kind items and other significant financial losses. Also as a result of Defendants' action and inactions, Plaintiff Julie O'Keefe individually has suffered personal injury and emotional distress by breathing in and being repeatedly exposed to the deadly containment [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] of asbestos dust during the roofing construction, during the cleanup efforts, and by the tracking of the deadly asbestos dust in her car and her home. [Doc. # 24-1, \u00b6 33].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Specific to Above It All, O'Keefe alleges that Above It All breached its duty to determine whether the Property's old roof contained asbestos and communicate such findings, and to perform its work in a workmanlike manner by \"failing to ensure that a large pipe did not fall into The Cedar Chest's store, failing to place a tarp or other protective device on the second floor of the building to protect The Cedar Chest's store from falling dirt, silt, dust and debris and/or by failing to advise Plaintiffs and/or Defendant Townmaker, L.LC. that the roofing project was going to begin so that Plaintiffs could take any necessary precautions to protect the merchandize [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ], employees, customers or themselves.\" [Doc. # 24-1, pp. 9-10 \u00b6\u00b6 51-55].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Above It All sought a defense and indemnity under the Security National policy for the allegations against it in the Underlying Lawsuit. [Doc. # 24, p. 3 \u00b6\u00b6 10-11; Doc. # 24-2]. Security National declined Above It All's request for insurance coverage under the policy, citing four policy provisions: (1) the pollution exclusion, (2) the asbestos exclusion, (3) the punitive or exemplary damage exclusion, and (4) the policy's definition of \"bodily injury.\" [Doc. # 4-2, \u00b6\u00b6 22-26].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   On November 30, 2017, O'Keefe filed her Amended Petition in the Underlying Lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Doc. # 31-1]. The Amended Petition removes all reference to \"asbestos.\" Specifically, the Amended Petition alleges that Above It All breached its duty to perform the roofing job in a good and workmanlike manner by \"failing to ensure that a large pipe did not fall into The Cedar Chest's store, failing to place a tarp or other protective device on the second floor of the building to protect The Cedar Chest's store from falling dirt, silt, dust and debris, and/or by failing to advise Plaintiffs and/or Defendant Townmaker, L.L.C. that the roofing project was going to begin so that Plaintiffs could take any necessary precautions to protect the merchandise, employees, customers or themselves.\" [Doc. # 31-1, p. 7 \u00b6 45].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Above It All argues that, because the Amended Petition makes no asbestos-related allegations, Security National can no longer rely on the asbestos exclusion or the pollution exclusion and therefore Security National is obligated to provide a defense to Above It All for the Amended Petition from November 30, 2017 forward (as well as for the original Petition for the reasons previously asserted). [Doc. # 31, p. 5]. In response Security National requests additional briefing regarding whether the pollution exclusion remains applicable to the Underlying Lawsuit based on the Amended Petition's allegations that the sole cause of O'Keefe's damages was dust and debris. [Doc. # 32, p. 3]. Additionally, Security National, for the first time, raises the issue of the potential application of the policy's Independent Contractors Limitation Endorsement based on Above It All's apparent subcontracting out of the work at the Property. [Doc. # 32, p. 2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History and Scope of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   On December 1, 2016, Above It All sued Security National in the District Court in and for Tulsa County, State of Oklahoma, alleging breach of contract and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing. On December 30, 2016, Security National removed the lawsuit to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   At the court's suggestion, the parties agreed to submit the issue of coverage-specifically the issue of Security National's duty to defend Above It All against O'Keefe's claims in the Underlying Lawsuit under the Security National policy-to\n   judicial determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties filed their respective briefs on coverage [Doc. # 24 and Doc. # 26], and responses [Doc. # 27 and Doc. # 28]. The court stayed discovery as to Above It All's bad faith claim during the pendency of the coverage determination. [Doc. # 23]. On December 12, 2017, Above It All supplemented its opening coverage brief to notify this court of O'Keefe's Amended Petition in the Underlying Lawsuit [Doc. # 31], and on January 3, 2018, Security National filed its response to the supplement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The court's coverage determination is not made under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Doc. # 21]. Further, such determination does not include any opinion as to whether Security National breached the insurance contract by refusing to defend Above It All in the Underlying Lawsuit or breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing. Nor does the court consider the potential application or effect of the Independent Contractors Limitation Endorsement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court's determination is limited to whether, based on the stipulated facts, coverage briefing, and submitted exhibits before the court, Security National is obligated to defend Above It All in the Underlying Lawsuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court first analyzes the duty to defend based upon the allegations of the original Petition and coverage briefing, and then analyzes the duty to defend based on the Amended Petition and supplemental coverage briefing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Applicable Oklahoma Law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   General principles of contractual interpretation govern the construction of an insurance policy.\n   <em>\n    Dodson v.

The court will separately consider each argument with regard to the allegations of the original Petition, and then consider the effect of subsequent information on the duty to defend. [Doc. # 24-11].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Pollution Exclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   As set forth above, the Security National insurance policy includes a total pollution exclusion, subpart (1) of which precludes coverage for \" 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' which would not have occurred in whole or part but for the actual, alleged or threatened discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape of 'pollutants' at any time.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Doc. # 24-8, p. 16]. Above It All contends that the pollution exclusion is inapplicable to the allegations of the original Petition for two reasons: (1) the damages asserted in the Underlying Litigation were caused by Above It All's negligent workmanship and resultant felled pipe, as well as the alleged release of asbestos; and (2) asbestos does not qualify as a \"pollutant\" as defined by the policy. [Doc. # 27, pp. 4-18].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Asserted Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Security National argues that, because the damages sought in the original Petition in the Underlying Litigation are wholly predicated upon release or discharge of a \"pollutant,\" coverage under the policy is precluded by the pollution exclusion. In opposition, Above It All argues that the original Petition alleges damages from Above It All's negligent workmanship, not just the release of asbestos. That is, Above It All contends that the damages asserted in the original Petition were caused by two identifiable causes, one potentially excluded (asbestos) and one not, and therefore coverage is owed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   This argument requires the court to, first, consider the Security National policy's insuring agreement to determine the scope of damages generally covered under the policy and, second, to analyze the damages sought in the original Petition to determine whether the asserted damages fall within the scope of the policy's insuring agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The policy's insuring agreement applies to \"property damage,\" [Doc. # 24-8, p. 30],\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   which is defined as \"[p]hysical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of that property\" and \"[l]oss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.\" [Doc. # 24-8, p. 44]. Pursuant to both definitions of \"property damage,\" \"[a]ll such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the 'occurrence' that caused it.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Although Above It All argues that the original Petition \"clearly alleged damage from the negligence of Above It All, not just damage from the alleged release of asbestos,\" Above It All does not identify any specific damages sought by O'Keefe related only to the negligent workmanship and not the asbestos. [Doc. # 27, p. 4]. However, the court notes the original Petition alleges that \"an approximately 24 foot lead pipe fell through the ceiling of The Cedar Chest,\" and seeks damages for destruction of the Cedar Chest's merchandise. [Doc. # 24-1, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 33]. Further, the it alleges that,\n   <em>\n    prior to any indication of asbestos\n   </em>\n   , O'Keefe was forced to close her business because \"silt, dirt, dust, and debris continued to fall into the store and there was no protection from further pipes or objects falling through the ceiling of The Cedar Chest's store.\" [Doc. # 24-1, \u00b6 27].\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   [Doc. # 24-1, \u00b6\u00b6 28-29 (indicating that Townmaker informed The Cedar Chest when the roofing job was complete and that the Cedar Chest was \"clear to start cleaning up its shop\" and it was \"safe to go back into the building,\" and that only\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   O'Keefe began cleaning did O'Keefe decide to have professional testing performed) ]. Thus, the original Petition can be reasonably read to allege that the 24-foot pipe that fell through the ceiling resulted in damage to O'Keefe's leasehold and merchandise, regardless of whether asbestos fell on that merchandise. Based on these allegations, the court is persuaded that the original Petition alleges that both negligent workmanship and the release of asbestos contributed to the damages sought by O'Keefe in the original Petition, although the court cannot identify any damages solely related to negligent\n   workmanship based on the materials before it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Because the damages are alleged to have been the result of two causes, the court must consider the efficient proximate cause doctrine under Oklahoma law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Am.

In the\n   <em>\n    Great American Restoration\n   </em>\n   decision, the policy included specific exclusions for both asbestos and pollution. The asbestos exclusion stated that coverage did not apply \"to 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' arising out of the 'inhal[ation]' or 'prolonged physical exposure to' asbestos, the 'use' of asbestos in construction, the 'removal' of asbestos from products or structures, or the 'manufacture, sale, transportation, storage, or disposal' of asbestos or products containing asbestos.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 144. The pollution exclusion precluded coverage for \" 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' arising out of the actual, alleged or threatened discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape of 'pollutants,' \" defined as \"any solid, liquid, gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant, including smoke, vapor, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, chemicals and waste.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court concluded that interpreting \"pollutant\" to include asbestos created an ambiguity because \"[a]lthough asbestos may be a thermal irritant ... the term 'asbestos' is not specifically included within the definition of a 'pollutant' as defined under the terms of the policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 146. Further, the court concluded that including asbestos within the policy's definition of \"pollutant\" would \"render the specific asbestos exclusion meaningless, in violation of settled canons of construction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The court is not persuaded by\n   <em>\n    Great American\n   </em>\n   for three reasons.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , under Oklahoma law, \"policy exclusions are read seriatim; each exclusion eliminates coverage and operates independently against the general declaration of insurance coverage and all prior exclusions by specifying other occurrences not covered by the policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Dodson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11956683\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/812/372/#p376\">\n    812 P.2d at 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted).

Here, the asbestos exclusion removes coverage for asbestos in some circumstances; the pollution exclusion applies to further remove coverage. The purposes of the policy's definition of \"pollutant\" is to define specific excluded losses, not negate another plainly worded exclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BP America, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8442678\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/148/832/#p835\">\n    148 P.3d at 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , the court is not persuaded that interpreting \"pollutant\" to include asbestos would render the asbestos exclusions superfluous, or vice versa. The focus of the inquiry with regard to the applicability of the pollution exclusion is whether the damages would have \"occurred in whole or part\" from pollution, resulting in the circumvention of the efficient proximate cause doctrine. The asbestos exclusion inquiry focuses on whether the alleged injuries\n   \"arise out of\" asbestos. The court can foresee separate application of the two exclusions based on these distinct inquiries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Third, in the majority of the cases identified by the court considering whether an asbestos-specific exclusion renders a pollution exclusion ambiguous, the courts have found no ambiguity.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    RLI Ins.

The effect of such prudence, however, is not to restrict the scope of the pollution exclusion.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the court concludes that the pollution exclusion in the Security National policy unambiguously applied to preclude coverage for the damages sought in the original Petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Asbestos Exclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Although the pollution exclusion initially appears applicable with regard to the allegations of the original Petition, the court will consider the asbestos exclusion. As previously mentioned, the policy includes an asbestos exclusion, which precludes coverage for \"bodily injury,\" \"property damage,\" or \"personal and advertising injury,\" arising out of five (5) designated activities enumerated in sub-paragraphs a. through e. Security National does not dispute that sub-paragraphs a., b., c., and e. are inapplicable to coverage for the Underlying Litigation. Accordingly, the court's analysis is limited to subparagraph d., which excludes coverage for \"bodily injury,\" \"property damage,\" or \"personal and advertising injury,\" \"arising out of ... [i]nhaling, ingesting or prolonged physical exposure to asbestos or goods or products containing asbestos.\" [Doc. # 24-8, p. 17].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Security National argues that any \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" asserted by O'Keefe is precluded from coverage by reason of the asbestos exclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Doc. # 26, p. 13]. Although any \"bodily injury\" allegedly sustained by O'Keefe due to exposure to asbestos is unambiguously excluded by sub-paragraph d. of the asbestos exclusion, the court is not persuaded that sub-paragraph d. excludes coverage for allegations of \"property damage.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Sub-paragraph d. applies to injury or damage due to \"inhaling, ingesting, or prolonged physical exposure\" to asbestos. [Doc. # 24-8, p. 17]. The alleged \"property damage\" to O'Keefe's merchandise clearly did not arise from the \"inhal[ation]\" or \"ingesti[on]\" of asbestos. Thus, it is necessary to consider whether the alleged \"property damage\" arose from \"prolonged physical exposure\" to asbestos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The Security National policy does not define \"prolonged physical exposure.\" [Doc. # 24-8, p. 17]. Nor have Oklahoma courts. Accordingly, this court must \"determine the best-reasoned interpretation\" of the phrase.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. E. Cent. Okla.

Here, sub-paragraph d. first lists two potential\n   causes of injuries that are specific to bodily injury-\"inhalation\" and \"ingestion.\" These specific causes are followed by the more general cause \"prolonged physical exposure.\" Pursuant to the principle of ejusdem generis, the phrase \"prolonged physical exposure\" is intended to encompass actions of the same general type as \"inhalation\" and \"ingestion\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , bodily injuries.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10400215\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/753/1334/#p1336\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the court concludes that sub-paragraph d. of the asbestos exclusion is inapplicable to allegations of \"property damage.\" Because the original Petition clearly alleged \"property damage,\" sub-paragraph d. of the asbestos exclusion does not preclude a duty to defend under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Punitive or Exemplary Damage Exclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Security National asserts that \"[t]he punitive damages exclusion precludes coverage for the alleged damages sought from Above It All.\" [Doc. # 26, p. 15]. Policy \"coverage,\" under Oklahoma law includes two duties-the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify. However, as previously mentioned, the court is not considering the duty to indemnify at this time. Rather, the court's inquiry is limited to the duty to defend Above It All.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The punitive damage exclusion states: \"If a 'suit' is brought against the insured for damages covered by this policy, seeking both compensatory and punitive or exemplary damages, [Security National] will afford a defense to such action.\" [Doc. # 24-8, p. 17]. The original Petition in the Underlying Lawsuit seeks both compensatory and punitive damages against Above It All. [Doc. # 24-1, \u00b6 55]. The punitive damage exclusion is unambiguous, and does not exclude a duty to defend Above It All under the Security National policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    D. \"Bodily Injury\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   In their final argument, Security National asserts that the original Petition in the Underlying Litigation does not allege \"bodily injury\" as defined by the policy. Because this court has found that the original Petition in the Underlying Lawsuit alleges \"property damage,\" whether the original Petition asserts \"bodily injury\" is not determinative as to the duty to defend. Accordingly, the court will not decide the issue at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Effect of Subsequent Information\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Although the court concludes that the pollution exclusion effectively circumvents the efficient proximate cause doctrine and applies to the allegations of the original Petition, based on the materials submitted to this court, it is clear that, at some point, questions were raised as to the presence or existence of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   asbestos at the Property. Specifically, the materials submitted included a March 26, 2017 report prepared by Pinnacle Environmental Solutions &amp; Consulting finding: (1) friable asbestos containing material below the detection limit; and (2) no non-friable asbestos containing material present. [Doc. # 24-11]. The March 26, 2017 report was forwarded via e-mail to counsel for Security National on April 7, 2017. [Doc. # 24-12].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   As previously mentioned, under Oklahoma law, the duty to defend determination is not limited to the allegations of the pleadings, but is determined \"on the basis of information gleaned from the petition (and other pleadings), from the insured and from other sources available to the insurer.\"\n   <em>\n    First Bank of Turley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11952443\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/928/298/#p302\">\n    928 P.2d at 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis removed from original) (citation omitted). \"An insurer has a duty to defend an insured whenever it ascertains\n   <em>\n    the presence of facts\n   </em>\n   that give rise to the\n   <em>\n    potential\n   </em>\n   of liability under the policy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11952443\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/928/298/#p302\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added) (internal citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Thus, an insurer cannot shut its eyes to\n   <em>\n    facts\n   </em>\n   triggering the duty to defend, in favor of reliance upon the complaint's allegations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11952443\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/928/298/#p302\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 303 n.13. \" '[E]ven though the pleadings do not show coverage, where known or reasonably ascertainable facts become available that show coverage the duty to defend devolves upon the insured.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11952443\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/928/298/#p302\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 303 n.15 (quoting 7 Appleman,\n   <em>\n    Insurance Law &amp; Practice\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4684.01 at 95 (1979) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Under the circumstances of this case, the court concludes that facts indicating that asbestos was\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   present at the Property, coupled with the original Petition's allegations of negligent workmanship, give rise to the potential for liability under the policy to which no exclusion would apparently apply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, evidence indicating that damage occurred\n   <em>\n    absent the presence of any asbestos\n   </em>\n   gives rise to the potential for damages within the policy's coverage and triggered Security National's duty to defend.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    First Bank of Turley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11952443\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/928/298/#p302\">\n    928 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   304 n.16. Accordingly, the court concludes that the duty to defend was trigged by the allegations of the original Petition in the Underlying Lawsuit on the date the March 26, 2017 report was forwarded by email to counsel for Security National such that Security National was made aware of facts giving rise to the potential for liability under the policy-April 7, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n    <em>\n     Application and Coverage Analysis Under the Policy to the Amended Petition\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   As previously stated, the Amended Petition removes all references to asbestos from the original Petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Doc. # 31-1]. Specifically, the Amended Complaint alleges that Above It All breached its duty to perform the roofing job in a good and workmanlike manner by \"failing to ensure that a large pipe did not fall into The Cedar Chest's store, failing to place a tarp or other protective device on the second floor of the building to protect The Cedar Chest's store from falling dirt, silt, dust and debris and/or by failing to advise Plaintiffs and/or Defendant Townmaker, L.L.C. that the roofing project was going to begin so that Plaintiffs could take any necessary precautions to protect the merchandize,\n   employees, customers or themselves.\" [Doc. # 31-1, p. 7 \u00b6 45].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Absent allegations of asbestos, neither the pollution exclusion nor the asbestos exclusion applies. Further, for the same reasons discussed with regard to the original Petition, the punitive or exemplary damage exclusion and definition of \"bodily injury\" do not preclude the duty to defend.

[Doc. # 27, p. 17]. The Tenth Circuit has recognized that friable asbestos includes previously nonfriable material \"after such previously nonfriable material becomes damaged to the extent that when dry it may be crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder by hand pressure.\"\n    <em>\n     Adams-Arapahoe Sch.

Presumably, many pollutants may not be harmful while in a controlled form, but become hazardous upon damage. Further, those jurisdictions that have concluded that asbestos is not a \"pollutant\" generally have not based their decisions on the character of asbestos but, rather, that the release of asbestos does not result in environmental injury as required for application of the pollution exclusion in those jurisdictions.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v.

Essentially, Security National belatedly attempts to assert that dirt, dust and debris constitute \"pollutants\" as defined by the policy. The original Petition alleged that dirt, dust and debris, in part, caused O'Keefe's damages.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , [Doc. # 24-1, \u00b6\u00b6 23 and 54]. However, Security National's denial letters do not assert that dirt, dust and debris are \"pollutants.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    [Doc. # 24-3, p. 6 (\"The Pollution Exclusion also precludes coverage for the alleged damages because the petition alleges that\n    <em>\n     asbestos\n    </em>\n    caused contamination.\") (emphasis added); Doc. # 24-9]. Nor has Security National previously argued for application of the pollution exclusion based on dirt, dust and debris before this court. As a result, under well-established Oklahoma law, Security National is precluded from asserting the coverage defense that dust, dirt, and debris are \"pollutants\" for purposes of the policy's pollution exclusion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Buzzard v.
