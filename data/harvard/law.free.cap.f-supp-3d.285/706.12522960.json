(\"Northern Oil\"), Michael L. Reger (\"Reger\"), and Thomas W. Stoelk (\"Stoelk,\" collectively, the \"Defendants\"). Lead plaintiff Matthew Atkinson (\"Plaintiff\" or \"Atkinson\") asserts causes of action individually and on behalf of others similarly situated against Defendants for violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. Plaintiff generally alleges that Defendants made false and misleading statements in their public filings and comments.

CAC \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Northern Oil is an independent energy company engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas properties in the United States, primarily holding interests in the Williston Basin of North Dakota and Montana.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 31. It was co-founded by Reger and Ryan Gilbertson (\"Gilbertson\"), a non-party, in 2006.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, 32. In 2007, Northern Oil became a public company through a reverse merger whereby it merged into a company that had publicly-traded stock.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. It is incorporated in Minnesota and is headquartered in Wayzata, Minnesota.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The two individual Defendants occupied executive positions at Northern Oil during the Class Period.

Reger sold over 550,000 shares of Northern Oil common stock during the Class Period for tax purposes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. 41 (\"Hammel Decl.\") Ex. 20-36. Stoelk served as Northern Oil's Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\") at all relevant times, and became the interim CEO upon Reger's termination. CAC \u00b6 28. Stoelk sold over 78,000 shares of Northern Oil common stock during the Class Period for tax purposes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Hammel Decl.

Reger's Conduct at Dakota Plains\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2008, Reger and Gilbertson co-founded another company named Dakota Plains Transport Inc., which became a public\n   company named Dakota Plains Holdings, Inc. (\"Dakota Plains\") on March 22, 2012. CAC \u00b6 34. Dakota Plains, a non-party, is a \"transloading\" facility that loads crude oil into railway cars in New Town, North Dakota, and is wholly unrelated to Northern Oil.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 29. It is a Nevada corporation with its principal executive offices in Wayzata, Minnesota.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Reger and Gilbertson improperly exercised control over Dakota Plains.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 35-51. Specifically, when Dakota Plains became a public company, Reger controlled 21.4% of its stock and 33.3% of its promissory notes, and Gilbertson controlled 11% of its stock and 38.9% of its promissory notes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-27. However, in order to conceal the full extent of their involvement, they did not hold any formal positions at Dakota Plains.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. Instead, they named Reger's father as CEO and Gilbertson's father as President, and later installed one of their friends as CEO.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36, 40. Reger also held his Dakota Plains stock in ten different accounts over which he had beneficial ownership, with each account holding no more than 5% of the stock.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-51. Without disclosing their control or ownership, Reger and Gilbertson used their influence to improperly obtain financial benefits for themselves, including through a stock manipulation scheme.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 20, 2015, Dakota Plains reported Reger and Gilbertson's potential violations of securities laws at that company to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52. Thereafter, the SEC sent Reger a Wells Notice\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   in connection with the Dakota Plains investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15, 109. On August 16, 2016, after Reger informed Northern Oil of the Wells Notice, Northern Oil terminated Reger.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On that day, Northern Oil stock fell by 6.28%.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 110. On October 31, 2016, the SEC issued a cease and desist order against Reger concerning his role at Dakota Plains, in which he agreed to cease and desist from violating Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 13(d) and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and to make disgorgement and penalty payments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 111;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Hammel Decl. Ex. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Reger's Conduct at Northern Oil\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff claims that, during the Class Period, Reger neglected his responsibilities as the CEO of Northern Oil, and instead, appropriated Northern Oil resources to further his control of Dakota Plains. CAC \u00b6 55. Plaintiff relies on three confidential witnesses (\"CWs\"). CW 1, a former executive assistant at Northern Oil headquarters from January 2009 through September 2015 who reported directly to Reger, asserts Reger went to the Northern Oil headquarters in Wayzata, Minnesota\n   three or four days a week for brief periods of time, and that Stoelk effectively ran Northern Oil during Reger's last few years at the company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58. At Northern Oil headquarters, Reger worked on Dakota Plains matters, including holding meetings with Dakota Plains directors and investors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 60-61. CW 1 \"regularly ferried Dakota Plains-related personnel ... to and from Northern Oil headquarters.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61. Reger also used Northern Oil sponsored tours of Northern Oil facilities in North Dakota to pitch hedge funds and other investment entities on Dakota Plains.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   CW 2, a former vice president of engineering at Northern Oil headquarters from November 2011 through November 2015 who reported directly to Reger and Stoelk, states that Reger had little to no involvement in the day-to-day operations at Northern Oil, and instead, spent most of his time pursuing acquisitions or working on matters related to Dakota Plains.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64. He further attests that Reger's role at Dakota Plains was an open secret at Northern Oil, of which Stoelk was aware.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 65-66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   CW 3, a former vice president of operations for Dakota Plains in Wayzata, Minnesota from April 2012 to February 2013, recalls spending more time in Northern Oil's offices than Dakota Plains' own offices, which was located half a block away from Northern Oil's headquarters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 53, 71. He states that \"Dakota Plains functioned under the direction of Northern Oil.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Defendants' Alleged False or Misleading Representations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that, in light of Reger's misconduct, Defendants made fraudulent representations and omissions in their public filings and other public comments. Specifically, Northern Oil stated in each of its Form 10-Ks for the years ended December 31, 2012, December 31, 2013, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015 that it \"adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to [Northern Oil's] chief executive officer, chief financial officer and persons performing similar functions [and that a] copy is available on [Northern Oil's] website at www.northernoil.com.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 74, 89, 98, 103. Reger and Stoelk signed certifications as to the accuracy of each of these public filings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Northern Oil and Gas, Inc., Annual Report Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Form 10-K) (March 1, 2013); Northern Oil and Gas, Inc., Annual Report Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Form 10-K) (March 3, 2014); Northern Oil and Gas, Inc., Annual Report Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Form 10-K) (February 27, 2015); Northern Oil and Gas, Inc., Annual Report Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Form 10-K) (March 3, 2016). Northern Oil's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics states in relevant part the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 \"It is the policy of [Northern Oil] that all employees and directors comply strictly with all laws governing its operations and to conduct its affairs in keeping with the highest moral, legal and ethical standards.

All employees must conduct business in a manner that avoids even the appearance of conflict between personal interests and those of [Northern Oil]....

Specifically, Northern Oil made the following alleged misrepresentations in its 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 10-Ks:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 \"To continue to develop our business, we rely on our management team's knowledge and expertise in the industry and will use our management team's relationships with industry participants, specifically those of Mr. Reger our Chief Executive Officer, to enter into strategic relationships, which may take the form of joint ventures with other private parties and contractual arrangements with other oil and natural gas companies.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 76, 91, 100, 105 (emphasis omitted).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 \"Michael L.

Mr. Reger began working the oil and gas leasing business for his family's company, Reger Oil, in 1992 and worked as an oil and gas landman for Reger Oil from 1992 until co-founding Northern [Oil] in 2006. Mr. Reger holds a B.A. in Finance and an M.B.A. in finance/management from the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota.

Northern Oil's outsized reliance on Reger allowed him to run Dakota Plains and engage in illegal stock manipulation, and this dependence on Reger also caused Northern Oil to overlook flagrant ethical violations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 93, 95, 97, 102, 106.

On May 8, 2017, the Court declined to grant joint appointment and appointed Atkinson to serve individually as lead plaintiff, finding that he was the most adequate plaintiff due to his timely application to be appointed as lead plaintiff, his large financial stake, typicality of his claims, and adequacy of his representation.
