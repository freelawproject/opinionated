Kisembo (\"Kisembo\"), Joseph Skabowski (\"Skabowski\"), and\n   David Van Leuven (\"Van Leuven\") (collectively \"plaintiffs\") are three Youth Division Aides (\"Aides\") employed by the New York State Office of Children and Family Services (\"OCFS\") at Brookwood Secure Center (\"Brookwood\"), a juvenile detention facility located in Claverack, New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that defendants OCFS, Acting OCFS Commissioner Sheila J. Poole (\"Commissioner Poole\"), current Brookwood Director Gary B. Pattman (\"Director Pattman\"), former OCFS Commissioner Roberto Velez (\"Commissioner Velez\"), former OCFS Commissioner Gladys Carrion (\"Commissioner Carrion\"), former Brookwood Director Farouk Mallick (\"Director Mallick\"), and former Brookwood Director John Dixon (\"Director Dixon\") (collectively \"defendants\") have violated their constitutional rights under the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In particular, plaintiffs' complaint alleges that in 2007 defendants enacted a use-of-force protocol that obligates Brookwood staff members facing a disturbance to exhaust non-physical options before resorting to the use of force. According to plaintiffs, defendants continue to enforce this protocol despite knowing full well that it places staff members at increased risk of injury or death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants have moved under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure seeking to dismiss plaintiffs' complaint in its entirety. The motion has been fully briefed and will be considered on the basis of the submissions without oral argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   OCFS supervises the operation of Brookwood, a juvenile detention facility that houses a population of \"male individuals up to the age of 21 years old.\" Compl. \u00b6 21. Because these inmates are typically \"physically mature, with known violent criminal histories, including assault and murder,\" employees at Brookwood are \"often requir[ed to use] immediate, forcible restraint to prevent [inmates] from inflicting life threatening assaults upon the staff.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 27, 2007, Commissioner Carrion replaced the existing use-of-force and physical restraint policies and procedures at Brookwood with a revised Protocol (the \"2007 Protocol\" or the \"Protocol\") that was \"intended to limit the use of restraint to circumstances when all mandated, proactive, non-physical, behavioral management techniques had been tried and failed.\" Compl. \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The 2007 Protocol, which would later come to be known as the \"therapeutic\" or \"sanctuary\" model of dealing with juvenile inmates, \"mandated that when the use of physical restraint is necessary, the staff shall employ only the mandated minimum amount of physical control necessary to stabilize the Juvenile Inmate in a dangerous or violent situation.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   To that end, the Protocol required Aides like plaintiffs to use \"initial, proactive non-physical behavioral management [NPBM] techniques\" before resorting to physical restraint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Compl. \u00b6 20. In addition, the Protocol discouraged plaintiffs and other Aides at Brookwood from using \"touch controls,\" such as \"tapping,\" \"prodding,\" or other \"incidental gesture[s]\" when addressing,\n   confronting, or directing juvenile inmates at the facility.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Prior to the implementation of the 2007 Protocol, Aides at Brookwood lacked \"deterrent devices\" but \"were at least allowed to use decisive measures to physically restrain the [juveniles] when in imminent danger of violent assault.\" Compl. \u00b6 24. However, after the Protocol was implemented, Aides \"were no longer allowed to use decisive measures to physically restrain [inmates] when in imminent danger of violent assault.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs allege the 2007 Protocol \"has promulgated a culture of predatory behavior on the part of certain violent [inmates], who have become intimately aware of the limitations placed upon the Aides in defending themselves from unprovoked assaults that are intended to cause injury or death.\" Compl. \u00b6 27. As a result, the Protocol \"has caused a culture of trepidation and fear among the Aides,\" who are unable to defend themselves.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The 2007 Protocol also altered how inmate-on-staff assaults were treated at Brookwood. Compl. \u00b6 33. Before the Protocol, an inmate who assaulted an Aide or other staff member would \"immediately be moved to a modified special program (\"MSP\") for a thirty-day period, in which there would be 24-hour supervision and he would be escorted from his unit for school, recreation, and medical care only.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Since 2007, however, \"there is no such procedure\" in place, \"leaving the Aides vulnerable to further attack.\" Compl. \u00b6 35. Further, plaintiffs allege defendants fail to abide by certain reporting regulations instituted by the Public Employee Safety and Health Bureau (\"PESH\") that require facilities like Brookwood to document incidents \"involving physical violence against the Aides.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Finally, plaintiffs allege the unsafe environment created by the 2007 Protocol has been exacerbated by OCFS's recent decision to reduce certain staffing levels at detention facilities like Brookwood. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 29-30. For instance, the Special Services Unit (\"SSU\") staff-who were previously stationed in all common areas and hallways for immediate crisis response and to assist with all inmate movements in the hallways-were eliminated and reassigned to individual units, leaving the hallways and other common areas unprotected.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. According to plaintiffs' complaint, these staffing reductions occurred some time in 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   All three plaintiffs allege that they suffered serious on-the-job injuries at the hands of violent juvenile inmates that are traceable to the changes wrought by the 2007 Protocol.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     David Van Leuven\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Van Leuven is a 280-pound, 52-year-old male who has worked as an OCFS Aide since January of 2001. Compl. \u00b6 97. Since 2005, Van Leuven has also been qualified as a \"facility-based trainer\" and he is therefore familiar with the \"supervision, counseling, control, and, when necessary, restraint of [inmates] within the maximum secure juvenile facilities.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99. Van Leuven became the facility trainer at Brookwood on March 23, 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On December 12, 2014, at approximately 4:30 p.m., Van Leuven attempted to intervene in an argument in the hallway between\n   a juvenile inmate and an SSU staff member. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 100-04.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   When Van Leuven attempted to resolve the situation using NPBM techniques, a second juvenile inmate \"grabbed him with a bear hug, and another [inmate], ... hit [him] over the head, neck, and shoulder with a crutch.\" Compl. \u00b6 105.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Although Van Leuven \"attempted to gain control of [the situation] by putting [the inmate] in a standing physical restraint, in response [the inmate] continued to hit [Van Leuven] with the other crutch, injuring his right wrist and arm.\" Compl. \u00b6 106.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Van Leuven was transported to the hospital, \"where he was treated for a severe headache, blurred vision, and was later found to have sustained compressed and fractured vertebrae of the neck, resulting in pain and loss of movement.\" Compl. \u00b6 107.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As a result of this incident, Van Leuven \"suffers from anxiety, sleeplessness, agitation, and post-traumatic stress.\" Compl. \u00b6 107.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Charles A. Kisembo\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Kisembo is a 180-pound, 60-year-old male who has worked for OCFS for over twenty years. Compl. \u00b6 39. As a result of his two-decade tenure, Kisembo \"had been trained and was experienced in all the procedures instituted by OCFS with regard to supervision, counseling, control, and, when necessary, restraint of [inmates] within the secure juvenile facilities such as Brookwood.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On December 11, 2016, at around 6:30 a.m., Kisembo began his shift at Brookwood, where he was assigned as a member of the SSU staff, the \"kitchen dining room staff,\" and the medical round staff. Compl. \u00b6 44. At around 11:00 a.m., medical staff asked Kisembo to escort three juvenile inmates-one at a time-to the medical department.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Kisembo located the first of the three inmates, who was on a \"safety watch,\" in another part of the Brookwood facility. Compl. \u00b6 48. According to Kisembo, this inmate was \"approximately 6 feet tall, weigh[ed] approximately 200 pounds, and [was] known to have committed multiple prior assaults of Aides at Brookwood.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49. In any event, the inmate \"appeared compliant\" when Kisembo first approached him, and so Kisembo and other staff member began the process of escorting the inmate to the medical department.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Kisembo, the inmate, and the second staff member were about one-quarter of the way down a hallway leading to the medical department when the inmate \"grabbed a pair of wet floor signs and called out [Kisembo's] name.\" Compl. \u00b6 54. When Kisembo turned around and observed the inmate holding the wet floor signs, he attempted to \"de-escalate the situation in a non-physical manner\" in accordance with the 2007 Protocol.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56. The inmate ignored Kisembo's attempt at de-escalation and instead \"brutally assaulted him by swinging the wet floor sign at his forehead.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Kisembo was \"shocked and dazed, blood began gushing out of his head and down his face and clothes, and he collapsed to the floor.\" Compl. \u00b6 59. Medical staff rushed Kisembo to the hospital, where he nearly died.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 60-65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"As a result of the brutal, near-fatal assault, [Kisembo] received twenty stitches on his forehead and now has a disfiguring scar, he experiences ringing in his ears, sleepless nights, repeatedly relives the situation, suffers from severe migraine headaches and neck pain, and has been treating with a psychologist for post-traumatic stress, a physical therapist for neck pain, and is scheduled for further treatment with a neurologist.\" Compl. \u00b6 65. Kisembo is presently disabled.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Joseph Skabowski\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Skabowski is a 227-pound, 43-year-old male who has worked as an OCFS Aide since May 31, 1998. Compl. \u00b6 69. As with his fellow plaintiffs Van Leuven and Kisembo, Skabowski \"has been trained and was experienced in the aforementioned Protocol instituted by OCFS with regard to supervision, counseling, control, and when necessary restraint of [inmates] within the maximum security juvenile facilities\" like Brookwood.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On December 31, 2016, some time after 6:30 a.m., the same inmate who had assaulted Kisembo just twenty days before \"came out of his room[ and] walked down to the staff office.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 71-72. When Skabowski instructed him to return to his room, the inmate refused, stated \"I'm going to hit you,\" and then struck Skabowski \"on the left side of his face, ear, and head.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73. With the assistance of another staff member, Skabowski managed to restrain the inmate, who was handcuffed and returned to his room.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74. Skabowski went to the emergency room, where he was treated for \"an abrasion on the left side of his head and a concussion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On January 4, 2017, Skabowski was assigned to the same area of the Brookwood facility where he had recently been assaulted. Compl. \u00b6 76. When Skabowski inevitably ran into the same inmate again, he \"suffered an incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder and became anxious, pale, and dizzy and sought treatment in the emergency room.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On January 19, 2017, some time \"later in the morning,\" a different inmate threatened to throw milk at Skabowski. Compl. \u00b6 79. When Skabowski \"explained to [the inmate] that there will be consequences and he will be written up,\" the inmate threw the milk at him anyway, \"spit on him and then ran into the bathroom.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80. Skabowski notified SSU staff, who escorted the inmate back to his room.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   A short time later, Skabowski was tasked with escorting a different inmate to the facility's activity room. Compl. \u00b6 82. When the inmate and Skabowski were alone in the room, the inmate \"took a broomstick from the corner, removed the stick from the broom, and sat at his desk holding the broomstick in a threatening manner.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83. In addition, the inmate told Skabowski \"he wanted to hit him with the broomstick.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84. Skabowski called for assistance from the Duty Officer, who arrived and spoke with the inmate, but did not take the broomstick away from him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85. After five minutes or so, two other staff members came in and took the broomstick away from the inmate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The next day, January 20, 2017, at around 6:15 a.m., Skabowski advised his Duty Officer about the threatening behavior he experienced the day before, including the milk-throwing and spitting incident. Compl. \u00b6 87. According to the complaint, the Duty Officer rejected Skabowski's concerns, reassigned him to the same location in the facility, and stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \"you've been here long enough, figure it out.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Later that morning, the inmate who had thrown milk on Skabowski tried to throw a cup of urine at him. Compl. \u00b6 89. Skabowski retreated to the staff office and called SSU staff and the Duty Officer for assistance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90. These additional staff were able to calm the inmate down and return him to his room.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Thereafter, Skabowski was tasked with escorting an inmate with a violent history to the activity room. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 91-92. This inmate \"became agitated because of the unavailability of recreational program\" and reacted by taking a clock off the wall and breaking in on a table.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93. Skabowski left the room and called for help from the Duty Officer and SSU staff members.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Although the staff members talked with the inmate for a couple of minutes, when they left and Skabowski returned to the activity room the inmate still \"appeared very unstable.\" Compl. \u00b6 94. When Skabowski \"attempted to calm him,\" the inmate flew into an \"uncontrollable rage, picked up several chairs and assaulted [Skabowski] with them, and then punched him in the face.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Skabowski was taken by ambulance to the hospital, where he was treated for \"a concussion, neck pain, a lump on his left lip, back, leg, and knee injuries, marks on his chest, back, and neck, a sprained middle finger, agitation, anxiety, sleeplessness, and post-traumatic stress.\" Compl. \u00b6 95.

Plaintiffs further allege that the Protocol has been in force continuously since that time as a result of conduct attributable to those defendants as well as to OCFS Commissioner Poole and Brookwood Director Pattman, the facility's current leadership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Plaintiffs claim the 2007 Protocol relegates the use of physical force against juvenile inmates, including but not limited to the application of physical restraint measures, to that of a last resort rather than a first impulse. Among other things, the Protocol requires Aides and other staff members at Brookwood to attempt proactive NPBM techniques before applying \"only the mandated minimum amount of physical control necessary to stabilize the Juvenile Inmate in a dangerous or violent situation.\" Compl. \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   According to plaintiffs, the 2007 Protocol has \"promulgated a culture of predatory behavior on the part of certain violent [inmates], who have become intimately aware of the limitations placed upon the Aides in defending themselves from unprovoked assaults that are intended to cause injury or death.\" Compl. \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   More recently, defendants have exacerbated the problems caused by the 2007 Protocol by reducing the levels of SSU staff inside Brookwood and by failing to properly report instances of physical violence in accordance with PESH, a state regulation. As a result of these changes, each named plaintiff has suffered a violent attack at the hands of one or more juvenile inmates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   But even considered in the aggregate, these factual allegations do not give rise to a claim of\n   <em>\n    constitutional\n   </em>\n   magnitude, especially since by its own terms the 2007 Protocol permits plaintiffs and other Brookwood staff members to use physical force when necessary \"to stabilize the Juvenile Inmate in a dangerous or violent situation.\" Compl. \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In fact, plaintiffs' complaint specifically alleges Van Leuven made use of physical force (albeit unsuccessfully) to attempt to restore order on at least one occasion. Id. \u00b6 106. There is no allegation that defendants ever disciplined Van Leuven as a result of his decision to apply force or physical restraint during this encounter. Nor is there any allegation that plaintiffs or any other Brookwood staff members were ever penalized, counseled, admonished, or reprimanded for using physical force in situations where it may have been necessary to \"stabilize ... a dangerous or violent situation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   To be sure, OCFS leadership's decision to depart from the pre-2007 use-of-force regime at Brookwood and other state-run juvenile detention centers-where Aides like plaintiffs \"were at least allowed to use decisive measures to physically restrain the Juvenile Inmates\"-might have been an \"incorrect or ill-advised\" policy change.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Indeed, plaintiffs appear to believe a policy that permits more wide-ranging application of physical force to non-compliant youthful offenders would produce better results at Brookwood.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 22-23 (alleging that \"some\" juveniles at Brookwood \"posed a danger and threat equivalent to inmates with comparable backgrounds in County Jails and State Prisons\" and suggesting that staff at those other detention facilities are permitted by policy to use physical restraint more liberally);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36 (alleging the inmate who assaulted two of the named plaintiffs never received \"any meaningful\" discipline).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   But the implementation and enforcement of the 2007 Protocol certainly does not qualify as \"arbitrary, conscience shocking, or oppressive in a constitutional sense.\"\n   <em>\n    Reyes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4069707\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/995/215/#p230\">\n    995 F.Supp.2d at 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
