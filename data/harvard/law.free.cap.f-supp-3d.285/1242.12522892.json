BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Cristian Naranjo filed suit against the Cherrington Firm, LLC and Lacey Cherrington (collectively, \"Cherrington\"). Cherrington is engaged in the business of debt collection. Cherrington allegedly attempted to and did collect from Naranjo amounts in excess of what Naranjo actually owed. Naranjo claims that Cherrington's debt-collection practices violated (1) the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\"), and (2) the Utah Consumer Sales Protection Act (\"UCSPA\"). Cherrington has moved to dismiss Naranjo's UCSPA claim on the grounds that debt collection is governed by a more specific statute, the FDCPA. The Court finds this argument meritless and therefore denies the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Cherrington contends that Naranjo's UCSPA claim is barred because a more specific federal law, the FDCPA, governs debt collection. Cherrington states, \"Utah law is clear that a claim under the UCSPA is barred when the conduct at issue is 'governed by other, more specific law.' \" But Cherrington misunderstands Utah law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Under Utah law, courts must construe legislative enactments to \"give effect to the legislature's underlying intent.\"\n   <em>\n    Millett v.

The court first looked to\n   Utah Code \u00a7 13-11-22(1)(a), which provides that the UCSPA \"does not apply to ... an act or practice required or specifically permitted by or under federal law, or by or under state law.\" The court then cited\n   <em>\n    Carlie\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Be r neike\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that a plaintiff cannot bring claims under the UCSPA when those claims \"are governed by any other state\n   <em>\n    or federal law\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%20657394\">\n    2014 WL 657394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The holding in\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   is wrong for two reasons.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , neither\n   <em>\n    Berneike\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Carlie\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that UCSPA does not provide a remedy when the alleged acts are governed by more specific\n   <em>\n    federal\n   </em>\n   law. Both cases looked to more specific\n   <em>\n    state\n   </em>\n   law to conclude that the UCSPA did not provide a remedy. In fact, in\n   <em>\n    Berneike\n   </em>\n   , the court ignored the fact that there was more specific federal law, RESPA, which regulated the alleged wrongful conduct.\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 13-11-22(1)(a) speaks only to situations where state or federal law \"require[s] or specifically permit[s]\" the alleged wrongful conduct.

Utah Oct. 13, 2017), the court held that plaintiffs failed to allege a UCSPA claim because the alleged wrongful conduct fell squarely within the Federal Wiretap Act\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the Utah Interception of Communication Act (collectively defined in the case as the \"Wiretap Acts\"). The court was not clear as to whether it would have reached the same conclusion if it relied solely on the Federal Wiretap Act:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   This conduct falls squarely within the Wiretap Acts.

Thus,\n   <em>\n    West\n   </em>\n   provides little guidance to the case at hand in which Cherrington relies solely on federal law to argue that a UCSPA claim is barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Here, Naranjo's UCSPA claim is not barred by the FDCPA. Both\n   <em>\n    Carlie\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Berneike\n   </em>\n   spoke to situations where UCSPA claims were improper due to more specific state law. The rule enunciated in\n   <em>\n    Carlie\n   </em>\n   seeks to maintain consistency between state statutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lowder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10347596\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/889/412/#p414\">\n    889 P.2d at 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This gives effect to the Utah legislature's underlying intent.\n   <em>\n    Millett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10452319\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/609/934/#p936\">\n    609 P.2d at 936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For instance, if the Utah legislature has spoken specifically to a topic, its decision on that topic should not be undermined by a general legislative enactment, such as the UCSPA. But\n   <em>\n    Carlie\n   </em>\n   does not stand for the proposition that UCSPA claims are barred when there is more specific federal law that is consistent with state law. Indeed, the Court is unaware of any Utah Supreme Court case in which a party has been denied a remedy under Utah law because of a more specific, but not conflicting, federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Cherrington's argument is based entirely on the existence of a federal law, the FDCPA. It has not pointed to a state law that specifically regulates the alleged wrongful conduct, improper debt-collection practices. While there is state law that imposes registration and bond requirements\n   on collection agencies, it does not regulate debt-collection practices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2012-1-1\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 12-1-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   If Cherrington is aware of state law that specifically regulates debt collection, it is more than welcome to file a motion alerting the Court to such law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Cherrington seems to argue that the Court should adopt a sweeping rule of statutory construction whereby plaintiffs are denied remedies under state law whenever there is a more specific federal law. Admittedly, the court in\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   adopted such an approach. But that case was based on an erroneous reading of\n   <em>\n    Carlie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Berneike\n   </em>\n   , and \u00a7 13-11-22(1)(a). Such an approach would lead to sweeping preemption of Utah law whenever a federal law spoke more specifically to the subject matter of a lawsuit. In the case at hand, this was neither the intent of the Utah legislature,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13-11-22 (exemptions), nor Congress,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692n (\"[The FDCPA] does not annul, alter, or affect, or exempt any person subject to the provisions of this subchapter from complying with the laws of any State with respect to debt collection practices, except to the extent those laws are inconsistent with any provision of this subchapter, and then only to the extent of the inconsistency.\"). Accordingly, the Court concludes that Naranjo's UCSPA claim is not barred by the FDCPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Moreover, \u00a7 13-11-22(1)(a) does not bar Naranjo's UCSPA claim. As noted above, this section provides that the UCSPA does not apply when state or federal law \"require[s] or specifically permit[s]\" the alleged wrongful conduct. Here, Naranjo claims that Cherrington\n   <em>\n    violated\n   </em>\n   both federal and state law. Section 13-11-22(1)(a) would apply only if Cherrington's actions were required or specifically permitted by federal or state law. Accordingly, the Court concludes that \u00a7 13-11-22(1)(a) does not bar Naranjo's UCSPA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In sum, Naranjo's UCSPA is not barred by the rule enunciated in\n   <em>\n    Carlie\n   </em>\n   nor \u00a7 13-11-22(1)(a). The UCSPA claim would be barred under\n   <em>\n    Carlie\n   </em>\n   only if there were a more specific state law that regulated the subject matter of this suit, debt collection. Cherrington has not identified any such law. And \u00a7 13-11-22(1)(a) would apply only if the alleged wrongful conduct were required or specifically permitted by federal or state law. It is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
