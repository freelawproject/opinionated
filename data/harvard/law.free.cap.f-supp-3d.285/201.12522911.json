(\"AOL\"). Plaintiff argues that Defendants violated the Federal Records Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202101\">\n    44 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"FRA\") and the Administrative Procedures Act (\"APA\") by failing to initiate action through the Attorney General for the recovery of the emails, which constitute federal records improperly removed from the State Department. Plaintiff has a pending Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") request for the emails, and the injury it alleges is the continuing inability to access the emails due to Defendants' failure to act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss for lack of standing. They contend that the relief Plaintiff seeks-initiation of action through the Attorney General to recover the emails-is not likely to redress Plaintiff's injury, because Defendants \"have no reason\n   to believe that any federal records still exist in former Secretary Powell's private email account.\" Mem. in Support of Defs.' Mot. Dismiss 1 (hereinafter \"Defs.' Mot. Dismiss\"). Specifically, Defendants argue that because AOL informed Secretary Powell's personal representative that the email account no longer exists, any further effort will be fruitless. However, because the FRA is premised on leveraging the significant \"law enforcement authority of the United States [as] a key weapon in assuring record preservation and recovery,\"\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch, Inc. v.
