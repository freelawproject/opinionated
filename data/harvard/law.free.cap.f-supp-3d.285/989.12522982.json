Having considered the motions, submissions, and applicable law, the Court determines Houston Independent School District's motion for summary judgment should be granted and Springboards to Education Inc.'s motion for summary judgment should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is a trademark infringement case. Plaintiff Springboards to Education Inc. (\"Springboard\") is a Texas corporation that designs, markets, and sells reading and other education-related products and programs. Springboard owns multiple federally registered trademarks related to its products and programs (\"Springboard's Marks\"). Defendant Houston Independent School District (\"HISD\") is a Texas independent school district. From 2008 to 2013, HISD offered a free summer reading program to HISD students called the Houston ISD Millionaire Club (the \"Millionaire Club\"). Springboard alleges HISD used multiple products and services in connection with the Millionaire Club that infringed on Springboard's Marks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Based on the foregoing, on August 29, 2016, Springboard filed this lawsuit against HISD\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging trademark infringement, trademark counterfeiting, trademark dilution, unfair competition, and unconstitutional takings under Texas and federal laws. On September 20, 2016, the Court dismissed Springboard's state law claims for trademark dilution, trademark infringement, and unfair competition. Only Springboard's federal Lanham Act claims and state and federal takings claims remain. On October 2, 2017, HISD and Springboard cross-moved for summary\n   judgment on Springboard's federal Lanham Act claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    II.

Therefore, \"[a]lthough we consider the evidence and all reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, the nonmoving party may not rest on the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings, but must respond by setting forth specific facts indicating a genuine issue for trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Goodson v.

LAW &amp; ANALYSIS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Springboard brings federal Lanham Act claims and state and federal constitutional takings claims against HISD. HISD and Springboard cross-move for summary judgment on Springboard's federal Lanham Act claims. HISD additionally moves for summary judgment on Springboard's state and federal constitutional takings claims. The Court first addresses Springboard's federal Lanham Act claims and then turns to Springboard's constitutional takings claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    A. Federal Lanham Act Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Springboard brings claims against HISD under the federal Lanham Act for (1) trademark counterfeiting; (2) trademark infringement; (3) false designations; and (4) trademark dilution. HISD and Springboard\n   cross-move for summary judgment on Springboard's federal Lanham Act claims. HISD contends summary judgment is proper on Springboard's federal Lanham Act claims because Springboard cannot prove HISD engaged in commercial use of Springboard's Marks. Springboard contends it can show HISD engaged in commercial use of Springboard's Marks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As to Springboard's trademark dilution claim, the Lanham Act specifically excludes \"[a]ny noncommercial use of a mark.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3). As to Springboard's trademark counterfeiting, trademark infringement, and false designations claims, the statutory requirement that the plaintiff's mark be used \"in connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution, or advertising of any goods or services\" requires commercial use of the plaintiff's mark.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201114\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1125 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bosley Med.

Thus, commercial use is required for all of Springboard's claims brought pursuant to the Lanham Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The commercial use requirement is rooted in Congress's ability to regulate commercial speech. Therefore, the United States Supreme Court's commercial speech doctrine and the purpose of the Lanham Act are relevant to the Court's inquiry as to what constitutes commercial use.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Procter &amp; Gamble Co. v.

Sale and Distribution of Products\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Springboard alleges HISD created, sold, and distributed thousands of products bearing Springboard's Marks, such as t-shirts, reading logs, brochures, and bumper stickers, in connection with the Millionaire Club. HISD contends: (1) there is no evidence that HISD sold or offered for sale any items containing Springboard's Marks; and (2) that distributing items free of cost to students in HISD does not constitute commercial use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As to Springboard's allegation that HISD sold infringing products, it is undisputed that HISD sold t-shirts in connection with its \"Name That Book\" contest, a separate and independent program from the Millionaire Club. It is further undisputed that the t-shirts in connection with the \"Name That Book\" contest did not contain Springboard's Marks. The Court\n   finds that the summary judgment record cited by both parties supports HISD's allegations that: (1) the products in connection with the Millionaire Club, such as reading logs, flyers, and bracelets, were distributed free of charge to students as an incentive to participate in the Millionaire Club; and (2) HISD did not sell or offer for sale any items in connection with the Millionaire Club or containing Springboard's Marks. As to Springboard's allegation that HISD created and distributed items bearing Springboard's Marks, the Court finds that creating and distributing items free of charge to students as an incentive to participate in a free local public education reading program is not commercial use of Springboard's Marks. The Court therefore finds that Springboard's allegation that HISD created, sold, and distributed products containing Springboard's Marks is insufficient to satisfy the commercial use requirement for Springboard's federal Lanham Act claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burlington N.

HISD contends Print Shop is not an entity separate from HISD and because all printing services were provided to HISD, HISD did not engage in commercial use of Springboard's Marks. It is undisputed that Print Shop charged HISD's Department of Library Services (\"Library\") for printing reading logs and flyers in connection with the Millionaire Club. It is further undisputed that Print Shop and Library are departments within the same entity-HISD. The Court finds that HISD's internal transaction between Print Shop and Library regarding printing flyers and reading logs for the Millionaire Club does not satisfy the commercial use requirement for Springboard's federal Lanham Act claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Canadian Pacific Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"287584\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/754/992/#p994\">\n    754 F.2d 992\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 994 (Fed.

It is undisputed that Springboard posted pictures on the internet and received sports ticket donations for HISD students in connection with the Millionaire Club. Springboard contends HISD's postings on the internet and community publicity gained from receiving sports ticket donations for students enrolled in the Millionaire Club constitutes commercial use because the activities were done with economic incentive to increase the appeal of HISD to students which in turn would lead to increased state funding. HISD contends that (1) Springboard's citations to articles and webpages are not relevant and should thus be disregarded; and (2) there is no evidence that HISD used Springboard's Marks with an economic incentive to promote itself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On a motion for summary judgment, a non-moving party must provide evidence that meets the admissibility standards at trial.\n   <em>\n    Bellard v.

In support of its contentions, Springboard cites (1) a Show-Me Institute article from August 26, 2011, regarding the effects of school district rankings and property tax rates in Richmond Heights, Missouri; (2) a PTO Today article from March 2, 2017, regarding a parent-teacher-association in Manhattan, New York; (3) a School Digger webpage regarding public school rankings in New York; (4) a Texas Education Agency webpage regarding state funding and school finance in Texas; (5) a CNBC article from December 14, 2010, regarding property taxes; (5) an NPR article from April 18, 2016, titled \"Why America's Schools Have a Money Problem,\" regarding a national survey on the difference between geographically rich and poor school districts; and (6) a School Compass article regarding the impact of local education on economic development (the \"Articles\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Articles do not discuss HISD or pertain to HISD's alleged infringing conduct-using Springboard's Marks with an economic incentive to attract more students to HISD and thus increase state funding to HISD. The Court therefore finds the Articles do not have a tendency to make HISD's alleged economic incentive in connection with the Millionaire Club more or less probable. Thus, the Court finds the Articles are not relevant and therefore not admissible to support Springboard's contention that HISD had an economic incentive to use Springboard's Marks.

HISD contends Springboard's complaint should be disregarded because it is not proper summary judgment evidence. The Court construes HISD's contention as an objection to Springboard's complaint as improper summary judgment evidence.
