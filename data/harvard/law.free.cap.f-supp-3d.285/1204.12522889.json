As set forth in detail in my previous Order dated December 4, 2015, I denied Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's Eighth Amendment claims for deliberate medical indifference as to individual Defendants Santini, Osagie, and Camacho. Relevant to the pending motion to dismiss, I also denied Defendants' motion as to Plaintiff's Eighth Amendment injunctive relief claims against the BOP. I granted Defendants' motion to dismiss as to Plaintiff's Rehabilitation Act claim. (ECF No. 113, Order at 12-19). My previous Order is incorporated by reference herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the pending motion, Defendant BOP asserts that because Plaintiff was transferred to another BOP facility, his claims for injunctive relief against the BOP are moot. Specifically, Plaintiff's claims arise\n   out of medical treatment he received while he was incarcerated at the U.S. Penitentiary-Administrative Maximum Security (\"ADX\") in Florence, Colorado. In recent months, Plaintiff was transferred to USP-Terre Haute, and is no longer housed at ADX. Defendant states that \"there is no indication that [Plaintiff] would return to FCC-Florence anytime in the foreseeable future.\" (Mot. at 3). With this significant change in the condition of Plaintiff's confinement, Defendant BOP asserts that no prospective relief for Plaintiff's deliberate medical indifference claims remains available, and the injunctive relief claims against Defendant BOP should be dismissed as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In response, Plaintiff argues that his claims for injunctive relief are not moot because I \"still ha[ve] the power to grant relief against Defendant BOP ... or [I] can fashion [my] own remedy to redress the continued violation of [Plaintiff's] right to adequate medical care. (Resp. at 3). Plaintiff contends that Defendant BOP's Motion to Dismiss should be denied because despite his transfer to another facility, his medical needs have not changed. \"The relief he is seeking is not institution-specific, but rather is properly characterized as constitutionally-adequate medical care\n   <em>\n    wherever\n   </em>\n   he is incarcerated by Defendant BOP.\" (Resp. at 6). Plaintiff also asserts that although he has been transferred to USP-Terre Haute, Defendant BOP continues its failure to provide adequate medical treatment for Plaintiff's Type 1 diabetes. Finally, Plaintiff argues that the doctrine of voluntary cessation applies to his injunctive claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Legal Standard for Mootness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Whether a case is moot is a threshold inquiry the Court must address before addressing the merits of the case \"because the existence of a live case or controversy is a constitutional prerequisite to the jurisdiction of the federal courts.\"\n   <em>\n    Beattie v.

I find the Tenth Circuit's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Abdulhaseeb v. Calbone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223629\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/600/1301/\">\n    600 F.3d 1301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2010) instructive on this issue. In\n   <em>\n    Abdulhaseeb\n   </em>\n   , an inmate brought claims for monetary damages and injunctive relief against Oklahoma prison officials in their official capacities for violations of the Religious Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (\"RLUIPA\"), and the Court determined the claims were not moot despite plaintiff's transfer between state prisons.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223629\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/600/1301/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223629\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/600/1301/\">\n    at 1312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Of particular importance was the fact that plaintiff\n   had sued the director of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections (\"ODOC\") and that plaintiff remained within the custody of ODOC.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223629\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/600/1301/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Tenth Circuit noted that \"even if [the plaintiff] cannot recover money damages against any defendant or injunctive relief against the prison-specific defendants, the courts may still fashion some effective relief\" because plaintiff's claims involved ODOC policies and the director of ODOC has final policymaking authority for that prison system.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223629\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/600/1301/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Tenth Circuit held that plaintiff's claims were not moot because a judgment in plaintiff's favor could effect change regarding the ODOC policies as to plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223629\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/600/1301/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Given the reasoning set forth in\n   <em>\n    Abdulhaseeb\n   </em>\n   , I find that Plaintiff's injunctive relief claims against Defendant BOP are not moot. Even though Plaintiff has been transferred out of ADX, he is still in BOP custody and under the authority of the BOP. Further, because Plaintiff sued the BOP, I find that he has sued an entity capable of altering the manner in which it provides medical care for Plaintiff's Type 1 diabetes. Thus, consistent with\n   <em>\n    Abdulhaseeb\n   </em>\n   , relief remains available because Plaintiff is still incarcerated in BOP custody, subject to BOP policies, and a judgment in his favor may require the BOP to modify those policies.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223629\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/600/1301/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Tenth Circuit made clear in\n   <em>\n    Rezaq\n   </em>\n   that a case is not moot when there is some possible remedy, \"\n   <em>\n    even ... one not requested by the plaintiff\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223629\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/600/1301/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) (emphasis added) (citing\n   <em>\n    Church of Scientology,\n   </em>\n   506 U.S. at 12-13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11924854\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/506/9/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) (\"While a court may not be able to return the parties to the\n   <em>\n    status quo ante\n   </em>\n   [,] ... a court can fashion\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   form of meaningful relief in circumstances such as these.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Based upon the foregoing, it is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   ORDERED that the Motion to Dismiss Claims Against Defendant Bureau of Prisons as Moot (ECF No. 117) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    The motion is filed only on behalf of Defendant BOP and not on behalf of the other named Defendants.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Plaintiff also filed three supplements to his response.
