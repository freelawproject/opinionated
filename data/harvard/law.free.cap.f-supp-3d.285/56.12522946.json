In that motion, Ms. Mokhtar states that she has consulted with three potential attorneys, but she did not hire any of them because she \"has never had the kind of money needed to pay the fees these lawyers are asking [for].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ms. Mokhtar also asserts that she is a \"direct-hire full-time Government employee,\" but she does not provide her salary or any other financial information.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A civil plaintiff is not guaranteed counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gaviria v.

However, federal courts are authorized by statute to \"request an attorney to represent any person unable to afford counsel.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1) (2006) ;\n   <em>\n    accord.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Willis v.

In determining whether it is appropriate to appoint counsel to a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   litigant proceeding\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   courts in this district consider the following factors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   (i) the nature and complexity of the action;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   (ii) the potential merit of the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   party's claims;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (iii) the demonstrated inability of the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   party to retain counsel by other means; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (iv) the degree to which the interests of justice will be served by appointment of counsel, including the benefit the Court may derive from the assistance of the appointed counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.D.C.

The D.C. Circuit has noted that our \"local rule differs only slightly from the\n   <em>\n    Poindexter\n   </em>\n   factors[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Willis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9457688,3727056\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/274/531/\">\n    274 F.3d at 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because Ms. Mokhtar currently is proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , the Court will construe her filings more\n   liberally than it would the formal pleadings or legal briefs drafted by lawyers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thompson v. HSBC Bank USA, N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4028448\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/850/269/#p273\">\n    850 F.Supp.2d 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 273 (D.D.C. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Here, Ms. Mokhtar's motion gives the Court no information from which to evaluate whether she is capable of affording counsel, which is the first factor under the\n   <em>\n    Poindexter\n   </em>\n   standard. For example, the motion does not provide her present salary, and it does not address whether she can afford counsel through alternative means, such as other sources of income, savings, or by entering into a contingency arrangement, as well as what other expenses she has that are preventing her from affording counsel as a full-time employee. Although \"a court should not insist that a plaintiff be destitute,\"\n   <em>\n    Poindexter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3801520,669753\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/737/1173/\">\n    737 F.2d at 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , a party seeking court-appointed counsel in a civil matter must present at least some evidence of financial need.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Because Ms. Mokhtar fails to make any demonstration regarding her financial inability to afford counsel, the Court finds it unnecessary at this time to address the remaining\n   <em>\n    Poindexter\n   </em>\n   factors. Accordingly, it is hereby\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Plaintiff's motion for appointment of counsel is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   . Ms. Mokhtar is free to submit a new motion that provides detailed information from which the Court may determine whether to appoint counsel under the\n   <em>\n    Poindexter\n   </em>\n   factors listed above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    The Court notes that Ms. Mokhtar has not moved to proceed\n    <em>\n     in forma pauperis\n    </em>\n    pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
