(\"Aim Exploration\" or \"Defendant\") alleging breach of contract and unjust enrichment. (\"Complaint,\" Dkt. No. 1; \"First Amended Complaint,\" Dkt. No. 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 25, 2017, Aim Exploration moved for a judgment on the pleadings and to dismiss Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c). (\"Motion,\" Dkt. Nos. 27, 31.) For the reasons stated below, the Motion is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The contracts at issue in the case are an 8% convertible redeemable note (\"Note,\" Dkt. No. 11, Ex. B) and a securities purchase agreement (\"SPA\"). The Note and the SPA, both dated November 6, 2014, provided for a principal amount of $45,000, a per annum interest rate of 8%, and a maturation date of November 6, 2015, and also granted Adar Bays a right to convert portions of the Note's principal and accrued interest into shares of Aim Exploration's common stock. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 11, Exs. A &amp; B.) Specifically, Adar Bays was entitled,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   at its option, at any time ... to convert all or any amount of the principal face amount of this Note then outstanding into shares of [Aim Exploration's] common stock (the \"Common Stock\") ... at a price (\"Conversion Price\") for each share of Common Stock equal to 55% of the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     lowest\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     trading\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     price\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   of the Common Stock ... for the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      fifteen\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   prior trading days including the day upon which a Notice of Conversion is received.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (Note \u00b6 4(a)(emphasis in original).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Relatedly, the Note also required Aim Exploration to reserve on account of Plaintiff 1,168,000 shares of the company's common stock for conversion under the Note. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12 (Aim Exploration \"shall issue irrevocable transfer agent instructions reserving 1,168,000 shares of its Common Stock for conversions under this Note (the 'Share Reserve').\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In case of certain \"Events of Default,\" the Note provided for a default interest rate of 24% per annum as well as various penalties. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) For example, the Note provided for a $250 and $500 daily penalty if Aim Exploration failed to deliver stock to Adar Bays pursuant to the conversion feature of the Note, and purported to increase the outstanding principal amounts due under the Note by various percentages in the event of other breaches by Aim Exploration. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 30 2015, Aim Exploration issued a partial redemption against the value of $11,250 to Adar Bays. (First Amended Complaint \u00b6 14.) In January and February 2016, Aim Exploration validly effectuated four conversions for the value of $21,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) However, on December 21, 2016, Adar Bays submitted a notice of conversion for $12,750 of the principal amount of the Note to be converted into 8,831,943 shares of Aim Exploration stock, and Aim Exploration failed to deliver the shares. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 23.) On January 3, 2017, the parties entered into an agreement whereby Aim Exploration could redeem the Note by paying $50,000 prior to 4:00 p.m. on January 6, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-19.) Aim Exploration failed to make the payment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 6, 2017, Adar Bays filed the First Amended Complaint alleging breach of the Note and SPA contracts and unjust enrichment. (Dkt. No. 11.) In its Answer, Aim Exploration asserted, among other affirmative defenses, that the Note was unenforceable because Plaintiff charged a criminally usurious rate of interest. (Dkt. No. 22 \u00b6 67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In its Motion, Aim Exploration moves for a judgment on the pleadings and to\n   dismiss Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) because: (1) the conversion discount value of 45% is interest to be included in a usury analysis and violates New York usury laws; (2) the value of the reservation of shares reserved to Adar Bays at the time of the loans is interest under New York law and violates New York usury law; (3) the default rates of interest charged at the time the loans were made violate New York usury laws; (4) usurious intent is clear from the four corners of the Note; (5) the loan is void because it is criminally usurious; and (6) no equitable relief can be granted for usurious transactions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Defendant's Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion to Dismiss (\"Def. Mem.\"), Dkt. No. 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In opposition, Adar Bays argues: (1) the discounted price to acquire stock is not interest; (2) the share reserve is not interest; (3) the post-default interest rate is irrelevant to the usury determination; (4) Aim Exploration cannot prove the intent necessary for a finding of usury; and (5) even if the court were to find provisions of the contracts usurious, the loans should be adjusted, rather than voided.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. at 10-13.) According to Aim Exploration, the Court therefore must include the 45% discount rate in its interest computations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As Adar Bays points out in its brief, this exact question-whether an option to convert stock at a discount is included in a usury calculation-has been addressed in two recent decisions by courts in this District. In a case involving a contract with provisions substantially similar to those at issue here, the Court considered a criminal usury defense involving a note with an 8% interest rate on a $75,000 loan and an option on the part of the lender to convert any or all of the borrower's common stock at 58% of the lowest trading price within thirteen days prior to receipt of the notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Union Capital LLC v. Vape Holdings Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-cv-1343,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201406278\">\n    2017 WL 1406278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2017). In response to the borrower's argument that the Court consider the 42% conversion discount in calculating the effective interest rate, the Court disagreed and concluded that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [Lender] simply held an option to convert shares, and it could have elected to obtain repayment in cash, which would clearly not have been usurious. Moreover, even if [lender] chose to convert the loan principal into shares, any potential profit [lender] might realize would still be dependent on the market price at the time of conversion and so, therefore, would be too uncertain to incorporate into an interest rate calculation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phlo Corp. v. Stevens\n   </em>\n   , 00-cv-3619 (DC),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20WL%201313387\">\n    2001 WL 1313387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 25, 2001) (\"[I]t was not clear that any effective interest rate in excess of 25% would ever have to be paid, as the value of the warrants was uncertain.\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   It could be argued that any potential profit a lender might realize from such an arrangement would not necessarily be dependent on the market price of the borrower's stock at the time of conversion because the percentage discount is always the same. Assuming full liquidity and immediate disposition, the profit realized from the purchase of stock at a fixed percentage discount at a fixed overall purchase price should generally be the same regardless of the undiscounted price of the stock. However, stock is not necessarily fully liquid and it cannot always be disposed immediately. According to Adar Bays, there are numerous circumstances under which it could realize no profit from the conversion discount. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opposition at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   For example,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   in order for Plaintiff to convert and sell the stock pursuant to the Note[ ], Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') regulations require ... that Defendant is current with its SEC filings. Therefore, if at any point, Defendant became delinquent in said filings, the conversion right became valueless until Defendant becomes current again.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Additionally, Adar Bays argues, there is no guarantee that it could realize a fixed profit by reselling the stock since it is possible that the price of the stock would decrease immediately following submission of a notice of conversion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16 (describing various circumstances under which Adar Bays could realize no value from the conversion right, including that \"Defendant could become delinquent in its filings, become delisted, experience sudden decreases in its stock price, experience no demand for its stock, or simply cancel the\n   reserve or refuse a conversion\").) In sum, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party, Adar Bays has at minimum stated a plausible claim that a right to convert loan principal into shares, even at a fixed percentage discount, is materially more uncertain than a right to receive cash and therefore should not be considered as interest in a usury calculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Similarly,\n   <em>\n    Beaufort Capital Partners LLC v. Oxysure Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   examined notes that had an equity conversion feature, which provided that at any time after the maturity date of the notes, interest and principal could be convertible into shares at the higher of (1) $.0004 or (2) the amount that is a 3 0% discount from the average closing price. No. 16-CV-5176,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20913791\">\n    2017 WL 913791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 7, 2017). In\n   <em>\n    Beaufort\n   </em>\n   , the Court held that the usury defense failed for the separate reason that the defense of usury does not apply to post-maturity interest rates. However, the Court noted that even focusing on the post-maturity interest rate, \"the usury defense would likely nonetheless fail because it relies on the debt-to-equity conversion feature of the notes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20913791\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court reasoned that \"though the initial transaction took the form of a loan, upon conversion to equity, the loans likely have the character of an equity investment, and are thus no longer vulnerable to a usury defense.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20913791\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the Court concluded that defendant's reliance on the discounted equity conversion in determining the applicable interest rate in connection with its usury defense was misplaced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20913791\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the case at hand, the Court is therefore persuaded that, drawing all inferences in favor of the non-movant, the value of the conversion discount is too uncertain to include as interest in a usury calculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Reservation of Shares\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Aim Exploration also argues that the Note is criminally usurious because it reserved 1,168,000 shares of stock at the time the loan was made. (Def. Mem. at 13.) As support, Aim Exploration cites New York General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-511, which states that \"[a]ll ... notes ... whereupon or whereby there shall be reserved or taken, or secured or agreed to be reserved or taken, any greater sum, or greater value, for the loan or forbearance of any money, goods or other things in action, than is prescribed in section 5-501, shall be void.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Gen.%20Oblig.%20Law%20%C2%A7%205-511\">\n    N.Y.

Since the share conversion feature does not render the agreement usurious, neither does the reservation of shares provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Default Rate\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Aim Exploration argues that the default provisions of the Note also render it usurious. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. at 14-16.) The terms of the Note provide for various \"Events of Default,\" including Aim Exploration's default in the payment of principal or interest on the Note, Aim Exploration's becoming insolvent, and Aim Exploration's failure to deliver to Adar Bays common stock pursuant to the conversion provision. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Note \u00b6 8.) In such \"Events of Default,\" the Note provides that Adar Bays is entitled to consider the Note immediately due and payable and \"interest shall accrue at a default interest rate of 24% per annum or, if such rate is usurious or not permitted by current law, then at the highest rate of interest permitted by law.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In addition, if Aim Exploration fails to deliver to Adar Bays the common stock pursuant to the conversion provision of the Note within three business days of its receipt of a Notice of Conversion, the Note provides for a penalty of $250 per day the shares are not issued beginning on the fourth day after the conversion notice was delivered, which increases to a penalty of $500 per day beginning on the tenth day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition, if Aim Exploration breaches other specific provisions of the Note, then the outstanding principal amounts are to increase by 20% or 50%. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, the Note states that if it is not paid at maturity, the outstanding principal due under the Note increases by 10%. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   According to Aim Exploration, the penalties in the default section of the Note are \"disguised interest\" that cause the stated default interest rate of 24% to exceed the criminal usury cap depending on the duration of the event of default. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. at 15.) In opposition, Adar Bays argues that Aim Exploration's argument is foreclosed by a long line of cases which state that usury limits do not apply to interest rates charged only after default.
