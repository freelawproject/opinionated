Code 1975 \u00a7 15-20A-1\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   On February 5, 2015, after protracted litigation, a four-day trial, and a necessary period for consideration of arguments raised in numerous post-trial briefs,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court entered final judgment, which granted Plaintiff relief on two of his claims. (Doc. # 284.) Specifically, the court entered the following judgment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   In accordance with the prior proceedings, opinions, and orders of the court, it is ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECLARED that the Alabama Sex Offender Registration and Community Notification Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2015\">\n    Ala. Code \u00a7 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -20A-1\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , is unconstitutional under the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution to the extent that it requires (1) in-town homeless registrants to register (or check-in) on a weekly basis with two separate law-enforcement jurisdictions as provided by Alabama Code \u00a7 15-20A-12(b) in conjunction with \u00a7 15-20A-4(13) and (2) all in-town registrants to complete travel permit applications with two separate law-enforcement jurisdictions as provided by Alabama Code \u00a7 15-20A-15 in conjunction with \u00a7 15-20A-4(13).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (Doc. # 284.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 18, 2015, Plaintiff filed a motion for attorney's fees and costs pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which allows prevailing civil rights plaintiffs to recover reasonable costs and fees. (Doc. # 285.) Plaintiff sought $1,919,098.00 in attorney's fees and $69,106.36 in costs. (Doc. # 345.) Defendants opposed Plaintiff's motion, arguing that Plaintiff was not entitled to any award of fees and costs because Plaintiff was not the prevailing party. (Doc. # 334.) Alternatively, Defendants contended that any award of fees and costs should be limited because Plaintiff claimed unreasonably excessive hourly rates for an unreasonably excessive number of hours worked, the majority of items for which Plaintiff sought to recover costs were unreasonable or ineligible under \u00a7 1988, and Plaintiff obtained only limited relief. (Doc. # 334.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before briefing was completed on the motion for attorney's fees and costs, Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal (Doc. # 287) on March 16, 2015, and Defendants John Richardson, Luther Strange, Derrick Cunningham,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Montgomery County Sheriff's Department cross-appealed. (Doc. # 305; Doc. # 310; Doc. # 316.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 27, 2015, the court ordered that, \"[t]o efficiently manage this case, avoid piecemeal adjudication of issues pertaining to attorney's fees and costs, and conserve judicial resources, ... justice would be best served by denying [Plaintiff's] motion for attorney's fees without prejudice and with leave to re-file the motion after the conclusion of the appeal.\" (Doc. # 350 at 2.) Accordingly, the court exercised its discretion to deny Plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees without prejudice and with leave to file a new motion for attorney's fees after the Court of Appeals entered a mandate on the pending appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 18, 2015, Alabama House Bill No. 316 was introduced. Among other revisions to ASORCNA, the bill sought to\n   remove the two double-registration requirements from which this court's February 5, 2015 Order granted Plaintiff relief. On June 11, 2015, the bill was passed into law, and it became effective on September 1, 2015. 2015 Alabama Laws Act 463 (\"H.B. 316\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Nearly three years after Plaintiff filed his notice of appeal, and over two years after the court denied Plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees and costs with leave to refile after issuance of a mandate, the appeal remains pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Motion for Reconsideration\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Before deciding the merits of Plaintiff's motion for interim fees and costs, the court must decide whether Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause to reconsider the August 27, 2015 Order prior to issuance of the mandate. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not specify the grounds available for motions for reconsideration of non-final orders, and resolution of such motions is within the court's discretion.\n   <em>\n    Region 8 Forest Serv.

Alcock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10516299\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/993/800/#p806\">\n    993 F.2d 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 806 (11th Cir. 1993) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P 54(b) (providing merely that nonfinal orders \"may be revised at any time before the entry of a judgment adjudicating all the claims and all the parties' rights and liabilities\"). To ensure efficient judicial administration, this court generally does not entertain motions for reconsideration on grounds that were raised previously or that could have been timely raised before issuance of the order from which relief is sought. However, the court may grant relief from a nonfinal order upon a showing of good cause, such as a change in circumstances justifying relief, an intervening change in the law, a clear error on the part of the court, circumstances similar to those justifying relief from final judgments under Rules 59(e) or 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or other reasons demonstrating that relief is necessary to rectify clear error, prevent injustice, or ensure the efficient disposition of the case.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pres.

Ga. 1995) (describing the standard of review on motions for reconsideration under that court's local rules).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This case presents complex and difficult issues that affect the validity of state laws regarding sex offender community notification requirements. Thus, its resolution reasonably requires more time than necessary in ordinary cases. However, when the court entered its August 27, 2015 Order directing Plaintiff to refile the motion for attorney's fees and costs after entry of the mandate, the court did not anticipate\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   that, nearly three years\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   after\n   entry of final judgment, the mandate still would be outstanding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   It is now apparent that the protracted resolution of the appeal, however necessary for that court's full consideration of the issues, creates financial hardships the court did not anticipate when it issued the August 27, 2015 Order. (Doc. # 350.) Specifically, the significant financial hardships Plaintiff's counsel faces while waiting for a resolution of the appeal are precisely the kind (1) that the fee-shifting provision of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   is intended to redress, and (2) that often justify an interim award of fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Awards of costs and fees under \u00a7 1988 exist to enable plaintiffs with meritorious claims to attract competent counsel in cases such as this one-cases that benefit the public by securing compliance with constitutional law, but that do not promise much in the way of a monetary damages award. Requiring counsel to wait years between entry of final judgment and a fee award fundamentally undermines the purpose of \u00a7 1988 by making representation in civil rights cases financially untenable and by discouraging members of the bar from undertaking similar cases in the future. However, the availability of interim fee awards can further the purposes of \u00a7 1988 by enabling civil rights attorneys to undertake representation when litigation is likely to be protracted in difficult and complex cases that require significant investment of time and resources.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hensley v.

Therefore, regardless of the outcome of Plaintiff's appeal, it is now feasible to craft an interim fee award as to the dual-registration claims on which Plaintiff has already\n   obtained relief.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527816\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/900/116/#p119\">\n    900 F.2d at 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that interim fees may be awarded \"once a plaintiff obtains substantive relief that is not defeasible by further proceedings\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As Defendants point out, because the appeal is already under submission, the interim fee award is not necessary to enable Plaintiff to continue with this litigation. However, this case presents unique circumstances. As explained in Section I.A., because of the financial strain and uncertainty caused by the unusually protracted status of the appeal, an interim fee award is needed give effect to the underlying purpose of \u00a7 1988, which is to ensure that civil rights plaintiffs\n   <em>\n    in general\n   </em>\n   can continue to obtain representation. Withholding an interim fee award would hamper Attorney McGuire's ability to take on other civil rights cases due to lack of resources.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Allowing an interim award will encourage other members of the bar to accept civil rights cases by reassuring them that the likelihood of a protracted appeal in a complicated case will not financially cripple their firms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendants correctly note that the delay at the appellate stage is not due to any party's dilatory tactics. Nevertheless, the delay exists, and in light of the prejudice caused by the delay in these unusual circumstances, Defendants' lack of bad faith conduct does not outweigh other relevant factors that strongly support imposition of an interim award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Further, the unduly protracted status of the appeal, which has already caused significant hardship, supports imposition of an interim fee award. In an attempt to promote efficient resolution of the attorney's fee dispute as a whole, the court already withheld ruling on the motion for interim fees for over nine months because the appeal had long been under submission, and it appeared likely that a mandate would issue at any moment, rendering moot the interim fee request. While it is not possible to speculate on how long the appellate delay will continue, the court finds no just reason to further delay an interim fee award on the expectation that a mandate might issue soon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff has already received the relief order by this Court, full and final. The appeal can have no effect on the relief already received, for which the interim fee will be awarded. There is thus no reason for further delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

(Doc. # 361 at 6; Doc. # 334 at 36.) In support of the attorney's fee request, Plaintiff notes that, in briefing on his previous motion for attorney's fees, Defendants contended that Plaintiff's attorneys had reasonably expended, at most, only 2,820.65 of the total 5,382.6 hours for which Plaintiff sought attorney's fees. (Doc. # 320 at 12.) Plaintiff proposes that applying a lodestar amount of $250.00\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   per hour to the allegedly uncontested 2,820.65 hours expended on the case would result in a reasonable fee of $705,162.50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In briefing on the original motion, Defendants conceded only that Plaintiff's attorneys reasonably spent a total of 2,820.65 hours on the case\n   <em>\n    as a whole\n   </em>\n   , prior to any adjustment for the fact that Plaintiff obtained relief on only a limited number of his claims, and prior to any adjustment for gross excessiveness of the fee request. (Doc. # 334 at 36.) Defendants submitted evidence to support their position that a reasonable lodestar amount would be $185 per hour for 2,441.85 hours Attorney McGuire worked on the case as a whole, and $275 per hour for 378.8 hours the EJUL attorneys worked on the case as a whole. (Doc. # 334 at 36). Defendants further argued that the amount of attorney's fees should be adjusted downward from those lodestar figures for gross excessiveness of Attorney McGuire's fee request and because of the minimal nature of the relief obtained. Specifically, Defendants contended that, with a 10% reduction for gross excessiveness and an 85% reduction for minimal relief obtained, Attorney McGuire should reasonably recover no more than $60,985.20 in attorneys' fees. Defendants also argued that an 85% reduction\n   in the EJUL attorneys' fee request would reasonably lead to a $15,625.50 fee award. (Doc. # 334 at 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    a. EJUL Attorneys\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The court will not award fees to the EJUL attorneys at this time because Plaintiff offers no explanation and cites no specific evidence as to why the $250.00 hourly fee is reasonable for any of his attorneys, because it does not appear that the EJUL attorneys participated in the interim fee motion, and because Plaintiff requests an across-the-board $250.00 hourly fee for all attorneys, which is less than the $275.00 fee Defendants have already indicated would be acceptable for the EJUL attorneys. Accordingly, before entering a fee award for the EJUL attorneys, the court would benefit from argument addressing the amount of a reasonable hourly fee for the EJUL attorneys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    b.

Further, having reviewed both party's evidence (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Exhibits to Doc. # 320, 334, and 345), the court agrees with Defendants (and Plaintiff now appears to concede (Doc. # 361 at 7) ) that a reasonable hourly fee for Mr. McGuire's work on this case would be less than the $350.00 per hour Plaintiff requested in his original motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   However, the court is not persuaded that Defendants' proposed hourly fee of $185.00 per hour is reasonably sufficient for Mr. McGuire's work. (Doc. # 334 at 36). This case involved complex and difficult legal questions, and serving as the lead attorney required a level of skill in excess of what would be normally expected of a young associate. Further, unlike firms with multiple associates and partners, a sole practitioner's firm is significantly limited in the ability to take on other clients and cases when it assumes the lead representation in a difficult and complex case. Therefore, in determining an appropriate hourly fee for Attorney McGuire, the court concludes that, in light of all relevant factors and the quality of Attorney McGuire's work, which exceeded that normally seen in an associate with similar years of experience, Defendants' proposed $185.00 hourly fee, which is based largely on fees charged by law firm associates, is unreasonably low.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Based on a review of all the evidence submitted by both parties (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Exhibits to Doc. # 320, 334, and 345), and in light of the quality of Attorney McGuire's work, the court finds that $225.00 represents a reasonable hourly rate for Attorney McGuire. Multiplying that reasonable hourly rate by the 2,441.85 hours Attorney McGuire reasonably spent on this case yields a lodestar figure of $549,416.25 for Attorney McGuire's work on the case as a whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The court also finds that additional adjustments are necessary in light of the limited nature of the relief obtained and in light of the excessive hours Attorney McGuire devoted to the case. The relief afforded by the February 5, 2015 Judgment is limited in relation to the extensive nature of Plaintiff's claims and the breadth of Plaintiff's legal challenges to ASORCNA. Further, some reasonable adjustment is appropriate in light of the excessive hours claimed by Attorney McGuire.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   This adjustment is not intended as a punishment for Attorney McGuire's\n   zealous representation or as a sanction for a grossly unreasonable fee request, but is necessary upon consideration of issues of fundamental fairness. Because Attorney McGuire devoted excessive time and resources to this case, Defendants and the court, in turn, were required to also devote more resources to the case than would otherwise be reasonable or expected.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mitigating the award in light of Attorney McGuire's excessive work on the case serves the ends of justice by effectively relieving Defendants of unreasonable excess litigation costs incurred through no fault of their own.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hensley v.

(Doc. # 361 at 7; Doc. # 334 at 34-35 (Defendants' arguments outlining their basis for opposing specific costs alleged to be unreasonable) ). Because Plaintiff does not adequately address Defendants' specific objections to the costs requested, the motion\n   for interim fees is not sufficient to allow the court to determine at this time the amount of reasonable costs. Accordingly, the court will reserve ruling on a reasonable award of costs until after the issuance of the mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Instead, when he was not living under a bridge, he moved between various hotels and family residences, depending on changing financial and family circumstances. (Doc. # 354; Doc. # 355.) The court notes that Plaintiff ceased to be homeless in late 2014 because family members took him in, but that his continued ability to reside with family was constantly at the mercy of changing family circumstances that were out of his control, such as his aging mother's health. (Doc. # 354 at 2-4; Doc. # 355.) In fact, in March 2016, Plaintiff became homeless again because his attorney discovered that the family home where he had resided since December 2014 had never been compliant with ASCORCNA due to a nearby daycare that had been in operation since before the entry of judgment.

The court finds that the hours Attorney McGuire reasonably expended on the case, standing alone, would reasonably have required the devotion of sufficient resources to impair his firm's ability to take on additional clients, particularly in light of the unusual delay in Attorney McGuire's ability to recover some portion of those resources in the form of a \u00a7 1988 award of fees and costs, the complexity of the issues, and the undesirability of the case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    In briefing on the original motion, Plaintiff requested hourly fees that varied from $350.00 per hour for Attorney McGuire's work to $393.00 per hour for the EJUL attorneys.
