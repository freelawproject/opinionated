Dkt. 6 at 4-5 (Am. Compl. \u00b6 15). Dr. Paige installed a permanent crown, which was manufactured by Global Dental Solutions LLC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9 (Am. Compl. \u00b6 48). The procedure was covered by Cigna Health and Life Insurance Company, Arora's dental insurance provider at the time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 (Am. Compl. \u00b6 12). Soon afterwards, Arora began to experience intense discomfort and pain in the area surrounding the crown.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6 (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 22-24). The crown, it turned out, was not the \"high noble metal crown\" for which Arora and Cigna paid.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, 7-8 (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 17, 36, 41). Instead, according to the invoice Global sent Buckhead Family Dentistry, Arora received a non-noble crown of lower quality.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9 (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 47-48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Arora \"demand[ed] a full refund\" of his portion of the dentist's fee (presumably, his co-payment) from Cigna so that he could have the crown replaced.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 (Am. Compl. \u00b6 39). In a letter dated July 10, 2014, Cigna described the procedure at issue as receipt of a \"high noble metal crown on tooth # 30.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (Am. Compl. \u00b6 41). In addressing Arora's complaints, Cigna stated that it \"investigate[s] and take[s] appropriate action on all quality of care concerns,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 (Am. Compl. \u00b6 40), and acknowledged its \"continuing effort to provide quality of care and service,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9 (Am. Compl. \u00b6 49). It declined, however, to refund to Arora the \"applicable patient copay[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Am. Compl. \u00b6 41). Meanwhile, Arora switched dentists and had the crown removed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Am. Compl. \u00b6 45). He eventually moved to the District of Columbia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 (Am. Compl. \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , Arora brought this diversity action against (1) Dr. Paige and Buckhead Family Dentistry (collectively, \"Buckhead\"); (2) Global Dental Solutions, LLC, and Global's President, Brad Abramson (collectively, \"Global\"); and (3) Cigna. As relevant here, the amended complaint asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and negligent misrepresentation against Cigna, as well as a conspiracy claim against Cigna, Dr. Paige, and Buckhead.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-23, 26-27 (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 115-36, 155-60).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Buckhead, Global, and Cigna each moved to dismiss, Dkt. 7; Dkt. 11; Dkt. 18; Dkt. 33, and Arora responded to all three motions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. 15; Dkt. 16; Dkt. 24. In resolving those motions, the Court first concluded that it lacked personal jurisdiction over Buckhead and Global under D.C.'s long-arm statute.\n   <em>\n    Arora\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264813\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/263/121/#p125\">\n    263 F.Supp.3d at 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But, rather than simply dismissing Arora's claims against those defendants, the Court directed that the parties address whether the case should be transferred to the Northern District of Georgia pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201631\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   given Buckhead and Global's ties to Atlanta and the fact that \"most, if not all, of the alleged events relevant to Arora's claims occurred in Atlanta.\"\n   <em>\n    Arora\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264813\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/263/121/#p125\">\n    263 F.Supp.3d at 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court further concluded that Arora had \"failed to carry his burden of showing that he ... properly effected service of process\" on Cigna.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264813\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/263/121/#p125\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264813\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/263/121/#p125\">\n    at 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   Court, as a result, did not reach the merits of Cigna's arguments that Arora's complaint failed to state a claim and, instead, gave Arora a further opportunity to effect service on Cigna.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264813\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/263/121/#p125\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264813\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/263/121/#p125\">\n    at 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Each defendant opposed transfer on the ground that Arora's claims lack merit and that transfer, therefore, would be futile.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 38 at 2-3; Dkt. 39 at 2; Dkt. 40 at 4. Arora, concerned about potential statute of limitations difficulties, requested transfer. Dkt. 41 at 6-7. He also filed a purported proof of service indicating that he had served \"Cigna's Legal Department\" and \"Cigna's Attorney o[f] Record.\" Dkt. 42 at 1. Because Cigna had previously requested that the Court consider the merits of its previously-filed motion to dismiss \"if [Arora] file[d] proof of service,\" Dkt. 40 at 3, the Court asked Cigna to clarify whether it intended to contest service and, if not, whether the Court should treat its motion to dismiss as renewed, Minute Order (Aug. 10, 2017). Cigna, in response, waived any objection to service and renewed its earlier motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Dkt. 43 at 1-2. Arora filed a supplemental opposition.

The Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws, \u00a7 145, supplies the four factors relevant to this inquiry: (1) \"the place where the injury occurred;\" (2) \"the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred;\" (3) \"the domicile, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of business of the parties;\" and (4) \"the place where the relationship is centered.\"\n   <em>\n    District of Columbia v.

Arora has not raised any objection to the application of Georgia law. The Court agrees with Cigna that the substantive law of Georgia governs this action because, by any measure, Georgia has \"the most significant relationship\" to the dispute. In addition to the considerations Cigna has identified, both Buckhead and Global are based in Atlanta, Georgia. Dkt. 6 at 3 (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11). The only conceivable basis for applying D.C. substantive law is the fact that Arora eventually moved to the District of Columbia.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7868277\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/667/811/#p816\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Am.

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 117-19). Cigna, in turn, contends that these allegations fail as a matter of law because, under Georgia law, \"[i]t is well settled that there is no fiduciary relationship between the insured and the insurer or the insurer's agent.\" Dkt. 33 at 13 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Nash v.

First, he maintains that an insurance company owes a fiduciary duty to an insured when the insured has \"retain[ed] [the] insurance company as part of an employer[-]sponsored plan governed\" by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\") and the insurer \"exercises discretion\" in administering the plan.
