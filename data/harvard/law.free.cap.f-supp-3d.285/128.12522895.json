BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In May 2017, NALC and the United States Postal Service (\"USPS\") agreed to a tentative collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\") to replace their expired agreement. First Am. Compl. \u00b6 6, Dkt. 18. Under the terms of NALC's constitution, NALC members must ratify a new CBA before it goes into effect. Accordingly, NALC held a ratification vote. NALC mailed ballots to certain members in late June 2017, with completed ballots due by July 29, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 9; Def.'s Mem. in Support of Mot. to Dismiss at 3, Dkt. 19-1. Before the ratification vote was completed, however, NALC member and retired letter carrier David W. Noble (\"Noble\"), acting\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , challenged the vote, alleging various violations of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (\"LMRDA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

For relief, Noble maintains his request that the Court \"[o]rder NALC to cancel the ratification referendum begun during the week of June 19,\" \"[o]rder NALC to permit plaintiff to use NALC's list of members' email addresses\" to oppose ratification, and issue a declaratory judgment stating that NALC violated the LMRDA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Although such claims may have presented a live controversy before the ratification vote, \"intervening events\"-namely, the ratification vote-\"make it impossible to grant [Noble] relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Lemon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3567450,6047923\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/514/1312/\">\n    514 F.3d at 1315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Therefore, it cannot grant the relief requested by Noble: the Court cannot enjoin or cancel the ratification vote months after it was held, nor can the Court permit Noble to use NALC's email list to oppose a vote that already occurred.

In Count I, Noble alleges that NALC concealed information that was material to the upcoming ratification vote, specifically the number of CCAs that USPS could employ under the proposed CBA. First Am. Compl. \u00b6 29. Similarly, Count III alleges that NALC falsely stated in May and June 2017 that the proposed CBA narrowed the compensation gap between CCAs and career letter carriers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 37. Noble has not shown, however, that these alleged actions amounted to anything more than a \"one-time event.\"\n   <em>\n    Herron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3817729\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/903/9/#p13\">\n    903 F.Supp.2d at 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   NALC only holds a ratification vote when it successfully reaches an agreement with USPS. When NALC and USPS do not reach an agreement, an arbitration board decides the CBA's terms, without a ratification vote. Renfroe Second Decl. \u00b6 2, Dkt. 19-2. Before the CBA ratification vote challenged by Noble, ten years had passed since the last NALC contract ratification vote.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3817729\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/903/9/#p13\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As a result, any future need to negotiate a new CBA, and thus any future CBA ratification vote, remains speculative at this time. And it remains unknown whether any future CBA would include the same terms as the CBA opposed by Noble, whether NALC would take the same alleged actions to conceal or misrepresent the CBA's terms, and whether the same legal issues would arise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The issue in Count II is also unlikely to recur. Noble asserts that NALC violated the LMRDA by preventing him from live-streaming the \"rap session\" in Atlantic City on June 14, 2017. First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 33-34. Noble has given no reason to expect that (i) there will be future rap sessions; (ii) he or others will seek to live-stream them; (iii) such actions will conflict with future NALC policies; (iv) NALC will act to prevent live-streaming; and (v) the same legal issue will arise. A decision on Noble's claim, then, would \"no[t] have a more-than-speculative chance of affecting [Noble's rights] in the future.\"\n   <em>\n    Aref\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4352338\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/242/#p250\">\n    833 F.3d at 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Am.

First Am. Compl \u00b6\u00b6 41-42. Again, any future CBA ratification vote remains speculative. Moreover, the NALC convention has the authority to change NALC's voting rules for future votes. Renfroe Second Decl. \u00b6 4. In the event of a future vote, it is unknown whether NALC would seek to limit retiree voting, whether NALC's voting rules would treat the voting rights of retirees in the same manner, and whether the same legal issues would arise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The issue in Count V is also unlikely to recur. Noble asserts that NALC violated the LMRDA by refusing to permit him to use NALC's email list to oppose ratification of the proposed CBA. First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 44-46. Noble has given no reason to expect, however, that NALC would take the same alleged action to prevent opponents of any future CBA from using NALC's email list.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, there is not a reasonable expectation that the same actions and issues alleged in Count V-as well as Counts I-IV-will arise again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In addition, even if those actions and issues arose again, there is not a reasonable expectation that NALC would subject the \"same complaining party\"-Noble-\"to the same action[s].\"\n   <em>\n    United Bhd. of Carpenters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5756482,3665164\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/721/678/\">\n    721 F.3d at 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As discussed above, future CBA ratification votes remain speculative. In the same way, Noble's involvement in any future CBA ratification votes remains speculative. Therefore, Noble has not shown that his claims in Counts I-V are sufficiently \"capable of repetition\" to survive dismissal for mootness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Finally, Noble is not aided by his requests for declaratory judgment. He argues that his claims are not moot because\n   the Court can provide declaratory relief. Pl.'s Opp. at 1-2. But \"[g]enerally, if a case is moot, a request for declaratory judgment will not resuscitate the lawsuit, unless an exception to the mootness doctrine applies.\"\n   <em>\n    Ctr. for Biological Diversity v.

In particular, \"[w]here an intervening event renders the underlying case moot, a declaratory judgment ... affords the plaintiff[ ] no relief whatsoever.\"\n   <em>\n    NBC-USA Hous., Inc., Twenty-Six v.

Cir. 2012). Here, the completed vote rendered Noble's claims moot, so he does not stand to gain any relief from a declaratory judgment that NALC violated the LMRDA before the vote.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3770808,6048993\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/674/869/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Tidwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267718\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/239/213/#p226\">\n    239 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   226-27 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sibley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4303022\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/916/58/#p62\">\n    916 F.Supp.2d at 62-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (challenge to votes cast by electors rendered moot after vote was held, even though plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment). Thus Noble's requests for declaratory relief do not save his claims from mootness. The Court, in sum, \"is not in the practical or constitutional position to grant the declaratory and injunctive relief requested by plaintiff[ ].\"\n   <em>\n    Newdow v.
