In Counts 1 through 3, Plaintiff alleges that the individual Defendant officers violated his federal civil rights by unlawfully entering his home, falsely arresting him, and using excessive force. In Count 4, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant City of Springfield maintained policies or customs that were deliberately indifferent to the rights of civilians by failing to train and discipline its police officers and that these policies or customs proximately caused his injuries. In Counts 5 through 8, Plaintiff asserts common law claims of assault and battery, false arrest, malicious prosecution, and abuse of process against the individual Defendant officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff has filed a motion for summary judgment on Count 1, contending that the undisputed facts confirm that two of the individual Defendant officers violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment by unlawfully entering his home. Defendants have moved for summary judgment on all eight counts of the complaint. To the extent that some counts survive their motion, Defendants have also moved for bifurcation of the sole claim against the City of Springfield, Count 4, from the counts against the individual officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on Count 1 will be denied. Defendants' motion for summary judgment will be denied as to Counts 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8, and will be allowed as to Counts 2 and 6. Defendant City's motion to bifurcate will be allowed, but on the understanding that trial on Count 4 against the City will proceed first, with the trial against the individual officers to follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The facts are drawn from the full summary judgment record.

Town of Stow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3495558\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/588/1/#p8\">\n    588 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 8-9 (1st Cir. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On the day of the precipitating incident, January 20, 2013, Plaintiff Lee Hutchins, Sr., owned a three-story, two-family home at 51-53 Daytona Street in Springfield. There were two entrances at the front of the house. The left entrance, 51 Daytona Street, belonged to Plaintiff's tenant. The right entrance was for 53 Daytona Street, where Plaintiff lived with his family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Upon passing through the doorway on the ground level, a person entering 53 Daytona Street would go up an interior flight of stairs to a landing on the second floor. That door opened directly into Plaintiff's kitchen. The street-level entrance to 53 Daytona Street provided no access to any other living unit; the interior staircase was part of Plaintiff's residence, not a common passage. In other words, when someone entered the ground floor entrance of 53 Daytona Street, he or she was facing a staircase but inside Plaintiff's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the back of 53 Daytona Street, another set of stairs connected the basement to the second-floor kitchen. A third set of stairs, also in the back, connected the second floor to the third floor. Plaintiff's son, Keith Hutchins, had a bedroom in the basement. Plaintiff's son, Lee Hutchins, lived in one of the third-floor bedrooms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   For ease of reference, Lee Hutchins, Sr., will be referred to in this memorandum as \"Plaintiff,\" and his son as \"Lee Hutchins\" or \"Lee.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Around midnight on January 20, 2013, Defendants Daniel McKay and Felix Romero, Springfield police officers, were dispatched to assist Vanessa Montero in retrieving her two-year-old son Ivan from the boy's father, Lee Hutchins. Defendants followed Vanessa's vehicle to 53 Daytona Street. They either knocked on the ground-floor door or rang the doorbell, waking up Plaintiff as well as other occupants of the residence. According to Plaintiff, his stepson, Tyshon Faust, answered the door. The officers did not recall the name of the person at the door, but Defendant McKay testified that he was \"very civil\" and \"said they'd be right down with the child.\" (McKay Dep., Dkt. No. 31-5 at 8-9.) The ground-floor front door was left open while Tyshon went upstairs to alert the household. (Romero Dep., Dkt. No. 31-4 at 4.) Tyshon did not invite the officers to enter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Tyshon went to Plaintiff's second-floor bedroom and told him the police were at the door. Meanwhile, after waiting outside for approximately ten minutes, Defendants McKay and Romero entered 53 Daytona Street through the ground-floor door, climbed the stairs to the second floor, and knocked on the interior door there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Exactly why Defendant officers entered the premises is unclear, and what their assumptions were in doing so is disputed. In his deposition, Defendant McKay stated that, during their ten-minute wait outside, the officers \"tried re-establishing contact from the base of the stairwell. When we received no response, we went to the top of the stairwell and knocked on the door there.\" (McKay Dep., Dkt. No. 31-5 at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Accepting the officers' testimony, it is possible to conclude that they mistakenly, but reasonably, believed that the interior stairwell leading from the street entry to the second floor was a common area outside Plaintiff's home. Defendant Romero stated at his deposition that when they reached the second-floor landing they \"decided to knock on the apartment door,\" (Romero Dep., Dkt. 31-4 at 5) and that the two officers remained outside the \"apartment\" through the interchange. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This testimony suggests that Defendant Romero did not believe he was entering Plaintiff's living area by going up the stairs. Similarly, Defendant McKay stated in his affidavit in opposition to Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment that a common layout of buildings like 51/53 Daytona Street included one downstairs apartment and two second-floor apartments served by a common staircase. (McKay Aff. \u00b6 6, Dkt. No. 51-1 at 2-3.) He stated explicitly that \"[a]t the time that we went up the stairs and had our conversation with the Plaintiff, we believed we were in a common area of the building, not within an individual apartment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At any rate, Defendants McKay and Romero were standing on the second-floor landing outside the interior door when Plaintiff opened it and asked, \"Can I help you?\" When told the officers were there to collect the child Ivan, Plaintiff said that he would \"be right back\" with the child. (Pl.'s Statement of Undisputed Facts, Dkt. No. 33-1 at 46-47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   What happened next is disputed. The testimony of Romero and McKay was that they never entered into the apartment area from the second-floor landing. (Romero Dep., Dkt. No. 31-4 at 5; McKay Aff. \u00b6 7, Dkt. No. 51-1 at 3.) Plaintiff's version, on the other hand, is that when Plaintiff's son Keith came up the back stairs from his basement bedroom, he found McKay and Romero standing \"at the door frame which is in the kitchen.\" (Keith Hutchins Dep.,\n   Dkt. No. 33, Ex. C at 36.) He became angry, telling them, \"You have no warrant. You got to go outside.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff himself, when he returned with Ivan, found that the two officers \"were in the kitchen and they were arguing with my son Keith.\" (Pl.'s Dep., Dkt. No. 31-9 at 16.) Confusion on this point is worse confounded by Defendants' submission, citing Plaintiff's deposition, which seems to concede that \"McKay and Romero were already in the kitchen when Plaintiff returned from the 3rd floor with Ivan.\" (Dkt. No. 31-1 at 4.) For purposes of Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on Count 1, this memorandum assumes the officers stayed on the second-floor landing outside the kitchen, per Romero's deposition and the McKay affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   When Plaintiff's son Lee woke up and learned that his son's mother, Vanessa Montero, was at the residence with two police officers to collect their son Ivan, he became upset. Defendants McKay and Romero heard Lee say he was going to \"fuck that bitch up\" before running out the back door. (McKay Dep., Dkt. No. 31-5 at 9.) Lee ran down the back stairs to confront Montero, who had been left unattended on the porch. Plaintiff's other son, Keith, then ran down the front stairs to the outside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendants McKay and Romero followed and came upon Lee and Keith engaged in a verbal confrontation with Montero. Whether this involved physical contact is disputed. (Pl.'s Response to Defs.' Statement of Undisputed Material Facts \u00b6 32-33, Dkt. No. 43 at 4-5.) Defendant Romero told Lee that if he continued, he would be placed under arrest. Defendant Romero then grabbed Lee, attempting to take him into custody, and a struggle ensued. Plaintiff emerged onto the porch at this time and tried, without success, to calm his sons down. Keith entered the fray on Lee's side in the struggle with Romero, and Lee eventually broke free and fled the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   During the ensuing fracas, Defendant McKay began striking Keith with his baton. Plaintiff approached the struggling men and, by his own admission, grabbed the end, or tip, of McKay's baton. (Pl.'s Dep., Dkt. No. 33-1 at 86.) Plaintiff contends that, in grabbing the baton, he was attempting to stop Defendant McKay from errantly striking Defendant Romero and to assist in bringing Keith under control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In response to Plaintiff grabbing the end of his baton, Defendant McKay maced Plaintiff. Plaintiff stumbled back. He was then struck twice in the back by Defendant Springfield police officers Hervieux and his partner Christopher Goodrow, who had just arrived on the scene. Plaintiff was subsequently handcuffed and transported to the police station.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In his police report, Defendant McKay described Plaintiff as engaging in disorderly conduct, committing two counts of assault and battery on a police officer, and resisting arrest. The report served as the basis for the eventual criminal charges leveled against Plaintiff. On September 10, 2014, a jury acquitted Plaintiff of all charges against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This lawsuit followed. On March 10, 2017, Plaintiff and Defendants filed their motions for summary judgment, Plaintiff as to Count 1 and Defendants as to all eight counts. (Dkt. Nos. 29 and 31.) Defendant City of Springfield also filed a Motion to Bifurcate. (Dkt. No. 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A motion for summary judgment can only be allowed if \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine\n   issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

His argument is straightforward: the officers had no legal authorization to enter his home when they stepped through the ground-floor entrance and proceeded up the staircase to the second floor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiff's motion is anchored on the well-established principle that an unauthorized intrusion by police officers into a home is \"the chief evil against which ... the Fourth Amendment is directed.\"\n   <em>\n    Payton v. New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777746\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/573/#p586\">\n    445 U.S. 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 586,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777746\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/573/#p586\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777746\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/573/#p586\">\n    63 L.Ed.2d 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980) (internal quotation omitted). It is undisputed that the street-level door marked the perimeter of Plaintiff's home. Since it is also undisputed that McKay and Romero passed through that door without a warrant or other legal justification, their action, Plaintiff argues, constituted a violation of the Fourth Amendment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   This is a powerful argument. The First Circuit has noted that an occupant's \"privacy interest in the foyer\" of a building is \"linked to the proper characterization of the building itself.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Werra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4198527\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/638/326/#p331\">\n    638 F.3d 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 331 (1st Cir. 2011) (quotation marks and citation omitted).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The text of the Fourth Amendment confirms that it forbids only \"unreasonable\" searches and seizures. Thus, in some circumstances, where an officer makes a reasonable mistake of fact, no violation of the Fourth Amendment will result.\n   <em>\n    Heien v.

Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6214176\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/177/#p186\">\n    497 U.S. 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 186,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6214176\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/177/#p186\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6214176\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/177/#p186\">\n    111 L.Ed.2d 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990) (\"Because many situations which confront officers in the course of executing their duties are more or less ambiguous, room must be allowed for some mistakes on their part. But the mistakes must be those of reasonable men [sic], acting on facts leading sensibly to their conclusions of probability.\"(internal quotation omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Resolution of whether McKay and Romero made a reasonable mistake of fact when they entered the street-level door to 53 Daytona Street-like assessments of reasonableness generally-must await development at trial and resolution by the jury, or possibly the court. A factfinder may conclude that the officers' mistake was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   reasonable, or that the officers, contrary to their testimony, entered the kitchen from the second-floor landing without authorization, an act that could not be dismissed as a mistake. These issues must await further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   It is worth pausing to note that other arguments offered by Defendants in opposition to Plaintiff's motion have little traction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The fact that the officers were not actively investigating a crime would not justify an unreasonable intrusion onto Plaintiff's property if it occurred. Such a rule would create a gaping hole in Fourth Amendment protections, and no authority supports it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Nor will the record support any argument that the officers received the level of explicit, voluntary consent to enter the premises that the Fourth Amendment requires.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

They committed no violation of the Fourth Amendment, period. On the other hand, if their mistake is found to be\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   reasonable, then their entry through the street-level door into Plaintiff's dwelling constituted a violation of clearly established Fourth Amendment law. No principle of qualified immunity will protect them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Second, the undisputed facts of record will not support an invocation of qualified immunity based on the \"community caretaking\" exception to the Fourth Amendment. This exception exempts from Fourth Amendment liability warrantless searches undertaken while engaging in functions \"totally divorced from the detection, investigation, or acquisition of evidence relating to the violation of a criminal statute.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

There, the\n   court confronted a situation where the police were responding to a call from a party concerned that a neighbor's door had been standing open for some time, and no one was home. The police arrived and announced themselves outside the home. When no one responded, they entered through the open door to see if there was some problem. Judge Selya noted that, even in this compelling situation, the law was unclear as to whether the entry was justified under the \"community caretaker\" exception. Nevertheless, he concluded that, given the \"nebulous\" boundaries of the exception, the officers had qualified immunity, as a reasonable officer would not have known, in that factual context, that he was violating a clearly established constitutional right.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4235984\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/745/8/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4235984\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/745/8/\">\n    . at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The undisputed record in this case, however, presents a factual landscape dramatically beyond the boundaries of the \"community caretaking\" doctrine, however nebulous the doctrine might be at its edges.

Another has been subject to seven such complaints, one of which was not brought before the Community Police Hearing Board (CPHB), notwithstanding stated policy to the contrary. In one instance, when one Defendant was found responsible for using inappropriate force to prevent an onlooker from documenting police brutality, the written reprimand he was supposed to receive did not appear in his file. In a previous case against Defendant City, this court denied a motion for summary judgment on this basis alone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ververis v.

(Dkt. No. 31-1 at 14.) In support of its argument, Defendant City points to the existence of \"ongoing training, discipline and investigative policies.\" (Dkt. No. 31-1 at 17.) But, as Plaintiff notes, in order to defeat a\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim, \"It is not enough that an investigative process be in place.... The investigative process must be real. It must have some teeth.\"\n   <em>\n    Douglas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20123422\">\n    2017 WL 123422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *10 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Beck v.

Although a jury may ultimately determine otherwise, the record contains evidence that, if believed, would be sufficient to demonstrate a pattern of failures to train and discipline officers whose conduct falls short of appropriate standards. Moreover, a jury could find that these lapses had a direct causal connection to the injuries suffered by Plaintiff. Put differently, a reasonable jury could, based on the facts adduced by Plaintiff, conclude that the City was deliberately indifferent to the use of unnecessary and excessive force by officers on its police force and that such indifference was the moving force that led to the deprivation of Plaintiff's constitutional rights. Given this, Defendant City's motion for summary judgment on this count must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Counts 7 and 8: Common Law Malicious Prosecution and Abuse of Process\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Plaintiff contends that the officers pursued baseless charges against him to cover up for their errors on the scene. Specifically, Plaintiff claims that Defendant McKay drafted a police report that deliberately falsified the allegations that served as the basis for a criminal complaint application against Plaintiff for disorderly conduct, assault and battery of a police officer, and resisting arrest. (Dkt. No. 1 at 5.) Defendants contend that where there was probable cause to arrest, a plaintiff cannot make a claim for malicious prosecution. As will be seen, this argument lacks force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Ordinarily, to state a cause of action for malicious prosecution, a plaintiff must allege that criminal proceedings were initiated against him without probable cause and for an improper purpose and that they were terminated in his favor.\n   <em>\n    Meehan v.

Defendant McKay's version is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   [During the skirmish involving Plaintiff's two sons and Defendant officers, Plaintiff] came out into the street yelling, grabbing at our batons and swinging at both officers, [Plaintiff] was then advised that he was under arrest, however he continued his assault toward Officers. [Plaintiff] was then sprayed using my department issued OC spray, which caused [Plaintiff] to back away from the officers struggling on the ground. At this point Officers Hervieux and Goodrow arrived to assist, and placed [Plaintiff] into handcuffs and into the rear of their marked cruiser for transport.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   (Dkt. No. 31-3.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Several points stand out. First, Defendant McKay does not mention Defendant Hervieux's use of force on Plaintiff. Second, he claims Plaintiff engaged in a \"continued\" \"assault\" against officers, whereas Plaintiff alleges that he was trying to prevent Defendant McKay from hitting his fellow officer, Defendant Romero, with the baton. Third, in general, this rendition of the incident identifies Plaintiff as an instigator of violence, whereas Plaintiff's version was that he was trying to calm his sons down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   It is impossible at this stage to know which of these dramatically different descriptions of the arrest scene will be found by the jury to be credible. Because a reasonable jury could find that Defendant McKay \"exaggerated the gravity of the situation so that the prosecutor would be more likely to press charges,\" Defendants' motion for summary judgment as to Count 7, charging malicious prosecution will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The analysis for the abuse of process claim is substantially similar. \"The elements of an abuse of process claim are that: \"(1) 'process' was used; (2) for an ulterior or illegitimate purpose; (3) resulting in damage.\"\n   <em>\n    Gutierrez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"734973\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/437/396/#p407\">\n    437 Mass. at 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=772%20N.E.2d%20552\">\n    772 N.E.2d 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation omitted).

Defendant argues that the factors of convenience, prejudice, and economy support bifurcation. The City points out that, in a joint trial, Defendant officers may suffer undue prejudice, since evidence admissible on the issues relating to the City might contaminate the jury in weighing the issues relating to the officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Plaintiff counters that bifurcation will result in even greater prejudice to him. He argues that, if the trial against the officers goes first, a verdict in his favor and an award of damages will have the practical effect of deterring him from pursuing his claim against the City, thereby allowing an\n   unconstitutional custom or policy to operate unchecked. Further, Plaintiff is concerned about being under-compensated for his injuries if damages are sought from individual officers and not the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Defendant's concern about the potential prejudice faced by individual police officers where claims against them and the City are tried jointly is reasonable. It is likely that evidence of \"prior bad acts\" by the individual officers may be relevant to the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim but excluded entirely in a separate trial against the officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   On the other hand, Plaintiff's concerns are also legitimate.

But even where a plaintiff does prevail in the first suit, and receives a full and fair measure of damages, that plaintiff has little incentive to pursue his claim against the City in a second trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Douglas Colbert,\n   <em>\n    Bifurcation in Civil Rights Cases: Undermining\n    <em>\n     Monell\n    </em>\n    in Police Brutality Cases\n   </em>\n   , 44 HASTINGS L.J. 499, 575 (1992-93) (\"Most litigants lack the resources, fortitude, and commitment necessary to proceed to a second trial on the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim.\"); Matthew J.

L.R. 583, 585 (2014) (\"The result of bifurcation is to make the task of proving municipal liability even more onerous.\") The reality is that allowance of a motion for bifurcation, where the trial against the officers proceeds first, can in effect mean that a\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim disappears irrespective of its merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The solution to all these concerns is to allow the motion to bifurcate, but proceed with trial of the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim first. Relevant evidence of prior bad acts may be weighed by the jury in the trial against the City, without risk of prejudice to Defendant officers. Of course, Plaintiff will bear the burden of proving at this trial both the existence of a custom or policy, and a causal connection between the custom or policy and his injuries. Put differently, even if Plaintiff can prove an unconstitutional custom or policy, he will not be entitled to recover unless he can prove a violation of his constitutional rights by the officers stemming from that policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Admittedly, some considerations of economy may weigh in favor of trying the claims against the individual officers first. If, for example, Plaintiff fails to prove the existence of an unconstitutional custom or police, or a causal link between that policy and his injury, then the jury will return a verdict for the City on the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim. A trial against the individual officers will thereafter be necessary, with much of the same evidence regarding the January 20, 2013, incident. This, however, is a bearable (and not inevitable) imposition, in order to permit Plaintiff to have his day in court on his\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim and to protect the important policy considerations underlying such a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment as to Count 1 is hereby DENIED. Defendants' motion for summary judgment is DENIED as to Counts 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 and is ALLOWED as to Counts 2 and 6. Defendant City's motion to bifurcate is ALLOWED, but with the understanding that the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim will go first. The clerk will set the case for a final pre-trial conference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   It is So Ordered.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Plaintiff has moved to strike Defendant City's Opposition on this point. (Dkt. No. 54). Plaintiff points out that the City is not named in Count 1 and that Defendants McKay and Romero \"are perfectly capable of defending themselves.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 2-3.) It is true that the City's counsel is, perhaps, doing the work of counsel for the individual Defendant officers, who, unlike the City, are entitled to assert a qualified immunity defense. But, the argument deserves to be addressed, regardless of who raised it.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
