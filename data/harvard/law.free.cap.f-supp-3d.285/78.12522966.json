Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The government argues that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Ms. Barnes' FTCA claim because she was approved for workers' compensation benefits under FECA, an exclusive statutory scheme that provides compensation to federal employees injured on the job. Def. Mot. 4-6, ECF No. 16-1. In other words, because the Department of Labor approved Ms. Barnes' workers' compensation claim, the government argues that the Court lacks jurisdiction over her FTCA claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. In response, Ms. Barnes argues that her workers' compensation claim should never have been approved because she was not performing official duties at the time of the incident. Pl. Opp'n, ECF No. 12; Pl. Mot., ECF No. 14. She states that she inadvertently listed the time of injury on the OWCP form as 11:30 am-the time she usually picked up the mail. In fact, Ms. Barnes was actually injured at 2:50 pm, when she was on leave.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Because the incident occurred while she was technically on leave, it follows that her claim should have been denied because she was not injured while performing official duties. Additionally, Ms. Barnes argues that the Court has jurisdiction over her FTCA claim because most of her injuries were not covered by workers' compensation; she was approved only for benefits related to her sprained neck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The government responds that any mistake made is immaterial because the Secretary of Labor, through the OWCP, determined that FECA applied and its decision is unreviewable-whether right, wrong, or incomplete. Def.
