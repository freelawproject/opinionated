Defendant argues the SAC fails to identify a Metro 2 guideline that applies to a furnisher in Defendant's distinctive position\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 65-1, pg. 18. While the alleged Metro 2 guideline does not explicitly include a furnisher who has previously sold, or otherwise transferred, the debt in question prior to the bankruptcy discharge, it does not unequivocally exclude them either. A reasonable inference can be drawn that Metro 2 guidelines do not distinguish between furnishers who still own debt, and those who have transferred or sold debt, for purposes of bankruptcy discharge notification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Defendant argues Capital One's reporting was entirely compliant with Metro 2 guidelines, particularly those that regulate reporting of sold or transferred debt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 65-1, pg. 19. In support of this argument, Defendant presented several excerpts from the Metro 2 guidelines which discuss furnisher reporting duties when accounts are transferred or sold.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc.

No. 65-1, pg. 20. However, as alleged by Plaintiff, Metro 2 does extend a duty to report a new post-bankruptcy account status by requiring \"furnishers to\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     update\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   the CII indicator status of accounts discharged in Chapter 7 Bankruptcies with an 'E' notation, i.e. 'Discharged in Bankruptcy.' \" Doc No. 54 \u00b6 134 (emphasis added).

Cal. June 6, 2016) (Plaintiff alleged \"the Metro 2 reporting format directs furnishers to report 'D' or 'no data' during the pendency of a bankruptcy rather than the charge off [Defendant] actually reported.\") (internal citations omitted) ). Defendant argues the reporting in the previous\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Nissou-Rabban\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   case occurred after the party had filed for bankruptcy, whereas in the present case, the alleged reporting concerns the pre-bankruptcy reporting of the accounts. The Court finds this distinction unpersuasive\n   and determines Plaintiff's Metro 2 violation, standing alone, can support a claim under the FCRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Defendant raises another distinction between these two cases that warrants discussion. In\n   <em>\n    Nissou-Rabban\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff alleges Capital One's original reporting of the debt as \"charged off\" instead of \"no data\" during the pendency of her bankruptcy was contrary to Metro 2 guidelines, and thus inaccurate or misleading.\n   <em>\n    Nissou-Rabban\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204508241\">\n    2016 WL 4508241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (S.D. Cal. June 6, 2016). Conversely, Defendant points out this case involves accurate pre-bankruptcy reporting that subsequently becomes inaccurate or misleading after the bankruptcy is successfully discharged. Defendant cites\n   <em>\n    Sheridan v. FIA Card Services, N.A.\n   </em>\n   , in support of its argument that, \"... reporting of historically accurate information does not later become inaccurate under the FCRA when the debts are subsequently discharged through bankruptcy.\"\n   <em>\n    Sheridan v. FIA Card Servs., N.A.\n   </em>\n   , No. C13-01179 HRL,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%20587739\">\n    2014 WL 587739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 14, 2014). This Court agrees that historically accurate information should not be deemed inaccurate for purposes of the FCRA when the debt is subsequently discharged through bankruptcy, so long as it provides the complete picture, so as not to affect future credit decisions. In granting summary judgment for the furnisher, the court in\n   <em>\n    Sheridan\n   </em>\n   held that the alleged inaccuracies were \"... unlikely to adversely affect credit decisions, particularly where the report also\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     clearly notes that the account was discharged in bankruptcy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Sheridan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%20587739\">\n    2014 WL 587739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 14, 2014) (emphasis added). In other words, unfavorable historical information, such as a history of late or overdue payments, is unlikely to adversely affect decisions by a future potential creditor when they are adequately notified that the debt was subsequently discharged in bankruptcy. Plaintiff's credit report does not clearly indicate her debt was subsequently discharged in bankruptcy. In fact, that is the sole reason for her bringing this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Therefore, a much more accurate statement would be that Plaintiff's bankruptcy did not render Defendant's previous reporting inaccurate, but rather incomplete. The Ninth Circuit has held that \"... n item on a credit report can be 'incomplete or inaccurate' within the meaning of the FCRA's furnisher investigation provision.\"\n   <em>\n    Carvalho v. Equifax Info. Servs., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079214\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/876/#p890\">\n    629 F.3d 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 890 (9th Cir. 2010) (\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gorman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5892843\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/584/1147/#p1153\">\n    584 F.3d 1147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1157 (9th Cir. 2009) ). Defendant contends that their reporting was accurate on the date it was sent to Equifax, and that is sufficient to defeat Plaintiff's claim. However, barring a FCRA claim in situations where a subsequent event makes a once accurate reporting incomplete would be contrary to the FCRA's purpose of \"protect[ing] consumers against inaccurate\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     and incomplete\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   credit reporting.\"\n   <em>\n    Nelson v.

To prove her case, Plaintiff will need to establish \"through admissible evidence that [updating the status of sold or transferred accounts discharged in bankruptcy] is in fact the industry standard, that [Capital One] deviated from it, and that this particular deviation might adversely affect credit decisions.... Whether these allegations turn out to be true is a question of proof that is not suited for resolution in a motion to dismiss.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    Nissou-Rabban\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204508241\">\n    2016 WL 4508241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (S.D.

No. 65-1, pg. 24. Specifically, Defendant contends that Plaintiff's failure to allege the contents of her May 2015 dispute letter to Equifax is fatal, arguing reasonableness of the investigation cannot be judged without an analysis of what it was based upon. In support for this contention, Defendant cites to\n   <em>\n    Gorman\n   </em>\n   , which states, \"[t]he pertinent question is... whether the furnisher's procedures were reasonable in light of what it learned about the nature of the dispute from the description in the CRA's notice of dispute.\"\n   <em>\n    Gorman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5892843\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/584/1147/#p1153\">\n    584 F.3d 1147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1157 (9th Cir. 2009). In opposition, Plaintiff argues that in an attempt to comply with this Court's previous Order [Doc. No. 52], her SAC explicitly alleges information relevant to why Defendant's investigation was not reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 77, pg. 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In her SAC, Plaintiff alleges that on or about May 15, she disputed Defendant's reported information regarding the status of the debt, by notifying Equifax in writing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 54 \u00b6 170. As Defendant noted, Plaintiff failed to plead the contents of that letter making it difficult to determine the reasonableness of Defendant's response. Equally problematic is Plaintiff's argument that Defendant's reinvestigation was unreasonable because, had Capital One adequately investigated, it would have removed the disputed account \"charge off\" notifications from her credit report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 54, \u00b6\u00b6 174-188. Plaintiff offers only conclusory allegations as support.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5892843\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/584/1147/#p1153\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Ninth Circuit has emphasized that an investigation for the purposes of the FCRA \"is not necessarily unreasonable because it results in a substantive conclusion unfavorable to the consumer, even if that conclusion turns out to be inaccurate.\"\n   <em>\n    Gorman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5892843\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/584/1147/#p1153\">\n    584 F.3d 1147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1161 (9th Cir. 2009). Therefore, as this Court held in dismissing her FAC, alleging Defendant's investigation was unreasonable solely because the investigation failed to remedy the error, is not sufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Plaintiff next alleges that Defendant maintains a company policy to not update credit reports following bankruptcy discharge in order to strong-arm individuals to pay a debt, which they no longer are legally obligated to pay, and this policy makes it fundamentally impossible for Defendant to conduct a reasonable investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. 77 pg. 18; 54 \u00b6\u00b6 85-102. According to Plaintiff, the alleged policy requires individuals to pay off legally unenforceable debt before Defendant will remove inaccurate information from their credit report.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 85-102. Plaintiff argues it would be a fundamental impossibility for Defendant to conduct a reasonable investigation when Capital One maintains a policy so inherently unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 77, pg. 19. Plaintiff's factual content to support the existence of this nefarious policy is limited. However, taking all factual allegations in her complaint as true, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Defendant would be unable to conduct a reasonable investigation with such a policy in place. Additionally, Defendant would be in the best position to engage in this factual inquisition, as Defendant would have the necessary documents-or lack thereof-regarding the existence of any company policy. Defendant's Motion to Dismiss as to the FCRA claim is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     CCRAA Claim (Count II)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Defendant argues that Plaintiff's CCRAA claims should be dismissed\n   because they are either insufficiently alleged or preempted by the FCRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 65-1, pg. 28. Plaintiff brings a claim under California Civil Code Section 1785.25(a), which provides: \"A person shall not furnish information on a specific transaction or experience to any consumer credit reporting agency if the person knows or should know the information is incomplete or inaccurate.\" The FCRA preempts state law claims \"relating to the responsibilities of persons who furnish information to consumer reporting agencies.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681t(b)(1)(F)(ii) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mestayer v.

This preemption, however, does not apply to California Civil Code \u00a7 1785.25(a).
