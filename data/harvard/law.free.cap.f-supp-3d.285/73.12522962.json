In determining whether limited discovery may be appropriate, a court typically evaluates an agency's affidavits regarding its search; where such affidavits are \"reasonably detailed\" and \"submitted in good faith,\" discovery is ordinarily denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SafeCard Servs., Inc. v.

Because an agency usually submits these affidavits in support of its summary judgment motion, courts generally do not allow discovery in FOIA actions until after the government has moved for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Based on the facts above, Mr. Cole has raised significant questions as to whether FEMA has processed documents in good faith in response to Mr. Cole's FOIA request. Indeed, the Court is troubled by multiple aspects of the government's actions at issue here. Mr. Cole submitted his FOIA request in May 2011 but did not receive\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   documents until after he filed this lawsuit almost five years later in April 2016. This is all the more concerning given that NIST had determined that it possessed 3,789 pages of responsive records by the end of June 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court is also troubled by the government's inconsistent, even contradictory, responses to Mr. Cole's inquiries regarding his FOIA request. For example, FEMA initially represented that it had located 490,000 pages of potentially responsive records in storage at NARA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. Ex. 8, ECF No. 15-13. Later, FEMA also represented that potentially responsive records may be located in regional offsite archives. Pl.'s Mot. Ex. 2, ECF No. 15-7. But in its final response, FEMA stated that no such archives existed and that it had been unable to find any additional responsive documents. Pl.'s Mot. Ex. 4, 15-9. In this correspondence, FEMA nowhere provided a clear explanation as to its changing position regarding the availability of additional records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Despite these concerns, the Court concludes that discovery is premature at this juncture. Discovery in FOIA cases is the exception, and it is generally limited to cases in which factual disputes persist-for example, where \"the adequacy of the [agency's] search remains in doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    Weisberg v. U.S. Dep't of Justice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3505425,1287775\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/627/365/\">\n    627 F.2d 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 371 (D.C. Cir. 1980). Although that may indeed be the case here, because the government has not yet moved for summary\n   judgment-and therefore has not submitted any declarations setting forth details related to its search for documents responsive to Mr. Cole's request-the Court does not have sufficient information to determine whether a genuine factual dispute exists or whether Mr. Cole requires additional facts essential to oppose the government's motion. Therefore, the Court cannot determine at this time whether discovery is warranted and, if it is, how it should be limited in scope.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Murphy v. F.B.I.,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146890\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/490/1134/#p1136\">\n    490 F.Supp. 1134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1137 (D.D.C. 1980) (\"In the instant case, the government has yet to file its affidavits. The plaintiff therefore cannot possess the prescience to predict whether a factual issue will emerge.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Once the government moves for summary judgment, Mr. Cole may renew his motion for discovery if he is able to show \"by affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, [he] cannot present facts essential to justify [his] opposition\" to the government's motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d) ;\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

The appropriate mechanism for the plaintiff to seek such relief, however, is through a Rule [56(d) ] motion filed after the government submits its renewed motion for summary judgment.\"). Moreover, if Mr. Cole believes that FEMA's declarations are insufficient to show that its search was adequate, he may oppose the government's motion for summary judgment on that ground. If the Court agrees with Mr. Cole, it may reconsider Mr. Cole's request for discovery at the summary-judgment stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leopold v. Nat'l Sec.

Feb. 20, 2015) (explaining that an argument that an agency's affidavits are deficient is often \"best presented in the context of an opposition to Defendant's motion for summary judgment or as a cross-motion for summary judgment, rather than as a basis for seeking discovery\");\n   <em>\n    North v.
