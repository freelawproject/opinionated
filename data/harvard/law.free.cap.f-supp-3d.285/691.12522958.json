First, the Plaintiff's request that the Primary Election held on\n   September 12, 2017 be \"re-run\" with the Plaintiff's name on the ballot is denied. Am. Compl. 4. The Plaintiff provides no factual support for why such action is warranted. The Plaintiff cites only \"Due Process Violations against Murawski\" and that \"[t]he signature schemes developed and implemented by the [State Board] and the [City Board] are unconstitutional.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201985\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Absent any factual and legal support for why such relief is appropriate, the City Defendants' motion to dismiss this claim is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Likewise, the Plaintiff's second claim for relief is dismissed as the Plaintiff failed to seek an order to show cause requesting the postponement of the General Election held on November 7, 2017.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201985\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Nevertheless, the Second Circuit heard the Plaintiff's petition for a writ of mandamus as to this issue, and ordered the request denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order on Pet. for Writ of Mandamus, Nov. 6, 2017, ECF No. 21.

In support of this request, the Plaintiff argues that the five percent signature requirement to be placed on the General Election ballot or the Voter Guide is \"arbitrary and capricious.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201985\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, \"the general rule [is] that a ballot access requirement of signatures from five percent of the relevant voter group ordinarily does not violate constitutional rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Prestia v.

The Plaintiff has failed to show how the present situation demands a different outcome, so this claim to relief is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Further, the Plaintiff requests the Court \"[d]eclare the 2013 election for Mayor of the City of New York as null and void because of collusion and [c]onstitutional violations.\" Am.

Am. Compl. 5. While the Plaintiff provides that this will be less distracting for voters, he does not offer legal grounds for this request. Accordingly, this request is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Plaintiff requests that the City and State Boards schedule all Primary Elections for elected positions to city, state, and federal government on the same day, so as to comply with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and to save taxpayers approximately $9 million annually.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11958297\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/410/752/#p759\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, again, the Plaintiff has not provided any legal reason or factual support for why this is so. Absent additional support bridging this wide gap, this claim is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Next, the Plaintiff seeks that the City and State Boards, within three years, develop methods that allow voters to obtain a paper receipt after voting, and to verify online that their vote was counted.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11958297\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/410/752/#p759\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Again, the Plaintiff has not proffered a cognizant legal theory on which this relief may be granted, accordingly, it is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Finally, the Plaintiff asks the Court to order the City Board to develop a method whereby a third, non-interested party verifies votes cast in any election held in New York State.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11958297\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/410/752/#p759\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This request is dismissed for the same reasons as state above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Defendants' motions to dismiss are granted, and the Plaintiff's Amended Complaint is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   It is so ordered.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    In his Amended Complaint and Affidavit, the\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    Plaintiff has submitted a lengthy set of facts covering a large timeframe; has listed the aforementioned constitutional and statutory bases on which he seeks relief; and has requested nine unique forms of relief from this Court.

Nevertheless, construing the pleadings liberally, as this Court must for\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    litigants, the Court \"interpret[s] them to raise the strongest arguments that they suggest.\"\n    <em>\n     McPherson v.
