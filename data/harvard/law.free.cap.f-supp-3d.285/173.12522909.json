BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Nearly one year after this Court dismissed the majority of the counts in his First Amended Complaint, Plaintiff Raymond Jefferson is back for another round. In his Motion for Leave to File a Second Amended Complaint, Jefferson renews his effort to clear his name of the accusations leveled against him in a 2011 investigation and report by the Department of Labor's Office of Inspector General. Defendants-the U.S. Department of Labor, the Department's Office of Inspector General, the Council of the Inspector General on Integrity and Efficiency, and five individuals-oppose this third bite at the apple. After toiling through Jefferson's prolix pleading, the Court ultimately concludes that one additional claim may proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Counts II and III, Plaintiff's Administrative Procedure Act and\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   claims, were already dismissed in this Court's prior Opinion and are re-pled here largely to preserve them for appeal. Count IV, Jefferson's new cause of action under the Appointments Clause, cannot survive, both because he lacks standing and because it is facially deficient. It is only Count I, which alleges procedural and substantive due-process violations, that the Court concludes states a plausible basis for relief. The lack of prejudice to Defendants and the liberal standard for amending complaints counsel in favor of allowing Jefferson to move forward with this augmented count. The Court will therefore grant leave to amend in this limited respect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The lengthy factual history of this case is set forth in full in this Court's prior Opinion and need not be repeated here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jefferson v.

Suffice it to say that Jefferson, a former high-level appointee in the Department of Labor, believes himself the victim of an Inspector General's defamatory campaign relating to his procurement efforts. Appointed in 2009 to serve as the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Veterans' Employment and Training Services\n   (VETS), Jefferson's central grievance revolves around a 2011 investigation and resulting Report by DOL's Office of Inspector General (DOL-OIG).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344220\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/170/194/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344220\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/170/194/\">\n    at 198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Report and an accompanying Cover Memorandum described an alleged \"pattern of conduct\" by Jefferson that \"reflect[ed] a consistent disregard of federal procurement rules and regulations, federal ethics principles, and the proper stewardship of appropriated dollars.\" ECF No. 19, Exh. B (Cover Memorandum) at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In his First Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleged that these criticisms were false, and that the investigation and Report were motivated by personal animus and riddled with factual and legal errors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 16 (First Amended Complaint), \u00b6\u00b6 29-50. According to Jefferson, the day after the Report was issued to his boss, Deputy Secretary Seth Harris, he was placed on administrative leave. Four days later, Harris informed him that he had \"four hours in which to resign or be fired,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 58, and Jefferson submitted his resignation to the Secretary of Labor that afternoon.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 61. Yet Plaintiff's alleged mistreatment did not end with his departure. Instead, the next day DOL and DOL-OIG held a joint press conference at which they publicly discussed the Report and Memorandum and thereby repeated the \"false charges, errors of fact, and mistakes of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 62. The accusations against Jefferson were subsequently reported in\n   <em>\n    The Washington Post\n   </em>\n   and other publications, and were the subject of a press conference held by Senator Claire McCaskill, then-Chair of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Contracting Oversight.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 63-65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following his resignation, Jefferson embarked upon what is now a six-year journey to find redemption. In 2014, he filed a complaint with the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) against DOL-OIG and the relevant investigators, alleging violations of \"OIG regulations, the [Inspector General Act], the APA, and [his] due process rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 78. Three months later, CIGIE's Integrity Committee informed Plaintiff that it would not be taking action on the matter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 80.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The same month that Jefferson filed his CIGIE complaint, he also filed suit in this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 (Complaint).

Defendants moved to dismiss Jefferson's Complaint in its entirety,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 19 (Motion to Dismiss), and on March 21, 2016, this Court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order granting that request as to the majority of Plaintiff's counts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jefferson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344220\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/170/194/\">\n    170 F.Supp.3d at 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, the Court dismissed Counts I, III, and IV, and allowed only Count II, which alleged a procedural due-process violation, to proceed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344220\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/170/194/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After receiving a series of extensions, Jefferson now moves for leave to file a 94-page Second Amended Complaint alleging four counts (ordered in a different fashion\n   from the First Amended Complaint). The first count has two subparts, offering both procedural and substantive due-process claims. The second reiterates the earlier\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claims, and the third again invokes the APA. The last sets out a new claim under the Appointments Clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 44-1 (Second Amended Complaint). As Defendants have opposed Plaintiff's Motion,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 52, the Court must now determine whether to grant him the requested leave to amend and, if so, on which counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A plaintiff may amend his complaint once as a matter of course within 21 days of serving it or within 21 days of the filing of a responsive pleading.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1). Otherwise, he must seek consent from the defendant or leave from the court. The latter \"should [be] freely give[n] ... when justice so requires.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). In deciding whether to grant leave to file an amended complaint, courts may consider \"undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc.\"\n   <em>\n    Foman v.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In conducting its analysis, the Court first briefly considers the reasserted APA and\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   counts, which are re-pled essentially for appellate purposes. It next looks at both the procedural and substantive due-process claims, before concluding with the new Appointments Clause count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A. APA and\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   (Counts II &amp; III)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court begins by clearing away Jefferson's APA and\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   claims, both of which were dismissed in the prior Opinion. Plaintiff maintains that he \"re-pleads claims that this Court has already dismissed in order to preserve them for appeal.\" ECF No. 41 (Motion for Leave to File) at 2-3. Yet, as Defendants point out,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 8-9 and Jefferson acknowledges in his Reply, \"he need not have re-alleged ... his dismissed claims in order to preserve them for appeal under D.C. Circuit precedent.\" Reply at 9 n.6. The Court agrees and therefore will not grant leave to amend with respect to the previously dismissed counts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BEG Investments, LLC v.

Such efforts therefore do not provide grounds for leave to amend.\n   <em>\n    Robinson v. Detroit News, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11447195\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/211/101/#p114\">\n    211 F.Supp.2d 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 114 (D.D.C. 2002) (amendment futile if it \"reasserts a claim on which the court previously ruled\"). With respect to the\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   count, the Court held that it was untimely, as Jefferson was limited by the one-year statute of limitations for defamation under D.C. law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jefferson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344220\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/170/194/\">\n    170 F.Supp.3d at 213-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court additionally concluded that, regardless of timeliness, a\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   remedy would not be cognizable because, by \"specifically exempting positions like Jefferson's from the [Civil Service Reform Act],\" Congress had deliberately chosen to omit damages remedies for claimants in Plaintiff's position.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344220\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/170/194/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344220\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/170/194/\">\n    at 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As to the APA counts, the Court found that the Report and Cover Memorandum were \"interlocutory recommendations-and not final agency action,\" and therefore could not be challenged under the APA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344220\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/170/194/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344220\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/170/194/\">\n    at 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It held, moreover, that even without such a lack of finality, Jefferson would nonetheless not prevail because DOL-OIG's publication of the two documents did not constitute \"agency action under the binding precedent of this circuit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344220\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/170/194/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 219 (citing\n   <em>\n    Hearst Radio, Inc. v.

Cir. 1948) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court similarly rejects Plaintiff's argument that by \"identifying specific regulations at issue and final agency action,\" the Second Amended Complaint \"sets forth Administrative Procedure Act claims that are consistent with\" the prior Opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 2. As with the other APA allegations in the previous Complaint, the Court denied Plaintiff's notice-and-comment claim not solely because it was supported by insufficient facts, but also because the Act's notice-and-comment requirements \"do[ ] not apply to interpretive rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice.\"\n   <em>\n    Jefferson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344220\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/170/194/\">\n    170 F.Supp.3d at 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The only \"specific regulations\" identified in Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint fall well within the ambit of such internal agency practices,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SAC, \u00b6 226, and his renewed claim is thus precluded by the Court's prior legal conclusion. Contrary to Jefferson's assertion that the Court \"invit[ed]\" him to expand upon his APA claims, the prior Opinion left no such door ajar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff's attempt to distinguish his previously asserted\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   count from those alleged in the Second Amended Complaint meets a similar fate. Although he acknowledges that the Court dismissed his\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   claims regarding actions taken while he was employed at DOL, Jefferson contends that the Second Amended Complaint includes a new\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   theory-namely, an action against Harris for a memorandum he issued after Jefferson left DOL, which Plaintiff contends \"repeated and ratified a number of the\" agency's \"false legal and factual conclusions.\" Mot. at 2;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SAC, \u00b6\u00b6 149, 196-206. Yet this distinction makes no difference when it comes to the scope of the Court's prior legal conclusions. As it already determined, the existence of a comprehensive remedial scheme under the CSRA counsels against the creation of a\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   remedy for those claims arising out of Plaintiff's employment at VETS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jefferson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344220\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/170/194/\">\n    170 F.Supp.3d at 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This rationale applies even if the alleged unconstitutional\n   defamation occurred after Plaintiff's resignation, as Harris's memorandum was nonetheless part of the broader removal proceedings. As Jefferson himself states, the memorandum was \"DOL's response to the Report,\" and he asserts that its publication was a \"final agency action\" regarding the investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC, \u00b6 148. Harris's alleged defamation subsequent to Plaintiff's resignation is entwined with Jefferson's employment at DOL, and any\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   action thus remains precluded by the CSRA's remedial scheme.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peter B. v.

This claim is based on the alleged injury Plaintiff suffered when the Integrity Commission-an entity within CIGIE composed of four IGs, the FBI official serving on the Council, the Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel, and the Director of the Office of Government Ethics,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   5 U.S.C. App. 3 \u00a7 11(d)(2)(A) -declined to pursue further review of his 2014 Complaint against DOL employees Petrole, Cunningham, Russ, and Powell. This Complaint asserted that the four individuals had \"willfully and wantonly violat[ed] OIG regulations, the IGA, the APA, and Jefferson's due process rights by failing to conduct a full and fair investigation, by knowingly issuing a legally and factually false Memorandum and Report, and by failing to notify Jefferson ... of the allegations against [him] and depriving [him] of a meaningful opportunity to be heard.\" SAC, \u00b6 166. Three months after filing the CIGIE Complaint, the Integrity Commission (IC) of CIGIE sent Plaintiff a letter stating that \"the IC determined the allegation does not meet the threshold standard necessary for further review since the allegation did not concern the actions of a currently covered OIG official who is subject to the IC's jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., \u00b6 168. The letter went on to inform Jefferson that the IC had therefore \"closed the complaint and will take no further action on the matter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   According to Jefferson, this determination was fundamentally flawed. He alleges that the decision to close his Complaint was in fact unconstitutional, as he asserts that the IGA provisions governing the composition of the IC violate the Appointments Clause.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 231-232;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const., art.

Arguing that the members of the IC are \"officers\" within the meaning of the Clause, Plaintiff contends that their method of appointment does not fulfill the constitutional requirements for such positions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although this claim is certainly creative, the Court concludes that it is also futile. As discussed below, Plaintiff does not have standing to bring his Appointments Clause count, and, even if he did, he would not prevail on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Standing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court considers first the threshold issue of whether Jefferson even has standing to advance such a count. He alleges that he was \"injured by [the] constitutionally invalid IC holding ... that it lacked jurisdiction to consider his meritorious CIGIE Complaint,\" and \"by jurisdictional rules issued in whole or in part by the IC that purportedly deprived it of jurisdiction in contravention of the IGA.\" SAC, \u00b6 233. Plaintiff further alleges that the IC ruling forced him to \"pursue an expensive federal lawsuit in order to seek review of [Petrole, Cunningham, Russ, and Powell's] abuses ... instead of CIGIE and the IC.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 172. Are these alleged injuries sufficient for standing?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Defendants argue in the negative, citing the same reasons that the Court relied on in finding he lacked standing to bring other allegations regarding the IC determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 29. The Court did previously dismiss Jefferson's APA and due-process claims against CIGIE because, as a private citizen, he lacked \"a judicially cognizable interest in the prosecution or nonprosecution of another\" and could not seek to \"compel [a] government investigation of another.\"\n   <em>\n    Jefferson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344220\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/170/194/\">\n    170 F.Supp.3d at 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because he could not \"establish an injury traceable to the challenged action-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the [IC's] decision not to investigate\"-the Court concluded that he lacked standing to pursue his CIGIE claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344220\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/170/194/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344220\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/170/194/\">\n    at 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to Defendants, this conclusion applies with equal force to Jefferson's new count against the IC under the Appointments Clause. They assert that even under the relatively broad standing approach for such challenges, Plaintiff still cannot establish a cognizable injury arising from the IC's inaction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 30-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court agrees.

Mar. 5, 2009) (\"There is ... no such thing as a due process right to an investigation by the ... Inspector General.\"). Challenges under the Appointments Clause may require a lesser degree of causation between the alleged harm and the constitutional violation, but it does not follow that\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   asserted injury is cognizable in such contexts. Because Jefferson cannot allege a legally protected interest in the IC's non-investigation, he is unable to establish standing even under the permissive standards of the Appointments Clause. The Court therefore concludes that it would be futile to permit amendment on this count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Merits\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Although the Court finds that Jefferson lacks standing, it will, out of an abundance of caution, briefly address the merits of this count. The Appointments Clause states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   [The President] shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2. The Constitution thus \"limits congressional discretion to vest power to appoint 'inferior Officers' to three sources\"-the President, the heads\n   of governmental departments, and the courts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Freytag\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107758\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/868/#p871\">\n    501 U.S. at 878\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107758\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/868/#p871\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

June 26, 2017) (denying by an equally divided court petition for\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   review to consider,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , whether to overrule\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Landry\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Here, the ICs, like the ALJs in\n   <em>\n    Landry\n   </em>\n   , are charged solely with \"review[ing] and refer[ring]\" allegations of wrongdoing, and the Committee's investigative power includes no binding or final authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 U.S.C. App. 3 \u00a7 11(d)(1),(7). As a result, the Court need not look beyond the lack of finality afforded to the IC's decisionmaking to determine that the Commission members are not inferior officers. Under the IGA, the IC is authorized only to refer allegations to executive-branch agencies or to make recommendations to the Executive Chairperson of CIGIE, the President or head of a designated Federal entity, or the congressional committee of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 U.S.C. App. 3 \u00a7 11(d)(5), (d)(8)(A-B) (2014). These referrals and recommendations have no binding or legal effect, and, as Plaintiff concedes, the final disposition of any given matter falls outside the IC's jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC, \u00b6 231 (stating that \"neither the President nor agency head are bound to execute the IC's disciplinary recommendations\"). Defendants represent, moreover, that the \"the IC's declination to conduct an investigation has [no] bearing on a final determination.\" Opp. at 33. Just as this Circuit held in\n   <em>\n    Landry\n   </em>\n   that the ALJs in that case were \"employees\" rather than officers because they lacked any \"power of final decision,\" so too are the members of the IC imbued with no such powers.\n   <em>\n    Landry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11477970,3672907\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/1125/\">\n    204 F.3d at 1134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At bottom, therefore, the authority of the IC is solely advisory. Because the Commission holds \"purely recommendatory\" authority,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11477970,3672907\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/1125/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11477970,3672907\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/1125/\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   the Court concludes that its members are not inferior officers for the purposes of the Appointments Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Court notes, moreover, that even if the IC members\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   have sufficient powers to be considered inferior officers, Plaintiff's Appointments Clause claim would nonetheless be futile. This is because each of the members of the IC appointed by the Chairperson has already been properly appointed as a government officer. Under the 2014 version of the IGA, the IC is made up of three statutorily specified appointees and four Inspectors General appointed by the Chairperson of the Council.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 U.S.C. App. 3 \u00a7 11(d)(2). These eligible IGs are defined under subsection (b)(1), which governs CIGIE membership and states that the Council consists, in relevant part, of \"all [IGs] whose offices are established under\" Section 2 or 8G of the Act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11477970,3672907\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/1125/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Those Sections in turn provide that IGs shall either be \"appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,\" or, for certain \"Federal entities,\" shall be \"appointed by the head of the designated Federal entity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11477970,3672907\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/1125/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11477970,3672907\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/1125/\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3, 8(G)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   It follows, therefore, that the IGs selected by the CIGIE chairperson to serve on the Commission have already been constitutionally appointed as government officers. That is, they have either been appointed by the President or have been selected as IGs by their respective \"Heads of Departments.\" U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2. Indeed, Plaintiff admits as much.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 23 (stating that \"a person cannot be appointed to a majority of the IC member positions\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   being an Officer of the United States\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Jefferson nonetheless asserts that the fact that the selected IGs are members of the Commission in addition to functioning as agency IGs requires them to be appointed anew. The caselaw is clear, however, that officers need not be re-appointed simply because they take on additional governmental duties. In\n   <em>\n    Weiss v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232514\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/163/\">\n    510 U.S. 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232514\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/163/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232514\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/163/\">\n    127 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994), for instance, the Supreme Court rejected the argument that commissioned officers assigned to serve as military judges must be separately appointed to such a role pursuant to the Appointments Clause. The Court held that the officers, who had been appointed by the President, could hold a military judgeship without requiring a \"second appointment\" under the Clause \"before assuming their judicial duties.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232514\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/163/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232514\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/163/\">\n    at 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232514\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/163/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the Court recognized that \"military judges must possess certain qualifications\" above and beyond those of commissioned officers, it reasoned that the \"role of military judge is 'germane' to that of military officer.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232514\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/163/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232514\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/163/\">\n    at 170-71, 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232514\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/163/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"no one could seriously contend that the positions of military lawyer or pilot, for example, are distinct\n   offices because officers performing those duties\" are specially selected or possess additional credentials). The Court therefore concluded that the Appointments Clause required no additional appointment \"before military officers may discharge the duties of [military] judge.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232514\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/163/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232514\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/163/\">\n    at 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232514\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/163/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Here, too, the role of a member of the IC is \"germane\" to that of an Inspector General. As Plaintiff himself asserts, the IG members of the IC \"carry out functions that at least mirror ... those that they carry out as Inspectors General of their own 'Federal entities.' \" Reply at 24. Contrary to Jefferson's claim that the IGs on the IC \"were not properly appointed and confirmed to serve in their roles as members of the [Committee],\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23, therefore, the selection of IGs for this related, secondary role does not require an additional appointment under the Appointments Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Court, accordingly, concludes that on both standing and the merits of his claim, Plaintiff's Appointments Clause count is futile, and amendment is thus unwarranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   As discussed above, much of Jefferson's proposed Second Amended Complaint may not proceed; indeed, Counts II and III are pled for appeal-preservation purposes only. For the sake of clarity and brevity-and so that Defendants require no perspicacity to discern what remains alive-the Court will require that Plaintiff file a new version of his Second Amended Complaint alleging only his due-process claims, and setting forth only the facts that relate to these claims. This version of the Complaint shall be limited to 35 pages and shall be filed by January 18, 2018. A contemporaneous Order so stating shall issue this day.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
