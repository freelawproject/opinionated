But that right is not absolute and is subject to various statutorily defined \"forfeiture events.\" As relevant here, an applicant who fails \"to obtain tentative approval of [its ANDA] within 30 months after the date on which the [ANDA] is filed\" forfeits its right to the 180 days of market exclusivity, \"unless th[at] failure is caused by a change in or a review of the requirements for approval of the application imposed after the date on which the application is filed.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j)(5)(D)(i)(IV).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The plaintiff in this case, Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC (\"Amneal\"), was the first manufacturer to file an ANDA to market a generic version of Namenda XR (memantine hydrochloride extended release capsules), and its ANDA challenged a patent held by the manufacturer of the brand-name version of the drug. Amneal did not, however, obtain tentative approval for its ANDA within the 30-month window. As a result, Amneal's eligibility for the 180 days of generic market exclusivity turns on whether its failure to obtain timely approval was \"caused by a change in or a review of the requirements for approval of the\" ANDA. In proceedings before the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"), Amneal argued (1) that the delay was caused by the FDA's demand for data from a commercial-scale batch of the drug and (2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   that this demand constituted a change in a requirement for approval of the ANDA. The FDA disagreed on both counts. Amneal, in response, brought the present action pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20701\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , challenging the FDA's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The case is now before the Court on Amneal's motions for summary judgment, Dkt. 25, and for a preliminary injunction or, in the alternative, a temporary restraining order, Dkt. 62, and the cross-motions for summary judgment filed by the FDA, Dkt. 34, and intervenor-defendant Lupin Pharmaceuticals (\"Lupin\"), Dkt. 30. Although Amneal raises a host of other issues, the heart of the dispute is whether the FDA's request that Amneal supplement its ANDA with data from a commercial-scale batch, as opposed to data from the pilot-scale batches that Amneal originally submitted, constituted a \"change in ... the requirements for approval of\" Amneal's ANDA-or, more precisely, whether the FDA's decision that the request did not was contrary to law or otherwise unreasonable. As explained below, the Court concludes that the FDA acted within its authority and reasonably in rejecting Amneal's claim to market exclusivity. The Court will, accordingly, deny Amneal's motion for summary judgment, Dkt. 25, and will grant the FDA's and Lupin's cross-motions for summary judgment, Dkt. 30; Dkt. 34. Moreover, having resolved the case on the merits, the Court will deny Amneal's motion for a preliminary injunction or, the alternative, a temporary restraining order, Dkt. 62, as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On June 10, 2013, Amneal submitted an ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of Namenda XR-a medication intended to treat moderate to severe dementia of the Alzheimer's type. AR 153, 160.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Namenda XR is a memantine hydrochloride capsule designed to facilitate an \"extended release\" of the drug. AR 1059. The FDA had previously approved an NDA submitted by Forest Laboratories LLC (\"Forest\") to market Namenda XR in four dosage levels: 7 mg, 14 mg, 21 mg, and 28 mg. AR 160. Amneal's ANDA included all four dosage levels; it was the first filed; and it included a paragraph IV certification for at least one of the patents listed in the Orange Book. AR 1041, 1043-44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Amneal's ANDA proposed to achieve Namenda XR's extended-release effect by\n   manufacturing capsules containing tiny \"beads\" of the active ingredient that would dissolve into the body at different rates. AR 182. Unlike the brand-name version of Namenda XR, which includes a single type of bead, Dkt. 33 at 13 &amp; n.5, each capsule of Amneal's proposed product would contain both immediate release beads (\"IRs\") and extended release beads (\"ERs\") [redacted], AR 185. Consistent with the FDA's Guidance on ANDA Submissions-Refuse-to-Receive Standards, AR 240, 252, Amneal submitted data from three \"pilot batches\" of 150,000 capsules for each of the four dosage strengths in its ANDA, AR 198-99. These pilot batches produced the capsules by combining [redacted] to create the extended release effect. AR 437. For purposes of commercial sales, however, Amneal proposed to produce much larger batches of 1,000,000 capsules and, in doing so, to blend up to six different lots of ER beads with two different lots of IR beads. AR 199, 437.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On November 5, 2013, the FDA sent Amneal a letter refusing to receive Amneal's ANDA because it was \"not sufficiently complete to merit a critical technical review.\" AR 63. Specifically, the FDA explained that Amneal had \"failed to produce accelerated stability data which encompasses at least 84 days in the accelerated stability chamber for the 30 and 500 counts for all strengths.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289151\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/910/299/#p301\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Amneal responded a month later by clarifying that the required data had, in fact, been included-it only appeared insufficient because a \"typographical error\" indicated the wrong date on which the stability testing began. AR 67. After confirming that the date in the ANDA was indeed a typographical error, the FDA rescinded its \"Refuse to Receive\" letter and treated the date of Amneal's original submission as the date of the application. AR 109. Although the record does not reflect when other generic manufacturers filed their ANDAs, there is no dispute that, using Amneal's original date of submission, Amneal qualified as the \"first applicant\" to submit an ANDA for Namenda XR containing a paragraph IV certification, making it eligible for 180 days of generic exclusivity if approved within 30 months,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , by December 10,2015. AR 1016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On September 10, 2014, the FDA sent Amneal a letter identifying a number of substantive deficiencies with Amneal's ANDA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 230-39. As relevant here, the FDA wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The proposed combination of multiple ER and IR lots for commercial production, combined with the deficiencies observed in the information submitted for the exhibit lots, requires the review of the resulting data from the manufacture of a commercial size lot before application approval. In this regard, please submit all the required [chemistry, manufacturing, and controls] information for the production of a 7 mg and 28 mg Memantine HC1 lot of the size intended for commercial distribution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   AR 233. As the FDA further explained in its chemistry review, this deficiency was based on several factors. In particular: (1) Amneal's product required a specific ratio of IR beads to ER beads in each capsule [redacted] to ensure the desired rate of release, AR 189, 222-23; (2) the pilot batches used in the ANDA involved mixing [redacted] of IR beads, while Amneal proposed to market a product produced in commercial batches made by mixing \"six different ER batches with two IR lots,\" AR 199; (3) Amneal's pilot batches had deficiencies such as overfilled capsules, AR 224; and (4) the \"in-process controls\" that Amneal proposed to use for the commercial manufacture of the drug were \"regular controls used for simpler encapsulated drugs[,] which [might] not be sufficient to ... monitor the quality of\" a product made\n   by combining \"different types of ... beads,\" AR 203. Overall, the FDA reviewers concluded that, \"[d]ue to the complexity of the proposed process, combined with the deficiencies noted in the review,\" and because \"mixing multiple lots of ER and IR beads could induce additional deviations not observed during the manufacture of the [pilot] lots that may require additional control,\" Amneal \"should submit a scale up batch before approval.\" AR 199;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR 233 (requesting that Amneal \"please submit all the required ... information for\" commercial lot sizes).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Complying with the FDA's request required considerable time and effort on Amneal's part. Amneal needed to \"acquire commercial-scale quantities of source materials, ramp up production to manufacture commercial-size lots, conduct comprehensive analytical testing on the finished product, evaluate the resulting data, and resubmit its ANDA\"-a process that took eight months to complete. AR 654. But, upon review of the additional data, the FDA noted several issues. Most problematically, Amneal's proposed IR-to-ER bead ratio \"was not followed in the newly submitted batches\" and, while \"some latitude in this ratio [was] required[,] ... the deviation ... was not justified.\" AR 460.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Amneal submitted a lengthy response to the FDA's review, which, among other things, highlighted the differences in processes used in producing the pilot-scale and commercial-scale batches. AR 437-44. As Amneal explained, \"[i]n the ANDA exhibit batches, [redacted] were used to manufacture the intermediate blend; whereas for manufacturing of future commercial scale batches, multiple batches of IR pellets and ER pellets will be used.\" AR 437. Acknowledging that combining multiple lots of IR and ER beads introduced additional \"complexity\" into the production process, which \"may result in calculation errors,\" Amneal proposed an \"additional control ... to ensure [that the] accurate dose of the drug product is administered to the patients.\" AR 444. The FDA, however, concluded that the additional control was \"not acceptable,\" and it, accordingly, \"recommend[ed]\" that Amneal \"scale down the proposed commercial batch size[ ] to a size with a constant, reproducible capsule filling weight as well as a constant bead type composition.\" AR 483. Amneal accepted the FDA's recommendation to scale down the proposed commercial-scale batches-from 1,000,000 capsules to 150,000 capsules-thus resolving the issue and clearing the way for approval of its ANDA. AR 488-89.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In the meantime, however, Amneal experienced a further delay: an \"Import Alert\" was issued on October 15, 2015, to the supplier of Amneal's active pharmaceutical ingredient (\"API\"). AR 486, 490, 527. As the FDA has explained, an Import Alert signals that an \"imported product will be detained because it appears to be in violation of the FDCA or its implementing regulations.\" Dkt. 34 at 16 n.10. In light of this development, Amneal sought approval to use a different API supplier, AR 486, 490, 527, and sought to amend its ANDA to substitute the new supplier in place of the one that was previously identified, AR 495. Amneal's troubles continued, however, and, on December 7, 2015, the FDA notified Amneal that its proposal to change its source of API was \"not acceptable\" because Amneal had yet to demonstrate bioequivalence. AR 740. Amneal provided the missing data demonstrating bioequivalence using the new source of API on February 25, 2016, but FDA chemistry reviewers raised additional deficiencies in Amneal's product, which were not addressed until August 11, 2016 and September 15, 2016. AR 1037. Finally, on September 28, 2016, the FDA tentatively approved Amneal's\n   ANDA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289151\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/910/299/#p301\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   By that time, however, the 30-month period for approval had run.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    C. FDA's Determination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On December 2, 2015, Amneal requested that the FDA \"confirm ... that Amneal's Memantine XR ANDA will remain eligible for 180-day generic marketing exclusivity regardless of whether the [a]gency grants tentative approval ... or final approval to that ANDA on or before December 10, 2015.\" AR 640. In support of that request, Amneal raised a variety of arguments, but only one is relevant for present purposes. That argument posited, as Amneal argues in this proceeding, that its failure to obtain approval within 30 months of June 10, 2013-the date that the FDA treated as the date of filing-was caused by the FDA's \"post-filing review of and change in the requirements for approval.\" AR 651. Amneal asserted that, prior to the date on which it filed its ANDA, the FDA \"long ... permitted applicants to submit ANDAs ... based on the production of, and presentation of date regarding, pilot-size test batches.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289151\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/910/299/#p301\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It was only after the ANDA was filed, Amneal argued, that the FDA changed \"the pertinent approval requirements\" and required \"that [it] scale up and complete 'the production of a 7 mg and 28 mg Memantine HC1 lot of the size intended for commercial distribution' and then 'submit all the required ... information' in order to enable FDA 'review of the resulting data from the manufacture of a commercial size lot before application approval.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289151\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/910/299/#p301\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis omitted). Finally, Amneal asserted that it was unaware \"of any other ANDA for which the [a]gency ha[d] ever required the production and analysis of ... data from a commercial-size lot as a condition of approval,\" and, indeed, despite having obtained 95 ANDA approvals, it had \"never previously been required to produce\" such data in support of an ANDA. AR 652 (emphasis omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On September 28, 2016, the same day the FDA tentatively approved Amneal's ANDA, the agency issued a 17-page letter decision concluding that Amneal had forfeited the 180-day period of exclusivity. AR 1041-57. In that letter, the FDA explained that its request that Amneal provide commercial-scale data was not a \"change\" in \"requirements for approval\" that would trigger the exception. AR 1055. The \"approval requirement\" at issue was not, according to the FDA, the submission of commercial-scale data; rather, the relevant requirement was that the applicant \"demonstrate that the methods used in, or the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, and packing of the drug are adequate to assure and preserve its identity, strength, quality, and purity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The FDA wrote: \"That statutory requirement has not changed, nor has [the] FDA's specific requirements for certain complex products like Amneal's proposed memantine hydrochloride ER capsules to meet it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289151\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/910/299/#p301\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The FDA's letter decision further explained that its request for commercial-scale data was nothing new. To the contrary, although limited in its ability to disclose proprietary information regarding other applications, AR 1055 n.43, the FDA represented that it has, \"[s]ince at least 2010,\" requested commercial-scale data for \"certain complex drug products and/or a complex manufacturing process.\" AR 1055. The decision whether that information is \"necessary,\" however, is case-specific \"and is made during the substantive review of the ANDA by the chemistry reviewers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289151\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/910/299/#p301\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"Merely having a complex process,\" the FDA continued, \"is not, by itself, typically sufficient to warrant a request for the manufacture of commercial batches pre-approval,\" but:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [I]f the applicant does not demonstrate a good understanding of its product and\n   manufacturing process and have appropriate in-process controls, [the] FDA will have concerns about the ability of the applicant to successfully produce scaled-up commercial lots of the drug product upon approval. In that situation, [the] FDA typically would request that an applicant manufacture a commercial scale batch and submit information on that batch to the Agency for review prior to approving the ANDA. If, as is the case here, the applicant then revises its proposed commercial batch size to match the size of its exhibit batches, this would address the [a]gency's concern, as the applicant would no longer be seeking to produce a scaled-up commercial batch.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289151\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/910/299/#p301\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the FDA reasoned, because neither statutory requirements nor agency policy had changed, the exception to the 30-month rule did not apply. AR 1056.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As an alternative basis for its decision, the FDA also concluded that the FDA's request for data from a commercial-scale batch, even if a change in a requirement for approval, did not\n   <em>\n    cause\n   </em>\n   Amneal to miss the 30-month mark. AR 1054-55. It premised that conclusion on two points: First, the FDA's request for commercial scale data was resolved before the forfeiture date and, therefore, could not have \"preclude[d] tentative approval or approval at that time.\" AR 1055. Second, Amneal did not \"demonstrate[ ] that the [FDA's] request\" that Amneal provide the commercial-scale data \"caused it to fail to obtain tentative approval or approval by [the relevant date].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289151\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/910/299/#p301\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Four months after receiving the FDA's adverse determination, Amneal filed this APA action, alleging that the FDA's decision was arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law. Dkt. 1. Two other pharmaceutical manufacturers with tentatively approved ANDAs for generic versions of Namenda XR-Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Lupin Limited (collectively, \"Lupin\"), and Par Pharmaceutical, Inc. (\"Par\")-moved to intervene in support of the FDA, Dkt. 20; Dkt. 52, and the Court granted those motions, Minute Order (Mar. 6, 2017); Minute Order (Nov. 8, 2017). In addition, Amneal filed a motion for summary judgment, Dkt. 25, and the FDA and Lupin responded with their own cross-motions for summary judgment, Dkt. 30; Dkt. 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   While the events described above were unfolding, another generic manufacturer, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA (\"Teva\"), filed its own ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of Namenda XR, and Teva's ANDA included a paragraph IV certification asserting that six of the associated patents were invalid or would not be infringed by its product.\n   <em>\n    Forest Labs., Inc. v.

Although the Federal Circuit's mandate has yet to issue, and a petition for rehearing is pending, a final affirmance in the\n   <em>\n    Teva\n   </em>\n   case would open the door for generic manufacturers with approved ANDAs to market their products.

Amneal does not dispute the first conclusion, but it contends that the second is flawed on multiple levels. Most significantly, Amneal disagrees with the FDA's conclusion that the agency's \"demand for commercial-scale data\" did not constitute a \"change in a requirement for approval of the application.\" Dkt. 25 at 29. It also argues that the FDA erred in failing \"even [to] consider whether the delay in receipt [of Amneal's ANDA due to the typographical error] resulted from a change in or review of approval requirements,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , and erred in failing to treat \"all of the activity regarding whether the [a]gency would receive the application\" as a \" 'change in or [a] review of ... a 'requirement[ ] for approval of the application,' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n    at 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j)(5)(D)(i)(IV) ). Finally, Amneal devotes the lion's share of its brief to arguing that the FDA erred in concluding, in the alternative, that even if either of these regulatory actions constituted a change in a requirement for approval of the ANDA, neither action \"caused\" Amneal to miss the 30-month deadline. Dkt. 25 at 23-38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As explained below, the Court holds that the FDA did not violate the plain terms of the statute or act unreasonably in deciding that neither of the regulatory steps identified by Amneal constituted \"a change in or review of [a] requirement[ ] for approval\n   of\" Amneal's ANDA. The Court, in contrast, does have significant doubts about the FDA's conclusion that the delay occasioned by its request for the commercial-scale data was not\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   cause of Amneal's failure to meet the deadline. But, even if Amneal were correct about that portion of the FDA's decision, it would not save Amneal's claim; Amneal can prevail only if it can show that the FDA erred in declining to treat one or both of the identified regulatory steps as a change in or review of a requirement for approval\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   that the FDA's causation analysis was flawed. Because Amneal fails to clear the first of these hurdles, the Court need not decide whether it has cleared the second.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Request for Commercial-Scale Data\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The principal dispute between the parties turns on whether the FDA's request that Amneal supplement its ANDA by submitting data from a commercial-scale batch constituted \"a change in ... the requirements for approval of\" Amneal's ANDA. Although one might think that it would be relatively straightforward to identify \"the requirements for approval of the application\" to market a generic version of a drug, all agree that more is required than simply flipping through the statute, regulations, and policies. To be sure, a change in the statute, regulations, or policies would generally be sufficient to trigger the proviso. But the FDA acknowledges that other steps can alter \"the requirements for approval of\" ANDAs. An ANDA applicant, for example, must demonstrate that the labeling it proposes to use is the same as the labeling for the listed drug, and, accordingly, if the label of the listed drug changes, the FDA will typically require that ANDA applicants submit new, proposed labels. Dkt. 33 at 25. FDA concedes that such a scenario represents a change in \"the requirements for approval.\" Similarly, when the FDA changes or reviews the types of study designs that it recommends to establish bioequivalence, that process may delay ANDA applicants who rely on that guidance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Again, FDA concedes that such a change would trigger the proviso.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   What all of these circumstances have in common, according to the FDA, is that the rule, guidance, or practice at issue applies generally to other similarly-situated ANDA applicants. That is, according to the FDA, \"requirements for approval\" are those steps or efforts that the \"FDA would demand from\n   <em>\n    any and all\n   </em>\n   applicants submitting an ANDA for the drug at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n    at 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The FDA does not, in contrast, construe the phrase \"requirements for approval\" to encompass occasions when the FDA requests additional data or information from a specific applicant to address a specific deficiency noted in the course of the agency's scientific review of the ANDA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Amneal, for its part, takes a broader view of what it means to change a \"requirement[ ] for approval of an ANDA. It agrees that the types of changes of general applicability identified by the FDA meet the terms of the proviso. But it would also include what it characterizes as \"changes applied to particular applications.\" Dkt. 25 at 43. Amneal concedes, as it must, that this does not mean that every request for additional data or information that emerges as part of the FDA review process constitutes a change in the relevant requirements; all agree that the review process is an iterative one \"in which there is inevitably and invariably back and forth\" requiring applicants to provide additional information. Dkt. 69 at 8 (Tr. 8:6-7). What separates this case from those garden-variety requests for additional information, according to Amneal, is that the FDA's request in this case for data from a commercial-scale batch was\n   <em>\n    different in kind\n   </em>\n   from the request for pilot-scale batch data that the FDA required at the time Amneal filed its ANDA. Dkt. 25 at 40. The FDA may not have changed \"what\" Amneal was required to demonstrate-that the production methods \"are adequate to assure and preserve [the drug's] identity, strength, quality, and purity,\" AR 1055;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(D), (j)(2)(A)(vi) -but it changed \"how\" Amneal was required to show that it satisfied that standard-by using a commercial-scale batch as opposed to pilot-scale batches. Dkt. 38 at 11; Dkt. 69 at 15 (Tr. 15:16-22),\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n    at 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tr. 26:11-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Understanding what Amneal means by this, however, requires consideration of what, if anything, actually changed from when Amneal filed its ANDA and when the FDA approved it. Amneal asserts that, before it submitted its ANDA, the FDA had \"stated [that] it [would] generally\n   <em>\n    receive\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    approve\n   </em>\n   applications containing only pilot-scale data,\" Dkt. 25 at 40 (emphasis added), and that \"[i]t is undisputed that [the] FDA's public policies required only the submission of pilot-scale data,\" Dkt. 38 at 12. In support of this contention, Amneal cites to five FDA guidance documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 25 at 17 &amp; n.2; Dkt. 38 at 12; Dkt. 68 at 32 (Tr. 32:8-9). Although each of those documents supports Amneal's contention that the FDA generally requires only pilot-batch data for purposes of\n   <em>\n    receipt\n   </em>\n   of an ANDA as \"substantially complete\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20314.101\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), none of them supports Amneal's further contention that the FDA has stated that pilot-batch data is sufficient to support\n   <em>\n    approval\n   </em>\n   of an ANDA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Court does not doubt that the type of information required for the FDA to receive an ANDA will often mirror the type of information required to approve it. But, the receipt of a \"substantially complete\" application only begins the process, which inevitably requires the submission of additional information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 69 at 8 (Tr. 8:7). As the FDA put it in its decision letter, the \"Agency's requirements in 21 C.F.R. [\u00a7] 314.101 as to whether an ANDA is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review, and thus may be received by the Agency, are distinct from the question as to whether the application meets the requirements for approval set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20314.127\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\" AR 1055 n.44. And, the approval \"requirements\" make clear that the FDA will \"refuse to\n   <em>\n    approve\n   </em>\n   an ANDA\" if \"[t]he methods used in,... and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, and packaging of the drug product are inadequate to ensure and [to] preserve its identity, strength, quality, and purity.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20314.127\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The same guidance documents that Amneal cites, moreover, inform ANDA applicants that \"[i]t is critical that all testing be conducted on samples that represent the entire batch and\n   <em>\n    mimic the product which will be marketed post-approval\n   </em>\n   .\" Guidance: Test Batches at 1 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Guidance: Stability Testing at 8 (\"The manufacturing process used for primary batches should simulate that to be applied to production batches and should provide product of the same quality and meeting the same specification as that intended for marketing\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20314.127\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20314.127\">\n    at 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defining \"pilot scale batch\" as \"[a] batch of drug product manufactured by a procedure fully representative of and simulating that to be applied to a full production scale batch\"). That admonition is apt here because Amneal proposed using a significantly different manufacturing process for \"the product which [would] be marketed post-approval\" than it used for the pilot batches that it submitted with its ANDA. Amneal's pilot batches, as explained above, were produced by combining [redacted] of IR (that is, immediate release) beads with [redacted] of ER (that is, extended release) beads, yielding 150,000 capsules. For commercial purposes, however, Amneal proposed producing batches of 1,000,000 capsules by combining up to two lots of IR beads with up to six lots of ER beads. It was this difference in production techniques that, at least in substantial part, prompted the FDA to request data from a commercial-scale batch to address concerns about the [redacted] required to achieve the desired rate of release of the drug.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Against this backdrop, Amneal's proposed reading of the statute must be clarified as follows: A change in the requirements for approval occurs when the FDA allows for the receipt of an ANDA that contains a certain type of information-here, data from pilot-scale batches-and, then, in the course of its technical review of the application, the FDA concludes that a different type of information-here, data from a commercial-scale batch-is necessary for it to approve the ANDA. To this, Amneal adds that the change here was a significant one, requiring, for example, substantially larger quantities of the active ingredient, AR 654, and that \"across a portfolio of 95 approved ANDAs, Amneal ha[d] never previously been asked to produce a commercial-scale lot as a condition of approval,\" AR 1056.

The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Although the relevant statutory terms are not defined, they are not technical or uncommon terms. A \"requirement\" is \"a condition which must be complied with,\" XIII Oxford English Dictionary 682 (2d ed. 1989), and a \"change\" is the \"substitution of one thing for another,\" III Oxford English Dictionary at 15. Understanding the meaning of those words, however, does little to resolve the parties' dispute. As noted above, all agree that not every request for additional information-even if the FDA will not approve the ANDA without that information-constitutes a \"change\" in the governing \"requirements.\" What makes this case different, in Amneal's view, is that the FDA required\n   <em>\n    one type of data\n   </em>\n   as a condition of receipt of its ANDA-data from pilot-scale batches-and, then, required\n   <em>\n    a different type of data\n   </em>\n   as a condition of approval of the ANDA-data from a commercial-scale batch. \"In other words,\" according to Amneal, \"at the time of the ANDA's submission [the] FDA [did] not require submission of commercial-scale data and only [made] that determination later in the review process. That's a change by any definition.\" Dkt. 25 at 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In support of its contention that this \"change\" falls within the plain terms of the statute, Amneal argues that the statute \"is not limited to broader ... changes\" in the statute or in FDA policy, but also includes \"changes\n   <em>\n    applied to particular applications\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43 (emphasis added). The central question under Amneal's view of the law, accordingly, is whether the applicant faced a different set of hurdles before and \"after the date on which [its] application was filed.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j)(5)(D)(i)(IV). Evidence of the statutory focus on the hurdles faced by the applicant in the context of the FDA's review of its\n   <em>\n    particular\n   </em>\n   ANDA is found, according to Amneal, in the statute's references to the requirements for approval \"of the application\" that are imposed after \"the application\" is filed. Dkt. 25 at 43-44. If the FDA were right, Amneal adds, and the focus was instead on changes in generally applicable rules and policies, the words \"of the application\" would be rendered meaningless, thus violating the canon against surplusage.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n    at 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Court, of course, agrees that statutes should be construed, where possible, to avoid surplusage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Indep.

Cir. 2000). It is unpersuaded, however, that the FDA's reading of the statute runs afoul of that canon. Under the canon against surplusage, the Court must ask whether, on the FDA's reading the statute, the phrase \"of the application\" could be dropped from that statute with no consequence. It cannot. To the contrary, under both the FDA's and\n   Amneal's proposed constructions of the statute, those words perform the same, essential function: they are the\n   <em>\n    object\n   </em>\n   of the phrase \"the requirements for approval,\" and, without them, the reader would be left to ask, \"approval of what?\" The phrase \"of the application,\" in short, is needed to complete the sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Amneal's construction of the statute, in contrast, either reads the phrase \"approval of\" out of the statute or, at a minimum, gives that phrase a strained meaning. Amneal presumes that the requirements for the FDA to receive an ANDA mirror the requirements for approval. But the FDA has explained-and Amneal has not identified any evidence to the contrary-that the two requirements, even if closely related, are distinct. AR 1055 n.44. Amneal's textual argument, however, conflates the two, and, in doing so, it sidesteps the critical question whether the data from the pilot-scale batches that it submitted with its ANDA was ever sufficient (before or after the ANDA was filed) to support\n   <em>\n    approval\n   </em>\n   of the application. Understood in this light, nothing in the statutory text supports Amneal's reading, much less unambiguously forecloses the FDA's approach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vill. of Barrington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4101900,3555108\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/636/650/\">\n    636 F.3d at 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Nor is the Court convinced that the distinction that Amneal draws between \"what\" the applicant must demonstrate and \"how\" it must do so has any bearing on the meaning of the statute. The FDA, for its part, does not dispute that either type of change may constitute a \"change in ... the requirements for approval of the ANDA. As noted above, however, the question is not whether the requirements for receipt of\" the ANDA were different from the requirements for approval of the ANDA; the question is whether the FDA changed the applicable \"requirements for approval\" after the ANDA was filed. Whether cast as a change in\n   <em>\n    what\n   </em>\n   Amneal was required to demonstrate or\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   it was required to do so, Amneal cannot prevail in the absence of evidence that the FDA changed the requirements for approval of Amneal's ANDA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Amneal also argues that its construction of the statute is necessary to achieve the statutory goal of \"granting exclusivity to an applicant whose delay was caused by change in the review requirements 'of the application.' \" Dkt. 25 at 44-45. According to Amneal, \"[i]f the FDA is correct, and a substantial change in expectations like a post-filing demand for commercial-scale data is not a change sufficient to trigger the statute, then the aims of the statute will be thwarted.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45. \"An ANDA sponsor hoping to ensure 180-day exclusivity,\" Amneal further asserts, would have significant reason under the FDA's reading of the statute to wait to submit its ANDA \"until it has fully scaled up to commercial production and obtains all of the requisite commercial-scale data.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And that, according to Amneal, would then delay generic entry into the market, contrary to the aims of the Hatch-Waxman Act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   This argument might more appropriately be raised under\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   step two, but it is, in any event, unconvincing.

The relevant question, accordingly, is not whether Amneal was surprised by the FDA's request for the data, but whether the agency's forfeiture decision was arbitrary and capricious. That question must be considered in light of the statutory standard-whether there was \"a change in ... the requirements for approval of\" Amneal's ANDA-and, for the reasons discussed above, the Court concludes that the FDA reasonably concluded that there was not. In short, Amneal was required to demonstrate that its manufacturing processes and controls were adequate to assure the \"identity, strength, quality, and purity\" of its product,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j)(4)(A), and it was required to produce testing on samples that would \"mimic the product which [would] be marketed post-approval,\" Guidance: Test Batches at 1; AR 44. The fact that the FDA noted a deficiency and requested data that it concluded-in its expert judgment-was needed to meet that standard did not cross the Rubicon of the arbitrary and capricious standard. Amneal's argument to the contrary stands on its statutory\n   argument-that the exception focuses on \"application-specific requirements,\" Dkt. 25 at 44-and fails for the same reason its statutory argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Inconsistency\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Amneal also argues that the FDA's interpretation is inconsistent with the agency's past decisions. In support of this contention, Amneal points to (1) a 2010 FDA letter decision excusing a failure by Nycomed U.S., Inc. to obtain approval within 30 months,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n    at 47-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (2) a similar decision in the case of Synthon Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 48 n.14; (3) another similar decision in the case of Sandoz, Inc.,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; and, finally, (4) FDA guidance explaining that \"changes in a [listed] drug's labeling or formulation that require ... an applicant to conduct additional testing\" may constitute a change in the requirements for approval,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n    at 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Amneal fails to identify any evidence, however, that the FDA applied a standard in any of those cases that differs from the standard the FDA proffers here: the exception to the 30-month requirement applies to changes in how all similarly-situated ANDA applicants must demonstrate that their ANDAs warrant approval, and it does not apply to requests for additional information prompted by deficiencies specific to the particular ANDAs. Dkt. 33 at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Nycomed, for example, sought to market a 5% Imiquimod Cream and failed to obtain approval within 30 months. The FDA nonetheless concluded that Nycomed qualified for the 180-day market exclusivity because the delay \"was caused by the agency's ongoing review of the requirements for approval of Imiquimod Cream, 5%.\" Letter from FDA to Nycomed, U.S., Inc. at 2 (Feb. 25, 2010).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the FDA has explained, that review involved \"the study designs recommended to establish bioequivalence with\" the listed drug. Dkt. 33 at 25 (citing Draft Guidance on Imiquimod Cream, 5% (Feb. 2010)).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, unlike the present case, \"the change in or review of the requirement[ ] for approval\" was not prompted by a deficiency noted in Nycomed's application, and it applied to all similarly-situated applicants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Synthon decision cited by Amneal is distinguishable on similar grounds. As previously discussed, an ANDA applicant is required to demonstrate that its proposed label is the same as the proposed label for the listed drug.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j)(2)(A)(v) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20314.94\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 314.94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(8)(iii), 314.127(a)(7). Thus, if the label for the listed drug is amended, ANDA applicants must submit new proposed labels for their products. Such a change delayed the approval of Synthon's ANDA, and, consistent with the FDA's reading of the statute, the agency concluded\n   that Synthon had not forfeited its eligibility to the 180 days of exclusivity:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   The agency has determined that there was a change in the requirements for approval of this ANDA. Specifically, the labeling of the [listed drug] changed after submission of the ANDA. The agency has also determined that this change was the cause of your not obtaining tentative approval of the ANDA within 30 months after the date on which it was filed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Letter from FDA to Synthon Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 2 n.1 (March 30, 2012).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The same is true for the Sandoz decision. Like the labeling requirement, changes to the formulation of the listed drug requires ANDA applicants either to seek approval for their generic version based on the new formulation or to seek a determination that the old formulation was not withdrawn for safety reasons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Guidance for Industry (Draft)-180-Day Exclusivity: Questions and Answers 23 (Jan. 2017)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   [hereinafter Draft Guidance: 180-Day Exclusivity]. In the Sandoz decision, the FDA explained that \"[w]hen a change in formulation for a listed drug referenced requires an ANDA applicant to respond[,] ... we will consider this a 'change in or review of the requirements for approval' within the meaning of [the FDCA].\" Letter from FDA to Sandoz at 9 (Sept. 20, 2011).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, this example also fails to reveal any inconsistency in administrative practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Finally, the FDA guidance that Amneal references is to the same effect. As with the preceding examples, that guidance merely affirms that changes in the listed drug's labeling or formulation require all ANDA applicants seeking to market a generic version of the listed drug to follow suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Draft Guidance: 180-Day Exclusivity at 23. For the reasons explained above, that rule is also consistent with the FDA's reading of the exception, and nothing it did with respect to Amneal's ANDA or request for exclusivity is at odds with the guidance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Accordingly, the FDA's conclusion that its request for commercial-scale data did not constitute a \"change in ... requirements for approval\" such that Amneal was exempt from the 30-month forfeiture date was both reasoned and consistent with agency precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Receipt of Amneal's ANDA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Amneal's other theory of relief requires only brief discussion. Amneal argues that the FDA's \"consideration of whether to receive Amneal's application notwithstanding a typographical error\" also constituted a \"change in or review of the requirements for approval\" of its ANDA. Dkt. 25 at 41. \"It is a hard and fast rule of administrative law, rooted in simple fairness, that issued not raised before an agency are waived and will not be considered by a court on review.\"\n   <em>\n    Nuclear Energy Inst.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3429173,9237829\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/373/1251/\">\n    373 F.3d at 1297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, because Amneal did not raise this issue before the FDA,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 638-66, it may not do so now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Moreover, even had Amneal preserved the issue, it would not advance Amneal's cause. There is no dispute that established FDA guidance counseled Amneal that ANDAs\n   must contain 84 days of accelerated stability data, nor is there any doubt that Amneal's ANDA contained a typographical error that led the FDA reviewers to conclude that the ANDA lacked the required data. AR 63. That typographical error delayed the FDA's acceptance of the ANDA. But, the error was Amneal's, and it was not the product of any \"change in or review of the requirements for approval of\" the ANDA. Indeed, the only possible basis for arguing otherwise returns to Amneal's contention that the exception to the 30-month rule applies in every case in which the ANDA sponsor faces an unanticipated hurdle after delivering its application to the FDA. As explained above, that is not the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Remaining Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Having concluded that Amneal has failed to identify a relevant change in the requirements for approval of its ANDA, the Court need not reach Amneal's further argument that the FDA misconstrued the phrase \"caused by\" and impermissibly imposed a rigid, single-factor causation test. Dkt. 25 at 23-38. The Court recognizes that the FDA's causation test is difficult to square with the statutory text, but Amneal can prevail here only by demonstrating that the FDA misconstrued or misapplied both the \"requirement\" prong and the \"caused by\" prong of the proviso. Because Amneal has not cleared the first hurdle, the second hurdle is beside the point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Finally, having concluded that Amneal's case fails on the merits and that the FDA is entitled to summary judgment, the Court need not decide whether Amneal is entitled to a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order. \"The purpose of a preliminary injunction is merely to preserve the relative positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held.\"\n   <em>\n    Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186349\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/390/#p395\">\n    451 U.S. 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 395,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186349\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/390/#p395\">\n    101 S.Ct. 1830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186349\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/390/#p395\">\n    68 L.Ed.2d 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981).
