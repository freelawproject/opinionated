Here, the complaint invokes\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   and all three of these constitutional provisions. Those claims fail for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   First, Safarini's Fourth and Fifth Amendment claims fail because they seek recovery for allegedly tortious conduct committed overseas by U.S. officials engaged in a terrorism investigation. In particular, he alleges that the Federal Defendants unlawfully seized him at the airport in Bangkok, Thailand, and then unlawfully transported him to the United States. Dkt. 1 at 4 (Compl. \u00b6 15). Safarini further alleges that he is a \"foreign national.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 (Compl. \u00b6 3). And, finally, although not recounted in the complaint, the Court can take judicial notice of the fact that Safarini was taken into U.S. custody on charges that he led a team that hijacked a Pan Am flight in Karachi, Pakistan; shot one U.S. citizen and threw his body on the tarmac; and, eventually, opened fire on the passengers, killing nineteen of them, including another U.S. citizen, and injuring over a hundred others.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Safarini\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9114457\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/257/191/#p193\">\n    257 F.Supp.2d 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 193 (D.D.C. 2003). As a result, the Court must decide whether\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   reaches claims brought under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, by non-U.S.-persons, for actions taken by U.S. law enforcement officials outside the United States, in response to the hijacking of an aircraft outside the United States. The answer to that question is \"no.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The D.C. Circuit decided a similar question in\n   <em>\n    Meshal v. Higgenbotham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357472,12309896\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/417/\">\n    804 F.3d 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. 2015). There, the Court of Appeals held that\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   does not extend to cases involving (1) national security or terrorism investigations, (2) where the relevant \"conduct that occurred outside the borders of the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357472,12309896\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/417/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357472,12309896\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/417/\">\n    at 425-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court reached that conclusion, moreover, even though the plaintiff in that action-unlike the present case-was a U.S. citizen, and even though the investigation in that case had both national security and criminal law enforcement components.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357472,12309896\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/417/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357472,12309896\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/417/\">\n    at 418, 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the terrorist attack at issue in this case occurred fifteen years before Safarini's apprehension by U.S. officials, the same considerations that were present in\n   <em>\n    Meshal\n   </em>\n   apply here as well. As the Court of Appeals wrote, \"[m]atters touching on national security and foreign policy fall within an area of executive action where courts hesitate to intrude absent congressional authorization,\" and, courts must proceed with caution when their actions \"could have diplomatic consequences.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357472,12309896\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/417/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357472,12309896\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/417/\">\n    at 426-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Safarini's claim posits that the United States connived with foreign officials to take him into custody on foreign soil; thus, his claim, even if accepted as true for purposes of evaluating its legal merit, necessarily implicates sensitive issues of national security and foreign policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   But, even putting this aside, extending\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   to Safarini's claims would involve a leap well beyond that which the Court of Appeals deemed too far in\n   <em>\n    Meshal\n   </em>\n   . Safarini is not a U.S. citizen, and, more importantly, he was not a U.S. citizen at the time he was allegedly apprehended by U.S. law enforcement officials in Thailand.

Ku Klux Klan Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Ku Klux Klan Act is a Reconstruction-Era statute that provides a damages action \"[i]f two or more persons in any State or Territory conspire ... for the purpose of depriving ... any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities of the laws.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3). Section 1985 provides a remedy only when the plaintiff can show, among other things, \"that some racial, or perhaps otherwise class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus lay behind the conspirators' action.\"\n   <em>\n    Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11925246\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/506/263/#p268\">\n    506 U.S. 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 268,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11925246\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/506/263/#p268\">\n    113 S.Ct. 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11925246\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/506/263/#p268\">\n    122 L.Ed.2d 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993) (alterations, quotation marks, and citations omitted). Here, Safarini\n   has not alleged that the Federal Defendants took any action motivated by that kind of discriminatory animus. Accordingly, this claim must also be dismissed for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Criminal Statutes and Fraud Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Safarini's last two sets of claims also fail as a matter of law. He attempts to invoke two federal criminal statutes (kidnapping,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201201\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and piracy,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201651\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), but-even if applicable-neither of those statutes includes a private right of action, and federal criminal statutes cannot be enforced through a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   action,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kittner v.

Cir. 2011). Finally, Safarini alleges the Federal Defendants violated \"representations made to the representatives of the government of Pakistan,\" and thus committed \"fraud.\" Dkt. 1 at 6 (Compl. \u00b6 16). To state a claim for common law fraud, a plaintiff must allege \"(1) the defendant made a false representation; (2) in reference to material fact; (3) with knowledge of its falsity; (4) with the intent to deceive the plaintiff; (5) the plaintiff acted in reasonable reliance on that representation; (6) which consequently resulted in provable damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Essroc Cement Corp. v. CTI/D.C., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4155268\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/740/131/#p145\">\n    740 F.Supp.2d 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 145 (D.D.C. 2010). Here, Safarini does not allege that the Federal Defendants intended to deceive\n   <em>\n    him\n   </em>\n   or that\n   <em>\n    he\n   </em>\n   acted in reliance on any representation they made. For both of these reasons-and others as well-he has failed to state a claim for common law fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Accordingly, Safarini's criminal law and common law fraud claims must also be dismissed for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the remaining claims in Safarini's complaint will be dismissed on the Court's own motion pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   A separate order will issue.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Because Safarini is proceeding\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    , \"[t]he officers of the court\" are responsible for serving \"all process.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d). Although the U.S. Marshal's Service attempted to serve the Federal Defendants, the United States has filed a Statement of Interest,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20517\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 517\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , noting that former Attorney General Ashcroft, former FBI Director Mueller, and the current or former FBI agents have not been properly served, and arguing that the case should therefore be dismissed for failure of timely service. Dkt. 9. That would seem a harsh and unjust consequence, given that Safarini is not responsible for effecting service and that the Department of Justice has (at least to the Court's knowledge) done nothing to facilitate service of former government officials. In the ordinary course, the Court would ask the plaintiff for the mailing addresses necessary to effect service, but it seems implausible-and, in any event, unwise-to suggest that incarcerated felons should know where former law enforcement officials reside. It would benefit the courts and the sound (and safe) administration of justice for the Department of Justice to consider how the courts should go about effecting service on current and former law enforcement officials without revealing their personal addresses.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    As discussed above, had Safarini brought suit against the United States, those same claims would fail for want of jurisdiction.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
