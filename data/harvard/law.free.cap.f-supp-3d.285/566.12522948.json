Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff was accused of three crimes in 2007: homicide, escape, and robbery. He was acquitted by a jury of the homicide and escape. The separate robbery charge was then dismissed. The present civil suit is based on the theory that the police lacked probable cause to bring charges and prosecute plaintiff for the robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The homicide and escape charges are unrelated to the robbery. Oct. 23, 2017 Hr'g Tr. 12:12-20. Plaintiff was accused of committing a murder on July 28, 2007,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   16:12-20, and it was alleged that while in custody for the homicide, under the supervision of Detective David Shapiro, he escaped.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   9:25-10:6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The robbery charge that forms the basis of the present civil suit is based on the following facts: on the evening of July 28, 2007, an armed man entered a retail sports store, threatened and assaulted employees, and forcibly removed $4,600 from a cash register. Plaintiff's Response to Defendants' Statement Pursuant to Local Rule 56.1 (\"56.1 Stmt.\") at \u00b6 1, ECF No. 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Shortly after the robbery, three of those present, Mohammad Sarwar, Anita Saunders and James Cadawan, viewed at the 106\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Precinct photographs matching their description of the perpetrator.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint Follow Up Report, ECF No. 67, Exh. C, Aug. 2, 2007. The witnesses did not identify anyone.\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Mr. Sarwar then provided the police with videos of the robbery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint Follow Up Report, ECF No. 67, Exh. C, July 29. They showed the perpetrator.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On August 29, 2007, Mr. Sarwar was watching the news on television; he saw a picture of plaintiff on a wanted poster related to the homicide and escape. 56.1 Stmt. at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 3. Believing that plaintiff depicted in the wanted poster was the person who robbed the store the previous month, he contacted the 106\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Precinct Detective Squad.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A day later, he met with Detective Tranchina, the detective responsible for investigating the robbery (not the homicide or escape alluded to in the wanted poster being investigated by Detective Shapiro).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4-5. Mr. Sarwar was shown a photo array at the precinct by Tranchina and again identified plaintiff as the robber.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7. The photo array contained a photograph from the wanted poster that Mr. Sarwar had seen on television the day earlier.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Two other eyewitness-victims of the robbery, Ms. Saunders and Mr. Cadawan, were present at the showing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They had seen the same wanted poster that Mr. Sarwar saw the prior day, but were uncertain about whether plaintiff, depicted in the photo, was the perpetrator of the robbery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On March 11, 2008, Mr. Sarwar, Ms. Saunders, and Mr. Cadawan viewed a lineup.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8. Mr. Sarwar identified plaintiff as the guilty person.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ms. Saunders and Mr. Cadawan did not identify plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ms. Saunders identified a different person with 80% confidence; Mr. Cadawan told the police that he did not recognize any of the people in the lineup.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On April 24, 2008, Detective Tranchina arrested plaintiff-who was already in jail on the homicide and escape charges-and signed a criminal court complaint charging him with two counts of Robbery in the First Degree.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A grand jury was convened on May 14, 2008 to determine whether there was probable cause to indict plaintiff on robbery charges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Grand Jury Hearing Transcript,\n   <em>\n    People v. DaCosta,\n   </em>\n   Ind. No. 1210-08 (May 14, 2008) (\"Grand Jury Hr'g Tr.\"). A December 12, 2017 Order unsealed the potions of these minutes recounted in the present memorandum and order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Three witnesses testified before the grand jury-Anita Saunders, Mohammad Sarwar, and Detective Tranchina.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Ms. Saunders testified to the basics facts of the robbery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She also testified that the perpetrator of the robbery pulled his \"shirt above his nose [ ], so his lower face was partially covered,\" but that he was not wearing a mask.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   7:15-23. She was not asked to inform the grand jury that in a lineup she identified a \"filler\"-not plaintiff-with 80% confidence, as the robbery perpetrator.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint Follow Up Report, ECF No. 67, Exh. C, Mar. 11, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Mr. Sarwar testified before the grand jury to his experience during the robbery. He, too, had viewed the perpetrator's face from the nose up. Grand Jury Hr'g Tr. 16:1-25. At one point, while there was a gun to Mr. Sarwar's head, the perpetrator dropped his mask revealing his entire face.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   18:13-19:12. Mr. Sarwar was focused on the perpetrator's gun, which obstructed his view of the robber's face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Mr. Sarwar testified to seeing the perpetrator in a \"video.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   20:19-21. This seemed to be a reference to the video Mr. Sarwar brought to the attention of police that showed a person he believed to be the perpetrator who had entered the store the day before the robbery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint Follow Up Report, ECF No. 67, Exh. C, July 29. About his identifications of plaintiff, Mr. Sarwar testified before the grand jury that while watching the news, he saw a picture of a person who he believed to be the robber. Grand Jury Hr'g Tr. 21:2-9. He brought this to the attention of Detective Tranchina.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   21:19-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Mr. Sarwar's final portion of testimony related to his identification of plaintiff at the lineup. He testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    [Prosecutor]\n   </strong>\n   : When you looked at that lineup did you recognize any of the people one through five or six?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    [Mr. Sarwar]\n   </strong>\n   : I pick number two. That was the number I picked.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    [Prosecutor]\n   </strong>\n   : Number two that you picked did you recognize that person?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    [Mr. Sarwar]\n   </strong>\n   : Yeah, it was.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    [Prosecutor]\n   </strong>\n   : Where was the person from?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    [Mr. Sarwar]\n   </strong>\n   :\n   <em>\n    From the picture in the-\n   </em>\n   from the robbery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    [Prosecutor]\n   </strong>\n   : Did it appear to be the same person that robbed the store?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    [Mr. Sarwar]\n   </strong>\n   : Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    [Prosecutor]\n   </strong>\n   : Did it appear to be the same person you saw in the picture on New York 1?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    [Mr. Sarwar]\n   </strong>\n   : The eyes definitely. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   22:18-23:6 (emphasis added). Note that Mr. Sarwar first said \"[f]rom the picture\" and then \"corrected\" himself to say it was from his recollection of the robbery. Mr.\n   Sarwar did not present testimony about his identification of plaintiff from the photo array.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint Follow Up Report, ECF No. 67, Exh. C, Aug. 31, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Detective Tranchina was the final witness before the grand jury. He explained that Mr. Sarwar identified plaintiff in the lineup. Grand Jury Hr'g Tr. 25:11-19. What he did not tell the grand jury was that Ms. Saunders viewed the same lineup and identified a different individual, that another eyewitness, James Cadawan, could not identify any individual, and that the picture seen on television in the wanted poster was of a suspect in the homicide and escape, not in the robbery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint Follow Up Report, ECF No. 67, Exh. C, Mar. 11, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiff was indicted on May 15, 2008 by the grand jury for one count of Robbery in the First Degree, one count of Robbery in the Second Degree, two counts of Assault in the Second Degree and one count of Criminal Possession of a Weapon (in the robbery) in the Fourth Degree. 56.1 Stmt. at \u00b6 13. On September 3, 2008, a criminal court judge determined that the indictment was not defective.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   After spending several years in jail on the robbery, homicide, and escape charges, plaintiff was tried and acquitted of the homicide and escape. Am. Compl. \u00b6 22, ECF No. 20. That same day he was released from jail on his own recognizance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23. A month later, on September 6, 2012, the robbery charges were dismissed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   A memorandum written by the Queens County District Attorney's Office dated July 31, 2012, explained that the robbery charges were dropped because the videotape of the incident-available to the police before the grand jury was convened-showed a person other than the plaintiff to be the robber:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   There is video surveillance of the robbery from which still photos of the perpetrator were developed. The perpetrator does not appear to be the defendant based upon a comparison to his arrest photo of 4-24-06. I also recently tried defendant's murder case and observed him extensively. He does NOT appear to be the same person in the video surveillance or still photos.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Exhibit A at 4 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Detective Tranchina was the lead detective on the robbery case, which forms the basis of the instant civil lawsuit. Plaintiff and his counsel were under the mistaken notion that Detective Shapiro, the officer who was involved in the murder investigation, and from whose custody plaintiff allegedly escaped, was in charge of the robbery investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Original Compl., ECF No. 1. Plaintiff filed suit on this assumption, and named as individual defendants only Detective Shapiro along with twenty John and Jane Doe officers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Plaintiff believed that Detective Shapiro had orchestrated his arrest for the robbery as payback for his alleged escape. Oct. 23, 2017 Hr'g. Tr. 9:16-10:13. In discovery, plaintiff found no evidence that this theory was true, but learned of the involvement of Detective Tranchina only in the robbery prosecution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Summary of Challenged Opinions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In two separate opinions, this court stated the conclusions now challenged by the present defendant. In the first opinion, dated November 8, 2017: (1) plaintiff was granted leave to amend his complaint to name Detective Tranchina rather than Detective Shapiro as defendant, and (2) the amended pleading was held to relate back to the filing of the original complaint, defeating the statute of limitations defense. Noted was the defendant's dilatory tactics and lack of burden on the new defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The relation back holding was based on three independent legal conclusions: first, the Corporation Counsel, a New York City government entity, had an ethical obligation to inform plaintiff that he had sued the wrong officer. Had the Corporation Counsel fulfilled this obligation, the statute of limitations would not have been in issue. Second, under New York State's CPLR 203, applicable through Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c)(1)(A), the amended pleading related back. Third, the amended pleading related back under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c)(1)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The second opinion, issued on December 12, 2017, addressed substantive claims. Defendant moved for summary judgment on plaintiff's malicious prosecution claim arguing primarily that (1) there was probable cause to initiate the prosecution against plaintiff, and (2) plaintiff could not overcome the presumption of probable cause created by a grand jury indictment. The court rejected both of these arguments. The sole evidence linking plaintiff to the robbery was one eyewitness identification. The eyewitness identification was of dubious value because (1) the identification had substantial indicia of unreliability, (2) the two other eyewitnesses of the crime failed to identify plaintiff as the robber, (3) the eyewitness was shown a suggestive photo array, and (4) the detective did not consult a video from the store, which would have demonstrated that a person other than plaintiff was the robber. The grand jury was not informed of the poor nature of the identification or of the videotape evidence. A civil petty jury could conclude that Detective Tranchina colluded to mislead the grand jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Standard of Review on Motions for Reconsideration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \"[R]econsideration will generally be denied unless the moving party can point to controlling decisions or data that the court overlooked-matters, in other words, that might reasonably be expected to alter the conclusion reached by the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Shrader v.

Relation Back\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Defendant makes two arguments supporting his motion for reconsideration of the relation back order. He first contends that the Corporation Counsel could not have alerted plaintiff or Detective Tranchina about the fact that the wrong detective was named because plaintiff's criminal case file was sealed by operation of law, and plaintiff delayed signing a release to unseal the file. Defendant also argues that plaintiff did not make a \"mistake\" in failing to name Detective Tranchina in the original complaint because plaintiff's criminal defense lawyer was aware that Detective Tranchina was involved in the robbery case in April 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   These two points that defendant claims the court overlooked are not specifically tethered to the three independent holdings on relations back. Purported new facts do not alter the court's conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    A. New York CPLR 203\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Defendant argues that plaintiff \"was made aware of [the proper defendant's] identity, while the criminal [robbery] case was pending.\" Def.'s Mem. in Support of Mot. for Reconsideration (\"Mot. for Reconsideration\") at 11, ECF No. 87, Ex. 9. He argues that \"either [plaintiff], or his attorneys, or both, purposely chose not to name him as a defendant\" in the original complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   This court \"conclude[d] that the New York Court of Appeals ... would hold that the diligence of the plaintiff is not an aspect\n   of the 'mistake' prong [of CPLR 203 ], and suing 'John Doe' when a defendant's identity is unknown is a mistake for purposes of the relation back doctrine of CPLR 203.\" Nov. 8, 2017 Order at 27-28. Even if Detective Tranchina should not have been substituted for Detective Shapiro, as defendant seemed to suggest, CPLR 203 would still be applicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Under the law of the case, if plaintiff deliberately omitted Detective Tranchina, the proper defendant, to gain a tactical advantage, a relation back would not have been granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Buran v.

Why would the Corporation Counsel seek to quash a subpoena issued for the deposition of Detective Tranchina when it knew that he was the proper defendant? Even if these actions took place after the statute of limitations expired, the conduct is troubling. Had civility ruled the litigation, this litigation would likely have ended some time ago. The Corporation Counsel's hardball tactics may end up costing the residents of New York more money because plaintiff's counsel has been forced to litigate what would otherwise be unnecessary motions in a case with the potential for fee shifting.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martinez v.

That provision was added in 1966 to respond to a recurring problem in suits against the Federal Government, particularly in the Social Security context. Advisory Committee's 1966 Notes 122. Individuals who had filed timely lawsuits challenging the administrative denial of benefits often failed to name the party identified in the statute as the proper defendant-the current Secretary of what was then the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare-and named instead the United States; the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare itself; the nonexistent \"Federal Security Administration\"; or a Secretary who had recently retired from office. By the time the plaintiffs discovered their mistakes, the statute of limitations in many cases had expired, and the district courts denied the plaintiffs leave to amend on the ground that the amended complaints would not relate back.\n   <em>\n    Rule 15(c) was therefore \"amplified to provide a general solution\" to this problem.\n   </em>\n   It is conceivable that the Social Security litigants knew or reasonably should have known the identity of the proper defendant either because of documents in their administrative cases or by dint of the statute setting forth the filing requirements. Nonetheless, the Advisory Committee\n   <em>\n    clearly meant their filings to qualify as mistakes under the Rule.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <em>\n    Krupski v.
