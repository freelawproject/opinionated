Walker, United States District Judge\n   Florida strips the right to vote from every man and woman who commits a felony. To vote again, disenfranchised citizens must kowtow before a panel of high-level government officials over which Florida's Governor has absolute veto authority. No standards guide the panel. Its members alone must be satisfied that these citizens deserve restoration. Until that moment (if it ever comes), these citizens cannot legally vote for presidents, governors, senators, representatives, mayors, or school-board members. These citizens are subject to the consequences of bills, actions, programs, and policies that their elected leaders enact and enforce. But these citizens cannot ever legally vote unless Florida's Governor approves restoration of this fundamental right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Florida's Executive Clemency Board has, by rule, unfettered discretion in restoring voting rights. \"We can do whatever we want,\" the Governor said at one clemency hearing. ECF No. 29, at \u00b6 55 n.26. One need not search long to find alarming illustrations of this scheme in action. In 2010, a white man, Steven Warner, cast an illegal ballot. Three years later, he sought the restoration of his voting rights. He went before the state's Executive Clemency Board, where Governor Scott asked him about his illegal voting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \"Actually, I voted for you,\" he said. The Governor laughed. \"I probably shouldn't respond to that.\" A few seconds passed. The Governor then granted the former felon his voting rights. ECF No. 101-159; ECF No. 29, at \u00b6 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is a facial challenge to Florida's re-enfranchisement scheme.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs and Defendants both move for summary judgment on cross motions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This Court has considered, without hearing, the parties' motions for summary judgment, their replies, and the record before it. In Florida, elected, partisan officials have extraordinary authority to grant or withhold the right to vote from hundreds of thousands of people without any constraints, guidelines, or standards. The question now is whether such a system passes constitutional muster. It does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Florida automatically disenfranchises any individual who has been convicted of a felony. FLA. CONST. art. VI, \u00a7 4 (a); FLA. STAT. ANN. \u00a7 97.041(2)(b). But the Florida Constitution authorizes the Governor, with the approval of at least two other Board members, to restore civil rights. FLA. CONST. art. IV \u00a7 8 (a); FLA. STAT. ANN. \u00a7 944.292(1). The Office of Executive Clemency \"was created to assist in the orderly and expeditious exercise of this executive power.\" Fla. R. Exec.

Fla. R. Exec. Clemency 2(A). The Governor\n   <em>\n    alone\n   </em>\n   \"has the unfettered discretion to deny clemency at any time, for any reason.\" Fla. R. Exec. Clemency 4.

FCOR \"operates as the administrative and investigative arm of the Board.\" FCOR Annual Rep. 2016-17, at 5 (\"Annual Rep.\"). It investigates all applicants who require a hearing before the Board. In doing so, it considers various factors, such as criminal and traffic records, the applicant's payment of fines, alcohol and substance use, voter registration information, and any input from the judiciary, state attorneys, and victims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. After its investigation, FCOR creates a report called the Confidential Case Analysis (\"CCA\"). ECF No. 103, at 7.

Fla. R. Exec. Clemency 12(A). Applicants are not required to attend their hearings, but the Rules \"encourage\" applicants to attend. Fla. R. Exec. Clemency 12(B). If applicants attend, they may speak\n   for no more than five minutes. Fla. R. Exec. Clemency 12(C). Others may speak in the applicant's favor, but the applicant's whole presentation cannot exceed ten minutes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In making its decisions, the Board can examine-but does not have to-assorted factors. These factors include drug and alcohol use, traffic violations, whether the applicant has voted despite legally being disenfranchised, employment status, family, and the Board's perceptions on the applicant's attitude, level of remorse, and whether she has turned her life around. ECF No. 103, at 8 (citations omitted). If an applicant is denied restoration, she cannot reapply for at least two years. Fla. R. Exec.

ECF No. 103, at 30-32; ECF No. 137, at 24-25; ECF No. 141, at 18-19.

A state cannot yank the right to vote from a Republican felon but retain voting rights for Democratic felons. Imagine a state bold enough to set in place a process-perhaps concurrent with criminal sentencing-where a panel of elected officials, empowered with boundless discretion but with a clear interest in shaping the electorate, decide that some felons can retain voting rights but others would be permanently barred from choosing their elected representatives. Such a scheme might be arbitrary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   It might also violate the First\n   Amendment.

Restoration cannot be arbitrary. A state cannot \"re-enfranchise only those felons who are more than six-feet tall,\" who are blue-eyed, who were born in August, who root for the Florida Gators, or who call heads during a coin flip.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nor can it violate the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendants essentially argue that vote-restoration for former felons can\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   occur on the state's terms. ECF No. 103, at 30-31. Once a felon loses the right to vote, only the state may grant it back in a manner of its choosing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A person convicted of a crime may have long ago exited the prison cell and completed probation. Her voting rights, however, remain locked in a dark crypt. Only the state has the key-but the state has swallowed it. Only when the state has digested and passed that key in the unforeseeable future-maybe in five years, maybe in 50-along with the possibility of some virus-laden stew of viewpoint discrimination and partisan, religious, or racial bias, does the state in an \"act of mercy,\" unlock the former felon's voting rights from its hiding place. Fla. R. Exec. Clemency 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Former felons' pathway back to full citizenship-one in which these members of Florida's communities have a voice in the selection of their government-cannot be tainted by even the slightest stench of viewpoint discrimination. A state may disenfranchise convicted felons. A particularly punitive state might even disenfranchise convicted felons permanently. But once a state provides for restoration, its process cannot offend the Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs have the right to free association and expression under the First\n   Amendment. Because the First Amendment protections in the context of felony re-enfranchisement is a matter of first impression, this Court first identifies the scope of these protections. If Plaintiffs were, for example, alleging First Amendment violations based on the discretion a police officer has in penalizing a speeding driver with a friendly warning or a steep monetary fine, the inquiry would be brief: there is no First Amendment protection against an officer issuing a fine versus a warning. Here, however, Florida's vote-restoration scheme violates two First Amendment rights; namely, free association and free expression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Right to Free Association.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"It is beyond debate that freedom to engage in association for the advancement of beliefs and ideas is an inseparable aspect of the 'liberty' assured by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which embraces freedom of speech.\"\n   <em>\n    NAACP v.

She may wish to express her support for the party's policies to her community, to the public, and elected officials by voting for the party's candidates. But the state requires her to complete her sentence, including any terms of parole and probation,\n   wait five or seven years, submit documentation, and is encouraged to appear before one of four semi-annual meetings of the Board in Tallahassee to plead her case. This process, to say the least, is burdensome-even if it were neutral, transparent, and uniform to all former felons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   But Florida goes several steps further.

Similar conduct can lead to different results in front of the Board. The Governor asked one former felon, Steven Warner, about an illegal vote he cast in 2010-before his voting rights were restored. ECF No. 29, at \u00b6 65; ECF No. 101-159. \"Actually, I voted for you,\" Warner responded.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    The Governor restored Warner's voting rights.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    But Plaintiffs identify five former felons who, at other points, were questioned about illegal ballots cast and then rejected on that basis.

Individualized review would certainly be less restrictive than unfettered discretion if, at the end of the day, such review meant anything. But the final decision-maker is the Clemency Board, and the Governor has de facto veto authority over anyone's restoration. All the component parts of the vote-restoration process that Defendants wave like shiny objects to distract from potential viewpoint discrimination-the investigations, case analyses, and hearings-mean nothing if the Governor\n    <em>\n     alone\n    </em>\n    has final authority to restore Plaintiffs' rights.\n    <em>\n     Bd. of Regents of State Colls. v.

This Court will not prevent-even briefly-the express preferences of Florida's Constitution without giving the parties an opportunity to address the appropriate remedy.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    <strong>\n     VII\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    This Court is not blind to nationwide trends in which the spigot to access the United States' most \"precious\" and \"fundamental\" right, the right to vote, depends on who controls the levers of power.\n    <em>\n     Harper\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174691\" index=\"279\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/663/#p665\">\n     383 U.S. at 670\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174691\" index=\"280\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/663/#p665\">\n     86 S.Ct. 1079\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . That spigot is turned on or off depending on whether politicians perceive they will benefit from the expansion or contraction of the electorate. In Florida, more than 154,000 citizens had their voting rights restored during the last gubernatorial administration's four years. Since 2011, a period of seven years, that figure has plummeted-less than 3,000 people have received restoration. The context of these numbers is not lost on this Court. More than\n    <em>\n     one-tenth\n    </em>\n    of Florida's voting population-nearly 1.7 million as of 2016-cannot vote because they have been decimated from the body politic.\n    <footnotemark>\n     19\n    </footnotemark>\n    More than one in five of Florida's African American voting-age population cannot vote.\n    <footnotemark>\n     20\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    If any one of these citizens wishes to earn back their fundamental right to vote, they must plod through a gauntlet of constitutionally infirm hurdles. No more. When the risk of state-sanctioned viewpoint discrimination skulks near the franchise, it is the province and duty of this Court to excise such potential bias from infecting the clemency process.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    Accordingly,\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    <strong>\n     IT IS ORDERED\n    </strong>\n    :\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n    1.
