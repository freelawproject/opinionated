Urbanski, Chief United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Political parties in Virginia can nominate their candidates for general elections through various methods. For example, a party may use a primary election in which all registered voters are invited to participate, or it could hold a mass meeting in which party loyalists select a nominee. As a default rule, Virginia allows the party to select its preferred nomination method. However, state election law provides an exception to this rule that empowers certain incumbent officeholders to select their party's nomination method, even over the party's objection. That provision of state law, known as the Incumbent Protection Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2024.2-509\">\n    Va.

They claim that the Incumbent Protection Act violates their right to free association under the First Amendment and should be\n   struck down. Defendants, the Virginia Department of Elections and members of the Virginia Board of Elections, counter that plaintiffs lack standing and fall short on the merits. The case is presently before the court on cross-motions for summary judgment. ECF Nos. 33, 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Incumbent Protection Act (the \"Act\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2024.2-509\">\n    Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 24.2-509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (B), affects each of the five plaintiffs in distinct ways. Indeed, each plaintiff's relationship to the Act weighs heavily on the outcome of their respective claims. Two of the plaintiffs are committees within the Republican Party of Virginia (the \"Party\"), and three are individuals associated with the Party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Party is an unincorporated voluntary association governed by its Plan of Organization (the \"Plan\"). ECF No. 39-1. The Plan establishes party committees for each electoral district in the Commonwealth. Under the Plan, those committees must use one of four possible methods to nominate Republican candidates for general election: a primary, a party canvass, a convention, or a mass meeting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   The Plan, Art.

V \u00a7 D(1)(a). The phrase \"where permitted to do so under Virginia Law\" was the subject of previous litigation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    24th Senatorial Dist.

The 6th congressional district covers much of the west-central portion of Virginia, from Roanoke to Front Royal. Representative Robert Goodlatte, also a member of the Republican Party, has represented the 6th congressional district since 1993. In 2016, Representative Goodlatte won nomination by primary, which qualifies him to exercise power under the Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under\n   Article IV of the Plan, the 6th Congressional Committee has authority to \"determine whether candidates for [ ] public office shall be nominated by Convention, Party Canvass or Primary.\" The Plan, Art.

Fitzgerald also sues in her capacity as the chairman of the 20th House Committee. Likewise, Yensho sues as chairman of the Greene County Republican Committee, though the Greene County Committee is not a party to this suit. None of these individuals currently hold public office.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In sum, plaintiffs consist of the committee-plaintiffs (20th House Committee and 6th Congressional Committee), the chairman-plaintiffs (Fitzgerald and Yensho), and the individual-plaintiffs (Fitzgerald, Yensho, and Kwiatkowski). Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , alleging that the Act is facially invalid because it violates their right to free association.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendants are the three members of the Virginia Board of Elections (the \"Board\")-Chairman James B. Alcorn, Vice Chair Clara B. Wheeler, and Secretary Singleton B. McAllister-and the Virginia Department of Elections (the \"Department\"). Both the Board and the Department are charged with enforcing the Incumbent Protection Act, among the other state election laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2024.2-103\">\n    Va. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 24.2-103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 24.2-404.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Act empowers certain officeholders to choose the method of nomination used to select their party's nominee for general elections. Section 24.2-509 of the Virginia Code states in its entirety:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   A. The duly constituted authorities of the state political party shall have the right to determine the method by which a party nomination for a member of the United States Senate or for any statewide office shall be made. The duly constituted authorities of the political party for the district, county, city, or town in which any other office is to be filled shall have the right to determine the method by which a party nomination for that office shall be made.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   B. Notwithstanding subsection A, the following provisions shall apply to the determination of the method of making party nominations. A party shall nominate its candidate for election for a General Assembly district where there is only one incumbent of that party for the district by the method designated by that incumbent, or absent any designation by him by the method of nomination determined by the party. A party shall nominate its candidates for election for a General Assembly district where there is more than one incumbent of that party for the district by a primary unless all the incumbents consent to a different method of nomination. A party, whose candidate at the immediately preceding election for a particular office other than the General Assembly (i) was nominated by a primary or\n   filed for a primary but was not opposed and (ii) was elected at the general election, shall nominate a candidate for the next election for that office by a primary unless all incumbents of that party for that office consent to a different method.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   When, under any of the foregoing provisions, no incumbents offer as candidates for reelection to the same office, the method of nomination shall be determined by the political party. For the purposes of this subsection, any officeholder who offers for reelection to the same office shall be deemed an incumbent notwithstanding that the district which he represents differs in part from that for which he offers for election.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Subsection A sets forth the general rule: political parties are empowered to choose the method of nomination. Subsection B creates exceptions to the general rule, distinguishing between General Assembly incumbents and non-General Assembly incumbents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Act grants incumbents of General Assembly districts unilateral power to override their party's preferred method of nomination. For example, if the 20th House Committee prefers a convention and Delegate Bell prefers a primary, Delegate Bell could invoke his power under the Act to force a primary. The Act also provides General Assembly incumbents with the power to require their party to use a party-run nomination method such as a mass meeting, even if the party would prefer to use a state-run primary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Act vests narrower authority to incumbents of non-General Assembly electoral districts, such as Representative Goodlatte of the 6th congressional district. If a non-General Assembly incumbent was nominated in the previous election cycle by a primary (or filed for a primary and was not opposed), then the political party may use a non-primary nomination method only with the incumbent's consent. So, for example, Representative Goodlatte, as a primary-nominated incumbent, could refuse consent to the 6th Congressional Committee's request to hold a convention and thereby force a primary. Unlike General Assembly incumbents, other incumbents do not have the authority under the Act to mandate a specific type of party-run nomination method-that is, Representative Goodlatte cannot force the 6th Congressional Committee to hold a convention if the Committee prefers a primary. Representative Goodlatte's power under the Act is limited to forcing a primary over the 6th Congressional Committee's request to use a non-primary method of nomination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In this case, neither Delegate Bell nor Representative Goodlatte has exercised his power under the Act to override his party committee's preferred nomination method for an upcoming election. So, there is no present conflict between an incumbent and a committee-plaintiff. Plaintiffs contend that no such conflict is necessary to prevail on their facial challenge to the Act. Defendants\n   take a different view. They argue that due to the absence of conflict between an incumbent and a party committee, plaintiffs lack standing. The court addresses these contentions below, along with defendants' other arguments on standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On March 22, 2017, defendants filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which the court denied in part and granted in part. The court granted the motion to the extent defendants challenged the claims brought by Yensho and Kwiatkowski as prospective candidates. The Fourth Circuit dismissed nearly identical claims pursued by a prospective candidate in\n   <em>\n    24th Senatorial Committee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4256110\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/820/624/\">\n    820 F.3d at 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As regards the committee-plaintiffs, the court allowed them to proceed past the Rule 12(b)(1) stage and directed the parties to engage in jurisdictional discovery as to whether the committee-plaintiffs have standing to sue. In the motion to dismiss, defendants did not challenge the standing of the individual-plaintiffs or the chairman-plaintiffs. Defendants correct that apparent oversight in their summary judgment motion and seek judgment as to all plaintiffs in each of their capacities. On summary judgment, defendants argue that no plaintiff has standing, and alternatively that no plaintiff succeeds on the merits. Plaintiffs also filed a summary judgment motion seeking judgment as a matter of law. The court addressed the cross-motions at a hearing on October 26, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the court must \"grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

In\n   <em>\n    24th Senatorial Committee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4256110\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/820/624/\">\n    820 F.3d 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Fourth Circuit dismissed a challenge to the Act for lack of standing. That decision directly relates to the claims brought here by the 20th House Committee and the individual-plaintiffs. Indeed, the court does not write on a clean slate as regards any plaintiff in this case given that the Fourth Circuit has examined the interplay between Virginia law and the Party's Plan on a number of occasions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marshall v.

Both committee-plaintiffs are in the same position as regards the first element: neither is currently at odds with an incumbent over what nomination method to use in an upcoming election cycle. Defendants assert that in the absence of a fully developed conflict between an incumbent and a\n   committee, the committees cannot show injury.

In\n   <em>\n    24th Senatorial Committee\n   </em>\n   , the Fourth Circuit concluded that this language incorporated the Act, and therefore, the alleged injury was caused by the Party's Plan, not the Act.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4256110\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/820/624/\">\n    820 F.3d at 630-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (dismissing a committee-plaintiff for failing to show causation element of standing).

The court must resolve the effect of this resolution in determining the 20th House Committee's standing. However, the 6th Congressional Committee presents no similar causation or redressability issues because Article IV of the Plan does not include the \"where permitted to do so\" language. In other words, the 6th Congressional Committee's power to select a nomination method is limited only by the Act, not the Party's voluntary choice to restrict its authority. The court now turns to examine these issues in depth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    1.

Defendants argue that for the committee-plaintiffs to have the requisite injury, they must openly oppose their incumbent's choice for a nomination method.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In response, the committee-plaintiffs argue that whether the incumbent's choice ultimately matches the committee-plaintiff's selection is irrelevant. They contend that the Act harms their associational rights long before an incumbent selects a nomination method for an ensuing election. Professor Jeffery Jenkins, an expert witness sponsored by plaintiffs, illustrates the ways in which the Act affects campaign planning decisions before it is formally invoked.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jenkins Decl., ECF No. 39-27. Jenkins notes that each of the four nomination methods available under the Plan \"create[s] a different distribution of potential voters (or decision makers) in the nomination process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8. For example, primaries involve the largest pool of potential voters, whereas conventions and mass meetings \"lend themselves more toward 'committed partisans.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9. Given these variations, the Act allows incumbents \"to assess how they would perform under different nomination methods and choose the one that they believe maximizes their chances of reelection.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. Therefore, even before an incumbent invokes the Act, candidates challenging the incumbent \"have to potentially prepare for (and qualify for) four different nomination methods.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9 n.5. Jenkins states that \"the mere existence of the Act may add ... uncertainty for potential high-quality challengers (and the staff, volunteers, and donors who would consider committing to their campaign).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Jenkins' conclusions are borne out in the testimony of the 20th House Committee and 6th Congressional Committee chairmen. Fitzgerald, as the 20th House Committee's chairman, described the \"big differences\" among the various methods of\n   nomination, including the stricter qualifications individuals must have to participate in party-run events compared to the qualifications applicable to primary voters. 20th House Committee Dep., ECF No. 39-4, at 27:5, 33:23-34:3. She stated that the 20th House Committee \"really, fundamentally, believes that it should be the right of the party to designate the way that we nominate our members.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45:22-25. Robert Sayre, chairman of the 6th Congressional Committee, testified that candidates for the 6th congressional district begin their campaign efforts before a nomination method is announced. 6th Congressional Committee Dep., ECF No. 45-2, at 32:16-25. He also stated that because of the Act, no one knows what nomination method will govern until the incumbent makes a selection: \"[t]he committee position is we wait for the congressman to tell us which method he has determined [that] we will follow.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 67:1-3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, members of the 6th Congressional Committee have discussed efforts to repeal or invalidate the Act on numerous occasions since 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Meeting Minutes, ECF No. 39-6, at 55, 66, 72, 82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The uncontroverted testimony from Jenkins and the committee chairmen shows that the Act need not be formally invoked to affect the campaign planning decisions of the committee-plaintiffs. In light of the fact that incumbents are not shy to exercise their power under the Act, the committee-plaintiffs must account for the ever-present threat that their preference for a particular nomination method will be rejected by their incumbent officeholders. Defendants do not challenge the accuracy of these facts, but merely argue these circumstances do not qualify as an injury for standing purposes. The court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The committee-plaintiffs' uncertainty as to what method will control the nomination of their general election candidates for upcoming elections is sufficient injury to demonstrate standing. This is so regardless of whether a committee ultimately agrees with its incumbent's choice of a nomination method. The committee-plaintiffs have demonstrated that the uncertainty\n   caused by the Act \"dramatically changes the plaintiffs' decisions about campaign financing, messages to stress, and candidates to recruit ... months, or even years, in advance of the election.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3464863\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/462/312/\">\n    462 F.3d at 317-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That uncertainty is palpable given the Act's repeated invocation by incumbents and enforcement by defendants.

First, Virginia Code \u00a7 24.2-516 states that \"[e]ach chairman shall file timely written notice with the Board whether or not a primary has been adopted and identify each office for which a primary has been adopted.\" Second, if a primary is to be held, Virginia Code \u00a7 24.2-527(A) requires committee chairmen to \"to furnish the name of any candidate for nomination\" to the Board and appropriate general registrar. In furnishing the list of candidates running for the party's nomination, the chairman must \"certify that a review of the filed candidate petitions found the required minimum number of signatures of qualified voters for that office to have been met.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2024.2-527\">\n    Va.

They have not identified a single prosecution, or threat of prosecution, pursuant to Virginia Code \u00a7 24.2-1001 for any conduct, much less a prosecution against a committee chairman for protesting the enforcement of the Act. Moreover, the chairman-plaintiffs' alleged injury could manifest only if a fully developed conflict between their committee and incumbent occurred and the chairmen decided to fight back by shirking their responsibilities under Virginia Code \u00a7\u00a7 24.2-516 and 24.2-527.

It is absurd to suggest that the Incumbent Protection Act is \"favorable to insurgents.\" Further, the Act does not mandate a particular type of nomination method, which Virginia may well do within the bounds of the Constitution. Rather, the Act allows incumbents to strip the 6th Congressional Committee of its ability to select from a menu of nomination methods, a menu that is available under the Plan and Virginia law except when an incumbent invokes the Act to eliminate all but the primary entree. The Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Lopez Torres\n   </em>\n   , which upheld New York's selection of its Supreme Court justices by convention, is of no aid to defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   At bottom, the Act provides express statutory benefits to incumbents at the expense of political parties' associational rights. Defendants have not shown any state interest that justifies such an intrusion into the 6th Congressional Committee's constitutional protections.

The as-applied challenge regards the Department's enforcement of the Act, which the Department undertakes in part by promulgating two forms: (1) Form SBE-509 (also tided ELECT-509 in some years), which incumbents use to notify both the Department and their respective party committee what nomination method they have selected; and (2) Form SBE-516 (also titled ELECT-516 in some years), which committee chairmen use to notify the Department whether a primary or non-primary method has been adopted.

Abell, Senior Elections Administrator, Virginia Department of Elections, to political party chairs, ECF No. 39-9; Email from Abell to state senators, ECF No. 39-10. The Department has used various iterations of these forms over recent years.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    2015 SBE-509(4), ECF No. 39-12; 2015 SBE-516(4), ECF No. 39,-13; 2016 SBE-509, ECF No. 39-15; 2016 SBE-516, ECF No. 39-16; 2017 ELECT-509, ECF No. 39-21; 2017 ELECT-516, ECF No. 39-22. In 2016 and 2017, the Department issued revised forms that treated all incumbents identically, indicating that even non-General Assembly incumbents have the unilateral power to choose a method of nomination.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5872036\" index=\"359\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/581/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    If the court were to find that the Act does not violate the 6th Congressional Committee's rights, but it does violate the rights of General Assembly committees, plaintiffs argue that the court ought to enjoin the Department from enforcing the Act in a manner inconsistent with its strict text. However, the court need not address this as-applied challenge because the Act, as written, severely burdens the associational rights of the 6th Congressional Committee.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"24\">\n   <p id=\"p-169\">\n    For ease of reference, Virginia Code \u00a7 24.2-509 is reprinted here with the addition of numbers for each sentence in Subsection B:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-170\">\n    A.
