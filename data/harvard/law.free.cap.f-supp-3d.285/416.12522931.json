PATTI B. SARIS, Chief U.S. District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case involves a bizarre dispute between the Plaintiff Heather Astaneh and the defendant the United States Postal Service. Plaintiff brought this action in state court against letter carrier Alan Hodgkins, alleging he was harassing her. Defendant removed the action to federal court and filed this motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), 12(b)(6), 12(c) and 12(h)(3), arguing, among other things, that the suit is barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity and that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because Plaintiff failed to exhaust her claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\"). The Court\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ALLOWS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   the Defendant's motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Alan Hodgkins is a letter carrier who delivers mail on the street behind Plaintiff's residence in Arlington, Massachusetts. He does not deliver mail to Plaintiff's house. Plaintiff alleges that Hodgkins was harassing her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 8, 2017, Green filed a form complaint against Hodgkins seeking a\n   Harassment Prevention Order pursuant to Mass. Gen. L. ch. 258E in Cambridge District Court. In an attached affidavit, she alleged that the letter carrier photographed her in her house, looked in her window, and parked his car in the back of her house and in front of a park that she frequents. She reported these encounters to his supervisor. The state district court issued an order barring Hodgkins from being within 100 yards of Plaintiff expiring on May 18, 2017. On May 16, 2017, she obtained an extension of the Harassment Prevention Order in Cambridge District Court until May 31, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Postal Service has submitted affidavits hotly disputing these factual allegations. In its view, plaintiff has been the one harassing Hodgkins and previous letter carriers by videotaping them and yelling at them. It also contends that the order interfered with Hodgkins' official route as a letter carrier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 10, 2016, Lauren Thomas, Counsel to Heather Green and Amin Astaneh, sent a letter to the United States Postal Service which was \"intended to serve as notice of a formal complaint under the Federal Tort Claims Act.\" Dkt No. 29-1. Her letter alleged that the Postal Service infringed on her and her husband's First Amendment right of free speech, violated the right to the use and enjoyment of their property, and discriminated based on Astaneh's national origin. She alleges that the First Amendment right to look out her window and record was abridged. Specifically, she contends that a previous carrier, Sharon A. Demiridjian, harassed her and failed to provide proper services. The letter does not mention Hodgkins. The written notification submitted to the Postal Service by the Plaintiff included a number of requested actions such as timely delivery of mail, timely processing of outgoing mail, investigation into criminal mail tampering or other criminal charges, and removal of Demiridjian from her service route. The letter does not contain a claim for money or damages or any sum certain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 9, 2017, the Tort Claims Examiner responded that Plaintiff's letter did not constitute a valid claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act and could not be reviewed by the office because it did not contain a \"sum certain\" amount in injuries and losses. Dkt No. 5-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 30, 2017, the government removed the case to this Court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201442\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (the federal officer removal provision). On May 31, 2017, the state court extended the order for one year, until May 31, 2018. On June 2, 2017, the government wrote to the state court judge, notifying her of the removal. After removal to the federal court, the state court vacated the order. Plaintiff does not challenge the removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The government argues that Plaintiff has failed to exhaust her administrative remedies under the FTCA, and that sovereign immunity precludes the Court from exercising subject-matter jurisdiction over a suit seeking injunctive relief against the Postal Service. Plaintiff argues that the sovereign immunity clause does not insulate the government from the intentional torts of its employees \"while they are engaged in the course of their employment\". Dkt No. 29. Although she initially sought to have the case remanded to state court, she dropped that challenge and appears now to acknowledge that Hodgkins was acting within the scope of his employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The FTCA waives immunity for certain government torts including \"injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful\n   act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201346\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), 2674.
