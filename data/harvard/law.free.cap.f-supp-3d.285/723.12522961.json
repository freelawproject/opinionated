The claims were initially denied on October 10, 2013 (Tr. 86-94), and plaintiff requested a hearing before an administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") (Tr. 95-99). ALJ Michael Rodriguez held a hearing by videoconference on January 20, 2015 during which plaintiff and a vocational expert testified (Tr. 36-74). On May 1, 2015, the ALJ issued a decision finding that plaintiff was not disabled (Tr. 13-31). This decision became the final decision of the Commissioner on October 17, 2016 when the Appeals Council denied plaintiff's request for review (Tr. 1-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Social Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff was born in December 1963 and was forty-nine years old as of the date of her DIB application (Tr. 75). Plaintiff has a college degree in social work, served in the military as a cable installer, a training officer, a child protective specialist and most recently had worked as a budget and administrative specialist at the Department of Veterans Affairs (the \"VA\") (Tr. 45-46, 48-51, 193-204). Plaintiff retired from the VA in February 2012 (Tr. 171, 291). Plaintiff lives in a single-family house with her father and her two adult sons, who were twenty-one and twenty-four years old as of the date of the hearing (Tr. 41-44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In a \"function report\" submitted to the Social Security Administration by plaintiff in September 2013, plaintiff stated that she was disabled due to chronic illnesses that included arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, sciatica with two slipped discs, numbness in her left arm, pain in her shoulders, feet and hands, hearing loss, depression and due to stress (Tr. 176-88). Plaintiff reported that she suffered from depression and felt stressed but also stated that she had not experienced anxiety attacks (Tr. 186-87). She reported that \"stress affects [her] whole body vision, nerves, bones, movements &amp; physical appearance [and] gives [her] migraine headaches\" (Tr. 184). She stated that she did not participate in social activities on a regular basis because she was embarrassed about not being able to walk without complaining, but that she spoke with her mother and grandmother over the telephone once or twice a week and shopped in stores once or twice a week for fifteen to twenty minutes (Tr. 180 81). Plaintiff stated that she had no problems with her attention or memory, could finish what she started, could follow spoken and written instructions and had no problems getting along with bosses or people in authority (Tr. 183-84)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Medical Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Although plaintiff applied for DIB on the basis of both her physical and mental impairments, on this appeal, plaintiff only challenges the ALJ's findings with respect to her mental health impairments. Therefore, only the facts concerning plaintiff's mental health history are discussed in detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Psychologist Dr. Melissa Halligan\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Treatment by Dr. Halligan Before Plaintiff's Alleged Onset Date\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On January 11, 2012, plaintiff saw psychologist Dr. Melissa Halligan at the VA for continued individual therapy (Tr. 277-79). Dr. Halligan reported that plaintiff was \"quite tearful [when] discussing the financial and work stressors that [were] impacting her recently,\" including foreclosure proceedings directed at her home and pressure to meet the deadlines of heavy workloads (Tr. 278). A mental status exam was normal except for a dysphoric mood and constricted affect (Tr. 277-78). Plaintiff had good insight, judgment and impulse control and Dr. Halligan diagnosed plaintiff with adjustment disorder (Tr. 277-78).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On January 30, 2012, plaintiff saw Dr. Halligan again and reported that she was continuing to deal with the ongoing stress of foreclosure proceedings (Tr. 268-69). A mental status exam showed that plaintiff had a dysphoric mood, had a normal affect and had good insight, judgment and impulse control (Tr. 269).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff missed an appointment with Dr. Halligan on February 13, 2012 because she forgot about it (Tr. 260). Plaintiff missed an appointment on February 22, 2012 because it was her last day at work and she was clearing out her desk (Tr. 260).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Treatment by Dr. Halligan Following Alleged Onset Date\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff saw Dr. Halligan again in September 2013 with complaints of severe depression and stress related to chronic pain and financial distress (Tr. 359-62). Dr. Halligan noted that plaintiff \"reports passive wishes that she would die naturally but ... denies any plan or intention to harm or kill herself\" (Tr. 360). Plaintiff scored in the severely depressed range on a PHQ-9 questionnaire\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Tr. 360-62). Dr. Halligan diagnosed plaintiff with depression (Tr. 360-61).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On October 23, 2013, plaintiff met with Dr. Halligan for therapy and reported stress resulting from a recent car accident and from financial problems (Tr. 348-49). A mental status exam showed that plaintiff had a dysphoric mood, good insight, judgment and impulse control and that there was no evidence of suicidal ideation (Tr. 348-49). Dr. Halligan diagnosed plaintiff with depression (Tr. 349).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Dr. Roland Larkin\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On October 23, 2013, plaintiff saw Dr. Roland Larkin at the VA for depression (Tr. 343).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff told Dr. Larkin that she had seen Dr. Halligan on and off for approximately six years, that she had a history of sexual abuse and that she had never taken any psychotropic medications (Tr. 344-45). Plaintiff stated that she felt depressed, hopeless and overwhelmed and had poor energy, motivation and sleep (Tr. 344). Plaintiff denied suicidal ideation, severe emotional distress, severe anxiety and panic symptoms (Tr. 340-41). Plaintiff complained of physical pain, insomnia and hopelessness and/or demoralization and had minimal indications of impulsive behavior (Tr. 340-41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A mental status exam showed that plaintiff had a cooperative attitude, calm motor activity, regular speech, intact thought processes, unremarkable thought content, fair insight, appropriate but tearful affect, grossly intact memory and cognitive function, intact abstraction, judgment and appetite (Tr. 346), Dr. Larkin diagnosed plaintiff with major depressive disorder, assessed a GAF score\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   of 58, indicating moderate symptoms, prescribed fluoxetine,\n   <em>\n    i\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    e\n   </em>\n   ., Prozac, and recommended that plaintiff continue individual therapy (Tr. 346-47).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   d.\n   <em>\n    Dr. Jennifer Reich and Dr. Uri Napchan\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff's primary care physician, Dr. Jennifer Reich, and her pain management physician, Dr. Uri Napchan, also monitored\n   plaintiff's depression during visits in 2013 and 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In August and September 2013, Dr. Napchan and/or Dr. Reich noted that plaintiff's judgment, insight, memory, mood and affect were normal (Tr. 415-16, 426-27, 434).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In October 2013, Dr. Reich noted that plaintiff's judgment, insight, mood and affect were normal with no anxiousness or suicidal ideation (Tr. 411-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In November 2013, Dr. Reich noted that plaintiff had started taking Prozac on October 23, 2013 and was \"starting to feel better at [that] time\" (Tr. 401-03).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In December 2013, Dr. Reich noted that plaintiff was \"under excessive amounts of stress,\" was following up with a psychiatrist at the VA and had recently started taking Prozac (Tr. 398-99).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In February 2014, Dr. Reich noted that plaintiff had normal insight, mood, affect and judgment (Tr. 388). She also noted that plaintiff was receiving therapy at the VA and was \"on Prozac and seemed to be doing well\" (Tr. 388-89). In March 2014, Dr. Reich again noted plaintiff was \"on Prozac and [was] doing well\" (Tr. 377).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Consultative Internal Medicine Evaluation: Dr. Gilberti Jenouri\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On October 2, 2013, internal medicine physician Dr. Gilberti Jenouri examined plaintiff at the request of the New York State Division of Disability Determination (Tr. 285). Plaintiff reported that she had a history of depression, back problems, hearing loss and neck problems (Tr. 285). Plaintiff said that she cooked two to three times a week, cleaned one to two times a week, shopped once a week but did not do laundry (Tr. 285). She did not shower but bathed three to four times a week, watched television and socialized with friends (Tr. 286). Dr. Jenouri diagnosed plaintiff with several physical impairments and a history of depression (Tr. 288).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Consultative Psychiatric Evaluation: Dr. Leslie Helprin\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On October 2, 2013, Dr. Leslie Helprin, a psychologist, examined plaintiff and prepared a consultative psychiatric evaluation (Tr. 291). Plaintiff told Dr. Helprin that she saw a psychologist at the VA once a week and had been seeing a psychologist since 2007 or 2008 (Tr. 291). Plaintiff complained of symptoms including waking up twice at night, loss of appetite, crying spells and social withdrawal (Tr. 291). She denied suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts but said that she sometimes felt that she did not want to live (Tr. 291). She said that she occasionally felt nervous but denied significant symptoms of anxiety, mania, thought disorder or cognitive symptomatology (Tr. 291). She reported she could drive, dress, bathe, cook and clean, but did not do laundry and needed help with grocery shopping due to back pain (Tr. 293). She also said she needed help with money management because she sometimes forgot when to pay bills (Tr. 293). Plaintiff did not socialize with friends in person but talked to her best friend in Georgia over the telephone and reported that her only leisure interest was watching TV (Tr. 293).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Dr. Helprin examined plaintiff and found that plaintiff was dressed appropriately, her posture and motor behavior was normal, her speech was fluent and clear with adequate expressive and receptive language skills and her thought processes were coherent and goal directed with no evidence of hallucinations, delusions or paranoia (Tr. 292). Dr. Helprin found that plaintiff had a dysphoric affect and her mood was dysthymic with \"some crying\" (Tr. 292). Plaintiff's attention and concentration were intact and her insight and judgment were good (Tr. 293). However,\n   plaintiff's recent and remote memory skills were \"[i]mpaired due to cognitive deficits. She recalled 3 of 3 objects immediately, and none after a five-minute time delay\" (Tr. 293). Plaintiff's intellectual skills were in the below average range (Tr. 293).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Dr. Helprin diagnosed plaintiff with adjustment disorder with depressed mood, moderate episodic, and an amnestic disorder, not otherwise specified (\"NOS\") (Tr. 294). Dr. Helprin concluded that plaintiff\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   evidences no limitations in her ability to follow and understand simple directions and instructions, cognitively perform simple tasks and complex tasks independently, and maintain attention and concentration, though with moderate short-term memory limitations. She evidences no limitations in her ability to maintain a regular schedule as it pertains to psychiatric and cognitive outlooks, make appropriate decisions, and relate adequately with [those] whom she encounters. She evidences mild limitations in her ability to deal with stress.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   The results of the examination appear to be consistent with some secondary psychiatric problems, but in itself this does not appear to be significant enough to interfere with the claimant's ability to function on a daily basis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   (Tr. 293-94). Dr. Helprin recommended that plaintiff take an antidepressant, continue psychological treatment and undergo a medical evaluation \"to determine if her medical conditions preclude her from all work;\" Dr. Helprin found that plaintiff s prognosis was \"good given the above treatments\" (Tr. 294).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Opinion by Non-Examining, Consulting Dr. h. Hoffman\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In October 2013, at the request of the Social Security Administration, Dr. L. Hoffman reviewed plaintiff's records, including Dr. Helprin's report, and completed a psychiatric review technique form (Tr. 79-86, 298). Dr. Hoffman opined that plaintiff had an affective disorder that imposed mild restrictions on her activities of daily living, mild difficulties in maintaining social functioning, mild difficulties in maintaining concentration, persistence, or pace and that she had not experienced any repeated episodes of decompensation of extended duration (Tr. 80).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Proceedings Before the ALJ\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Testimony\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   At the January 2015 hearing, plaintiff testified that she could not work because her \"back would give out on [her],\" she had carpal tunnel syndrome, arthritis and sciatica, and \"[i]t was hard just trying to either sit and trying to maneuver throughout the day\" (Tr. 52). She testified that her sons help her do all the household chores and shopping due to her pain, although she sometimes went grocery shopping with them (Tr. 62-63). Plaintiff spent her days sitting and watching TV, resting, or moving around the house to alleviate her pain (Tr. 62-63, 183).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiff testified that she first saw someone for mental health treatment around 2006 or 2007 in connection with her back pain and with sexual abuse she suffered while in the military (Tr. 56-57). She testified that she was currently in therapy at the VA where she was seeing a psychiatrist and a psychologist who had told her that she had depression and that they were examining her for possible PTSD (Tr. 56-57). She also testified that she was taking Prozac (Tr. 56-57).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Vocational Expert Testimony\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Vocational expert Esperanzo DiStefano (the \"VE\") testified at the hearing (Tr. 67-73). The ALJ asked the VE to assume that plaintiff's\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   residual functional capacity is sitting six hours out of an eight-hour workday, standing and walking two hours out of an eight-hour day, lifting and carrying ten pounds occasionally, five pounds more frequently. No upper or lower extremity push/pull activities, no ropes, ladders or scaffolds, no stairs or ramps, she'll do occasional balancing and stooping but no kneeling, crouching or crawling. Assume frequent overhead distance and directional reaching, assume frequent use of the hands, bilateral manual dexterity, both fine and gross manipulation. She can have occasional explosure to background noise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (Tr. 68-69). Given this residual functional capacity, the VE testified that plaintiff could do her past work as an administrative control specialist, DOT 209.362-026, which was a semi-skilled, sedentary job, and as a medical transcriptionist, DOT 203.582-058, which was a skilled, sedentary job (Tr. 68-69).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The expert testified that plaintiff's job opportunities would diminish by half if plaintiff were also off-task for fifteen percent of the time (Tr. 70). The expert testified that if plaintiff were further limited to only the occasional use of her hands, she could perform the three unskilled, sedentary jobs of information clerk, DOT 237.367-022, with 953,980 jobs nationally; callout operator, DOT 237.367-014, with 50,240 jobs nationally; and semi-conductor bonder 726.685-066, with 22,270 jobs nationally (Tr. 70-71). The VE also testified that plaintiff's employment opportunities for these positions would decrease by half if she were also off-task for fifteen percent of the day (Tr. 70-72).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Applicable Legal Principles\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Court may set aside the final decision of the Commissioner only if it is not supported by substantial evidence or if it is based upon an erroneous legal standard.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) ;\n   <em>\n    Selian v.

The ALJ found that plaintiff also suffered from the following impairments but that they were non-severe: obesity, carpal tunnel syndrome, headaches and thyroid nodules as well as mental impairments of adjustment disorder with depressed mood and amnestic disorder, NOS (Tr. 16-17). With respect to plaintiff's mental impairments, the ALJ found that these impairments did not cause more than minimal limitations on plaintiff's ability to perform mental work activities and noted that plaintiff had not alleged a severe mental impairment until sometime after she filed her application for disability benefits (Tr. 16-17). The ALJ also considered the four broad functional areas set out in the regulations for evaluating mental impairments and found that plaintiff had mild limitations on the activities of daily living, social functioning and concentration, persistence or pace and had no episodes of decompensation (Tr. 18-19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In coming to these conclusions, the ALJ reviewed the evidence of plaintiff's mental health treatment and assigned weight to the opinions in the medical record. The ALJ noted that plaintiff was treated by Dr. Halligan at the VA for severe depression and stress (Tr. 18). The ALJ noted that in September 2013, Dr. Halligan found that plaintiff was dysphoric, that her insight, judgment and impulse control were good and that her affect was within normal limits (Tr. 18). The ALJ also found that the record showed that plaintiff improved after starting on Prozac on October 23, 2013 (Tr. 18, 377, 388-89, 403). The ALJ noted that the records showed that on November 18, 2013, plaintiff was starting to feel better, that on December 9, 2013, she was calm and had an appropriate\n   mood and affect and that on February 24, 2014 and March 24, 2014 she was reported to be \"doing well\" on Prozac (Tr. 18). The ALJ gave \"great weight\" to the opinions of consulting examiner Dr. Helprin because his opinions supported the ALJ's conclusions that plaintiff's mental impairments were not severe and were \"consistent with the records as a whole and [because Dr. Helprin was] an expert in Social Security disability evaluation\" (Tr. 17). The ALJ also gave \"great weight\" to the opinion of the non-examining medical consultant, Dr. Hoffman, that plaintiff had mild limitations in the four broad functional areas specified for the evaluation of mental impairments (Tr. 17). In addition, the ALJ reviewed Dr. Larkin's treatment notes from October 2013, in which he diagnosed plaintiff with major depressive disorder and with a GAF score of 58 (Tr. 18). The ALJ gave \"little weight\" to the GAF rating because it was a \"snap-shot opinion of the claimant's functioning at that particular time\" and was inconsistent with plaintiff s mild limitations during other periods (Tr. 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   At step three, the ALJ found that plaintiff's disabilities did not meet the criteria of the listed impairments and that plaintiff was not, therefore, entitled to a presumption of disability (Tr. 20-21). 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The ALJ then determined that plaintiff had the RFC to perform a full range of sedentary work except that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   she is able to able to lift/carry ten pounds occasionally and five pounds frequently; can sit for six hours in an eight hour workday; is able to stand for two hours in an eight hour workday; can walk for two hours in an eight hour workday; must have no upper or lower extremity push/pull activities; can occasionally balance and stoop, but can never kneel, crouch, crawl, and climb stairs ramps, ladders, ropes, and scaffolds; can frequently perform overhead, distance, and directional reaching; can frequently use her hands bilaterally with manual dexterity, both fine and gross manipulation; and can have occasional exposure to background noise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   (Tr. 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The ALJ also considered plaintiff's testimony and found that while plaintiff's medically determinable impairments could reasonably have caused her alleged symptoms, a review of the entire case record showed that plaintiff's statements regarding their intensity, persistence and limiting effects were not entirely credible (Tr. 21-30). The ALJ found that plaintiff s \"reported restrictions are not consistent with the preponderance of the medical evidence, as well as the claimant's testimony at the hearing\" (Tr. 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   At step four, the ALJ concluded that plaintiff was not disabled and was capable of performing her past relevant work, stating that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   [i]n comparing the claimant's residual functional capacity with the physical and mental demands of her past work, the Administrative Law Judge is convinced that the claimant can perform the duties of her past relevant work as an administrative control specialist under Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) code 209.362-026 and medical transcriptionist under DOT code 203.582-058, as actually performed and normally performed in the national economy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   (Tr. 31). In reaching his conclusion, the ALJ relied on the testimony of the VE at the hearing (Tr. 30-31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Analysis of the ALJ's Decision\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the ALJ erred in finding that her mental impairments were not severe, that the ALJ erred in failing to include plaintiff's mental impairments in the RFC finding and that the ALJ's credibility\n   finding was flawed (Memorandum of Law in Support of the Plaintiff's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, dated July 21, 2017 (D.I. 20) (\"Pl. Mem.\") ). The Commissioner contends that the ALJ's decision was supported by substantial evidence, free from legal error and should be affirmed (Memorandum of Law in Support of Judgment on the Pleadings, dated October 3, 2017 (D.I. 24) (\"Def. Mem.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Assessment of the Severity of Plaintiff's Mental Impairments at Step Two\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The ALJ's finding that plaintiff did not have a severe mental impairment was supported by substantial evidence and was based on the correct application of the applicable legal standards. After finding that plaintiff had the medically determinable impairments of adjustment disorder with depressed mood and amnestic disorder, NOS, the ALJ then applied the required special technique for the evaluation of mental impairments and determined, based on substantial evidence, that plaintiff had no more than mild limitations in the four functional areas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Plaintiff's argument that Dr. Helprin's opinion that plaintiff had moderate memory deficits compelled the ALJ to find that plaintiff's mental impairments were severe is not supported by the record (Pl. Mem. at 10-13). Although plaintiff does not identify which functional areas the ALJ should have found to be more seriously impaired based on Dr. Helprin's finding of moderate memory limitations,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   a review of each finding shows that the ALJ's conclusions were actually supported by Dr. Helprin's findings and the overall record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   With respect to the first functional area, activities of daily living, plaintiff reported to Dr. Helprin that she needed some help with money management due to memory issues, had \"okay\" family relationships and did not socialize with friends in person (Tr. 293). Dr. Helprin concluded that plaintiff's psychiatric problems were not \"significant enough to interfere with [her] ability to function on a daily basis\" and that plaintiff could manage her own funds (Tr. 293-94). Dr. Helprin's opinion is therefore consistent with the ALJ's conclusion that plaintiff had mild limitations in the first functional area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   With respect to the second area, social functioning, Dr. Helprin found that plaintiff could \"relate adequately\" to others and had a \"mild\" limitations in the ability to deal with stress (Tr. 293). Thus, the ALJ's conclusion, that plaintiff had mild limitations in social functioning is also supported by Dr. Helprin's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   With respect to the third functional area, the ALJ acknowledged that Dr. Helprin's opinion that plaintiff had \"moderate short-term memory limitations\" may affect plaintiff's ability to maintain concentration, persistence, or pace (Tr. 19, 293). The ALJ concluded, however, that Dr. Helprin's other opinions and the overall record demonstrated that plaintiff's limitations in this area were mild. In the listings, \"concentrate, persist, or maintain pace\" is defined as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   the abilities to focus attention on work activities and stay on task at a sustained rate. Examples include: initiating and performing a task that you understand and know how to do; working at an appropriate and consistent pace; completing\n   tasks in a timely manner; ignoring or avoiding distractions while working; changing activities or work settings without being disruptive; working close to or with others without interrupting or distracting them; sustaining an ordinary routine and regular attendance at work; and working a full day without needing more than the allotted number or length of rest periods during the day. These examples illustrate the nature of this area of mental functioning.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, \u00a7 12.00(E)(3). With respect to these areas, Dr. Helprin opined that plaintiff could \"follow and understand simple directions and instructions, cognitively perform simple tasks and complex tasks independently, and maintain attention and concentration, though with moderate short-term memory limitations\" (Tr. 293). Dr. Helprin also found that plaintiff would have \"no limitations in her ability to maintain a regular schedule as it pertains to psychiatric and cognitive outlooks\" (Tr. 293). Therefore, with the exception of plaintiff's moderate short-term memory limitations, Dr. Helprin found that plaintiff had either mild or no limitations in areas of functioning that relate to concentration, persistence, or pace. Moreover, in August, September and October 2013, plaintiff's doctors found that her memory was either \"normal\" or \"grossly intact\" (Tr. 346, 416, 427, 434). Given these conclusions, it was not erroneous for the ALJ to conclude that Dr. Helprin's opinion and the record as a whole was consistent with a finding that plaintiff had mild restrictions in concentration, persistence or pace (Tr. 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   With respect to the fourth area, plaintiff does not dispute the ALJ's conclusion that plaintiff had not experienced any episodes of decompensation (Tr. 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Further, the ALJ did not improperly substitute his opinion for that of a medical professional in finding that plaintiff's psychiatric impairments were not severe. The ALJ gave Dr. Helprin's opinion, that of a consulting source, great but not \"controlling,\" weight. Even if Dr. Helprin's opinion could be interpreted to constitute a finding that plaintiff had a severe impairment, he was not a treating source whose opinion was entitled to controlling weight,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and he was not the only doctor to give an opinion. The ALJ also gave great weight to the opinion of medical consultant Dr. Hoffman that plaintiff had only mild limitations in the activities of daily living, maintaining social functioning and in her ability to maintain concentration, persistence, or pace and that she had suffered no episodes of decompensation (Tr. 17). Dr. Hoffman based this opinion on a review of the medical records that were available as of October 9, 2013, including Dr. Helprin's report (Tr. 76-81).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Further, the medical record from plaintiff's treating physicians supported the ALJ's finding that plaintiff's mental impairments were not severe and that her psychological condition improved with treatment during the relevant period. On September 26, 2013, during plaintiff's first post-retirement visit for treatment of depression, Dr. Halligan found that plaintiff scored in the severely depressed range on a PHQ-9 questionnaire and recommended that plaintiff meet with a psychopharmacologist to discuss medication for depression\n   (Tr. 360-61). On October 2, 2013, before plaintiff started taking medication, Dr. Helprin diagnosed plaintiff with an adjustment disorder with depressed mood that was \"moderate\" and \"episodic\" (Tr. 293-94). On October 23, 2013, Dr. Larkin assessed plaintiff with a GAF score of 58, indicating moderate symptoms (Tr. 346-47). Dr. Larkin examined plaintiff and found that she was cooperative, calm and had no suicidal ideations, but that she was \"depressed\" and \"mildly anxious\" (Tr. 346-47). Dr. Larkin prescribed Prozac (Tr. 346-47). On November 18, 2013, less than two months after Dr. Halligan diagnosed plaintiff with \"severe\" depression, plaintiff told Dr. Reich that she was beginning to feel better after starting Prozac and as a result of psychological counseling (Tr. 401-03). On December 2, 2013, Dr. Reich noted that plaintiff was under \"excessive amounts of stress,\" was on Prozac and would continue with treatment with a psychiatrist (Tr. 399). On February 24, 2014, Dr. Reich found that plaintiff's judgment, insight and mood were normal, that she was not depressed or anxious, that she was still taking Prozac and seemed to be doing well (Tr. 388-89). In March 2014, Dr. Reich again noted plaintiff was \"on Prozac and [was] doing well\" (Tr. 377). Thus, the ALJ correctly found that plaintiff's mental impairments improved with therapy and medication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Plaintiff's own account of her mental health also indicated that she had almost no limitations in her ability to function on a daily basis as a result of her mental health issues. Plaintiff reported to the Social Security Administration that she did not have trouble paying attention, did not need reminders to take her medication, could count change, could handle a savings account and could handle money (Tr. 18-19, 178-84). Although plaintiff stated that she did not socialize with friends in person, she lived with her family, she had no problems getting along with others and talked on the telephone with her mother, grandmother and her best friend (Tr. 181, 293). Although plaintiff told Dr. Helprin in October 2013 that she sometimes forgot to pay her bills, one month earlier, she had reported to the Social Security Administration that she had no trouble remembering things or handling bills (Tr. 180-84, 293).

At the first step, the ALJ found that in addition to certain physical impairments, plaintiff had the mental impairments of adjustment disorder with depressed mood and amnestic disorder, NOS (Tr. 16-17). As discussed above, in applying the special technique for the evaluation of mental impairments, the ALJ considered plaintiff's testimony and reports to her doctors related to the four factors in the special technique (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 17-20). To the extent plaintiff has challenged the ALJ's application of the special technique, those arguments were addressed above in Section (III) (C)(1). Later, in discussing plaintiff's physical impairments, the ALJ considered the statements plaintiff made in a disability questionnaire submitted to the Social Security Administration, her statements to her doctors and her testimony at the hearing (Tr. 21-29). The ALJ found that plaintiff's allegations of disabling physical limitations were not consistent with the medical evidence or her testimony at the hearing (Tr. 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Plaintiff's only challenge to the ALJ's credibility finding is that it is \"generally flawed\" because the ALJ failed to \"acknowledge Plaintiff's strong work history\" (Pl.
