INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This action arises from an encounter on an airplane between former Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke (\"Clarke\") and the plaintiff, Daniel Black (\"Black\"), which led to airport questioning and a social media spat. Black accuses Clarke of First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment violations, and seeks to hold both him and Milwaukee County liable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 11, 2017, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. (Docket # 15). Black responded on October 11, 2017, (Docket # 25), and the defendants\n   replied on October 25, 2017 (Docket # 29). For the reasons explained below, the defendants' motion will be granted in part and denied in part. The surviving claim will proceed to a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    3.1 Plaintiff's Failure to Dispute Defendants' Proposed Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Many of the relevant facts are undisputed because Black failed to dispute them. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 and Civil Local Rule 56 describe in detail the form and contents of a proper summary judgment submission. In connection with their motion for summary judgment, the defendants filed a supporting statement of material facts that complied with the applicable procedural rules. (Docket # 17). It contained short, numbered paragraphs concisely stating those facts they proposed to be beyond dispute, with supporting citations to the attached evidentiary materials.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775208\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/618/688/#p691\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As the party opposing the defendants' motion, Black was required to file \"a concise response to the moving party's statement of facts\" containing \"a reproduction of each numbered paragraph in the moving party's statement of facts followed by a response to each paragraph, including, in the case of any disagreement, specific references to the affidavits, declarations, parts of the record, and other supporting materials relied upon[.]\" Civ. L. R. 56(b)(2)(B). Black did no such thing. He filed only a memorandum of law opposing summary judgment, his own proposed facts, and a declaration attaching evidentiary material. (Docket # 25-28). The effect of this failure is that, for the purpose of deciding summary judgment, the defendants' uncontroverted statements of material fact are deemed admitted. Civ. L. R. 56(b)(4);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fabriko Acquisition Corp. v. Prokos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5763143\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/536/605/#p607\">\n    536 F.3d 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 607-08 (7th Cir. 2008) (\"[A] district court is entitled to demand strict compliance with [the local] rules for responding to a motion for summary judgment, and ... a court does not abuse its discretion when it opts to disregard facts presented in a manner inconsistent with the rules.\") (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court will consider Black's proposed facts, (Docket # 28-12), only to the extent they do not contradict the defendants' uncontroverted proposed facts, (Docket # 17).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    3.2 Relevant Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On January 15, 2017, Clarke boarded a plane bound for Milwaukee, Wisconsin from the Dallas / Forth Worth International Airport. He took his seat toward the front of the plane. Black boarded the plane after Clarke, and, during the boarding process, stopped in the aisle immediately adjacent to Clarke's seat. Black asked Clarke if he was the Milwaukee Sheriff, and Clarke responded affirmatively. Then, in what Clarke believed was a physically threatening manner, Black stared at Clarke and shook his head. As Black started to walk toward his seat, Clarke asked Black if he had a problem, and Black responded by turning, shaking his head, and waving Clarke off in a manner indicating displeasure. The men did not have further interaction during the flight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Before the plane took off, Clarke used his cell phone to call Inspector Edward Bailey (\"Bailey\"), who was then employed by the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office and whose regular duties included meeting Clarke at the Milwaukee airport when Clarke arrived home from an out-of-state trip. Clarke informed Bailey of the confrontation with Black, saying \"it had happened again\" and that he had had a \"confrontation with a passenger on an aircraft.\" (Docket # 17 at 4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Clarke described Black to Bailey and told Bailey that the confrontation had not been physical. Clarke did not think that it amounted to an offense for which a citation or arrest was appropriate. Clarke nevertheless told Bailey that he wanted deputies to conduct a \"field interview\" of Black when the plane arrived in Milwaukee. According to Clarke's undisputed version of the facts, a \"field interview\" in the Sheriff's parlance is a \"voluntary police-citizen encounter in which an officer obtains information from a citizen and makes an identification of the citizen.\" (Docket # 17 at 4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Bailey immediately called Captain Mark Witek (\"Witek\"), commander of the Airport Division of the Milwaukee County Sherriff's Office, to relay the information he had just received from Clarke. Separately, Clarke sent a text message to Witek instructing him to have deputies conduct a field interview of Black after the plane landed. Before the plane arrived in Milwaukee, Witek told Deputies Steven Paull (\"Paull\") and Jeffrey Hartung (\"Hartung\") that there was an individual on Clarke's flight that had possibly harassed him, and that the deputies were to conduct a field interview of that individual to identify him and obtain basic information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After the plane landed, Clarke exited the plane, entered the concourse at Gate\n   D54, and walked up to several waiting Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office personnel. Witek, Sergeant James Sajdowitz (\"Sajdowitz\"), Deputy Karen Mills (\"Mills\"), and Mills' canine were there to greet Clarke as part of standard procedure for the sheriff's airport arrival. Paull and Hartung were there solely for the field interview. Clarke stayed in the gate area with the other Sheriff's Office personnel until Black exited the plane and entered the concourse. Clarke identified Black to Witek, Paull, and Hartung and then left the gate area with Witek, Sajdowitz, and Mills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Paull and Hartung approached Black and said they needed to speak with him about an incident with Clarke on the plane. A brief segment of security footage from the gate area shows that the deputies did not use physical force when confronting Black. (Docket # 22-10). They walked with him to an open area at the center of Concourse D, near an unoccupied commercial space, that was not as confined and crowded as the gate area.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As they walked, Paull was several feet to Black's left and Hartung was behind Paull. When they arrived in the open area of the concourse, the deputies told Black to set down his bag and provide proof of his identity, which he did. Hartung called dispatch to run a check of Black's name and information from his Illinois driver's license for any outstanding warrants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   While they waited on dispatch, Paull asked Black to describe what happened with Clarke on the plane. Black relayed his account, and Paull, skeptical that Black's account was complete, asked Black if he had done anything else toward Clarke. Black called the situation ridiculous and Paull agreed. Paull asked Black what he thought of Clarke and Black responded, \"[n]o comment.\" (Docket # 17 at 8). Paull and Black then discussed other topics, apparently in a friendly manner. The three men learned that they all had attended the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee for college, and both Black and Hartung had played rugby there. When the field interview concluded (presumably the warrant check came back negative), the deputies escorted Black through the airport and outside to a waiting car driven by Black's friend. The field interview lasted approximately fifteen minutes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At no point in the interview did the deputies tell Black he was not free to leave, nor did Black ask if he was free to leave.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Black used his cell phone during the encounter to communicate with the friend who was picking him up at the\n   airport. Black also filmed video as the deputies escorted him out of the airport, and the deputies did not stop him from doing so. At his deposition, Black described the deputies who questioned him as \"kind.\" (Docket # 22-1 at 2). Black acknowledged that he did not refuse to answer the deputies' questions and said he was \"trying to be helpful.\" (Docket # 22-1 at 8). He also testified that he felt as though he could not leave without answering the deputies' questions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5763143\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/536/605/#p607\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Shortly after leaving the airport, Black posted about his interaction with Clarke and the deputies on a public Facebook group page. (Docket # 22-1 at 13). His post read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Just got off a flight from Dallas. Our wonderful Sheriff Clarke was on the flight. I couldn't tell if it was him because he was all decked out in all Cowboys gear, so I asked. When he responded yes, I shook my head at him and moved on. From behind me he asked if I had a problem and I shook my head no again. When we landed at Mitchell International, I had a welcoming party of about six cops and drug/bomb dogs, who questioned me for about 15 minutes before escorting me out. Just posting to let y'all know be careful around our Sheriff, he needs to be in a safe space at all times.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (Docket # 22-1 at 13).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A couple days after the airport incident, Black filed a formal complaint about Clarke with Milwaukee County. (Docket # 22-1 at 12). A day or two after that, on January 18, 2017, the Milwaukee County Sherriff's Office Facebook account posted a link to Black's complaint and a comment attributed to Clarke: \"Next time [Black] or anyone else pulls this stunt on a plane they may get knocked out. The Sheriff ... does not have to wait for some goof to assault him. He reserves the reasonable right to pre-empt a possible assault.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Docket # 22-1 at 15).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The next day, Clarke posted on the same Facebook account a meme, reproduced below, that included a picture of Black and the text \"Cheer up, snowflake ... if Sheriff Clarke were to really harass you, you wouldn't be around to whine about it.\" (Docket # 22-1 at 15 and # 30 at 10).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Black testified that he interpreted Clarke's posts as threats, and that they caused him mental and emotional harm. (Docket # 22-1 at 17). Black also testified that because of Clarke's posts, he has become the target of threatening and anti-Semitic comments online.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5763143\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/536/605/#p607\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    4. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Black brings claims against Clarke under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Black also brings a\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim against Milwaukee County based on Clarke's alleged constitutional violations. The defendants respond by contesting each of the alleged constitutional violations and arguing that, even if the Court finds a violation, Clarke is entitled to qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court's analysis begins with Black's Fourth Amendment claim, as the facts underlying that claim begin the story of this case. The Court then turns to Black's First and Fourteenth Amendment claims, and finally to Black's\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim against Milwaukee County. Clarke's entreaty for qualified immunity as to Black's constitutional claims is addressed only where the Court finds a potential constitutional violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    4.1 Fourth Amendment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Black contends that Clarke violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Swift\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11204666\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/220/502/#p506\">\n    220 F.3d 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 506 (7th Cir. 2000), when Clarke directed deputies to confront him in the airport and conduct an interview. To state a cause of action under the Fourth Amendment, the defendant's conduct must constitute a seizure and that seizure must have been unreasonable in light of the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Brokaw v. Mercer Cnty.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11174017\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/235/1000/#p1010\">\n    235 F.3d 1000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1010 (7th Cir. 2000). Defendants argue that: 1) Black was not seized within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment; 2) even if he was, Clarke did not direct the seizure; and 3) the seizure was reasonable in any event. Determining whether Black was seized at all is sufficient to dispose of the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Stated in general terms, a seizure occurs when a person's \"freedom of movement\" is restrained either by \"physical force\" or a \"show of authority.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Mendenhall,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185389\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/544/#p553\">\n    446 U.S. 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 553,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185389\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/544/#p553\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185389\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/544/#p553\">\n    64 L.Ed.2d 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980). Not all encounters between law enforcement and citizens constitute seizures. Police-citizen encounters generally fall into one of three categories, only the first two of which constitute seizures: (1) an arrest, requiring probable cause; (2) an investigatory stop, limited to \"a brief, non-intrusive detention\" based on specific and articulable facts supporting reasonable suspicion of criminal activity; and (3) voluntary encounters involving no restraint on the citizen's liberty.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Scheets,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11576281\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/188/829/#p836\">\n    188 F.3d 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 836 (7th Cir. 1999). A seizure occurs \"only if, in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\"\n   <em>\n    Mendenhall,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185389\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/544/#p553\">\n    446 U.S. at 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185389\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/544/#p553\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Because this question is context-dependent, courts have developed various factors to determine whether a seizure has occurred. For example, circumstances indicative of a seizure include\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   the threatening presence of several officers, display of their weapons, physical touching of the private citizen, use of forceful language or tone of voice (indicating that compliance with the officers' request might be compelled), and the location in which the encounter takes place. Courts also consider whether police made statements to the citizen intimating that he or she was a suspect of a crime, whether the citizen's freedom of movement was intruded upon in some way, whether the encounter occurred in a public or private place, and whether the officers informed the suspect that he or she was free to leave. These factors, however, are neither exhaustive nor exclusive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    United States v. Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4285401\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/794/681/#p684\">\n    794 F.3d 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 684 (7th Cir. 2015) (internal quotations and marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Under the totality of the circumstances, the deputies' interview of Black, at Clarke's request, did not amount to a\n   seizure. First, it is undisputed that Clarke instructed Bailey and Witek to have deputies conduct an interview of Black, and that Black had not done anything that would rise to the level of a citation or arrest. Clarke did not instruct his deputies to arrest or detain Black.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Although several officers were present at the gate when Black deplaned, only two approached him for questioning. There is no allegation and no evidence in the record that the deputies displayed their weapons. There is also no allegation or evidence that the deputies were forceful with Black, confirmed by the short amount of video surveillance capturing the deputies' initial contact with Black showing no use of force. Nor did the deputies use forceful language; in fact, Black testified that the deputies who interviewed him were \"kind.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Next, the deputies' questions were of a fact-gathering, as opposed to accusatory, nature. The deputies did not intimate to Black that he was a suspect of a crime. The limited information that Clarke conveyed to Witek, who presumably conveyed the same to the deputies, was that Black had had an interaction with Clarke on the plane that Clarke perceived as threatening. The deputies collected Black's biographical information, as well as his side of the story, before agreeing that the whole incident was \"ridiculous\" and escorting Black out of the airport to an awaiting car. Finally, the encounter was relatively brief and occurred in an area of the airport that was open to the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   True enough, the deputies did not tell Black he was free to leave, but Black also did not ask to leave. Black contends that it was \"obvious\" he wanted to leave the airport without staying to answer the deputies' questions, but that he could not leave because the deputies had instructed him to set down his bag and the deputies had his driver's license in hand. (Docket # 28-12 at 3-4). The defendants counter that Black answered the deputies' questions voluntarily, and Black admits he sought to be helpful to the deputies. \"[W]hether a person asks permission to leave is but one factor among many in the arrest analysis,\"\n   <em>\n    Fox v.

Black claims to understand these post as threats meant to deter him or others from criticizing Clarke.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Again here, the defendants do not contest that Black engaged in protected speech or that Clarke's posts were motivated thereby.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Docket # 29 at 12).

Although Black's complaint does not include reference to the First or Fourteenth Amendments, it does include the factual allegations on which those claims are based, namely Clarke's social media response to Black's protected speech acts.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    (Docket # 1 at 6-7, 10-11).

Along with their summary judgment submissions, the defendants filed a motion to seal Exhibit A to the declaration of Brian Barkow. (Docket # 20). The exhibit is matrix of information summarizing \"threats\" made against Clarke between July 2016 and July 2017. It includes identifying information about private citizens, including names, addresses, and birthdays. The defendants contend that public disclosure of this matrix could jeopardize ongoing investigations, provide assistance to individuals hostile to Clarke or Milwaukee County, and bring unwanted attention to the citizens whose identifying information is included.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314115\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/802/#p808\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Black opposes sealing, arguing there is no expectation of privacy for people who make statements online and that, in any event, the matrix is irrelevant to the claims at issue in this case. (Docket # 23). The defendants introduced the matrix to support their arguments opposing Black's Fourth Amendment claim, which will be dismissed.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    (Docket # 24 at 1-2). Because the exhibit is not dispositive to any issue in this case, and because it includes personal, identifying information about citizens who are not parties, the Court will grant the defendants' motion to seal it.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Goesel v.
