Defendants cite to paragraph 23 of plaintiff's complaint which reads: \"As a result of th[e] foreclosure, Mr. Dalby has lost title to his home wrongfully. The Court should rescind the foreclosure, restore title to Mr. Dalby, and determine what, if anything, remains of the mortgage debt.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants argue that in this paragraph plaintiff is asking the court to strip FNMA of title to the property, grant him title, and eliminate some or all of the mortgage debt. Defendants argue that plaintiff is not merely asking for a temporary delay of foreclosure procedures or for a loan modification. Rather, according to defendants, plaintiff seeks to\n   <em>\n    permanently\n   </em>\n   unwind a completed foreclosure. By doing so, defendants contend that plaintiff has put the entire property and loan in controversy. Thus, defendants argue that it is proper to determine the amount in controversy by looking to the value of the property and the amount of indebtedness.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chapman v. Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3755135\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/651/1039/\">\n    651 F.3d 1039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1045 n.2 (9th Cir. 2011) (in a quiet title action in which the plaintiffs sought judgment that they were the owners of the subject property in fee simple and that the defendants had no rights or interests in the property, \"the object in litigation is the Property, which was assessed at a value of more than $200,000\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants are correct that plaintiff is not asking for a temporary delay of foreclosure procedures or for a loan modification. But, plaintiff is also not asking that defendants be permanently enjoined from foreclosing on his home. He does not \"seek to enjoin foreclosure indefinitely as part of an effort to quiet title to the property or\n   rescind [his] loan agreement[ ].\"\n   <em>\n    Corral v.

In such cases, the Ninth Circuit recently explained that it was proper to measure the amount in controversy by the value of the property or the amount of indebtedness on the property because \"[w]hen a plaintiff seeks to quiet title to a property or permanently enjoin foreclosure, the object of the litigation is the ownership of the property.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265906\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/878/770/#p776\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But here, even though plaintiff does state in paragraph 23 of his complaint that he wants the court to restore title to him, he never requests that the court restore title to him free and clear of the mortgage. Rather, in his complaint, plaintiff acknowledges that there would still be a mortgage on the property, and he asks the court to determine how much is still owed on the mortgage. Plaintiff has alleged that he was not credited for some loan payments he made and that he was wrongfully required to purchase additional property insurance through Bank of America.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   His request that the court determine how much of the mortgage remains presumably has to do with these issues, as opposed to being a request to cancel the mortgage in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff does request that the foreclosure be rescinded. But, he does not request that defendants be enjoined from ever foreclosing on his home again or that his mortgage be canceled in its entirety. Thus, this case, as presently pleaded, falls within the exception to the general rule set out above. Because this case falls within the exception, it would not be proper to measure the cost of complying with plaintiff's request for equitable relief by looking to the value of the property or to the amount of indebtedness. Because these are not proper measures of the amount in controversy, defendants have failed to show that the amount in controversy has been met. Because defendants have not shown that the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000, removal was not proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the motion to remand\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   is granted.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Docket No. 13.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Docket No. 17.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Damages at 2, \u00b6 7, Exhibit A, Notice of Removal, Docket No. 1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 3, \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11, 13.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 3-4, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 4, \u00b6 15; 5, \u00b6 21.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 5, \u00b6 22.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 5, \u00b6 23.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 6, \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 6, \u00b6 28.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 6, \u00b6\u00b6 26 and 29.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 6-7, \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 7, \u00b6 34.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 7, \u00b6\u00b6 36-37.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 7, \u00b6 38.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 7, \u00b6\u00b6 39-41.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 8, \u00b6 43.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Declaration in Support of Plaintiff's Motion to Remand at 1, \u00b6 2, Docket No. 15.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Exhibit C at 9, Notice of Removal, Docket No. 1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Exhibit D at 2, Notice of Removal, Docket No. 1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"21\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Damages at 5, \u00b6 23, Exhibit A, Notice of Removal, Docket No. 1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"22\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Damages at 4, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16, Exhibit A, Notice of Removal, Docket No. 1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"23\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Docket No. 13.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
