(Dkt. 1 at \u00b6 1). Defendants Eric L. Atanas, also known as Eric Atanas, and Kathleen M. Pink, also known as Kathleen Pink (collectively, \"Defendants\"), have not appeared in this action. (Dkt. 8). On March 16, 2017, Plaintiff filed a motion for a default judgment and for foreclosure and sale of the Property. (Dkt. 9;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 10). On May 23, 2017, the Court denied that motion without prejudice and granted Plaintiff the opportunity to file a renewed motion for a default judgment to cure the\n   deficiencies described therein. (Dkt. 13). On July 6, 2017, Plaintiff timely filed a renewed motion for a default judgment and for foreclosure and sale of the Property. (Dkt. 16;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 17; Dkt. 18). The Court issued a motion scheduling order the same day, setting a briefing schedule and directing Plaintiff to serve that order and Plaintiff's motion papers upon Defendants. (Dkt. 20). On July 10, 2017, Plaintiff filed an affidavit of service, demonstrating that Plaintiff had served Defendants with the Court's motion scheduling order and Plaintiff's motion papers. (Dkt. 21). To date, Defendants have not answered the motion papers or otherwise appeared in this action. The Court assumes familiarity with the factual background and procedural history of this case, as set forth in its May 23, 2017, Decision and Order.

A copy of the complaint must be filed with the notice of pendency, unless the complaint has already been filed in that county. CPLR 6511(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As was the case during this Court's review of Plaintiff's first motion for default judgment, Plaintiff appears to have established the common-law elements of a foreclosure action. (Dkt. 18-2 at 3-6 (Note), 8-25 (Mortgage); Dkt. 18-7 (Pl. Aff.) ). In its May 23, 2017, Decision and Order, this Court determined that Plaintiff had \"complied with the procedural requirements of the RPAPL in most-but not all-respects.\" (Dkt. 13 at 5). Specifically, while acknowledging that Plaintiff's counsel had affirmed that \"a notice of pendency was filed in the Monroe County Clerk's Office in accordance with RPAPL \u00a7 1331 and CPLR 6511(a),\" the Court found that \"nothing in the record supports counsel's assertion that Plaintiff has complied with CPLR 6511(a) by filing the complaint with the notice of pendency.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6). Upon review of Plaintiff's renewed motion, the Court finds that all of the procedural requirements of the RPAPL have now been satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff's renewed motion, like its first motion, demonstrates that it has complied with \u00a7 1304 by serving the pre-litigation notice required under that statute (Dkt. 18-7 at 22), and with \u00a7 1306 by filing with the Superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services the information required by that statute (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 46). Plaintiff also served the following documents on each Defendant: the summons and complaint, notices pursuant to RPAPL \u00a7\u00a7 1303 and 1320, a debt validation letter, and a certificate of merit. (Dkt. 18-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   However, unlike its first motion, Plaintiff has demonstrated that the complaint and summons were filed with the Monroe County Clerk's Office at the same time as the notice of pendency. Here, Plaintiff submitted an attorney affidavit indicating that the complaint and summons were filed with the Office of the Monroe County Clerk alongside the notice of pendency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (Dkt. 18 at \u00b6 5);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Conklin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364854\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/310/40/#p44\">\n    310 F.R.D. at 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Plaintiff's attorney has submitted an affidavit confirming that a copy of the complaint filed with this Court was filed with the notice of pendency as required by [ CPLR 6511(a) ].\");\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nationstar Mortg.

Moreover, the complaint and summons provided by Plaintiff bear the Monroe County Clerk's time stamp, reflecting that they were filed on January 6, 2017, at 9:42 a.m. (Dkt. 18-2 at 32, 34), which is the same time stamp that appears on Plaintiff's notice of pendency (Dkt. 4);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

The Court admonished Plaintiff's counsel so that any subsequent filing would cure this defect, and Plaintiff's counsel has now renewed his request for attorney's fees. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 17 at 8-10; Dkt. 18-6).
