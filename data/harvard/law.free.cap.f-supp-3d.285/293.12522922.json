They contend that they are U.S. citizens by birth pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201401\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). That provision confers birthright citizenship on a person born abroad if both parents are U.S. citizens and one parent \"has had a residence in the United States\" prior to the person's birth.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Each of the Plaintiffs applied to the State Department for\n   proof of citizenship in the form of Consular Reports of Birth Abroad (\"CRBAs\"). The State Department either denied their CRBA applications or, for two of the Plaintiffs, revoked already-issued CRBAs. The Department's rationale: Plaintiffs are not, in fact, U.S. citizens because none of their parents satisfy the residency requirement of \u00a7 1401(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs filed this action against the United States, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and other State Department officials (collectively, \"the Department\") asserting claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. They contend that the State Department applied an impermissibly strict interpretation of the term \"residence\" in denying their applications, which is contrary to the plain terms of \u00a7 1401(c) ; that the Department departed from its prior, longstanding interpretation of the statute without following the requirements of the APA and the Department's Foreign Affairs Manual; and that the Department has not applied its new reading of the statute consistently nor embodied that reading in Department \"policy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Department moves to dismiss on four grounds. Its principal contention is that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because Plaintiffs' sole remedy lies in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201503\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Invoking the \u00a7 1503 remedy requires either (1) presence in the United States, which Plaintiffs do not allege, or (2) a set of conditions that Plaintiffs have not fulfilled: application for a certificate of identity, presence at a \"port of entry\" to the United States, an application for admission, and, if necessary, a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Second, the Department argues that, under the general six-year statute of limitations for claims against the United States,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), the claims of four of the Plaintiffs are untimely and that the Court, accordingly, lacks jurisdiction over those claims. Third, the Department contends that all but two of the remaining Plaintiffs have failed to allege facts sufficient to state claims for relief under the APA. Finally, the Department disputes the adequacy of Plaintiffs' due process claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As explained below, the Court concludes that for the most part, it has subject matter jurisdiction because Plaintiffs' claims arise under federal law and fall within the APA's waiver of sovereign immunity; it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the claims of four Plaintiffs, which are time barred; and the Department's limited challenges to the factual specificity of Plaintiffs' individual APA claims and due process claims are unpersuasive. The Court will, accordingly,\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   the Department's motion to dismiss in part and\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The final Plaintiff, Kenton Manning, is a Canadian citizen residing in Canada.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (Am. Compl. \u00b6 21).

Compl. \u00b6 49).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   First, in denying the application submitted on behalf of the three Chacoty children, the U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem concluded that \"[t]he activities described in [the] affidavits [submitted with the application] are the normal activities in which a person engages while on visit. There is no indication that the United States was ever the place of general abode.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Am. Compl. \u00b6 49). Second, in denying the application submitted on behalf of the Spector child, the Consulate General wrote, \"Based on a thorough review of the information contained in your application ... it has been determined that your child did not acquire citizenship at birth because neither [parent] had a 'residence' in the United States prior to the child's birth.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Am. Compl. \u00b6 50). Third, in revoking the CRBAs issued to Chana and Kayla Sitzman, the State Department explained that \"[t]he sole issue for decision at the revocation hearing was whether there was sufficient evidence ... that [their mother's] visits to the United States constituted residence,\" and the deciding official found that \"the character of [her] visits to the United States d[id] not constitute 'residence' within the meaning of\" \u00a7 1401(c).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Am. Compl. \u00b6 51). Finally, Plaintiffs attach to their complaint a letter from the Consul to the Consulate General rejecting the CRBA application of the Nachshon child, noting that the trips that his parents took to the United States before his birth never lasted longer than two months and concluding that those \"short trips to the U.S. were visits and indicate [that they] never established a residence there.\" Dkt. 28-4 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, the State Department's decisions denying their CRBA applications constitute a substantial departure from prior practice and, indeed, a departure from the practice at other embassies and consulates around the world. Until 2007, Plaintiffs assert, the Department \"published and disseminated a fact sheet\" explaining that \"if both parents were [U.S.] citizens, they could transmit citizenship to their children provided that one of the parents could show one day of physical presence in the United States.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Dkt. 28-1 at 1;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 28 at 32 (Am. Compl. Conclusion).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At some point, however, the Department adopted a new approach that requires more to establish \"residence.\" This new approach is reflected in \"updates\" to the Department's Foreign Affairs Manual and in at least one administrative decision, which is also attached to the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 28 at 15-16 (Am. Compl. \u00b6 61-62); Dkt. 28-2 (final administrative decision). Under that new approach, the consular officer must \"take[ ] into account the nature and quality of the person's connection to the place.\" Dkt. 28 at 15-16 (Am. Compl. \u00b6 61) (quoting 7 FAM 1133.5(b)). As a result, more is required \"than a temporary presence\": \"visits to the United States,\" without more, \"are insufficient to establish residency for purposes of citizenship transmission under\" \u00a7 1401(c).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Am. Compl. \u00b6 61) (quoting 7 FAM 1133.5(b)). Among other factors, the Department now considers whether the \"person owns or rents property\" and \"the duration of [the] person's stay in a particular place in the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Am. Compl. \u00b6 61) (quoting 7 FAM 1133.5(d), (f));\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 28-2 at 2 (final administrative decision) (noting that \"[r]esidence is not determined solely by the length of time spent in a place, but also takes into account the nature and quality of the person's connection to the place,\" and that \"[g]enerally, visits to the United States are insufficient,\" and, instead, the consular official must engage in \"a close examination, on a case[-]by[-]case basis, of the facts related to one's stay in the United States\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The complaint alleges that the State Department further revised the relevant portions of the Foreign Affairs Manual on February 24, 2016. Dkt. 28 at 17 (Am. Compl. \u00b6 66). The complaint does not, however, describe those revisions or whether or how they might bear on Plaintiffs' claims, all of which involve determinations made before February 24, 2016. Rather, the complaint merely asserts that these revisions demonstrate that the State Department's \"interpretation\" of \u00a7 1401(c) is a \"moving target.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 66).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Based on these allegations, Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, including an order directing that the State Department issue CRBAs to all of the Plaintiffs, except Kenton Manning, \"who should be issued a passport.\" Dkt. 28 at 33 (Prayer for Relief). This relief is warranted, in their view, for several reasons. They contend that the Department has misinterpreted \u00a7 1401(c) and has-at least implicitly-impermissibly read an \"intent\" standard into the statute. They also contend that the Department committed procedural errors in departing from its prior interpretation of the statute by failing (1) to engage in notice and comment rulemaking; (2) to follow the standards for revising the Foreign Affairs Manual set forth in the manual itself; and (3) to adopt a policy applicable to all consular offices. They conclude that, as a result of these errors, the Department has violated their rights under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Department argues that this case falls within the proviso by virtue of three different statutes: (1)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201503\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which the Department contends provides an exclusive remedy and thus \"impliedly forbids the relief\" Plaintiffs seek; (2) the \"no other adequate remedy\" provision of the APA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20704\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which the Department argues limits the APA's waiver of sovereign immunity; and (3) the general six-year statute of limitations in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), which the Department argues abrogates the waiver of sovereign immunity for untimely claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201503\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Department devotes the lion's share of its motion to its contention that \u00a7 1503 constitutes an exclusive remedy and thus impliedly forbids the relief sought by the Plaintiffs under other provisions of law. The Court is unpersuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As explained above, \u00a7 1503 provides two paths to challenge the denial of a \"right or privilege as a national of the United States\" on the ground that the applicant \"is not,\" in fact, \"a national of the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201503\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

According to the Department, Plaintiffs have failed to allege facts or otherwise to demonstrate that any of them have followed either path. The specified procedures, the Department adds, establish the exclusive avenue for establishing jurisdiction over claims like those asserted here.

The Court provided two principal reasons for reaching that conclusion. First, \u00a7\u00a7 1503(b) and (c) provides that an aggrieved party \"may\" apply for a certificate of identity and \"may\" apply for admission into the United States.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166745\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/367/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166745\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/367/\">\n    at 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166745\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/367/\">\n    82 S.Ct. 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court, accordingly, concluded that \"[t]he language of the section shows no intention to provide an exclusive remedy;\" that is, the language of the statute is permissive, not mandatory.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166745\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/367/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Second, the legislative history shows that \"the purpose of \u00a7 [1503(b) and (c) ] was to cut off the opportunity which aliens had abused ... to gain fraudulent entry to the United States by prosecuting spurious citizenship claims,\" and not to limit the relief otherwise available to those, like Plaintiffs here, who remain outside the United States.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166745\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/367/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166745\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/367/\">\n    at 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166745\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/367/\">\n    82 S.Ct. 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the Supreme Court further explained, \"[t]he teaching\" of earlier decisions, which were left unaffected by \u00a7\u00a7 1503(b) and (c), \"is that the Court will not hold that the broadly remedial provisions of the [APA] are unavailable to review administrative decisions under the 1952 [Immigration and Nationality] Act in the absence of clear and convincing evidence that Congress so intended.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166745\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/367/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166745\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/367/\">\n    at 379-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Cort\n   </em>\n   , therefore, is clear: \u00a7 1503 is not an exclusive remedy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Nor is the Court convinced by the Department's efforts to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Cort.\n   </em>\n   It argues, first, that the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Cort\n   </em>\n   , unlike the Plaintiffs in this case, had been previously recognized by the United States as a citizen and, second, that there was a \"near certainty\" that the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Cort\n   </em>\n   would have been \"arrested and prosecuted\" if he had returned to the United States because of a pending indictment.

But the Supreme Court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Cort\n   </em>\n   sweeps more broadly than that.\n   <em>\n    Cort's\n   </em>\n   holding-that \"a person outside the United States who has been denied a right of citizenship is not confined to the procedures prescribed by [ \u00a7 1503 ](b) and (c)\"-rested on the text and legislative history of \u00a7 1503.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166745\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/367/\">\n    369 U.S. at 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166745\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/367/\">\n    82 S.Ct. 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

If true, that would mean that Plaintiffs' claims are premature-not that they are untimely. The Court, however, is unconvinced, at least on the present record, that the denial of a CBRA does not constitute a final agency action. The Department's argument to the contrary collapses back on its argument that \u00a7 1503 provides the exclusive remedy for the denial of a CRBA. It argues, in short, that the \"denials of the CRBAs are an intermediate step in a regulatory and statutory structure that culminates in the process outlined in Section 1503\"-that is, the process that requires one to obtain a certificate of identity, appear at the U.S. border, and seek entry.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39. But, for the reasons discussed above, the Court has already concluded that Plaintiffs are not required to proceed under \u00a7 1503 and that, in fact, they have not done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Were some other formal process of agency review required or permitted, that might well render Plaintiffs' claims premature. Neither party, however, has identified any such process. To be sure, the State Department's Foreign Affairs Manual appears to permit an applicant's family to \"submit additional evidence at any time\" and to seek \"reconsideration of the case.\" 7 FAM 1444.3-2(B)(7);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   7 FAM 1445.9(b) (\"No formal application or filing of an appeal need be taken when submitting such evidence.\"). But that process, at least as described in the quoted portions of the Foreign Affairs Manual, lacks the formality or structure required to postpone the finality of the denial of a CRBA; to the contrary, it permits the submission of additional evidence \"at any time\" and would, thus, delay final action indefinitely in most, if not all, cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiffs add their own twist, alleging that \"any Plaintiffs who arguably fall outside of any applicable statute of limitations have reapplied, or are in the process of reapplying for CRBAs, thus restarting any applicable clock.\" Dkt. 28 at 30 (Compl. \u00b6 93). Like the Department's argument, that argument is potentially self-defeating; to the extent those Plaintiffs are still pressing their claims before the State Department, they are not time-barred, but they are premature. Once again, however, the Court is unconvinced, at least on the present record, that Plaintiffs' claims remain inchoate. As the Supreme Court has observed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   [W]here a petition for reconsideration has been filed within a discretionary review\n   period specifically provided by the agency (and within the period allotted for judicial review of the original order), ... the petition tolls the period for judicial review of the original order, which can therefore be appealed to the courts directly after the petition for reconsideration is denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    I.C.C. v.

Here, however, the Court does not understand Plaintiffs to allege that the Department is in the process of considering requests for reconsideration, much less requests filed within \"a discretionary review period specifically provided by the agency.\" They allege, instead, that they have \"reapplied\" for CRBAs. The Court is unaware of any authority supporting the proposition that a new application for relief restarts the statute of limitations with respect to an earlier application, which was denied in a final agency determination. Accepting that argument, moreover, would prove far too much for the reasons discussed in the preceding paragraph. It would, in effect, render the statute of limitations meaningless because an aggrieved party who failed to bring a timely challenge could resuscitate the untimely claim by \"reapplying\" for relief. It is, of course, possible that the applicant could bring an action challenging the denial of the new application (without regard to the earlier application), but that question is not before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Court, accordingly, concludes that any Plaintiff who received a final denial (including the resolution of any administrative appeal) of his or her CRBA application before May 2, 2008, has not brought a timely challenge to that decision. The claims of the Mayerson Plaintiff (application denied on February 25, 2008) and the claims of the two Shulem Plaintiffs (applications denied on November 15, 2007) are thus untimely. Dkt. 28 at 11 (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 39, 40). In addition, Kenton Manning's \"claim to U.S. [c]itizenship\" was initially denied on July 3, 2006, and affirmed by the State Department on May 24, 2007, and is, therefore, also untimely.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12 (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 45-46).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Court will, accordingly, dismiss the claims of the Mayerson Plaintiff, the Shulem Plaintiffs, and Kenton Manning for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

It argues that, with the exception of the Sitzman Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs have failed \"to allege\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   particularized facts relating to their parents' time in the United States or whether [one of their parents] had a residence in the United States before the birth of their children outside the United States.\" Dkt. 31-1 at 28. As a result, the Department concludes, Plaintiffs have not stated plausible claims for relief under any interpretation of \u00a7 1401(c)'s residency requirement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The complaint alleges that the Department denied Plaintiffs' applications for CRBAs \"on [the] grounds that\" the U.S. citizen parent did \"not satisf[y]\" the residency\n   requirement of \u00a7 1401(c). Dkt. 28 at 12 (Am. Compl. \u00b6 48). The complaint further asserts that the Department, \"[i]n the denial letters,\" explained that the parents' \"activities in the United States\" were not \"the activities of someone residing in the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Am. Compl. \u00b6 48). These allegations permit the reasonable inference that at least one of the parents of each Plaintiff has, in fact, spent\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   period of time in the United States before the Plaintiff was born and that \u00a7 1401(c)'s other requirements were satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Because the thrust of the Department's motion to dismiss turns on the lack of\n   <em>\n    factual\n   </em>\n   specificity in the complaint, and not on the\n   <em>\n    legal\n   </em>\n   sufficiency of Plaintiffs' theory that a single day's presence in the United States is sufficient, the Court will deny the Department's motion and will leave for another day the question whether a single day or very brief visit is sufficient.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Due Process Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Department notes that \"it is unclear\" whether Plaintiffs intend to assert their constitutional due process claims under\n   <em>\n    Bivens v.
