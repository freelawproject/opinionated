On September 30, 2016, citing national security concerns, DOD implemented enhanced security screening requirements for MAVNIs and required that the screening be successfully completed before a MAVNI enlistee would get a \"military suitability determination\" and be allowed to go to IET. (9/30/2016 DOD Memorandum, attach. 1, at 3; 1st Miller Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 10, 14-18;\n   <em>\n    Nio\n   </em>\n   , Tr. of PI Hr'g (Part I), July 19, 2017, ECF No. 34 (\"\n   <em>\n    Nio\n   </em>\n   , 7/19/2017 Tr.\") at 21-22.) DOD's enhanced security screening for MAVNI enlistees included: (1) a Tier 3 or Tier 5 background investigation-Tier 5 was formerly known as a Single Scope Background Investigation (\"SSBI\"); (2) a National Intelligence Agency Check (\"NIAC\"); (3) a counterintelligence focused security review (\"CI Review\"); and (4) an \"issue-oriented interview and/or issue-oriented polygraph, if needed to resolve any foreign influences or foreign preference concerns.\" (1st Miller Decl. \u00b6 14; 9/30/2016 DOD Memorandum, attach. 1, at 3-5.) Despite the reference to the possibility of a Tier 3 background investigation for some MAVNIs (a much less in-depth and time-consuming endeavor (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Stephanie P. Miller, July 28, 2017 (\"2d Miller Decl.\"), \u00b6 A2), DOD's current position is that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   MAVNIs are subjected to a Tier 5 investigation because \"every MAVNI applicant inherently has derogatory information\" due to the fact they are citizens of foreign governments. (10/18/2017 Tr. at 11-12.) Currently, the estimated time for completion of the Tier 5 investigation is over 400 days, and that is just one part of the enhanced security screening.

(10/18/2017 Tr. at 22-23.) IET would be completed in ten to twelve weeks, and by the end of IET, USCIS would have adjudicated their N-400 naturalization applications, and the MAVNIs would be granted citizenship.

(10/18/2017 Tr. at 32 (statement by DOD counsel: \"I think it's pretty clear that the process as it was originally contemplated was intended to move more quickly than what it currently does.\").) In fact, the enhanced screenings were taking so long that MAVNIs were starting to be discharged because they had exceeded the allowable time of two years in the DTP.

On July 27, 2017, in an attempt to ameliorate this problem, the then-Acting Secretary of the Army issued a memorandum that waived the requirement to attend IET within 24 months of accession and extended the period to 36 months for the 2,513 soldiers then in the DTP on the ground that the \"waiver is necessary to accommodate the additional security screening.\" (\n   <em>\n    Nio\n   </em>\n   , Defs.'

Ex. 13 (email to MAVNIs from Army Reserve administrator stating \"I have found out that we cannot certify [an N-426] unless you are on Active Duty\").) On July 7, 2017, DOD told this Court that it was \"undertaking a review of ... the standards for certifying approximately 400 existing N-426s\" (the\n   <em>\n    Nio\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs), and that it was \"not certifying any new MAVNI N-426s\" (the\n   <em>\n    Kirwa\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs) because it \"viewed IET [active duty] as a necessary precondition of an honorable service determination.\" (1st Miller Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 19-20; 2d Miller Decl. \u00b6 A4.) On August 17, 2017, the Army formerly ordered that no more N-426s were to be issued while its review was ongoing unless the person had served on \"active duty.\" (PI Mot. Ex. 10 (Aug. 17, 2017 Department of the Army Memorandum) (\"Effective immediately, I withhold authority to certify the honorable service (N-426) of Soldiers who have not yet attended Initial Entry Training.\").) That left MAVNIs who were currently drilling in the DTP-approximately 2000-unable to receive an N-426 and, as a consequence, they are ineligible to apply for naturalization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Initially, the refusal to execute plaintiffs' N-426 forms was attributable to DOD's hold during its N-426 policy review (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   1st Miller Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 19-20; PI Mot.

In addition, DOD's\n   action extends plaintiffs' time of living in a period of uncertain immigration status-with the concomitant limitations that places on their actions-and delays their ability to realize the benefits of citizenship.

(PI Mot. at 1.) Simultaneously, they filed a motion for class certification, seeking to certify a class that would include: (1) MAVNI enlistees, (2) who have served in the Selected Reserve, and (3) who have not received a completed Form N-426. (Pls.' Mot. for Class Certification, Sept. 19, 2017, ECF No. 12.) For purposes of the preliminary injunction motion, plaintiffs seek provisional certification of the class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   During a conference call on September 25, 2017, the parties agreed that, given DOD's position that \"active duty\" was required for certification of honorable service on an N-426, there were no facts in dispute, and the Court could collapse the preliminary injunction into a hearing on the merits. (10/18/2017 Tr. at 4-5.) Accordingly, the Court directed defendants to respond only to the merits of plaintiffs' substantive claims, set a hearing on the merits for October 18, 2017, and deferred defendants' obligation to respond to the motion for class certification. (Order, Sept. 25, 2017, ECF No. 16.) On October 10, 2017, defendants filed their response and a cross-motion for summary judgment on the \"active duty\" issue. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Summ. J. Opp. and Cross-Motion, Oct. 10, 2017, ECF Nos. 17 &amp; 18). Plaintiffs filed a reply on October 13, 2017. (Pls.' Summ. J. Reply, Oct. 13, 2017, ECF No. 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In the meantime, the legal landscape shifted dramatically. As the Court learned from the weekly status report filed in\n   <em>\n    Nio\n   </em>\n   at the end of the day on October 13, 2017 (\n   <em>\n    see Nio\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 58), DOD had just issued its new N-426 policies for when it would certify that a MAVNI currently in the Selected Reserve was \"serving honorably;\" it retreated from any express requirement of \"active-duty\" service, but instead imposed the numerous additional requirements set forth in its October 13th\n   Guidance. In light of this significant and abrupt change by DOD, the case was no longer about a single legal issue. The Court therefore concluded that it could no longer collapse the preliminary injunction hearing with the hearing on the merits. (10/18/2017 Tr. at 6.) Accordingly, it ordered full briefing on the preliminary injunction motion to be completed by October 17, 2017 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Minute Order, Oct. 14, 2017), so that it could hold the hearing as scheduled on October 18, 2017.

MAVNI enlistees had Form N-426s certified within days of submission. The certifying official confirmed that the enlistee (1) was serving, or had served in the Selected Reserves or in active duty, and (2) had at least one day of qualifying service, such as attendance at a drill. (PI Mot. Ex. 3.) The certifying official checked \"yes\" or \"no\" to \"[s]tate whether the [enlistee] served honorably or is currently serving honorably for each period of military service the requestor served.\" (PI Mot. Ex. 3 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   From the unrebutted evidence the Court can conclude that DOD officials were making the certification determination based on an enlistee's service record as it existed on the day he submitted the N-426. Again, in \"The Soldier's Guide to Citizenship Application\"-a document used by U.S. Army Human Resources Command to assist MAVNI enlistees in completing their naturalization applications-the Army clearly explained the meaning of \"honorable\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   As a general rule, a Soldier is considered to be serving honorably unless a decision has been made, either by the Soldier's commander or a court martial, to discharge him/her under less than honorable conditions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   In the rare cases where the character of a Soldier's service is questionable, ONLY the Soldier's commander can decide this issue, and the sole criterion for the decision is: If the Soldier were being discharged today, based on his/her record, what type of discharge would the Soldier receive? If Honorable or General or Under Honorable Conditions, the character of service on the N-426 will read \"honorable\". If Under Less than Honorable Conditions, the N-426 character of service item will NOT read \"honorable\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   (PI Reply Ex. 7, at 11.) The military has multiple regulations to judge an enlistee's honorable service, which make clear that the determination concerns an analysis of the existing military record. For instance, Army Regulation 135-178 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   The characterization of service upon separation is of great significance to the Solider. It must accurately reflect the nature of service performed....

In\n   <em>\n    Cody v. Casterisano\n   </em>\n   , the court reviewed issues surrounding a petitioner-enlistee's Form N-426 where, the government purported to (1) rescind and nullify a previously-issued Form N-426 certifying honorable service for a foreign student attending the U.S. Naval Academy on the grounds of administrative error because the student's service did not truly qualify as active-duty service; and then (2) issue a new N-426 after litigation commenced stating that the student had not served honorably because the service did not qualify as active-duty service. No. 09-cv-00687, at *1-4, 9-13 (D. Md. May 12, 2009) (unpublished). The federal district court, finding that the petitioner-enlistee was eligible for naturalization, did not defer to the N-426 issued after the beginning of litigation, but instead it concluded that it could either (1) consider itself bound by the N-426 issued prior to litigation, or (2) consider the petitioner's factual circumstances in light of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201440\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and relevant regulations/policy guidance to find that the plaintiff was eligible for naturalization.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201440\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201440\">\n    at 13-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The government protested that the petitioner could not have served honorably for naturalization purposes because he was not inducted into active duty, but the court noted that it could find the plaintiff to \"have been 'constructively inducted' into active-duty in the Navy based on his rank of 'midshipman' and his performing the duties of a service member.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201440\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201440\">\n    at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Whether DOD is taking an initial agency action or changing a longstanding policy, or practice, it still must provide a reasoned explanation for its action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In an attempt to explain the change, defendants' counsel repeated the now-familiar refrain that DOD has made the change for \"national security\" purposes. (10/18/2017 Tr. at 60-61.) But DOD's Guidance is not justified by any national security concerns. As the Court recognized in\n   <em>\n    Nio\n   </em>\n   , national security issues\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   justify enhanced security screening,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203917006\">\n    2017 WL 3917006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8, *11, *13, but N-426 certification is not related to that process. Importantly, DHS/USCIS is holding all MAVNI naturalization applications pending DOD's enhanced security screening so no MAVNI enlistee will naturalize until DOD completes the screening. And, even if a MAVNI enlistee were to slip through the cracks and obtain citizenship before screening had been completed,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201440\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) provides for revocation of citizenship if a person is separated under other than honorable conditions. Moreover, DOD fully controls what these enlistees do and have access to before the enhanced security screening is complete. Therefore, DOD has given no reasoned justification why certifying a form N-426 for immigration and naturalization purposes implicates our national security.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Furthermore, despite its assertions to the contrary, DOD does not control the naturalization process. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PI Opp. at 38 (\"DOD's new policy marks an effort to ... set standards for a naturalization process that has been greatly challenged by national security threats.\").) So DOD's unfounded attempt to control criteria for naturalization does not constitute a reasonable explanation for the October 13, 2017 policy change here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Retroactivity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The October 13th Guidance also suffers from another potential flaw: It retroactively changes standards and procedures applicable to service members who enlisted prior to October 13, 2017. When plaintiffs enlisted, the government told them that they would receive N-426s either after just one day of qualifying service (e.g., a drill with their Selected Reserve unit), or within around 180 days when they shipped to basic training. At that point, they would be able to apply for naturalization. The process to receive an N-426 was to take approximately 180 days. Now, DOD says that it will certify plaintiffs as having served honorably only if three new conditions are met: (1) they are not the subject of any pending disciplinary action or pending adverse administrative action or proceeding, and are not the subject of a law enforcement or command investigation; (2) they have completed applicable screening and suitability requirements; and (3) they have served in a\n   capacity, for a period of time, that permits DOD to make \"an informed determination\" as to whether such service was honorable. (10/13/2017 Guidance at 3.) These open-ended requirements will double and possibly even triple the time it takes for plaintiffs to receive N-426s, for the Tier 5 investigation, just one step in the screening process, will take over 400 days. DOD represented to plaintiffs that they would naturalize, or at least have the protection of being in the process of pursuing\n   <em>\n    expedited\n   </em>\n   citizenship, shortly after enlistment. Instead, the October 13th Guidance stands in stark contrast since the new projected timetable deprives the enlistees of their right to apply for an expedited path to citizenship.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Admittedly, the jurisprudence relevant to retroactivity in the context of administrative law involves either rulemaking by notice and comment or adjudications, but the principles that govern these cases are also relevant to DOD's Guidance. DOD has consummated its decisionmaking process and seeks to apply its decision in a concrete way that determines legal rights and obligations of plaintiffs and similarly-situated individuals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bennett v.

Cal. Oct. 12, 2004) (unpublished) (granting class certification to persons pursuing lawful permanent resident status \"to whom USCIS ha[d] failed to issue evidence of registration\"). By preventing plaintiffs from submitting valid naturalization applications to USCIS, defendants are depriving plaintiffs of \"lawful presence\" for purposes of ICE enforcement.

Pretending otherwise ignores ICE's own representations: (1) \"Generally ICE does not initiate removal proceedings against individuals in the [MAVNI] program if they have no valid immigration status,\n   <em>\n    so long as they\n   </em>\n   can demonstrate\n   active participation in the MAVNI program and\n   <em>\n    have a naturalization application pending with [USCIS]\n   </em>\n   ,\" (Asher Decl. \u00b6 5 (emphasis added)), and the submission of a MAVNI \"application provides the enlistee continued lawful presence in the United States while the application is pending.\" (PI Mot.

In granting provisional class certification \"the Court must still satisfy itself that the requirements of Rule 23 have been met.

After reviewing the record, the Court has concluded that the requirements of Rule 23 have been met, and defendants have failed to offer any meritorious reasons as to why provisional class certification is not appropriate. The Court will, however, modify the class to only include MAVNI enlistees who enlisted before October 13, 2017 because the October 13th Guidance has different criteria for MAVNI enlistees who enlisted on October 13, 2017 and after.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Court grants plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction and provisional class certification.
