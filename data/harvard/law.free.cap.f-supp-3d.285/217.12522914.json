On March 6, 2017, defendant decided to release additional information. Ex. 11 to Fantle Decl. [Dkt. # 14-3] (\"Letter Releasing More Records\"). Specifically, the agency reversed its\n   position on Exemption 6 and agreed to unredact the state of residence for each applicant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Then on March 9, 2017, defendant provided plaintiff with \"several pages\" of responsive records it had inadvertently omitted.

There was no briefing in this case following plaintiff's complaint due to the willingness of the parties to resolve the FOIA dispute among themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On June 14, 2017, the case was referred to a Magistrate Judge to conduct mediation concerning attorneys' fees and costs. The parties were unable to reach an agreement, so on August 18, 2017, plaintiff filed the pending motion for attorneys' fees. Pl.'s Mot.

The agency argues that once the appointments were announced on November 16, 2016, it concluded that Exemption 5 pertaining to pre-decisional and deliberative records no longer applied, and consequently it released 671 responsive pages a month later, on December 16, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   This is a close question.

Therefore, while it cannot be said that the filing of the lawsuit was the sole basis for the agency's change in position, there was a substantial causal connection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Moreover, the abandonment of Exemption 5 was not the only change. The agency agreed to partially waive Exemption 6 as to the five appointees' personal information on \"outside income and judgments\" because it found that the \"public interest in certain components of their applications outweighed their privacy interest in the information.\" Letter Releasing Records. To the extent that the lawsuit gave voice to the public's interest in this information, the Court finds that it played a role in the agency's decision to disclose that information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Finally, defendant acknowledges that the lawsuit played a role when it stated that it made its second revised production on March 6, 2017, \"in an effort to resolve the lawsuit.\" Def.'s Opp. at 8.

While there is a genuine public interest in monitoring the nation's administration and enforcement of organic standards in agricultural products, plaintiff's FOIA request is somewhat indirectly related since it narrowly sought the information of applicants to the National Organic Standards Board as announced in April 2016. Nonetheless, the Court agrees that the \"the backgrounds of persons appointed to the NOSB, as well as persons who sought appointment to the NOSB,\" a 15-member board that advises the Secretary of Agriculture on organic policy and standards, is relevant to the broader goal of monitoring the administration and enforcement of organic standards.
