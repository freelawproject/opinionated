GM removed the case to this Court and, thereafter, filed a Motion to Dismiss (Doc. No. 8) on the grounds that Gulley's conduct was governed by a Collective Bargaining Agreement (\"CBA\") and the subject of a Grievance Settlement entered into between GM and his Union.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Motion to Dismiss has been fully briefed by the parties. (Doc. Nos. 9, 10, 13 &amp; 16).

The factual allegations and relevant documents show the following.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 20, 2016, Gulley began working for GM at its manufacturing facility in Spring Hill, Tennessee. During his employment, Gulley was a member of the United Auto Workers Local 1853, and covered by a CBA between GM and that Union.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On July 12, 2017, Gulley drove to work and parked in the employee parking lot. At the time he had a handgun in his vehicle, secreted in a small compartment below the steering wheel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After walking into the plant, Gulley was asked to accompany his group leader to her desk. At the desk was a Union Committeeman and a GM Manager. Gulley was told that he needed to gather his belongings and meet with GM management in another part of the facility. After collecting his belongings, Gulley was escorted to a meeting room where he was met by a GM Labor Representative, the facility's Chief of Security, and a Maury County Deputy Sheriff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Upon being informed that an anonymous tipster had placed a phone call to the \"GM Awareline\" stating that Gulley had a weapon at the facility, Gulley consented to a search of his person, locker, and vehicle. A handgun was found in Gulley's vehicle after he told the Deputy Sheriff where it was located.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Once the handgun was retrieved and photographed, Gulley returned to the meeting room and was asked by the Labor Representative why he had a gun. Gulley stated that he had the handgun in his vehicle for protection. The Labor Representative then told Gulley that she was \"writing him up,\" and stepped out of the room. The Union Committeeman also stepped out of the room. After a couple of minutes, both returned and Gulley was handed a \"Notice of Disciplinary Action or Discharge\" form. The form indicated that Gulley was being discharged because he violated \"Standard of Conduct # 14.\" (Doc. No. 1-2 at 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Standard of Condition # 14 is a provision in the local CBA that reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Serious misconduct may include any of the following actions or behaviors by a team member will be sufficient grounds for corrective action ranging from reprimand to immediate discharge. In as much as all misconduct cannot be anticipated, this list is not intended to be exhaustive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   14. Possession of weapons or explosive material on Company premises at any time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (Doc. No. 9-1 at 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After being discharged, Gulley received a copy of GM's Global Security Policy (\"Security Policy\"), which states that \"GM will not tolerate the possession of guns, dangerous devices, or other weapons while on company property, including company parking lots.\" The Security Policy further states that, \"[u]nless this policy violates local law, it remains a violation of the policy to have weapons of any kind on GM property, event when they are kept in employees' personal vehicles.\" (Doc. No. 1-2 \u00b6 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On July 16, 2017, Michael Herron, the Union Chairman, emailed Ron Rich, GM's Plan Personnel Manager, and explained that, in the Union's view, GM's policy was in conflict with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2050-1-312\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 50-1-312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Herron also stated that it was the Union's position that the statute protected Gulley's right to keep the handgun locked in his vehicle and demanded that Gulley be returned to work immediately. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On August 9, 2017, Gulley, the Union, and GM entered into a \"Grievance Settlement\" that reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Without prejudice to the position of either party and on a non-precedent setting basis, the grievance is withdrawn by the Union. The grievant will be reinstated to his previously held position and paid for lost time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The grievant's return to active status (report for work) will be contingent upon the outcome of a \"fit for work\" evaluation to be performed by GM Medical. The purpose of the exam is to determine the grievant's mental and physical ability to return to work and to ensure that the grievant does not represent a threat to himself or others. In the event of an unsatisfactory assessment, the grievant shall be reinstated as noted above and placed on a sick leave of absence until such time as he is found able to return to work.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (Doc. No. 9-3 at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Gulley submitted to the request for a medical evaluation via a telephone conference on August 11, 2017 with a \"Doctor Jones\" hired by GM. Both Herron and a \"Doctor Bruce\" were present, and \"both of GM's own medical professionals, Dr. Jones and Dr. Bruce, stated that Gulley was 'fit to work.' \" (Doc. No. 1-2 \u00b6 23). Nevertheless, GM did not return Gulley to work. Instead, GM representatives called Gulley and informed him that he needed to undergo a second evaluation on August 24, 2017. Gulley said he was not available that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On August 25, 2017, Gulley (or his counsel) was told by Holly Georgell, GM's in-house counsel, that Gulley would be reinstated with full pay, but would be placed on leave rather than returned to work. Five days later, he received a copy of his pay stub that indicated he was being paid $3,847.50 in back wages, which was approximately $1,000 less than he was owed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On September 2, 2017, Gulley was told by Georgell that GM did not intend to reinstate him unless and until he successfully completed the second fit-for-duty evaluation. Gulley also received a printout indicating the $3,837.50 was for \"T. Gulley Discharge Settlement.\" Less than three weeks later Gulley filed suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Complaint is in two counts. Count One seeks injunctive relief pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2050-1-312\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 50-1-312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (B)(1)(B)\"to prohibit GM from: (a) taking any further adverse employment actions, of any kind, against Gulley as a result of the July 12, 2017 incident or any subsequent possession of his handgun inside his locked vehicle; and (b) requiring Gulley to submit to any further medical or psychological evaluations predicated upon the July 2017 [incident] or his current or future possession of a handgun inside his locked vehicle; and (c) enforcing any GM policy at the Spring Hill facility against Gulley or any other GM employee that violates Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 50-10312(b)(1)(A).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39). Count Two seeks \"economic damages, including back pay, front pay, the economic value of employee benefits, and consequential economic damages pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 50-1-312(b)(1)(B).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Even though the Court is required to construe the well-pleaded facts from the Complaint in favor of Gulley in ruling on GM's Motion to Dismiss, those \"[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level,\" and \"state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Bell Atlantic Corp. v.

Legal Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   GM's Motion to Dismissed is based on three grounds. First, it argues that Gulley's claims are preempted by Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20185\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , he has not exhausted his contractual remedies, and he has not alleged the Union breached its duty of fair representation. Second, GM argues that the present dispute is barred by the Grievance Settlement. Third, GM argues that the \"adverse employment actions\" about which Gulley complains were the result of the Grievance Settlement he knowingly and willfully signed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Section 301\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Section 301 provides that \"[s]uits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce ... may be brought in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction of the parties, without respect to the amount in controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the parties.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20185\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Thus, even though federal question jurisdiction is generally determined from the face of a complaint, a claim purportedly based solely on state law may provide jurisdiction because Section 301 of the LMRA had preempted that particular state law.\n   <em>\n    Klepsky v.

This is particularly so given Gulley's acknowledgment that the Discharge Notice listed only one reason for his discharge, specifically the violation of Standard of Conduct # 14. Indeed, Gulley's acknowledgment may well prove fatal because the statute contemplates a burden-shifting approach similar to the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   paradigm such that GM is allowed to produce evidence of a legitimate non-discriminatory reason that Gulley would have to rebut.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Nevertheless, the question now before the Court is simply one of preemption and \"reliance on the CBA as a defense is, in itself, insufficient to trigger preemption.\"\n   <em>\n    Paul\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5710465\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/701/514/#p519\">\n    701 F.3d at 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
