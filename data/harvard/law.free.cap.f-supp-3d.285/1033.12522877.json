Plaintiff alleges that she and similarly situated employees regularly worked more than forty hours per workweek but that, from approximately January 1, 2015, to October 13, 2015, they were not paid one and one-half times their regular rate for each hour worked over forty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff seeks remuneration for unpaid overtime wages on behalf of the following proposed class of FLSA opt-in plaintiffs and Rule 23 putative class members:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   All current and former employees of Defendants who have worked as direct support professionals, support associates, caregivers, home health aides, or other employees who provided companionship services, domestic services, home care, and/or other in-home services, and who worked over 40 hours in any workweek beginning January 1, 2015 through October 13, 2015, and were not paid time and a half for the hours they worked over 40.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 31, 37, ECF No. 1.

In December 2014, the D.C.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendants' Motion to Dismiss hinges on one crucial unsettled question of law: the effective date of the DOL's Final Rule. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants are liable to their domestic services employees for all unpaid overtime beginning January 1, 2015, the Rule's scheduled date of effectiveness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20552.6\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 552.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants, on the other hand, contend that the Final Rule was not effective until at least October 13, 2015, the date of the D.C. Circuit Court's mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   No circuit court has ruled on the Final Rule's effective date, and the district courts to have done so have reached conflicting conclusions. The analysis begins with the general principle that judicial decisions, as opposed to statutes and regulations,\n   apply retroactively. See\n   <em>\n    Harper v. Va. Dep't of Taxation,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355584\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/86/#p97\">\n    509 U.S. 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 97,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355584\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/86/#p97\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355584\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/86/#p97\">\n    125 L.Ed.2d 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993). According to that principle, when a court \"applies a rule of federal law to the parties before it, that rule is the controlling interpretation of federal law and must be given full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review and as to all events, regardless of whether such events predate or postdate [the court's] announcement of the rule.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355584\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/86/#p97\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Undersigned finds that a straightforward application of the\n   <em>\n    Harper\n   </em>\n   retroactivity rule to this case compels the conclusion that the Final Rule became effective as of January 1, 2015. \"[W]hen the D.C.

Practically speaking, adoption of the legal fiction that a former judicial decision was never really the law in the first place is precisely what the\n   <em>\n    Harper\n   </em>\n   rule requires.

At bottom, the DOL's policy not to\n   <em>\n    enforce\n   </em>\n   the Rule did nothing to\n   <em>\n    modify\n   </em>\n   the Rule itself or its effective date. If evidence were needed to support this position, it would come from the DOL's own prior guidance on the effective date of the Final Rule. In October 2014, the DOL issued guidance explaining that it would defer enforcement of the Final Rule until July 1, 2015, even though its effective date would remain January 1, 2015.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2060974\">\n    79 Fed. Reg. 60974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Oct. 9, 2014). Then, after July 1, 2015, and until December 31, 2015, the DOL stated it would exercise prosecutorial discretion and determine on a case-by-case basis whether an employer's violation of the Final Rule warranted enforcement action by the DOL.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2060974\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This guidance thus demonstrates that the DOL's non-enforcement decisions have no bearing on the effectiveness of the Final Rule.

Conditional Certification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   This matter is before the Court on the first step-conditional certification. Plaintiff seeks to conditionally certify all current and former domestic service employees of Defendants who worked over forty hours in any workweek from January 1, 2015, through October 13, 2015, and were not paid at a rate of 150% their normal hourly rate for the hours they worked over forty in a workweek. Mot. 1-2, ECF No. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As previously noted, Defendants declined to respond to Plaintiff's motion, asserting that it was filed prior to the parties' Rule 26(f) conference in violation of the Southern District of Ohio Civil Rule 23.3. Mot. Dismiss 2 n.1, ECF No. 6. Defendants misread that Rule. Rule 23.3 states that \"[i]n all cases with class action allegations,... [n]o motion\n   <em>\n    to certify a class\n   </em>\n   shall be filed before the Rule 26(f) conference except by agreement of the parties or order of the Court.\" S.D. Ohio Civ. R. 23.3 (emphasis added). Plaintiff's motion for conditional certification pertains only to her\n   <em>\n    collective action allegations\n   </em>\n   and not her Rule 23 class claims. The Rule's provision against filing motions for\n   <em>\n    class certification\n   </em>\n   does not apply to Plaintiff's motion for conditional certification of a\n   <em>\n    collective action.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   While the Court would prefer to rule on the motion only after fully considering any of Defendant's potential objections to it, the Court nevertheless proceeds to rule on it now for several reasons. First, conditional certification triggers the issuance of notices to potential opt-in plaintiffs, on whose claims the statute of limitations continues to run until opting in. Ruling on the motion now, without allowing time for additional briefing, thus prevents prejudicing potential opt-in plaintiffs who have yet to receive notice of this action. Second, conditional certification is routinely granted before any discovery takes place. Finally, Defendants may move to decertify the class at the close of discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Court finds that Plaintiff has carried her burden of setting forth a \"modest factual showing that [she] is similarly situated to the other employees [she] is seeking to notify.\"\n   <em>\n    Waggoner,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4366123\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/110/759/#p764\">\n    110 F.Supp.3d at 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Specifically, Plaintiff alleges in her Complaint\n   that Defendants permitted their domestic service employees to work more than forty hours per workweek but did not compensate them at a rate of one and one-half times their normal rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of forty in one week, Compl. \u00b6 27, ECF No. 1. Plaintiff also submits an affidavit in which she states that she typically worked around sixty-five to one hundred hours per week, that her regular pay rate was around $10.50 to $11.50 per hour, and that she was not paid overtime compensation for hours worked in excess of forty in a workweek. Brittmon Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 3-5, ECF No. 41-1. Additionally, Plaintiff asserts that her experiences as a Support Specialist are similar to Defendants' other employees who work as \"support professionals, support associates, caregivers, home health aides, or other employees who provided companionship services, home care, and/or other in-home services ...\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.

Ohio Sept. 12, 2013) (applying equitable tolling prior to conditional certification on the reasoning that the potential opt-in plaintiffs had no actual or constructive notice of the filing requirement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Undersigned agrees with the vast majority of cases in this circuit that have declined to apply equitable tolling at this stage of the litigation. Applying equitable tolling to the claims of unknown plaintiffs not yet before this Court contravenes the fact-specific, case-by-case determination that specific circumstances justify the tolling of an individual plaintiff's claims. That is, without having information about the potential plaintiffs whose claims the Court is being asked to toll, the Court is unable to determine whether those potential plaintiffs lacked actual or constructive notice of the filing requirement, diligently pursued their rights, or were reasonably ignorant of the legal requirements of their claims. As\n   <em>\n    Atkinson\n   </em>\n   put it, \"[a]pplication of the [\n   <em>\n    Truitt\n   </em>\n   ] five factors to a group of potential opt-in plaintiffs, who have not yet received notice of the collective action and are not yet parties to the lawsuit, [would be] convoluted at best.\"\n   <em>\n    Atkinson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20853234\">\n    2015 WL 853234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Accordingly, Plaintiff's premature Motion to Toll the Statute of Limitations is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.
