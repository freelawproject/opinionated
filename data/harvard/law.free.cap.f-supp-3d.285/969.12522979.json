Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Rondellte Frazier is a full-time employee of Defendant Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Board (\"DFW Board\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 31, 34, ECF No. 29). He provides security-related services, like inspections and traffic management, as a Civilian Security Officer at the airport. (Frazier Aff. \u00b6 4, ECF No. 53-1). For the last several years, DFW Board has been involved with the construction of an updated terminal at the airport. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 32). In furtherance of this project, DFW Board contracted with several other companies\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (collectively, the \"Companies\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   to help with construction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Companies then hired Plaintiff as an independent contractor to provide security-related services when he was not working for DFW Board. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30, 35-37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Despite being labeled as an independent contractor, Plaintiff claims that he was in fact jointly employed by DFW Board and the Companies. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 30, 64-65, 68). Accordingly, he argues that DFW Board should have calculated his eligibility for overtime wages by combining the hours he worked for DFW Board and the Companies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff filed this putative collective action, on behalf of himself and others similarly situated, to recover unpaid overtime wages under the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff has provided sufficient evidence to establish that similarly situated employees exist. Plaintiff has submitted six declarations, one from himself and the others from employees who have opted-in to the lawsuit. All of them are current or former Civilian Security Officers for DFW Board. (Pl. App. at 1, 11, 20, 29, 38, 47, ECF No. 53-1). They have also worked for some or all of the Companies as independent contractors, and they highlight the high-level of control the Companies have exercised over their work. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12, 15-16). They describe performing the same set of duties,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   at the same location, wearing the same badge and uniform, using the same equipment, reporting to the same supervisors, and following the same rules and policies whether working for\n   DFW Board or the Companies. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-15). However, they were paid separately by DFW Board and the Companies, and their eligibility for overtime was not calculated by combining the hours worked for both. (\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14). The uniformity of these declarations suggests that there are other similarly situated employees with respect to their job requirements and pay arrangements; it suggests Plaintiff's circumstances are neither uniquely personal nor specific to work for a particular Company. The record sufficiently supports, at this stage, the existence of a common plan where DFW Board does not pay overtime wages to Civilian Security Officers because they are hired as independent contractors by the Companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant highlights some variations among potential class members, including their job responsibilities and the hours they worked for the Companies. (Def. Resp. at 8-10, ECF No. 91). However, Plaintiff need not demonstrate uniformity \"in each and every aspect of employment\" among class members.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4282282\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/281/282/#p288\">\n    281 F.R.D. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   288 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker v. Honghua Am., LLC,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3839388\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/870/462/#p468\">\n    870 F.Supp.2d 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 468 (S.D. Tex. 2012) (\"Slight differences in job duties or functions do not run afoul of the similarly situated requirement.\"). It is also not apparent that any of the noted differences are relevant or make the jobs so dissimilar as to deny class certification. For example, some of Defendant's declarants-who are also Civilian Security Officers for DFW Board who have worked for the Companies-state not having access to the same tools in both jobs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. App. 15, 19, ECF No. 92-1). Such slight differences will not defeat certification at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Next, Defendant argues that the class will not be manageable because individual analysis is required to determine damages, whether a class member is an independent contractor, and whether DFW Board is a joint employer with each of the Companies. (Def. Resp. at 17-20). Plaintiff presents evidence to indicate that such individual analysis may not be necessary. The other employees who have consented to participate in the case uniformly describe the same employment relationship with DFW Board and all of the Companies. More importantly, the alleged need for individual analysis is not a sufficient reason, at this stage, to deny conditional certification. Plaintiff must merely show that similarly situated employees exist. Any need for individual analysis should become apparent through discovery, and Defendant's concerns can be addressed then by a decertification motion or by bifurcating the liability portion of the case from the damages portion.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roberts v.

Defendant objects to the proposed notice because it incorrectly identifies as defendants parties who are no longer involved with the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Def. Resp. at 25). Plaintiff has addressed Defendant's concerns by amending the notice accordingly. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Reply at Exs. A-B, ECF No. 93).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In its \"duty to ensure that the notice is fair and accurate,\" the Court makes one substantive change to Plaintiff's proposal.\n   <em>\n    Vargas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%20730155\">\n    2010 WL 730155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11. Plaintiff requests to notify-and that Defendant provide contact information for-all Civilian Security Officers who have worked for DFW Board and one or more of the Companies since 2013. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 52-1). However, the record is unclear whether Defendant has information indicating whether a particular Civilian Security Officer has actually worked for one or more of the Companies.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Frazier Aff. \u00b6 14 (stating that DFW Board and the Companies \"jointly maintain employment records including records of hours worked and posts manned\")\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Def. Resp. at 7-8 (stating that Companies manage and pay Civilian Security Officers directly, without DFW Board's involvement). Moreover, information from 2013 is not relevant here. The FLSA statute of limitations is also two years-three for willful violations-and runs from the date an employee files its consent form with the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20255\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 256. The Court therefore authorizes notice to Civilian Security Officers who worked for DFW Airport within the past three years from the date of this Order. It will also require an employee to identify on the consent form which of the Companies he or she has worked for in that span. Otherwise, the Court finds that the proposed notice and consent forms are accurate and includes information needed to make an informed decision about whether to join the lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

In the lawsuit, Ron Frazier (\"\n   <strong>\n    Frazier\n   </strong>\n   \" or \"\n   <strong>\n    Plaintiff\n   </strong>\n   \") alleges that he is owed overtime pay for hours he worked while employed by DFW Airport and the Joint Venture Manhattan/Byrne/JRT/3i/ (\"\n   <strong>\n    MBJ3\n   </strong>\n   \"), Wells Global, LLC (\"\n   <strong>\n    Wells Global\n   </strong>\n   \"), EAS Contracting, LP (\"\n   <strong>\n    EAS\n   </strong>\n   \"), Haydon Building Corp. (\"\n   <strong>\n    Haydon\n   </strong>\n   \"), Phillips/May Corporation (\"\n   <strong>\n    Phillips\n   </strong>\n   \"), and Balfour Beatty Construction Corporation (\"\n   <strong>\n    Balfour\n   </strong>\n   \") (MBJ3, Wells Global, EAS, Haydon, Phillips and Balfour each a \"\n   <strong>\n    Contractor\n   </strong>\n   \" and collectively \"\n   <strong>\n    Contractors\n   </strong>\n   \") You have the right to participate in this collective action lawsuit and this Notice explains how you may do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    What is this lawsuit about?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In the lawsuit, Frazier is seeking to recover overtime pay for hours he alleges that he worked over 40 hours in a work week while performing security services for DFW Airport as a Civilian Security Officer. The lawsuit claims that the hours Civilian Security Officers worked for DFW Airport and the hours Civilian Security Officers worked for one of the Contractors should be combined on a weekly basis to determine eligibility for overtime pay. Frazier claims that when you combine the hours, he worked more than 40 hours in a week but did not receive overtime pay. Frazier seeks back wages for the time worked over 40 hours a week. In addition to back wages and unpaid overtime, Frazier is seeking liquidated damages equal to his unpaid wages and overtime, attorneys' fees, and costs. DFW Airport contends that Frazier and the Civilian Security Officers were/are paid appropriately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Court has not decided whether DFW Airport failed to pay any overtime wages owed. The plaintiffs in this lawsuit must prove their claim at trial unless the case is settled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    What happens if I join this lawsuit?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   If you join this lawsuit, you consent to having Mr. Frazier represent you and the other Civilian Security Officers as lead plaintiff, and to having Mr. Miltenberger and his law firm act as your legal representative in this matter. You may have to answer questions about your claim, respond to written discovery requests, provide documents and/or provide testimony in a deposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   If you join this lawsuit and Frazier and the Civilian Security Officers win, you may get an amount up to two times the unpaid overtime wages that should have been paid. Mr. Miltenberger and his law firm are representing Frazier and the Civilian Security Officers on a contingency fee basis, which means if there is no recovery, they receive no attorneys' fees. If there is a recovery, Mr. Miltenberger and his law firm will be paid a percentage of the monetary judgment or settlement for you and other class members. If you join this lawsuit and Frazier and the Civilian Security Officers lose, you will get nothing and are barred from bringing a future claim for unpaid overtime wages for your hours worked from January 17, 2015 to the present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    How do I join the lawsuit?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   If you want to join the lawsuit, fill out the enclosed\n   <em>\n    Consent to Join Lawsuit\n   </em>\n   form and mail, email or fax it back to Mr. Miltenberger's law firm. It must be mailed or received by ____________. A\n   <em>\n    Consent to Join Lawsuit\n   </em>\n   form is enclosed with a self-addressed stamped envelope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    What are my choices?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   If you wish to join the lawsuit, mail in your\n   <em>\n    Consent to Join Lawsuit\n   </em>\n   form by ____________, 2018. If you choose to join in the case, you will be bound by the result in this case, whether it is favorable or unfavorable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   If you do not wish to join the lawsuit, you are free to do nothing. You will not be bound by the outcome, whether favorable or unfavorable. You will not be entitled to recover if Frazier and the Civilian Security Officers win. You can, however, bring your own lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    Can DFW Airport retaliate against me for joining this lawsuit?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   No. Federal law prohibits anyone from discriminating or retaliating against you for taking part in this case and DFW Airport will be required to follow the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    Can I get more details?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   To learn more, you can call Chris Miltenberger, Frazier and the Civilian Security Officers' attorney, at 1-817-416-5060.
