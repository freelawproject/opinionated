Therefore, the effective filing date for the '210 patent is October 12, 2015, the date plaintiff filed the '081 application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   2. Likelihood of Success on the Merits\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   a. Likely Infringement of the '210 Patent\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The court now turns to whether plaintiff has shown that the accused products likely infringe plaintiff's '210 patent. Step one of such an analysis requires the court to determine the meaning and scope of the claims of the '210 patent. Here, the only claims construction dispute between the parties concerns the meaning of the word \"covered\" as found in claim 1 of the '210 patent which requires \"at least one covered recessed vertical channel molded into the interior surface of the front or back wall ...\". ( '210 patent (DE 8-9) col. 4 ll. 36-37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiff asserts, as it does with all of the terms of the patent, that the ordinary meaning of the term should control and that the ordinary meaning of \"cover\" is to \"put something on top of or in front of (something) in order to protect or conceal it.\" (DE 30 at 4 (citing the Oxford Online English Dictionary)). Defendant argues that in this case \"covered\" means \"fully enclosed\" in that the molded channels at issue should be covered when viewed from either the outside or from the inside of the product. (DE 21 at 13 (\"A person skilled in the art would therefore understand a 'covered' recessed channel molded into the interior surface of a pouch to create an enclosed passage or tunnel, through which a bungee cord can be laced.\")).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Defendant's construction is not supported by the ordinary meaning of the terms of claim 1, the specification, or the prosecution history. Nowhere in the patent claims is the term \"covered\" defined, nor are the words \"cover\" or \"covered\" as applied to the channel at issue referenced in the specification. However, claim 1's requirement of \"at least one covered recessed vertical channel\" by its terms does not indicate that such a channel must be \"fully enclosed,\" a phrase inconsistent with the ordinarily understood meaning of the term \"covered.\" The figures in the specification further support this construction. The figures, represented by Figure 3 included above, do not illustrate an enclosed passage or tunnel through which a bungee cord can be laced. The figures only represent\n   a channel that is covered when viewed from the outside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Additionally, as both parties recognize, the parent application to the '210 patent described a \"vertical channel\" without the limitation of being \"covered,\" which was rejected by the PTO as anticipated by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%203%2C053%2C005\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 3,053,005\n   </extracted-citation>\n   which disclosed an uncovered channel. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 24-1 at 1; DE 24-2 at 6). Thereafter, plaintiff added \"covered\" to claim 1, which remained in claim 1 of the '210 patent as issued, but there is no indication in the prosecution history that \"covered\" was inserted to mean \"enclosed.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 24-3). The court agrees with plaintiff, as does defendant, that an \"uncovered channel\" would not literally infringe the '210 patent ; however, that does not mean \"covered\" should be construed to mean \"enclosed\" where such a reading is not supported by the claims, specification, or prosecution history.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Accordingly, for the purposes of deciding the present motion, the court adopts plaintiff's definition that \"covered\" means to \"put something on top of or in front of (something) in order to protect or conceal it,\" as illustrated in the specification figures of the '210 patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Because no other terms are in dispute, the court now compares claim 1 of the '210 patent to defendant's accused products. Defendant argues that its accused products do not infringe the '210 patent because 1) the accused products do not contain a \"covered recessed vertical channel molded into the interior\" of its front or back walls 2) with \"openings on opposite ends.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The patent requires \"at least one covered recessed vertical channel\" in which the \"channel\" is described as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   1) molded into the interior surface of the front or back wall\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   2) between the apertures\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   3) along the perimeter of the front or back wall\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   4) extending longitudinally along the length of the front or back wall\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   5) with\n   <em>\n    openings on opposite ends\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   6) and molded into the front wall or back wall\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   7) ...wherein the front wall and back wall are compressed towards one another using a binding device weaved or laced through the apertures in the perimeter of the front and back wall and the recessed vertical channel and the\n   <em>\n    openings of the vertical channel\n   </em>\n   .\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   ( '210 patent (DE 8-9) col. 4 ll. 36-47)(emphasis added)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Turning to the front of the accused products first and using the term \"covered\" as construed by the court above, there are two vertical channels which are covered but do not have openings on opposite ends. Although plaintiff argues there\n   are a multiplicity of channels extending from the two main vertical channels to the center that do have openings into the vertical channels and the center, those channels are not vertical, are not along the perimeter of the front or back walls, and do not extend longitudinally along the length of the wall and are therefore not \"covered recessed vertical channel molded into the interior\" of the products' front or back walls with \"openings on opposite ends,\" as specifically required by claim 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Turning to the back of the accused products, however, there are two covered recessed vertical channels that fit all of the requirements above. Although defendant argues that these openings are not openings to \"vertical channels\" but are openings to a \"product-wide recess,\" (DE 21 at 15), the court finds that these \"recesses\" satisfies all of the above descriptions of a \"vertical channel\" with \"openings on opposite ends\" and provide a way \"wherein the front wall and back wall are compressed towards one another using a binding device weaved or laced through the apertures in the perimeter of the front and back wall and the recessed vertical channel and the openings of the vertical channel.\" ( '210 patent (DE 8-9) col. 4 ll. 36-47). As indicated by the specification, the \"channels\" described by the patent can be of various shapes and sizes, as found on the back of defendant's accused products. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%203%2C053%2C005\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   col. 3 ll. 31-32 (\"[t]he vertical channels 70 and at least one horizontal channel 80 aid in retaining the binding device\"); Figure 3 (depicting vertical channels 70 and horizontal channel 80)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In sum, plaintiff has forecasted sufficient evidence to show it will likely prove that defendant's accused products infringe the '210 patent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   b.

In order for these publications to be considered prior art under the Patent Act, they must be published more than one year before the earliest effective filing date of the '210 Patent. 35 U.S.C. 102(b). Because the court has determined that the effective filing date for the '210 patent is October 12, 2015, the publications cited by defendant are to be considered prior art for the purposes of this obviousness analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The two publications cited by defendant were published by plaintiff on its Facebook page and on the website called Soldier Systems under \"Sneak Peak,\" and contain pictures of radio pouches designed by plaintiff which defendant argues disclose plaintiff's design for recessed channels molded into the face of an expandable tactical gear pouch. (DE 21 at 19-21). An example of one such picture is reproduced below:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   (DE 21 at 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   After offering the above publications, defendant states \"[a]s explained in the Declaration of Mr. Storms, it would have been obvious, given the state of the art at the time, to combine the vertical channels disclosed by [plaintiff] ... with the channels and walls in the well-established Taco pouch products.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21).

Defendant then states, again without elaboration, that such a combination \"would clearly meet every limitation of Claim 1 in the '210 patent.\" (DE 21 at 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Defendant offers no reason why a person of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to combine the prior art referenced, would have had a reasonable expectation of success in doing so, or how such a combination would meet every limitation of claim 1 of the '210 patent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Metalcraft of Mayville, Inc. v.

However, the information provided does not allow the court to estimate the likely extent of plaintiff's injury relative to the size of the company even taking into account the \"snowball effect\" discussed by plaintiff wherein each sale lost to a competitor implicates not just the revenue from that sale, but the revenue from many future sales of potentially multiple types of products.

Plaintiff argues that it is \"well-known as an innovator in the tactical gear industry,\" has been \"granted several patents covering its Scorpion line of products,\" (DE 8 at 20), and offers in support of this position an article from 2002 describing\n   plaintiff as the \"most innovative of the bunch\" of kydex holster makers, (DE 8-3) and to a more recent article describing the launch of plaintiff's Scorpion line of pouches which includes comments by readers such as \"Scott and his crew run a truly first class operation-they put lots of thought and operator input behind everything they do and this looks like it's going to be (yet another) winner from them,\" (DE 8-5). The court finds plaintiff has offered sufficient evidence of a \"reputation as an innovator.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   However, plaintiff must still demonstrate that it will likely suffers irreparable reputation harm absent an injunction, and that there is a causal nexus between that harm and defendant's infringement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Apple\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4059795\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/633/\">\n    809 F.3d at 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The causal nexus requirement ensures that an injunction is only entered against a defendant on account of a harm resulting from the defendant's wrongful conduct, not some other reason.\"). In support of its contention of harm, plaintiff argues that defendant's \"advertisements and promotions surrounding its infringing Polymer Taco suggest that it is HSG, not Edge-Works, who is the innovator.\" (DE 8 at 20-21). In addition to the articles cited above, plaintiff cites to defendant's website which states plaintiff's Polymer Taco is patented, (DE 8-11 (\"[o]ur patented line of polymer TACOs\u00ae function much the same as their nylon counterparts\")),\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   and to a Solder System's article stating defendant's Polymer Taco \"revolutionizes\" the magazine carrier market, (DE 8-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Of significance are the comments made in response to the online articles by consumers indicating that consumers, although not confused by who made which product, believe either plaintiff or defendant or both are engaged in copying the other's products and have been for some time.

The evidence shows that the parties' disagreement as to who is the innovator in the field and who has copied which product is an ongoing debate that did not begin with the release of defendant's accused products. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , DE 8-12 at 5 (\"Actually, the fact is G Code was the co-inventor and assisted Gene with the development of the 'Taco' about eight years ago.

There the court held that the district court \"made a clear error in judgment in its analysis\" of reputation loss, holding that although there was no evidence that interested consumers confused the two companies, harm could still occur, \"particularly its perception in the marketplace by customers, dealers, and distributors,\" where, for example, 1) \"customers found the same 'innovations' appearing in\" products of the competitors, \"particularly products considered less prestigious and innovative\"; 2) where defendant's expert agreed that plaintiff's reputation would be damaged if the industry believed plaintiff \"did not enforce its intellectual property rights\"; 3) where the evidence showed plaintiff intentionally never licensed its patents to maintain market exclusivity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3576874\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/1336/#p1344\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   First, although it appears customers may find the same \"innovations\" appearing in both plaintiff's and defendant's products, as evidenced by the comments found on the websites submitted by plaintiff, no evidence has been provided that defendant's products are considered less prestigious and innovative. Second, plaintiff argues, but provides no evidence, that the industry will believe plaintiff does not enforce its intellectual property rights absent an injunction, but the court finds this argument insufficient. This allegation, without more support, applies to every patent case where a patentee seeks a preliminary injunction against a competitor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Third, no evidence has been provided that plaintiff intentionally never licensed its patents to maintain market exclusivity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Douglas\n   </em>\n   court also stated that \"[w]here two companies are in competition against one another, the patentee suffers the harm-often irreparable-of being forced to compete against products that incorporate and infringe its own patented inventions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3576874\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/1336/#p1344\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As previously stated, although it appears clear that the parties are in competition with each other, plaintiff has offered no evidence in support of the extent of that competition in order for the court to determine irreparable harm is likely to occur or that monetary damages are inadequate, thereby justifying the remedy of a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Therefore, this court concludes that plaintiff has failed to carry its burden that it has suffered irreparable harm, as necessary to justify the imposition of the extraordinary relief of a preliminary injunction. Because the court finds that plaintiff cannot establish\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   likelihood of success\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   irreparable harm, plaintiff cannot be granted a preliminary injunction, and it is unnecessary for the court to analyze the balance of hardships and the impact of a potential injunction on the public interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Polymer Technologies, Inc. v.

Defendant disagrees, arguing that the PTO \"has recognized HSG as an innovator in the field, issuing a patent that covers the Accused Products.\" (DE 21 at 24 (citing U.S. patent no. 9,759,536 (DE 22-1) issued September 12, 2017)). The issue as to whether defendant's patent covers its accused products is not currently before the court and therefore will not be resolved by the court at this time.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"22\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    Defendant references this ongoing dispute, stating in its brief that, \"[i]n an ironic twist, Edge-Works now accuses HSG of infringing Edge-Works so-called 'inventions,' which are simply its copy of HSG's famous TACO.\" (DE 21 at 6).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"23\">\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    For a similar reason, the court rejects plaintiff's unsupported argument that defendant's infringement has caused plaintiff to lose brand distinctiveness in that \"HSG is Edge-Works' only competitor to have implemented its version of Edge-Works' channel system.\" (DE 8 at 22). Like plaintiff's argument concerning enforcement of its intellectual property rights, this argument applies to many patent case where a patentee seeks a preliminary injunction against a competitor. Factual support is needed beyond the argument that defendant and only defendant has sold allegedly infringing products such as evidence that the parties are direct competitors or other evidence that would allow the court to infer loss of brand distinctiveness.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"24\">\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    Because plaintiff has filed with the court its November 13, 2017, confirmatory patent assignment which assigns the '210 patent and all related patent right from Evans to Edge-Works (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    DE 30-3), confirmation of the recording of the assignment document with the PTO (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    DE 30-4), and affidavit of service showing plaintiff personally served defendant with paper copies of the summons and complaint (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    DE 27), it is unnecessary for the court to address defendant's arguments concerning these issues.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
