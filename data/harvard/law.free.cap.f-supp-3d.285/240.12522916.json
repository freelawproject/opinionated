Plaintiffs request that the Court reinstate their complaint as to Al Shamal and provide them with ninety days to complete service, or face dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons explained below, the Court will grant plaintiffs' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 17, 2015, plaintiffs filed a complaint against two banks, BNP Paribas, S.A. (BNPP) and Al Shamal, alleging that BNPP, Sudan, Al Shamal, and al Qaeda conspired to defeat economic sanctions imposed by the United States on Sudan in 1997. Plaintiffs alleged that the 1998 terrorist attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were carried out in furtherance of that conspiracy. They brought claims against BNPP and Al Shamal under (1) the civil liability provision of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202333\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , (2) the Alien Tort Statute (ATS),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201350\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and (3) for various common law torts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   BNPP was served, and moved to dismiss the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Stipulation and Proposed Scheduling Order [ECF No. 5] \u00b6 1; BNPP's Mot. to Dismiss [ECF No. 13]. On September 29, 2017, the Court dismissed all claims against BNPP for failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 29, 2017 Mem. Op. &amp; Order [ECF Nos. 30 &amp; 31]. The Court also dismissed without prejudice all claims against Al Shamal because plaintiffs \"have not filed an affidavit of service establishing that Al Shamal has been served with the complaint in this action, which was filed nearly two years ago, and they [had] not informed the Court of any efforts they have taken to serve Al Shamal.\" Sept. 29, 2017 Mem. Op. at 2 n.1;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Order at 1. Thereafter, plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of the Court's dismissal of their claims against BNPP,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and concurrently moved to vacate the dismissal without prejudice of their claims against Al Shamal.

Mot. to Vacate at 4, 6-7. True, courts have held that an order of dismissal without prejudice may operate as a final order where the statute of limitations had run on the underlying claim at the time the claim was dismissed, thereby barring the plaintiff from refiling the claim.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Solis v.

But here, plaintiffs only contend that they will be barred from re-filing a subset of their claims (i.e., the common law claims); indeed, they assert that their ATA and ATS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   claims do not expire until June 30, 2024.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n to Mot. to Dismiss [ECF No. 19] at 15.

Rule 60 is therefore not the proper vehicle for plaintiffs to seek relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court will instead construe plaintiffs' motion as one for reconsideration under Rule 54(b). A court may revise its own interlocutory orders \"at any time before the entry of a judgment adjudicating all the claims and all the parties' rights and liabilities.\" Fed. R. Civ.

Here, the Court dismissed without prejudice the claims again Al Shamal because nearly two years had passed since the complaint was filed and the record contained no evidence that plaintiffs had made any attempt to serve Al Shamal.

Though dismissal without prejudice was appropriate based on the record before the Court when it considered the issue, plaintiffs have now provided the Court with significant new facts and demonstrated that they will be harmed absent reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   To begin with, plaintiffs have for the first time informed the Court of steps they took to serve Al Shamal, beginning shortly after they filed the complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pls.' Mot. to Vacate at 2-3. Specifically, plaintiffs' counsel identified and corresponded with an American lawyer, Martin McMahon, who had represented Al Shamal in prior U.S.-based litigation relating to the September 11 terrorist attacks. Approximately two weeks after filing the complaint, plaintiffs' counsel sent a letter to Mr. McMahon asking if he would be willing to accept service on behalf of Al Shamal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 28, 2016, Mr. McMahon responded that he was in the process of being hired to represent Al Shamal in this action, and he asked plaintiffs for an extension of time to respond to the complaint in the event that he was retained. Plaintiffs' counsel last followed up with Mr. McMahon on April 13, 2016, to inquire whether he had been retained by Al Shamal and to again ask whether he would accept service. Mr. McMahon responded that he was resolving an issue concerning retainer terms, and indicated that he would accept service if retained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs' initial efforts to effect service through Mr. McMahon, as opposed to other avenues, appear reasonable in light of the circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court is, however, troubled by plaintiffs' lengthy period of inactivity after this initial push-plaintiffs apparently made no further effort to follow up with Mr. McMahon after April 2016, and have not otherwise attempted to serve Al Shamal over the last twenty months. By letting this lead go cold, plaintiffs may have hindered the prospect of serving Al Shamal through U.S. counsel. But ultimately, the Court concludes that plaintiffs have shown at least a \"reasonable prospect that service can be obtained.\"\n   <em>\n    Novak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3642584,1851447\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/703/1305/\">\n    703 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1310 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith-Bey v.

Op. &amp; Order [ECF Nos. 37 &amp; 38].\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Plaintiffs contend that the statute of limitations did not begin to run on their claims until June 30, 2014-the date on which BNPP's guilty plea was made public.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pls.' Opp'n to Mot. to Dismiss at 12-15. The Court did not need to resolve the statute of limitations is sue to decide BNPP's motion to dismiss.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Sept. 29, 2017 Mem. Op. at 34 n.25. Here, the Court will assume, without deciding, that plaintiffs' position is correct.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Plaintiffs' failure to bring these facts to the Court's attention earlier may be excused, in part, based on the fact that the Court dismissed the claims against Al Shamal\n    <em>\n     sua sponte\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    The letter included a copy of the complaint and a waiver of service form pursuant to Rule 4(d). Pls.' Mot. to Vacate at 2.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Plaintiffs indicate that they focused on serving Mr. McMahon rather than trying other \"complex, expensive, and burdensome\" alternatives because Sudan's laws with respect to service are unclear, and they anticipated that Mr. McMahon would accept service on Al Shamal. Pls.' Mot. to Vacate at 2, 8.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    It is unclear to the Court where in the complaint plaintiffs have pled a negligence claim against Al Shamal. Moreover, the complaint indicates that the fraudulent conveyance claim(which plaintiffs recast as a claim for tortious interference with economic advantage) applies only to BNPP.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl. [ECF No. 1] at 75.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Indeed, Mr. McMahon's correspondence with plaintiffs suggests that Al Shamal is aware of this action,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Ex.3, Pls.' Mot. to Vacate [ECF No. 34-3] at 2, and hence Al Shamal \"will not be subjected to any unfair surprise or prejudice.\"\n    <em>\n     Iskandar v.
