ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendants oppose the plaintiff's motion for leave to again amend his complaint on the grounds that (1) the plaintiff failed to earlier cure deficiencies in his complaint, (2) undue delay and prejudice, and (3) futility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp'n at 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Plaintiff's Failure to Earlier Cure Deficiencies Argument\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In their written opposition, the defendants argue that the Court should deny the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend because he does not explain \"why he failed to include the [proposed] amendments ... in his previously filed Complaints.\" Defs.' Opp'n at 4. The defendants note that at the status conference held on August 31, 2017, the Court ordered the plaintiff to file his third amended complaint on or before September 22, 2017,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Order (Aug. 31, 2017), ECF No. 40, which the plaintiff did, but \"[i]n that Complaint, [the p]laintiff brought no new claims,\" even though \"there was nothing that prevented [him] from bringing his proposed new claims,\" Defs.' Opp'n at 5. According to the defendants, \"by his own admission, [the p]laintiff relies on facts known to him or that should have been known to him when he sought to cure the original [Complaint] and Second Amended Complaint[ ].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The plaintiff argues in response that, as of the date he filed his reply on November 28, 2017, the \"[d]efendants ha[d] not responded to most of th[e] discovery\" the plaintiff had submitted to them, but that recent discovery has revealed the actions that defendant Cipullo took \"under the authority of his position with the [ ] Superior Court,\" which prompted the plaintiff's request to pursue the proposed constitutional claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply at 4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 (\"[D]iscovery is ongoing, and [the plaintiff] seeks leave to amend the complaint to conform to information learned in discovery so that the case may be tried on its merits.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the motion hearing, the plaintiff clarified that the deposition of MPD Commander William J. Fitzgerald, which was taken on October 17, 2017,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply, Exhibit (\"Ex.\") 1 (Transcript of Commander William J. Fitzgerald (\"Fitzgerald Dep.\")), revealed how defendant Cipullo allegedly used the color of his office to have the plaintiff arrested and charged, and the plaintiff promptly filed his motion for leave less than three weeks later,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. at 1. The defendants argued in response that Commander Fitzgerald's deposition did not reveal any new facts, but was based upon documents that the plaintiff already had in his possession, because Commander Fitzgerald did not have an independent recollection of the relevant events. The defendants, however, did not submit those documents to the Court to support their assertion that the plaintiff's proposed Fourth Amended Complaint \"relies on facts known to him or that should have been known to him when he sought to cure the original [Complaint] and Second Amended Complaint[ ].\" Defs.' Opp'n at 5. Therefore, the Court is unable to evaluate their assertion that the plaintiff already knew the facts forming the basis for his constitutional claims, and thus, the defendants have failed to meet their burden \"to show that leave to file an amended complaint should be denied\" on this basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Afram\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3831504\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/958/275/#p278\">\n    958 F.Supp.2d at 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, even if the plaintiff already knew or should have known about the relevant facts that purportedly support his constitutional claims, the defendants are unable to show any undue prejudice resulting from the filing of another amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   Part III.B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Undue Delay and Undue Prejudice to the Defendants Argument\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The defendants claim that they will be \"unfair[ly] disadvantage[d]\" and \"blindside[d\n   ]\" if the Court grants the plaintiff's motion because they will \"have to expend additional efforts and resources\" to address the proposed Fourth Amended Complaint and they \"seek closure\" in this case, which \"has been pending for just over two years.\" Defs.' Opp'n at 6. The defendants fail to cite\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   legal authority to support their proposition that the plaintiff's motion should be denied on these bases. The plaintiff argues in response to the defendants' position that \"[m]oving to amend the complaint before the close of discovery does not constitute undue delay[, and u]nder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(b), a party may amend the complaint to conform to the evidence at trial or even after trial.\" Pl.'s Reply at 6 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b) ). Moreover, the plaintiff claims that his amendments will\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   \"delay this case in any way,\" Pl.'s Mem. at 2, and at the hearing on the motion for leave to amend, the plaintiff's counsel stated that he would not seek additional discovery if he is permitted to assert the plaintiff's new claims. Moreover, the defendants do not contend that additional discovery will be necessary either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Courts liberally assess whether Rule 15 motions should be granted, only denying them on the basis of undue delay when the plaintiffs waited\n   <em>\n    many\n   </em>\n   years before seeking amendments,\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   discovery had already concluded or summary judgment had already been granted.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Williamsburg Wax Museum, Inc. v.

Therefore, a two-year delay between the plaintiff's initiation of this suit and his motion for leave to amend does not constitute undue delay, especially given that discovery was still ongoing as of the date the plaintiff filed his motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As for the defendants' argument regarding their need to \"expend additional efforts and resources\" if the plaintiff's motion is granted,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp'n at 6, Judge Friedman recently rejected a similar argument in a case that had been pending for over four years, noting:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \"Undue prejudice is not mere harm to the non-movant but a denial of the opportunity to present facts or evidence which would have been offered had the amendment been timely.\"\n   <em>\n    Does I through III v.

Indeed, \"if [a] court were\n   to employ a policy of denying [ ] leave to amend in every situation where an amended [pleading] may result in additional discovery or expense, then [the] court would fail to abide by the legal standard of granting leave 'freely ... when justice so requires.' \"\n   <em>\n    Hisler v.

The Court, however, finds that the plaintiff's proposed claims based on violations of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as his \u00a7 1983 claim against the District of Columbia, would be futile, and thus, denies the plaintiff leave to assert those claims. Finally, the Court cannot conclude, based on the record currently before it, that the plaintiff's proposed claims alleging that defendant Cipullo violated his Fourth Amendment rights, whether under \u00a7 1983 or\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   , are futile.
