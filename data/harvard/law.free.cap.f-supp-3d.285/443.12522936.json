During the thirteen-day trial, the government presented evidence that Wright conspired with several individuals, including his uncle, Usaamah Abdullah Rahim (\"Rahim\"), co-defendant Nicholas Rovinski (\"Rovinski\"), and others to support the Islamic\n    State of Iraq and Syria (\"ISIS\"). The government contended that Wright recruited Rahim and Rovinski in efforts to organize a terrorist cell in Massachusetts. Evidence showed that the group initially planned to join ISIS in Syria, but then changed course when ISIS issued a fatwa against American journalist Pamela Geller (\"Geller\"). Rovinski testified that, at that point, Wright, Rahim, and Rovinski conspired to behead Geller pursuant to that fatwa. Much of their planning, communication, and recruiting efforts took place via the internet, where Wright distributed ISIS propaganda, researched various weapons, managed a Twitter account advocating pro-ISIS beliefs, and chatted with other ISIS supporters. One of these individuals, Zulfi Hoxha (\"Hoxha\"), was an individual living in the United States whom Wright successfully encouraged to travel to Syria and join ISIS. Other individuals with whom Rahim communicated included an individual seemingly located in Turkey whose online moniker was \"abu3antar\" (\"Abu Antar\"), as well as a shadowy individual who operated numerous Twitter accounts under the name \"Abu Hussain al-Britani\" (\"Abu Hussain\"). Evidence was presented showing that this second individual was in fact Junaid Hussain, an ISIS member in Syria.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    On the morning of June 2, 2015, Rahim called Wright and told him that he planned to attack law enforcement officers on behalf of ISIS. Wright encouraged Rahim to do so, instructing him to destroy his electronic devices before the attack. Shortly thereafter, Rahim attacked several police officers in a Roslindale parking lot and was killed. After learning of this incident, Wright erased the data on his computer by restoring it to its original factory settings. Law enforcement officers arrested Wright later that day, searched his home, and conducted a lengthy interview with him.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    The jury convicted Wright on all counts. Wright moved to set aside the verdict and ordered a new trial on November 2, 2017. Def. Wright's Mot. New Trial (\"Def.'s Mot.\"), ECF. No. 393. The government opposed the motion. Gov't Opp'n Def.'s Mot. (\"Gov't Opp'n\"), ECF No. 395. This Court DENIED the motion on December 18, 2017. Electronic Order, ECF No. 407.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    <strong>\n     II. PRE-TRIAL RULING\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    Prior to trial, the government sought to introduce the certified conviction in a court of the United Kingdom (U.K.) of one Junaid Hussain of \"Causing [a] Computer to Perform [a] Function with Intent to Secure Unauthorized Access\" in the United Kingdom to support the inference that this British citizen is Abu Hussain, a U.K. born terrorist and \"hacker,\" who assisted Wright with the alleged terrorist plot, and the subject of a telephone call between Wright and Rahim on May 26, 2015. Gov't's Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. in Lim. Exclude Crim. Conviction of Junaid Hussain 1 (\"Gov't's Opp'n Mot. Lim.\"), ECF No. 260.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    Wright moved in limine to exclude the criminal conviction of Junaid Hussain on the grounds that no exception to the rule against hearsay applied. Def.'s Mot. in Lim. Exclude Crim. Conviction of Junaid Hussain 1 (\"Def.'s Mot. Lim.\"), ECF No. 250. Specifically, Wright contended: (i) Federal Rule of Evidence 803(22) is the only exception under which this Court could admit the foreign conviction of Junaid Hussain, and (ii) the foreign conviction of Junaid Hussain is not a public record within the meaning of Federal Rule of Evidence 803(8). Def.'s Mot. Lim. 2. In response, the government argued that the conviction of Junaid Hussain was admissible under either Rule 803(8) as a public record or Federal Rule of Evidence 807, the residual exception to the rule against\n    hearsay. Gov't's Opp'n Mot. Lim. 1. There was no dispute that Junaid Hussain's conviction was properly authenticated. Def.'s Mot. Lim. 1.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    This Court DENIED the motion on September 15, 2017, Electronic Order, ECF No. 318, and will explain its ruling below.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    <strong>\n     A. Rule 803(22) is not a Rule of Exclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    Rule 803(22) provides that \"[e]vidence of a final judgment of conviction\" is not excluded by the rule against hearsay, regardless of whether the declarant is available as a witness, if, among other requirements, \"(C) the evidence is admitted to prove any fact essential to the judgment; and (D) when offered by the prosecutor in a criminal case for a purpose other than impeachment, the judgment was against the defendant.\" Fed. R. Evid. 803(22).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Both parties appear to agree that Rule 803(22) does not apply here.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Mot. Lim. 1 (stating that the conviction is not against the defendant); Gov't's Opp'n Mot. Lim. 1 (implicitly conceding the inapplicability of Rule 803(22) by arguing that Rule 803(8) or Rule 807 applies instead). Therefore, the only issue left here is whether the inapplicability of Rule 803(22) excludes the application of other hearsay exceptions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Without citing any authorities, Wright argues that Rule 803(22) is \"[t]he only possible vehicle for the admission\" of prior convictions and because Rule 803(22)\"on its face excludes third party convictions,\" Junaid Hussain's conviction is inadmissible.

Def.'s Mot. Lim. 2. In\n    <em>\n     $125,938.62\n    </em>\n    , the government introduced the defendants' prior foreign conviction to show facts described in the conviction in addition to the conviction itself.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4130893\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/537/1287/\">\n     537 F.3d at 1290\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

In addition, the foreign nature of the conviction in\n    <em>\n     $125,938.62\n    </em>\n    was not the reason that Rule 803(8) did not apply.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4130893\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/537/1287/\">\n     537 F.3d at 1292\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Such evidence was sufficient for the Court to conclude that Wright more likely than not participated in a conspiracy to provide material support to ISIS with Abu Hussain, Abu Antar, and Hoxha. For example, the government presented evidence that Wright, Rahim, and Rovinski planned to kill Geller in allegiance to ISIS,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    9/21/17 Trial Tr. at 10:7-16, 17:9-21:23, and encouraged and assisted Hoxha's travel to Syria,\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 37:14-39:5, Exs. 57, 317, 379.

Though Wright claims that \"undisputed\" evidence showed that he had never personally met or spoken to Abu Hussain and Abu Antar, Def.'s Mot. 2-3, the fact that Wright may not personally have known these individuals does not compel the conclusion that no conspiracy existed. Knowledge of every other coconspirator and every detail of the conspiracy is not a prerequisite to coconspirator statement admissibility.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Cruz-Rodriguez\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3753021\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/541/19/#p28\">\n     541 F.3d 19\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 28 (1st Cir. 2008) (observing that conspiracy may be proven \"\n    <em>\n     without\n    </em>\n    showing that (1) each conspirator knew of or had contact with all other members; (2) each conspirator knew of all the details of the conspiracy or participated in every act in furtherance of it; or (3) the conspiratorial 'cast of characters' remained intact throughout the duration of the entire enterprise\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Second, Wright claims that many of the Rule 801(d)(2)(E) statements regarding travel to Syria were inadmissible because they were \"untethered\" to the specific conspiracies charged or \"suggested\" by the government, which (as Wright asserts) relate only to activities planned within the borders of the United States.

In\n    <em>\n     Piper\n    </em>\n    , the charged conspiracy involved an agreement to distribute drugs supplied by the defendant. In this context, the First Circuit explained, a conversation between the distributor and an undercover agent indicating \"an attempt to persuade [the agent] to purchase drugs from a source other than the [defendant]\" was not in furtherance of and in fact was \"antithetic to\" the charged conspiracy.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11448285\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/298/47/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11448285\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/298/47/\">\n     at 55\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Wright argues that any plan to travel to Syria is likewise \"an unrelated venture\" that is separate from the charged conspiracies and thus cannot support the statements' admissibility. Def.'s Mot. 6. The Court disagreed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Though the Court notes that statements may be admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(E)\"regardless of whether the conspiracy furthered is charged or uncharged,\"\n    <em>\n     United States\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Lara\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11658821\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/181/183/#p196\">\n     181 F.3d 183\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 196 (1st Cir. 1999), it need not address any potential uncharged conspiracy because\n    the statements here were clearly related to and in furtherance of the conspiracies charged. Statements relating to the planned travel to Syria, unlike the inadmissible statements in\n    <em>\n     Piper\n    </em>\n    , were not \"designed to frustrate\" the conspiracy to provide material support to ISIS.\n    <em>\n     Piper\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11448285\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/298/47/\">\n     298 F.3d at 55\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . On the contrary, traveling to Syria to join ISIS quite naturally advances such a conspiracy. Further, the First Circuit has explained that the \"essential purpose\" of a conspiracy may encompass different means and methods over time.\n    <em>\n     United States\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Mehanna\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723085\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/735/32/#p56\">\n     735 F.3d 32\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 56 (1st Cir. 2013) (concluding that a conspiracy's shift in focus \"from Pakistan to domestic attacks and then to Yemen did not rob it of its essential purpose: waging jihad against the United States\"). Here, the \"essential purpose\" of Wright's agreement with his co-conspirators-to provide material support to ISIS-remained the same, even if the means of providing that support changed over time. Whether the conspirators were planning to travel overseas to join ISIS, or plotting to commit an attack on Geller in the United States, they were serving the same basic purpose of providing material support to ISIS. Thus, the statements about traveling to Syria are admissible nonhearsay.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Third, Wright argued that the statements offered by the government and admitted under Rule 801(d)(2)(E) all occurred outside of the conspiracy's duration. According to Wright, the conspiracy began \"for purposes of Rule 801\" on May 6, 2015, when ISIS issued the order to kill Geller, and ended on June 2, 2015, the day he was arrested and spoke with the FBI. Def.'s Mot. 6. Any statements made before or after that time period, Wright claims, could therefore not have been made \"during\" the conspiracy and are inadmissible.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 7.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The argument as to statements made prior to May 2015 has no merit for the same reasons as those stated above. Evidence at trial showed that Wright and Rahim had discussed providing support to ISIS as early as June 2014,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Ex. 5, and though the means of that support may have evolved over time, these statements related to the same \"essential purpose\" as later statements-providing aid to ISIS. They accordingly do not \"predate the formation of the relevant conspiracy\" and are admissible.\n    <em>\n     Mehanna\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723085\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/735/32/#p56\">\n     735 F.3d at 57\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Statements made after June 2, 2015 were also admissible because the mere facts of Wright's arrest and confession of certain activities to the FBI did not terminate the conspiracy.

Further, the government introduced prison letters sent to Wright by Rovinski in August 2015, the contents of which tend to show that Wright had not communicated his affirmative disavowal of the conspiracy.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    9/21/17 Trial Tr. at 62, Exs. 73-74. Though Wright argues that he \"neither spoke nor acted in furtherance of the conspiracy\n    after the date of his arrest,\" Def.'s Mot. 7, that lack of action does not suffice. As a result, statements made through August 2015 were made during the course of the conspiracy and were admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(E).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Fourth and lastly, Wright argued that none of the Rule 801(d)(2)(E) statements were made in furtherance of the conspiracy because the statements failed to \"advance the objectives of the charged conspiracy to kill in the United States.\" Def.'s Mot. 8. In particular, Wright points to several of Abu Hussain's Twitter postings, such as those in which Abu Hussain refers to a \"CyberCaliphate\" and a potential drone strike, one statement in which he announces, \"I'm back again Obama,\"\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Ex. 400, and his statements commenting on Rahim's death,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Ex. 119.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    The determination of whether a coconspirator's statement is in furtherance of the conspiracy is, like the determination of the existence of a conspiracy, a \"preliminary question of fact ... resolved by the trial judge\" who must apply a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard.\n    <em>\n     Piper\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11448285\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/298/47/\">\n     298 F.3d at 54\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

The First Circuit has affirmed this finding where the statements at issue \"were seemingly made for such purposes as recruiting new members into the conspiracy or passing information between conspirators.\"\n    <em>\n     United States\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Shea\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1743224\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/211/658/#p668\">\n     211 F.3d 658\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 668 (1st Cir. 2000). Here, Abu Hussain's Twitter postings all appear designed to advance the conspiracy's objectives, recruit new members, or promote the Twitter account itself (which in turn helps to promote the conspiracy and recruit members). These goals are particularly apparent in the statements posted after Rahim's death, in which Abu Hussain explains that Rahim's plan was to behead Geller, wishes for his martyrdom, and provides an address for Geller along with the direction to \"GoForth.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Exs. 119-20.

Def.'s Mot. at 13.

Third, he argued that the Court erred when \"it instructed the jury that overseas 'conduct' can mean mere communication and when it refused to instruct the jury that the Defendant needed to intend that the killing involve overseas conduct to support a conviction,\" with regards to Count 4.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 9.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The Court will address each argument in turn.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    <strong>\n     1.

And the government alleges that the support is planning to murder Pamela Geller, murder police officers and other people, constitute themselves as a martyrdom cell and a conspiratorial cell within our society.

And there's got to be-what they do-and again this is all part of this terrorist connection, what they plan to do has-the specific language I want to use is that it has to be \"conduct done in coordination with or at the direction of the foreign terrorist organization.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n    Now the coordination-and the reason that the government has to prove that is to prevent, um, the law from applying some random act, just a random act of violence and then ISIS latches onto that and says, \"Oh, yeah, those were our soldiers,\" or something like that. They have to-the conspiracy has got to be, um, cognizant of and acting in coordination-it doesn't have to be direct orders, but in coordination with the strategy, the tactics of the foreign terrorist organization, in this case ISIS.

Second, they have to prove-and the specific intent here, the specific intent is different, but they've got to prove specific intent, they've got to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. Here the specific\n    intent has got to be to commit acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n    Now the government has additional things to prove in this Number 2 and here's what they are. It's not just some general crime that could perhaps help ISIS, its [sic] specific crimes and here they are.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n    Under the law the plan has got to be, um, it punishes someone who kills, kidnaps, maims, commits an assault resulting in serious bodily injury or assaults with a dangerous weapon to any person within the United States, those are the crimes. Now of course conspiracy doesn't mean that the people did those things, the conspiracy means that they've got to be planning to do one or more of those specific crimes.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n    Second, because it requires, um, transcending national boundaries, in this one there has to be conduct that they're planning within the United States, the conspirators, and there also has to be conduct outside the United States, somewhere, anywhere outside the national boundaries of the United States. The conduct? Now the conduct can be communication of some sort, encouragement, direction, but it's got to be conduct outside the United States.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n    Third-and so you see for this one somebody in connection with ISIS has got to know something about these three folks or this cell and there has to be some sort of connection there, the government's got to prove, because, as Congress used the language, this has to be the type of terrorism that transcends national boundaries.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n    Now one or more members of the conspiracy, and the government says the conspiracy is at least Wright, Rahim, and Rovinski, they've got to know about the foreign, um, communication, or direction, or encouragement, or the foreign conduct related to what they're doing, and it doesn't mean that Wright has to know specifically because you see if one is a conspirator, not every conspirator has to know everything every other conspirator is doing. Conspiracy is like a partnership and if one of the-once they're a partnership, the things that the partners do in furtherance of the conspiracy is attributed to all the partners. But at least they've got to show that Wright was-that Wright himself, the person who's on trial here, that he reasonably understood that he was engaged in a conspiracy to do conduct that transcends national boundaries, that has this terrorist connection as I've just defined it to you.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n    And then lastly for this one, not for Question 1, which only requires the conspiracy, the plotting, but for Question 2, the government has to prove that one of the conspirators, at least one of the conspirators, actually did something, did something to make the conspiracy come about. We call it the \"overt act,\" but that's legal talk. You don't need that. You just need to know it's not enough that they plot it, it's not enough that they conspired in all the manner that I've described, but then one of the conspirators, at least one has to do something to make the conspiracy come about.

Title 18 of the United States Code, section 2332b(g) defines \"conduct transcending national boundaries\" as \"conduct occurring outside of the United States in addition to\n    the conduct occurring in the United States.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332b(g). As such, the conduct that occurred overseas is not required to be criminal. Here, there was evidence to show that Rahim communicated with Abu Hussain, an ISIS member located in Syria, about killing Geller. During trial, Wright admitted that Abu Hussain gave Rahim an encrypted document related to Geller's beheading. 10/12/17 Trial Tr. at 49-50. Therefore, the government proved that there was conduct transcending national boundaries, as defined in section 2332b(g).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    In addition, Wright argued that the instructions did not properly reflect the government's burden of proving that Wright intended that the killing involve overseas conduct to support a conviction under Count 4, in accordance with section 2332b.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Mot. 11. The Court did in fact instruct the jury that the government had the burden of proving that the conspirators specifically intended to \"commit acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries\" and that Wright \"reasonably understood that he was engaged in a conspiracy to do conduct that transcends national boundaries.\" 10/17/17 Trial Tr. at 30-32.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Nevertheless, a plain reading of the statute suggests that there is no mens rea requirement for the government to prove. The phrase \"involving conduct transcending national boundaries\" is a jurisdictional element that makes the defendant liable under the specific statute, as opposed to any other criminal statute. Furthermore, an analysis of the legislative history of section 2332b also supports the notion that the phrase is a jurisdictional element, rather than a substantive conduct element with a mens rea. The Conference Report on the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which enacted section 2332b, states in relevant part that \"[t]here will be federal jurisdiction [if]... at least part of the conduct occurred outside of the United States.\" H.R.

He claimed that \"the evidence that the agreed-upon killing involved overseas conduct lacked probative force.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1478078\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/691/39/#p42\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    This argument lacked merit. The evidence presented at trial showed that Wright and his coconspirators knew that the conspiracy involved conduct that transcended national boundaries. The government proved that Wright and his coconspirators were in communication with multiple people overseas who were part of ISIS.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    <strong>\n     1. Evidence that Wright Spoke to the \"Mujahideen\"\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    The government presented substantial evidence that Wright and his coconspirators were in communication with people overseas. Wright admitted to an FBI cooperator that he and his coconspirators had spoken to ISIS fighters in Syria, otherwise known as the \"Mujahideen.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Ex. 51. Wright told the FBI cooperator that the \"Mujahideen\" in Syria had told them that they could not release the names and addresses of other ISIS fighters located in the United States.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1478078\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/691/39/#p42\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    <strong>\n     2. Rahim's Contacts Abroad\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Wright also acknowledged to the FBI that \"Rahim did in fact have a contact overseas following his pledging bayah to the Islamic State or allegiance to the Islamic State.\" 9/25/17 Trial Tr. at 16. The evidence showed that Rahim had been in contact with people located overseas-Abu Antar and Abu Hussain.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Exs. 356,\n    377-79. According to the messages between Abu Antar and Rahim, Rahim asked Abu Antar for help traveling overseas and joining ISIS.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Ex. 356, 9/28/17 Trial Tr. at 32-33. Abu Antar gave Rahim a phone number with a Turkey country code to call.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1478078\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/691/39/#p42\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Rahim contacted Abu Hussain directly at around the same time as he communicated with Abu Antar. 9/28/17 Trial Tr. at 30-34.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    Based on an ISIS book that Wright, Rovinski, and Rahim shared with each other, the person who used Abu Hussain's Twitter account lived overseas \"in the Islamic State.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Ex. 214 at 98. The postings on the account and other evidence confirmed that Abu Hussain talked to Rahim about beheading Geller in May 2015.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Exs. 57A, 119.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    Lastly, the evidence at trial also permitted the reasonable inference that Junaid Hussain, a citizen of the United Kingdom who traveled to Syria in August of 2013 and became a member of ISIS, was also Abu Hussain. Rahim had informed Wright that he had been in contact with a person named \"Mr. Hussain\" and had received encrypted files from this person regarding Geller's beheading. Ex. 57A at 3-4. Twitter accounts linked to Junaid Hussain were also linked to Abu Hussain. 10/10/17 Trial Tr. at 12, 15-16, 18-21; Exs. 119, 367, 378, 400.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    Based on these communications, a jury could properly infer (i) that Rahim was communicating with Abu Hussain and Abu Antar, who were located overseas near Turkey; (ii) that Junaid Hussain and Abu Hussain were the same person; (iii) that Junaid Hussain was also located overseas; (iv) that Rahim communicated with these individuals about joining ISIS and beheading Geller; and (v) that Wright was made aware of these communications.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    <strong>\n     IV. SENTENCING\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    At the close of a lengthy sentencing hearing on December 19, 2017, this Court sentenced Wright to 28 years in custody. Electronic Clerk's Notes, ECF No.409. Brief mention ought be made of two aspects of the sentencing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    <strong>\n     A. Applying the Advisory Sentencing Guidelines\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    Because this court varied downward from the Sentencing Guideline range, it failed rigorously to focus on the (higher) advisory range and adopted a guideline range of 30 years to life in its Judgment and Commitment Order. The government, however, had argued for an unequivocal guideline of life imprisonment.\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n    The government believes that the applicable guideline for a \"conspiracy to kill persons\" in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332b(a)(2) is USSG \u00a7 2A1.5 (Conspiracy or Solicitation to Commit Murder), not \u00a7 2A6.1, which only pertains to \"Threatening or Harassing Communications; Hoaxes; False Liens.\" Section 2332b(a)(2) criminalizes three types of offenses-\"threats, attempts, and conspiracies.\" While the Guidelines do list 2A6.1 as the statutory reference for Section 2332b(a)(2), that guideline provision appears only to refer to \"threats\" and not to conspiracies or attempts to kill, assault, kidnap, or damage real or personal property.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    USSG \u00a7 2A6.1 (repeated use of term \"threats\" but no references to conspiracies or attempts to kill or commit serious assault). Indeed, the very last sentence of Section 2A6.1 makes clear that it is designed only to cover conduct related to threats; it states that the seriousness of the offense \"depends upon the defendant's intent and the likelihood that the defendant would carry out the threat.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 2A6.1 (Background paragraph). Nowhere in\n    the discussion of the punishment is there any discussion about the harm caused by a conspiracy or attempt to kill a person.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n    The defendant was not convicted of making threats or communicating threats to an intended victim. Thus, the government requests that the Court apply the guideline that best fits the conviction, which charged the defendant with conspiracy \"to kill and maim persons within the United States in violation of the laws of Massachusetts and New York.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Almeida\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3550847\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/437/#p441\">\n     710 F.3d 437\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 441 (1st Cir. 2013) (applicable guideline should be based \"on conduct charged in the indictment.\"). The most analogous guideline is Section 2A1.5 (Conspiracy or Solicitation to Commit Murder). In accordance with USSG \u00a7 2A1.5 the base offense level is 33. There are no specific enhancements in Section 2A1.5 but the terrorism enhancement would then increase the offense level to 45 and defendant's criminal history category to category VI resulting in a guideline range of life.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n    Alternatively, because Wright is charged with conspiring to kill persons and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332b indicates that the punishment for conspiracies shall be the same as the amount of imprisonment that would have applied had the offense been completed, Section 2X1.1 could also be used. Indeed, the Guidelines appear to require this in cases like these where the offenses involved a conspiracy. USSG \u00a7 1B1.2(a) (\"If the offense involved a conspiracy, attempt, or solicitation, refer to \u00a7 2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) as well as the guideline referenced in the Statutory Index for the substantive offense.\"). Section 2X1.1 provides that the base offense for Count 4 shall be the same as the base offense level from the guideline for the substantive offense (first degree murder guideline- USSG \u00a7 2A1.1 ) where violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332b are charged. If Section 2A1.1 is used, the defendant's base offense level would be 43 and the terrorism enhancement would increase his offense level by twelve levels. Accordingly, defendant's maximum sentence under Section 2A1.1 would also be life.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    Gov't's Sentencing Mem. 9-11, ECF. No. 399 (footnote omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    In retrospect, the Court concludes that the government's guideline analysis is correct. It's too late to correct the Judgment of course,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(a), and it makes little practical difference as the Court varied downward (and would have to the same degree even had it adopted the government's guideline analysis before imposing sentence). Still, a decent respect for the careful arguments of counsel deserves this acknowledgment. Moreover, should the sentence become the subject of further proceedings, I need acknowledge that the extent of the variance ought to be measured from the advised life term, not from a 30 year low-end advisory sentence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    <strong>\n     B. \"Our society is not afraid of ideas, we're committed to the belief that we have better ideas.\"\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    No judge is ever satisfied that he or she has done \"justice.\" This is especially true when sentencing another human being. Justice is a goal for which we constantly strive. All we can say is that we conscientiously reach out for justice.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    Here, as the remarks leading off this opinion demonstrate, I was at pains to explain that Wright's sentence was but a small piece of a larger societal problem and that Wright-misguided and dangerous as he was-required a severe but nuanced penal sentence. I cannot definitively say that Wright's sentence was \"just,\" but\n    this much I know to be true. Whatever the advisory Sentencing Guidelines may say, reflexively to \"lock-em-up\"-a life sentence for every properly convicted terrorist is not just. It's not even a strategy. It reflects fear more than justice.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    \"We are not afraid,\" Court's Remarks, Transcript of Richard Reid's Sentencing Hearing,\n    <em>\n     United States\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Reid\n    </em>\n    , No. 1:02-cr-10013 (D.
