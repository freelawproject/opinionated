No. 17) filed August 30, 2017. Defendants' Motion is GRANTED to the extent it asserts that service of the summons and complaint on the individual defendants has not been properly effected. Plaintiff is therefore ordered to effect service on them in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or file proof that such service has already occurred, within thirty days of this Order. Defendants' Motion is DENIED in all other respects for the reasons that follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Alexandra Sirois, a former Hawaii-based employee of Defendant East West Partners, Inc. (\"EWP\"), brings claims against EWP for hostile work environment and retaliation, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e,\n   <em>\n    et. seq.\n   </em>\n   , and the Hawaii Employment Practices Act (\"HEPA\"), Hawai'i Revised Statutes (\"HRS\") \u00a7 378-2,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 1, Dkt. No. 1. EWP, which builds, sells, and manages luxury real estate developments throughout the United States, is a for-profit corporation organized and existing under the laws of the state of Colorado with corporate headquarters in Avon, Colorado. Compl. \u00b6 6. Also named as defendants are Harry H. Frampton III, EWP's CEO; Andrew Sutton, EWP's Managing Partner in Hawaii and Sirois' direct supervisor; and Nicole Greener, EWP's Director of Human Resources (collectively, \"Individual Defendants\"), each of whom Sirois accuses of aiding and abetting unlawful harassment and retaliation in violation of HEPA. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-9. Sirois asserts an additional claim against EWP for unpaid overtime compensation, in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   EWP hired Sirois as an Assistant Project Manager, with an initial annual base salary of $60,000, in January 2014. Compl. \u00b6 16. In less than three years, Sirois received three pay increases, bringing her base compensation to $92,500, illustrative of her value to EWP. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 20-21. As an Assistant Project Manager, Sirois performed a variety of office and clerical tasks, \"including but not limited to providing general support to Sutton; answering incoming phone calls; processing paperwork relating to home sales and change orders; preparing marketing materials and general correspondence; coordinating change orders with contractors; and planning and attending marketing events.\" Compl. \u00b6 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Sirois reported directly to Defendant Sutton, and at all times material, Sirois and Sutton were EWP's only full-time employees in Hawaii.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 22-23. Sirois summarizes Sutton's alleged harassment and mistreatment of her-based on sex and sexual orientation-as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   a) requiring that [Sirois] organize and attend marketing events so that Sutton could \"pimp out\" his own wife, Kelsey Sutton (\"Mrs. Sutton\"), and her scantily clad friends, providing Mrs. Sutton with a forum to drink excessively, dance inappropriately, kiss, grope, and have sex with a wealthy, married EWP customer, Brett Dedeaux (\"Dedeaux\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   b) taunting [Sirois] by making offensive comments about other women in [her] workplace, including [Sirois'] own mother;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   c) requiring that [Sirois] participate in a scheme to refrain from disclosing to Dedeaux's wife, Jean Dedeaux (\"Mrs. Dedeaux\") and Dedeaux's parents any information relating to Mrs. Sutton's and Dedeaux's illicit affair;\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   d) taunting [Sirois] by putting a woman on speaker phone and deliberately speaking to her in a rude and condescending manner as a way of asserting his male dominance;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   e) deliberately picking on Plaintiff, taunting and ridiculing her, and attempting to manufacture arguments with her as a way of asserting his male dominance;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   f) mocking [Sirois] by asking her to give him and Mrs. Sutton private tennis lessons during her non-working hours even though [Sirois] and Sutton never socialized outside of work;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   g) asking [Sirois] to hire \"hot\" female dancers for a marketing event;\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   h) telling [Sirois] that her work attire was not feminine enough;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   i) requiring that [Sirois] coordinate marketing events and schedules with Mrs. Sutton so that she could continue her illicit affair with Dedeaux;\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   j) following [Sirois] around with his phone and taking videos of her even after she repeatedly pleaded that he stop.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25(a)-(j). Thus, \"[b]y his demeanor, words, and actions, Sutton made clear ... that he had no respect for women in a professional work environment.\" Compl. \u00b6 26. Sirois also contends that \"Sutton regularly directed hostility towards [her] because she was an openly gay female.\" Compl. \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Although she complained to Greener about the hostile environment Sutton had created, Sirois states that Greener consistently failed to investigate her concerns and did not take any remedial action to address Sirois' complaints. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 28-30, 43-44, 51-52. As such, Sirois \"asked to speak directly with EWP CEO, Frampton.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 54-55. According to Sirois, however, Frampton too gave no credence to her complaints. Instead, he \"abruptly terminated [her] employment, stating that it was clear to him that [Sirois] could no longer work together with Sutton,\" but he also offered her a few weeks of severance pay for being a \"nice lady.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 56-57. Sirois later received a termination letter from EWP dated September 28, 2016,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   which states that the decision to terminate Sirois' employment was based on her \"uncorroborated allegations\" that demonstrated a \"lack of respect and trust for Mr. Sutton.\" Sirois refers to this letter as \"direct evidence of unlawful retaliation.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 58-60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On August 3, 2017, after exhausting her administrative remedies with the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") (Compl. \u00b6 62), Sirois initiated the instant action. The Complaint asserts five counts against EWP-Retaliation in violation of both Title VII,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202000\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (Count I), and HEPA, HRS \u00a7 378-2(2) (Count II); Hostile Work Environment, in violation of both Title VII,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202000\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (Count III), and HEPA, HRS \u00a7 378-2(1)(A) (Count IV); and for overtime compensation under the FLSA (Count VI). Only Count V is alleged against the Individual Defendants. That Count charges all three Individual Defendants with Aiding and Abetting EWP and each other \"in discriminating against [Sirois] in the terms and conditions of her employment in violation of HRS \u00a7 378-2(a)(3) by subjecting [Sirois] to a sexually hostile work environment as well as harassment based on her sex and/or sexual orientation.\" Compl. \u00b6 99. Count V also asserts that Frampton and Greener only aided and\n   abetted EWP and each other in retaliating against Sirois. Compl. \u00b6 100.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On August 30, 2017, the Individual Defendants filed the instant Motion to Dismiss. MTD, Dkt. No. 17.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the MTD, the Individual Defendants attack Sirois' Complaint on four grounds. First, they argue that Count V of the Complaint fails to state a valid claim for aiding and abetting under HRS \u00a7 378-2(a)(3), primarily because of conclusory allegations of unlawful intent. Mem. in Supp. of MTD at 6-8, Dkt. No. 17-1. Second, the Individual Defendants ask the Court to strike paragraphs 25(a), 25(c), 25(i), 32-40, 46, and 57 from the Complaint due to their \"immaterial, impertinent and scandalous\" nature. Mem. in Supp. at 2, 8-11. Third, the Individual Defendants argue that Greener is not subject to personal jurisdiction in this Court because she lacks sufficient minimum contacts with Hawaii. Mem. in Supp. at 12-13. And fourth, the Individual Defendants allege they were not properly served. Mem. in Supp. at 13-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Sirois filed her opposition to the MTD (Dkt. No. 44) on October 19, 2017, and Defendants filed a Consolidated Reply Memorandum in Support of the MTD (Dkt. No. 45) on October 26, 2017.

The challenged paragraphs refer to Defendant Sutton's alleged act of \"pimp[ing] out\" his spouse (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 32, 37); they identify Sutton's spouse and a married EWP client and label their alleged relationship as an \"illicit affair\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25(c), 25(i), 38), an \"illicit sexual relationship\" (Compl. \u00b6 34), an \"adulterous affair\" (Compl. \u00b6 40), and an \"infidelity\" (Compl. \u00b6 39); and they adjudge the alleged couple's various actions as \"inappropriate\" (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 34, 36, 46). The challenged paragraphs also describe the EWP client with whom Sutton's wife was allegedly having an affair and the client's friends as \"wealthy\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 33, 35), Sutton's wife's friends as \"young\" and \"scantily clad\" (Compl. \u00b6 35), and claim that the EWP client's own spouse \"was not fully aware of\" her husband's alleged \"infidelity\" with Sutton's wife (Compl. \u00b6 39). Finally, Defendants request that the Court strike the paragraph labeling Frampton a \"misogynist.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 57 (\"A true misogynist, Frampton also said that Plaintiff would receive a few weeks of severance pay because she was a 'nice lady.' \").

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(i), 38. In other words, Sutton directed Sirois to facilitate a sexual relationship for his benefit and for the benefit of EWP. The implication is that Sutton's decision to use his spouse in this manner was part of his business development plan. Moreover, Sirois alleges that she was required to do this on multiple occasions as part of her job duties. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(i), 31, 38-41, 47, 52. And she states that her involvement in these events became common knowledge within the Kauai real estate community in which she worked. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 36-37.

With respect to Sutton specifically, Defendants urge the Court to dismiss the aiding-and-abetting-harassment claim because the allegations underlying Count V merely assert \"that multiple persons were involved in alleged discrimination\" without \"identify[ing] any allegation against Sutton involving another individual, ignoring the well-settled rule that he cannot be sued for abetting himself.\" Reply at 8-9 (citing Mem. in Supp. at 7-8 (collecting cases in support) ). Noting that \"Greener is alleged to have failed to investigate or address Sirois' complaints about Sutton,\" and that \"Frampton allegedly fired [Sirois] in a phone call\" (Mem. in Supp. at 6), Defendants also argue that Sirois' allegations of \"mere\n   <em>\n    inaction\n   </em>\n   or joint participation in a termination alleged to be unlawful\" are insufficient to impose liability on Frampton and Greener for aiding-and-abetting (Reply at 9).

The court noted the absence of allegations that \"any communication by any of the Individual Defendants led anyone else to also discriminate or partake in unlawful practices against him\" and explained that \"[s]imply the fact that multiple people may have treated Plaintiff poorly, or even discriminatorily, does not automatically imply that they aided and abetted each other in doing so.\"\n    <em>\n     Park\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%203490190\">\n     2011 WL 3490190\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *8.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Indeed, the Complaint notes that \"Plaintiff asked to speak directly with EWP CEO, Frampton\" only after \"[r]ecognizing that Greener was completely unwilling to address the serious accusations of harassment that Plaintiff had lodged.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 54-56.
