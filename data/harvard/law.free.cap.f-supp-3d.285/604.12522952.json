(\"Sutherland\") to produce documents as to which it has asserted attorney-client privilege.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docket # 45). First, Narayanan seeks unredacted preliminary and final versions of a report prepared for Sutherland by Freed Maxick CPAs, P.C. (\"Freed Maxick\"), a consulting and accounting firm. The Freed Maxick report (the \"Report\") contains legal advice from Rank Associates (\"Rank\"), an Indian-based law firm hired by Sutherland. Although Sutherland previously produced a copy of the Report, it redacted those portions that reflected Rank's legal advice. Second, Narayanan seeks emails and documents from the period September 2013 through March 2014 between and among Rank, Sutherland, and Michael Russo (\"Russo\"), a certified public accountant and Managing Director of Freed Maxick (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket # 59-2 at \u00b6 7). Sutherland opposes the motion. (Docket # 52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Narayanan's principal argument is that Freed Maxick's involvement in communications between Rank and Sutherland waived the attorney-client privilege. Narayanan also maintains that Sutherland has waived any privilege attaching to the communications by placing the advice provided by Rank at issue in the litigation. Sutherland counters that the privilege remains intact because Russo was an agent of Sutherland whose involvement was \"necessary and indispensable\" to facilitate the attorney-client communications between Rank and Sutherland, or, alternatively, because Russo was the \"functional equivalent\" of a Sutherland employee. In addition, Sutherland maintains that it has not placed the communications at issue in this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 17, 2017, the Court heard oral argument on the motion. (Docket # 58).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court thereafter granted Sutherland leave to supplement the record and provided Narayanan the opportunity to respond. (Docket # 56). The parties completed supplemental briefing on June 21, 2017, and the Court heard further argument on August 17, 2017. (Docket ## 59, 61, 64).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Based on the record before the Court and for the reasons explained more fully herein, I find that the communications at issue are not protected by any privilege.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because I find that the communications at issue are not protected, I do not reach the issue of whether Sutherland waived any privilege by putting the subject matter of the withheld communications at issue in this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Narayanan commenced this diversity action on March 25, 2015, against Sutherland, asserting claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment. (Docket # 1). Narayanan was a director of Sutherland and a director and/or officer of certain Sutherland overseas subsidiaries for more than ten years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8). In connection with his employment, Narayanan exercised his option to purchase company shares. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19). In October 2014, the parties entered into two agreements pursuant to which Narayanan's shares were to be sold back to the company for approximately $2 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4-7). Narayanan claims that despite performing his obligations under the agreements, he has not received the purchase price for his shares. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7). According to Narayanan, he resigned from Sutherland in October 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In its Answer, Sutherland asserts a defense of set-off, maintaining that Narayanan owes it a sum of money that \"far exceeds, and will be a complete set-off to, the amount of money claimed by\" Narayanan. (Docket # 12 at \u00b6\u00b6 59-86). Sutherland also asserts a counterclaim against Narayanan for breach of fiduciary duties, for which it claims damages of approximately $6 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 97-104). The district judge denied Narayanan's motion to dismiss the counterclaim and to strike the set-off defense. (Docket # 37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Sutherland's set-off defense and counterclaim arise out of a series of transactions conducted by Narayanan in India. According to Sutherland, Narayanan was responsible for acquiring on behalf of Sutherland 26 contiguous acres of land in India. (Docket # 12 at \u00b6 62). In connection with the expected acquisition, approximately $10 million was allocated to be paid to third parties in exchange for deeds and to register the land. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 63). Sutherland claims that despite acquiring only 11 non-contiguous acres, Narayanan advanced the funds to a third-party land aggregator named Mr. S. Venkataramanan (\"Ramanan\"), primarily in exchange for promissory notes as opposed to deeds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 64, 68). According to Sutherland, when it discovered that the funds had been advanced without the acquisition of the desired land, it concluded that it \"had no choice but to work with [Narayanan] and Ramanan in an effort to recover the money.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 71). These efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In August 2013, Sutherland, through its CEO Dilip Vellodi (\"Vellodi\"), engaged Freed Maxick to investigate the land acquisition project in India (the \"Sutherland Land Acquisition\") and detail its findings and recommendations in the Report. (Docket ## 47 at 7; 52 at 8). According to Freed Maxick's engagement letter with Sutherland, which was signed by Russo on behalf of Freed Maxick, the Report was expected to detail, among other things, its \"findings related to the [Sutherland Land Acquisition] and [its] assessment of internal controls at [Sutherland]\" and to \"provide recommendations for improvements to internal controls at [Sutherland].\" (Docket # 50-1). Vellodi has explained that Sutherland chose Russo to conduct the investigation because he had a long history with Sutherland and was a \"trusted advisor\" with \"extensive knowledge about Sutherland.\" (Docket # 59-1 at \u00b6 6). Between 1996 and 1998 Russo worked as Sutherland's Senior Vice President of Finance, and between July 2014 and July 2015 as its interim Chief Financial Officer. (Docket ## 52 at 8-9; 59-2 at \u00b6 6). Since April 2014, Russo, who is not an attorney (Docket # 46-16 at 54-60), has also served as Sutherland's Legal Coordinator (Docket # 59-2 at \u00b6 4). Sutherland maintains that Russo is responsible for coordinating Sutherland's defense and prosecution of this matter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Also in August 2013, at Russo's recommendation, Sutherland retained Rank, an Indian-based law firm \"specializ[ing] in real estate transactions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11). Russo testified at his deposition that he \"was not qualified to fully complete the work that [Sutherland] [was] looking for [him] to do without some competent legal advice\" and he asked Sutherland to retain a law firm. (Docket # 53-3 at 4). According to Vellodi, Rank was retained to provide \"legal advice related to certain aspects of the [Sutherland Land Acquisition]\" and to advise \"how best to recoup the money that had allegedly been given to the land aggregator, Ramanan, but was now unaccounted for with no land having been registered.\" (Docket # 59-1 at \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Russo and his Freed Maxick team began the investigation of the Sutherland Land Acquisition in August 2013 and submitted the Report to Vellodi on or about September 12, 2013. (Docket # 50-2). The first paragraph of the Report states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   We have provided the consulting services summarized below, which were agreed to by Sutherland Global Services, Inc. and subsidiaries (Sutherland) in an [engagement] letter dated August 20, 2013, solely to assist you in the evaluation of certain real estate transactions entered into by Sutherland Development Company Private Limited (SDC) and to provide a limited general review of internal controls at Sutherland's Indian operations.... Sutherland is also responsible for the design, implementation and maintenance of internal controls.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Of the twelve-page single-spaced Report, less than one page was redacted; the redacted section follows the paragraph that provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   During the course of the engagement, we had various discussions with S.C. Raghuram from Rank Associates, a law firm in India that was retained by the company to advise on this matter. During these discussions, Mr. Raghuram provided the following advice. You should consider and seek further advice as necessary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Following the redacted section, the Report introduces a new section, entitled, \"Limited Review of Internal Controls Over Capital Expenditures.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Russo admits that during and following his investigation, he \"spoke to [Rank] on various occasions in order to provide, and\n   explain, information uncovered during the investigation and how it was impacting Sutherland Global[,] includ[ing] but ... not limited to, the information contained in [the Report].\" (Docket # 59-2 at \u00b6 12). Rank partner S.C. Raghuram (\"Raghuram\") was the primary participant in those conversations, as evidenced from Sutherland's privilege logs submitted in support of this motion. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Docket # 50-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Based on this Court's review, 26 entries on the privilege logs identify communications during the September 2013 to March 2014 period in which Russo was a participant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The earliest communications between Rank, Sutherland, and Russo are dated September 12, 2013, and were from Raghuram to Russo and Vellodi. (Docket # 50-7 at 2, items 1, 3, 5). These communications relate to \"orig[inal] findings by [F]reed [Maxick] re [sdc]\" and reflect \"[l]egal advice regarding the land acquisition deal.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Raghuram also sent emails and documents to Russo and Vellodi in September 2013 relating to either an \"SDC Comparison\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6, items 7, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17), or an \"India report draft\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-8, items 12, 13, 14, 18, 20, 22, 23, 24, 28). According to Sutherland, all of these emails and documents reflect \"[a]ttorney client communication[s] regarding [the] investigation into [the] land transaction.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Communications between Rank, Russo, and Sutherland continued in November and December 2013. From November 13, 2013 to November 19, 2013, Raghuram and Russo exchanged emails regarding a \"meeting,\" which reflected \"[a]ttorney client communication[s] regarding [the] investigation into land transactions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, 8, items 5, 6, 29). Also, on November 13, 2013, Russo sent himself a spreadsheet, with no attorneys copied therein; the log describes the communication as reflecting \"[a]ttorney client communication[s] regarding [the] land transaction and strategy for addressing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8, item 32). On November 29, 2013, Raghuram sent emails to Russo, Vellodi, and K.S. Kumar (\"Kumar\"), Chief Commercial Officer of Sutherland in India (Docket # 58 at 9), regarding the \"[s]ale of KRV land to Varun Manian\" and reflecting \"[a]ttorney client communication regarding [the] sale of certain land\" (Docket # 50-7 at 5, 8, items 4, 33), as well as an \"update\" email reflecting \"[l]egal advice regarding the land acquisition deal\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, item 2). Finally, on December 2, 2013, Kumar sent an email to Rank and Russo \"concerning legal advice and [the] scope of work to be conducted by lawyers in connection with [the] land transaction.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, item 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Motions to compel are \"entrusted to the sound discretion of the district court,\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

To make that assessment, I address in turn the four categories of documents and communications identified in the logs: (1) those between Rank and Russo; (2) those from Rank to Russo and Sutherland; (3) those from Sutherland to Rank and Russo; and, (4) those from Russo to himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Communications between Rank and Russo\n    </em>\n    (Docket # 50-7 at 5, 8, items 5, 6, 29)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Sutherland has submitted no affidavits from any Rank attorneys concerning the nature of Rank's communications with Russo. Russo, on the other hand, has submitted an affidavit averring that he provided and explained information to Rank that was uncovered through Freed Maxick's investigation of the Sutherland Land Acquisition. (Docket # 59-2 at \u00b6 12). Russo states that his disclosures and explanations to Rank were necessary to \"help guide\" Rank's legal advice to Sutherland. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13). Vellodi has affirmed that \"[b]ecause no [Sutherland] employees were involved in the investigation, and the short time frame involved, absent Mr. Russo and his team gathering and analyzing the underlying facts, [Rank] would not have been able to provide [Sutherland] with competent legal advice with respect to Plaintiff and Ramanan.\" (Docket # 59-1 at \u00b6 9). Stated another way, Russo provided Rank with the facts necessary for Rank to provide legal advice to Sutherland. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket # 52 at 6 \"Russo and his team at Freed Maxick ... provided the factual foundation and analysis upon which Rank based its advice\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Based on the record before the Court, I find that Sutherland's assertion of privilege as to these particular communications is unjustified. Sutherland's position is similar to one rejected by the Second Circuit in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ackert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11756685\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/169/136/\">\n    169 F.3d 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 1999). In\n   <em>\n    Ackert\n   </em>\n   , counsel for Paramount Corporation (\"Paramount\") had several conversations with a third-party investment banker concerning an investment proposal the investment banking firm had made to Paramount \"to learn more about the details of the proposed transaction and its potential tax consequences, so that he could advise his client ... about the legal and financial implications of the transaction.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Contending that these communications were privileged,\n   Paramount asserted that \"it was impossible for [its counsel] to advise [it] without these further contacts with [the banker], because [Paramount's counsel] could not otherwise fully define the factual, and therefore legal, nature of the proposal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11756685\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/169/136/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11756685\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/169/136/\">\n    at 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, Russo provided factual information to Rank that Sutherland did not itself possess; although it may have been helpful or convenient to Rank to speak directly to Russo, the record does not prove that Rank\n   <em>\n    needed\n   </em>\n   Russo to interpret the information for it. Indeed, Russo testified that Rank did not provide advice about accounting matters. (Docket # 46-17 at 3). Accordingly, I find that the communications between Russo and Rank are not privileged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ackert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11756685\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/169/136/\">\n    169 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   139 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Application Pursuant to 28 U.S.C.

As an initial matter, a proponent of privilege cannot meet the applicable burden by \"mere conclusory or ipse dixit assertions.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Grand Jury Subpoena Dated Jan. 4, 1984\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"629005\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/750/223/#p225\">\n    750 F.2d at 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, a review of the privilege log entries suggests that most of these communications relate to preliminary and final versions of the Report. Sutherland has offered no explanation for the purported need to include Rank's legal advice in the Report, the purpose of which, according to the engagement letter, was to detail Freed Maxick's factual findings regarding the Sutherland Land Acquisition and to recommend internal controls. In the absence of proof to the contrary, I find that the decision to include Rank's legal advice in the Report was one of convenience, rather than necessity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allied Irish Banks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3967930\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/240/96/#p103\">\n    240 F.R.D. at 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Moreover, there is no evidence that Rank's attorneys could not have understood the Sutherland Land Acquisition or\n   rendered legal advice to Sutherland about its options for recovering the advanced funds without Freed Maxick's help. Indeed, Rank, an Indian-based law firm \"specializ[ing] in real estate transactions\" (Docket # 59-2 at \u00b6 11), was retained by Sutherland to advise on Indian-based real estate transactions. Beyond Vellodi's wholly conclusory assertion, no specific factual showing has been made that Rank or Sutherland required Russo to facilitate the provision of legal advice from Rank to Sutherland.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Rather, the proof suggests that Freed Maxick's role in attorney-client communications was merely useful and convenient. That alone does not shield the privilege from waiver.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3967930\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/240/96/#p103\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3967930\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/240/96/#p103\">\n    at 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Exchanges from Sutherland to Rank and Russo\n    </em>\n    (Docket # 50-7 at 5, item 3)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The privilege logs reflect one communication from Sutherland to Rank and Russo-a December 2, 2013, email from Kumar \"concerning legal advice and scope of work to be conducted by lawyers in connection with land transaction.\" (Docket # 50-7 at 5, item 3). No proof on the record justifies Sutherland's privilege assertion over this communication. Vellodi's declaration addresses only his conferral with Russo, and not the necessity of Russo's involvement in communications from Kumar to Rank. Furthermore, Russo's declaration only addresses his communications with Rank, and does not reference his involvement in communications between Kumar and Rank several months after the issuance of the Report. Accordingly, Sutherland has failed to show that this communication is privileged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Exchanges from Russo to Himself\n    </em>\n    (Docket # 50-7 at 8, item 32)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Sutherland also asserts that a spreadsheet Russo emailed to himself is privileged. The log does not reflect that Rank was party to the communication, and the record does not otherwise demonstrate that the spreadsheet reflects privileged communications, let alone how such communications came to be included in the spreadsheet. Without more, Sutherland has not demonstrated that this communication is privileged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In sum, on this record, I find that Sutherland has not met its burden of showing that Freed Maxick acted as its agent in any of the communications at issue. As a result, the communications at issue, including the redacted information in the Report, are not privileged under the agency exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Functional Equivalent Doctrine\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Alternatively, Sutherland argues that attorney-client communications shared with Russo are privileged because Russo was the \"functional equivalent\" of a Sutherland employee. (Docket ## 52 at 13; 59 at 4-6). \"Although a number of courts around the country, including several within this Circuit, have adopted [the functional equivalent doctrine], it has never been recognized by the Second Circuit.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Church &amp; Dwight Co.

Russo provided the Report on Freed Maxick letterhead to Sutherland in September 2013. (Docket # 50-2).

Indeed, Freed Maxick explicitly represented in the Report that Sutherland, not Freed Maxick, was \"responsible for the design, implementation and maintenance of internal controls.\" (Docket # 50-2 at 2).

The simple fact that Russo's investigation uncovered and developed facts that were used in this litigation does not prove the existence of that type of relationship. That Russo himself was a Sutherland employee during periods before and after his investigation of the Sutherland Land Acquisition also does not demonstrate that he was \"integrat[ed] into [Sutherland's] corporate structure\" at the time he learned the attorney-client communications at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Exp.-Imp.
