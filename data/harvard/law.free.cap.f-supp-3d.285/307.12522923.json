Crying foul, a coalition of animal rights' groups filed suit under the \"reading room\" provision of the Freedom of Information Act, which requires federal agencies to maintain copies of frequently requested records for public inspection in electronic format. The Department of Agriculture has moved to dismiss on various\n   grounds. Finding that APHIS's reposting of most of the documents has mooted Plaintiffs' claims as to those records, and that the complaint does not adequately allege that the remaining removed records are subject to FOIA's reading room provision, the Court will grant the Department's motion.

PETA alleged that the Department's wholesale removal of the records violated the reading room provision of FOIA. The complaint focused on four specific categories of records: (1) research facility annual reports, (2) inspection reports, (3) lists of entities licensed under the Animal Welfare Act, and (4) regulatory correspondence and enforcement records.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 30.

In response, the Court issued a Minute Order on November 27, 2017 directing the Department to file a report clarifying the \"current posting status of the categories of records sought\" by PETA. The Department filed the requested report on December 4, 2017. In it, the Department explained that: (1) it had reposted all previously posted research facility annual reports on the APHIS website, and intended to continue doing so consistent with its practice prior to February 3, 2017; (2) it had reposted all inspection reports for the most recent three-year period-consistent with its practice as of February 3, 2017- though it had not reposted the animal inventories that accompanied those reports and some reposted reports contained more redactions than before; (3) it had reposted a monthly list of active licensees on its website (though not a \"real time\" list); and (4) while it had not reposted the regulatory correspondence and enforcement records, many of those records were official records of the Department's Office of Administrative Law Judges and Office of the Judicial Officer and remained available to the public on those offices' respective websites, and it did not intend to repost records involving possible violations that are unadjudicated (though it maintains a statistical summary of such records).

As to the documents that have been reposted, because PETA has been accorded the full relief requested in the complaint, the Court concludes PETA's claims as to those documents are now moot and should be dismissed. As for the remaining documents, the Court will dismiss PETA's claims without prejudice under Rule 12(b)(6) because the complaint does not adequately plead that the documents are reading room documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    PETA's claims as to documents that have been reposted are moot.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Article III of the Constitution requires that a case remain live throughout the pendency of the action.\n   <em>\n    Campbell-Ewald Co. v.

Cir. 1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court will start with PETA's request for injunctive relief. Based on the reports filed by the parties, it appears that for three of the four categories of records that PETA seeks, the Department has reposted the relevant records: the Department has reposted all previously-posted inspection facility annual reports (with the exception of the animal inventories that accompany the reports), inspection reports, and the list of entities regulated under the Animal Welfare Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

As such, that request is moot as to any reposted record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   This leaves PETA's declaratory relief request. The D.C. Circuit has recognized that when a plaintiff \"merely attacks an isolated agency action, then the mooting of the specific claim moots any claim for a declaratory judgment that the specific action was unlawful.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Hous. v.

PETA's complaint does not challenge any ongoing agency\n   <em>\n    policy\n   </em>\n   (at least with respect to any reposted records)-it has always challenged a discrete agency\n   <em>\n    action\n   </em>\n   , namely the removal of website records on February 3, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 36;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515846,3820263\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/24/1421/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Claim for Relief (seeking a declaration that \"Defendants have violated FOIA by removing [the records] from APHIS's website\"). Consequently, the mooting of PETA's injunctive relief request simultaneously moots its declaratory relief request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   That said, PETA's claims would not be moot if they met one of the two recognized exceptions for mootness: (1) capable of repetition yet evading review or (2) voluntary cessation.\n   <em>\n    City of Hous.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515846,3820263\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/24/1421/\">\n    24 F.3d at 1429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Of these two exceptions only the latter, voluntary cessation, would arguably apply here. A defendant's voluntary cessation of challenged conduct will moot the case if \"there is no reasonable expectation that the conduct will recur\" and \"interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation.\"\n   <em>\n    Qassim v.

Cir. 2006) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   These requirements are met here. PETA's access to the records erases the effects of the alleged violation. Additionally, there is no reasonable expectation the Department will remove the records again: from the beginning, the Department has indicated-and both parties have recognized-that the removal was a temporary measure intended to review the records and remove certain personal information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 30 (\"[The Department] asserted that the reason for its decision was its desire to 'remove certain personal information from documents it posts on APHIS' website.\" (citation omitted).

Given the temporary, one-time nature of the Department's removal of the records, it is reasonably certain that the Department will not remove these records again. The voluntary cessation exception thus does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In sum, because PETA has been accorded the full relief it sought with respect to the reposted records, the Court concludes that PETA's claims with respect to these records are now moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    PETA has insufficiently pled that the remaining removed documents are reading room documents.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As discussed above, three of the four categories of documents that PETA requested-annual facility reports, inspection reports (absent inventories), and the list of regulated entities-have been reposted and PETA's claims as to those documents are now moot. This leaves the Court to address only those documents that have not been reposted: the animal inventories (which the Department avers it is in the process of auditing and intends to repost) and regulatory compliance documents related to unadjudicated claims of violations of the Animal Welfare Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl \u00b6\u00b6 1, 30. As to these remaining documents, the Court agrees with the Department that PETA has not adequately pled that they fall within the scope of FOIA's reading-room provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Under the statute, the FOIA reading-room provision encompasses five categories of documents: (1) final opinions and orders rendered in the adjudication of cases, (2) statements of policy and interpretations which are not published in the Federal Register, (3) administrative staff manuals and instructions, (4) frequently requested documents, and (5) indices of posted records.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)-(E). If a document does not fall within one of these categories, then the agency has no affirmative obligation to post the document-it would only have a reactive obligation to release the document pursuant to a valid FOIA request,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 552(a)(3)(A). Consequently, a plaintiff raising a violation of FOIA's reading room provision must plausibly allege that the withheld records fall within one of these categories in order to properly state a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Campaign for Accountability v.

Oct. 6, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   PETA argues that the records at issue here fall in the first or fourth category. As to the first category, PETA's complaint does not contain plausible allegations that the records at issue represent final opinions made in the adjudication of cases. Indeed, the challenged regulatory compliance records specifically involved cases \"that have not reached final adjudication.\" Compl. \u00b6 30 (citation omitted). Such records, therefore, are not plausibly\n   <em>\n    final\n   </em>\n   opinions. Nor could \"warnings, settlements, and stipulations\" plausibly be final opinions, particularly since records must have \"precedential value\" or \"constitute working law of the agency\" to qualify as final opinions,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Tereshchuk v.

Similarly, inventories of animals submitted with annual reports do not plausibly sound like final opinions, and no facts alleged in the complaint suggest such an interpretation. As such, PETA fails to adequately allege that these remaining records fall within the first category of records covered by the reading-room provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This leaves the fourth category, frequently requested records. According to FOIA, such records are those that (1) \"have been released to any person\" pursuant to a valid FOIA request and (2) that the agency has \"determine[d] have become or are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests for substantially the same records\"\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   that \"have been requested 3 or more times.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(D). As an initial matter, PETA nowhere alleges in its complaint that the animal inventories and regulatory compliance records have\n   <em>\n    ever\n   </em>\n   been released to any person pursuant to a valid FOIA request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the records fail to meet the first requirement to be frequently request records. Similarly, PETA nowhere alleges that the records have been requested more than three times or that the Department has determined the records have been or are likely to be the subject of multiple requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In opposition to the Department's motion to dismiss, PETA primarily argues that because the records were previously posted on APHIS's website, they\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be records within the scope of the reading room provision. Pls.' Opp'n Defs.' Mot. Dismiss at 16. But that is not necessarily so. An agency could clearly decide to post a wider swath of records than obligated to under FOIA: for instance, an agency could preemptively post a record that has\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   been requested (and thus is not a frequently requested record under the statute) but that it anticipates will be requested repeatedly. The Court therefore does not agree that merely because a record has been posted on an agency's website, the agency was required to post that record under FOIA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In sum, PETA does not allege in its complaint that it has requested these documents pursuant to a valid FOIA request. And the record's prior-posted status is insufficient by itself to show it is a frequently-requested record. PETA has therefore failed to adequately allege that these records are reading room records and, accordingly, that the Department has improperly withheld records under FOIA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In light of the Department's reposting of the vast majority of the records at issue in this case, there is not much left for the Court to resolve. The Department's reposting of the records provides PETA with the injunctive relief it seeks, and therefore moots PETA's claim as to those records. With respect to the records that have not been reposted, PETA has not adequately alleged that they fall within the scope of FOIA's reading-room provision. The Court will therefore dismiss the case for mootness and for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted. For the non-mooted claims, this dismissal is without prejudice.

The Court cannot rely on the declarations attached to PETA's opposition in ruling on the motion to dismiss. Nor has PETA ever moved to amend its complaint to include any factual allegations set out in the declarations. For similar reasons, the Court will deny PETA's outstanding motion for leave to file a supplemental declaration-that declaration, too, would be inappropriate for the Court to rely on at this juncture to supplement allegations in the complaint.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    This is equally true for future records, which by virtue of their currently non-existent status have never been released to any person under a valid FOIA request and therefore cannot yet be reading-room documents.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Because the Court is dismissing for mootness and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, it need not address the Department's arguments that dismissal is also proper because PETA failed to exhaust its administrative remedies or on prudential ripeness grounds.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    PETA has also filed a motion for discovery.
