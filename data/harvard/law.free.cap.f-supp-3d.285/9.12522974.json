Defendant Eric D.

CMS makes reimbursements to participating providers through \"fiscal intermediaries,\" which are often private insurance companies. The reimbursement process begins when a participating provider submits an annual cost report to the fiscal intermediary, which then audits the report, determines the amount owed to the provider for the year, and reimburses the provider. A provider has a statutory right to a hearing before the Provider Reimbursement Review Board if (1) it is \"dissatisfied\" with the fiscal intermediary's determination of the reimbursement amount or the Secretary's determination of the outlier payment amount; (2) the amount in controversy is at least $10,000; and (3) the provider files a request for a hearing within 180 days of receiving the fiscal intermediary's determination. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395\n   <em>\n    oo\n   </em>\n   (a)(1).

In other\n   words, Defendant seeks a remand so the Board can grant Plaintiffs the expedited judicial review that the Board previously denied. Plaintiffs filed an Opposition to Defendant's Motion and Cross-Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, in which they contend that remand would be frivolous and cause unnecessary delay because they are entitled to expedited judicial review and, once granted, this matter will bounce back to this court for consideration of their APA challenges to the outlier regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

Defendant asserts that the best result Plaintiffs could hope for here is that the court will determine the Board erred by applying the self-disallowance regulation to Plaintiffs and, as in\n   <em>\n    Banner Heart\n   </em>\n   , remand the case for further proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 5-6 (citing\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12182319\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/201/131/\">\n    201 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   143 ).

First, although Defendant has asserted that the Board will modify its original decision by applying\n   <em>\n    Banner Heart\n   </em>\n   to this case, Defendant has not provided any \"substantial and legitimate\" reason warranting remand and, indeed, the course of conduct here leaves the court questioning whether the agency has acted in good faith. Second, Plaintiff has clearly articulated that remand would cause it undue prejudice because returning the case for further proceedings before the Board will cause extensive delay. Third, the court concludes that remand is futile because the law unambiguously requires the Board to grant expedited judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The court finds Defendant's procedural choices in and related to this case to be puzzling. Though Defendant presently contends that he disagrees with the court's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Banner Heart\n   </em>\n   , he never filed a motion for reconsideration with the court in that case and voluntarily dismissed his appeal of that decision one week after filing it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order,\n   <em>\n    Banner Heart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12182319\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/201/131/\">\n    201 F.Supp.3d 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , ECF No. 49. Two weeks after Defendant voluntarily dismissed his appeal in\n   <em>\n    Banner Heart\n   </em>\n   , the Board denied expedited judicial review in the present case, explicitly acknowledging but declining to apply\n   <em>\n    Banner Heart\n   </em>\n   's reasoning to Plaintiffs' appeal. Now that Plaintiffs have appealed the Board's decision for this court to review, Defendant seeks voluntary remand, agreeing to apply\n   <em>\n    Banner Heart\n   </em>\n   in this one instance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 4. Defendant's declination to pursue an appeal or seek reconsideration of\n   <em>\n    Banner Heart\n   </em>\n   , coupled with the present request for voluntary remand, looks more like Defendant is giving these Plaintiffs the run-around, rather than applying the law in a fair and just manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The court might be less concerned with Defendant's approach if the Board had provided a reasonable explanation for why it did not apply\n   <em>\n    Banner Heart\n   </em>\n   's reasoning to Plaintiffs' appeal or if Defendant did so now in his Motion, but the court is left wanting for further explanation on both fronts. The court plainly held in\n   <em>\n    Banner Heart\n   </em>\n   that \"the Secretary's self-disallowance regulation, as applied to Plaintiffs' specific regulatory challenge, conflicts with the plain text of section 1395\n   <em>\n    oo\n   </em>\n   .

Although the court stated that its ruling did not invalidate the self-disallowance regulation in its entirety, as the plaintiffs in that case had requested, the court made plain it was contrary to controlling law for the Board to apply the self-disallowance regulation \"to providers who, like Plaintiffs, seek to assert a legal challenge to a regulation or policy that cannot be addressed by a fiscal intermediary.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12182319\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/201/131/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 143 n.4.

The Board purposely decided not to apply the court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Banner Heart\n   </em>\n   when reviewing Plaintiffs' request for expedited judicial review, however, on the ground that\n   <em>\n    Banner Heart\n   </em>\n   did not invalidate the self-disallowance regulation as a whole and, therefore, the Board remained bound to apply that regulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bd. Decision at 6. That rationale makes little sense. Plaintiffs clearly fall within the category of \"providers who ... seek to assert a legal challenge to a regulation or policy that cannot be addressed by a fiscal intermediary,\" as to whom the court held the self-disallowance regulation cannot apply. Yet, the Board made no attempt to distinguish Plaintiffs from the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Banner Heart\n   </em>\n   or explain why it disagreed with the court's decision. Defendant does not address those questions now. Instead, Defendant seeks remand on the ground that, \"this case is in material respects similar to\n   <em>\n    Banner Heart\n   </em>\n   , and [the agency] wishes to acquiesce in the\n   <em>\n    Banner Heart\n   </em>\n   holding for purposes of this case.\" Def.'s Mot. at 4. Defendant offers nothing further, noting only that \"the agency does not agree with the Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Banner Heart\n   </em>\n   , [but] it does not intend to re-litigate that issue at this time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Defendant points to no new evidence, intervening event, or other reason why remand is warranted. Consequently, the court is left with the unsettling sense that Defendant is schizophrenically applying\n   <em>\n    Banner Heart\n   </em>\n   , resulting in Plaintiffs having to expend considerable time and resources to challenge the Board's decision in this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In light of the foregoing, the court concludes Defendant has not put forward any \"substantial and legitimate\" reason justifying remand of this matter to the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs have properly opposed Defendant's Motion by clearly articulating that remand will prejudice them in this case. Plaintiffs note that it is unclear how long it will take the Board to rule on their request for expedited judicial review. Pl.'s Opp'n at 8. In particular, they point to the fact that nearly eight months passed between when the court issued its decision in\n   <em>\n    Banner Heart\n   </em>\n   and when CMS actually vacated the Board's prior decision and remanded the case to the Board for further proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs fear that this case will be subjected to the same amount of time lost before the Board even reconsiders their request for expedited judicial review. Already, Plaintiffs have lost the months it has taken to litigate and resolve the voluntary remand request.

P . 12(c) ;\n   <em>\n    Tapp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207441719\">\n    2016 WL 7441719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 &amp; n.6. Consequently, Plaintiffs' Cross-Motion is not ripe for review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Black\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310765\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/882/98/#p107\">\n    882 F.Supp.2d at 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Therefore, the court denies Plaintiffs' Cross-Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For all the reasons stated herein, the court concludes that neither remand nor an entry of judgment on the pleadings is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The court retains jurisdiction over this case, but is unable to grant any relief on the Complaint with this matter in its present posture. Although Plaintiffs' Complaint asks the court to invalidate the self-disallowance regulation as applied to them and all similarly situated plaintiffs, as well as allow them leave to file their substantive claims concerning the validity of the outlier regulations,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 19, there is no motion before the court that would allow it to grant such relief. Before the court can grant any relief on Plaintiffs' Complaint, the court must have before it Defendant's Answer and a proper motion for judgment on the pleadings that seeks such relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED. R. CIV. P . 7(a), 12(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The court offers the following thoughts for the parties' consideration in order to move these proceedings forward efficiently. In light of the reasons stated in this Memorandum Opinion and Order, once presented with an appropriate motion, the court is prepared to hold that Plaintiffs' appeal is properly before the court and that Plaintiffs may amend the Complaint to add their substantive claims concerning the outlier regulations. In other words, the court is prepared to grant Plaintiffs' relief on their Complaint insofar as Plaintiffs seek an affirmative judicial finding that the self-disallowance regulation does not bar their lawsuit and that leave to amend their Complaint is proper.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Banner Heart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12182319\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/201/131/\">\n    201 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   142 ; Compl. at 19. On the present record, however, even if Plaintiffs file a proper motion, the court is not prepared to rule on the broader legal question of whether the self-disallowance regulation is invalid as applied to all \"providers who, like Plaintiffs, seek to assert a legal challenge to a regulation or policy that cannot be addressed by a fiscal intermediary.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Banner Heart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12182319\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/201/131/\">\n    201 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   143 n.4 ; Compl. at 19. If Plaintiffs still seek such greater relief, then the court will need further briefing from the parties on that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   A simple stipulation would save substantial time and effort in this matter. The court commends to Defendant that it stipulate to the lesser relief the court is prepared to grant-namely, for the reasons already stated, that Plaintiffs' appeal is jurisdictionally proper and Plaintiffs may amend their Complaint to advance their substantive challenges. That stipulation would allow the parties to avoid an unnecessary\n   round of briefing. If Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint asks the court to invalidate not only the outlier regulations but also the self-disallowance rule as applied to all those similarly situated to them, then the parties can provide briefing on both issues on cross-motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The court will hold a status hearing on November 7, 2017, at 10:30 a.m., to address further proceedings in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Section 405.1835 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations no longer contains a self-disallowance requirement. Instead, effective January 1, 2016, the regulation only requires that \"[i]f the provider self-disallows a specific item\" in its cost report, then the provider must explain the nature and amount of the self-disallowed item, the amount of reimbursement sought, \"and why the provider self-disallowed the item instead of claiming reimbursement for the item.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.1835\">\n     42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.1835\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(2)(iii) (2016) ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.1835\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 405.1835(d)(2)(iii) (including the same language with respect to the required content of a request for a Board hearing based on an untimely contractor determination). Neither party makes any argument that the Board was bound to follow the current version of the regulation when issuing its decision in this matter. Accordingly, that issue is not before the court, and the court assumes that the Board applied the proper version of the regulation when making its ruling.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
