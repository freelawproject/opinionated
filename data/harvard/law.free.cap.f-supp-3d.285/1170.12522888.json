Plaintiff TBL Collectibles, Inc. owns and operates Colorado Coins, Cards &amp; Comics, a retail coin and collectibles store in Arvada, Colorado. Docket No. 62 at 2, \u00b6 1; Docket No. 63 at 3, \u00b6 2. At all times relevant to this action, plaintiff held an insurance policy with defendant Owners Insurance Company, that provided commercial property insurance coverage. Docket No. 63 at 3, \u00b6 1. On August, 30, 2015, plaintiff's store was burglarized after hours. Docket No. 62 at 3, \u00b6 4. The only items stolen were a floor safe and its contents.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    at 3, \u00b6 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Docket No. 62-19 at 7. As part of its investigation into the incident, the APD prepared an Incident/Investigation Report containing a list of the stolen items as reported by Bruce Wray, the co-owner and manager of the store. Docket No. 1 at 3, \u00b6 11; Docket No. 62-18 (APD Report); Docket No. 62-19 (APD Report continued); Docket No. 75 at 3 (stating that the \"APD generated an Incident and Investigation Report ('APD Report'), which also lists the coins Mr. Wray asserts were taken during the burglary\"); Docket No. 62 at 3, \u00b6 2 (stating that store is managed by owner of TBL, Bruce Wray). On August 31, 2015, plaintiff informed defendant of the loss and submitted a claim under the insurance policy. Docket No. 62 at 3, \u00b6 5. Defendant immediately assigned the claim to an adjuster, Jayme Larson. Docket No. 63 at 5, \u00b6 9. Ms. Larson contacted Mr. Wray on September 1, 2015.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On September 2, 2015, Ms. Larson visited the store, where she \"confirmed placement of the safe that was stolen by left over marks on the carpet.\" Docket No. 1 at 6, \u00b6 17; Docket No. 12 at 5, \u00b6 17; Docket No. 67-11 at 20 (September 8, 2015 claims note).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At defendant's request, plaintiff provided the following documentation to substantiate the loss: (1) a handwritten list of the stolen items, which included the description and cost of each coin; (2) the APD Report; (3) invoices and deposit slips from Cornerstone Bullion, from which plaintiff had purchased coins prior to the theft; and (4) check copies, cash receipts, and bank statements reflecting plaintiff's coin purchases in the four years prior to the theft.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 62 at 6, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18; Docket No. 67 at 8-9, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 5; Docket No. 62-24 at 6, 23:18-25 (discussing Cornerstone Bullion invoices and deposit slips); 62-25 (handwritten list of stolen items); Docket No. 62-26 at 2 (discussing invoices for coin purchases from Cornerstone Bullion); Docket No. 62-32 at 2 (discussing check copies and bank statements); Docket No. 67-2 at 3, 47:21-25 (noting that plaintiff\n   purchased certain coins from Cornerstone Bullion); Docket No. 67-4 (APD Report).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 6, 2015, defendant authorized a policy limit payment of $15,000 for the stolen cash. Docket No. 1 at 7, \u00b6 22; Docket No. 67-11 at 11. According to defendant, the Cornerstone Bullion invoices confirmed the existence of the cash in the safe. Docket No. 63 at 5, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10; Docket No. 62-24 at 6, 23:14-24:8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ms. Larson continued her investigation of the stolen coins.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 63-13 at 1; Docket No. 67-11 at 11. After discussions with the Home Office claims department, Ms. Larson ultimately concluded that the coins would be considered business personal property under the terms of plaintiff's insurance policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 63-13 at 1; Docket No. 67-11 at 9-10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   She determined, however, that the documentation provided did not adequately substantiate plaintiff's loss. Docket No. 62-29 at 2; Docket No. 63-13 at 2-3; Docket No. 67-11 at 5-7. Ms. Larson assigned a forensic accounting firm-RGL Forensics-to inspect plaintiff's business records. Docket No. 63-13 at 2. The accountant who reviewed the records, Paul DeBoer, determined that, although the records demonstrated a pattern of coin purchases, they did not prove the ownership or existence of the specific coins allegedly kept in the safe. Docket No. 63 at 6, \u00b6 15; Docket No. 68 at 5-6, \u00b6 15; Docket No. 62-32 at 2; Docket No. 67-11 at 3 (2/1/16 claims note).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Wray was unable to provide further documentation because he did not keep written records of the coins he bought and sold. Docket No. 63 at 4-5, \u00b6 8; Docket No. 68-5 at 9, 12. In addition, plaintiff admitted that many of the stolen items were purchased with cash and it did not have receipts. Docket No. 68-5 at 12-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 16, 2016, defendant sent plaintiff a letter denying its claim for the stolen coins. Docket No. 63-13.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The letter states: \"The documentation you have provided has show a pattern of purchasing coins, however it has not substantiated the specific coins you are claiming.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Citing plaintiff's failure to comply with that duty, the letter states that defendant is \"unable to issue any further payments on [plaintiff's] claim.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The March 16, 2016 letter does not reference fraud as a basis for defendant's denial of payment.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, Ms. Larson's claims notes indicate that she found Mr. Wray believable and perceived his continued purchasing activities after the loss to be \"an indication that the loss\n   [was] legitamite [sic].\" Docket No. 67-11 at 4 (2/1/16 claims notes entry). Both Ms. Larson and Donald Gibson, a representative in the Home Office claims department,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 62-24 at 7, 28:4-6; Docket No. 62-32, testified that they never determined Mr. Wray's claim was false or fraudulent.

On July 6, 2017, defendant moved for summary judgment on all claims. Docket No. 63. Both parties have also filed motions to exclude certain expert opinions under Fed. R. Evid. 702.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 54 (plaintiff's motion to exclude opinions of John Craver); Docket No. 83 (defendant's motion to exclude opinions of David Young).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. MOTIONS TO EXCLUDE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court will begin by addressing the parties' motions to exclude certain opinions of expert witnesses given that the outcome of those motions may affect the Court's resolution of the pending summary judgment motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The admissibility of expert testimony is governed by Federal Rule of Evidence 702, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if: (a) the expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Fed. R. Evid. 702. As the rule makes clear, while required, it is not sufficient that an expert be qualified based upon knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education to give opinions in a particular subject area.

The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   identified four non-exclusive factors a court may consider in assessing reliability; however, those factors are not applicable in every case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kumho Tire Co. v.

Instead, plaintiff seeks to exclude a number of his statements and opinions on grounds that: (1) they are irrelevant, (2) they improperly usurp the function of the trial judge, (3) they are conclusory, and (3) they are factually erroneous.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 54; Docket No. 61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

Rev. Stat. \u00a7 13-17-101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   are irrelevant and misleading because plaintiff may prevail on its bad faith claim under \u00a7 10-3-1115 merely by showing that defendant acted unreasonably in denying plaintiff's claim for insurance benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 54 at 9; Docket No. 61 at 4. Section 13-17-101 is a legislative declaration explaining that the general assembly has \"set[ ] forth provisions for the recovery of attorney fees ... when the bringing or defense of an action ... is determined to have been substantially frivolous, substantially groundless, or substantially vexatious.\" In his expert report, Mr. Craver states that \"[t]he absence of a reasonable basis [standard under \u00a7 10-3-1115 ] .... is quite similar to the proof required for attorney's fees awards under C.R.S. \u00a7 13-17-101\"; under the latter provision, \"fees are awarded if the claim is frivolous, groundless or lacking a rational basis.\" Docket No. 54-1 at 7. Defendant argues that these statements are admissible because they were only meant to illustrate that the \"absence of a reasonable basis\" standard under \u00a7 10-3-1115 is not a novel legal concept. Defendant also disavows any implication that plaintiff faces a higher burden under \u00a7 13-17-101. Defendant's arguments do not rebut plaintiff's contention that the statute is irrelevant to any issue in this case. Moreover, Mr. Craver's point that the absence of a reasonable basis is not a novel legal concept is neither relevant to the issues in this case nor likely to assist a jury in its resolution of the parties' factual disputes. Mr. Craver's statements and opinions regarding \u00a7 13-17-101 are therefore excluded as irrelevant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.Sparks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20Fed.%20Appx.%20906\">\n    8 Fed.Appx. 906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 912 (10th Cir. 2001) (unpublished) (\"The district court has been charged by the Supreme Court with the responsibility of acting as a gatekeeper to exclude unreliable and irrelevant expert testimony.\") (citing\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/#p589\">\n    509 U.S. at 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/#p589\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   );\n   <em>\n    A-W Land Co., LLC v.

Colo.

Mr. Craver states in his report that (1) \"there were no substantial delays in the adjustment\" of plaintiff's claim, Docket No. 54-1 at 9; (2) defendant's investigation of the claim was \"prompt and proactive,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%20321155\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; and (3) the policy benefits determined to be owed have been paid in a timely manner.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.

Docket No. 54 at 10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant responds that\n   the opinions regarding defendant's prompt claims handling \"support[ ] the position that Owners' basis for denying the safe claim was justified, because it illustrates Owners' claim handling practices with regard to related portions of the claim.\" Docket No. 60 at 6. The Court is not persuaded by this asserted connection. The fact that defendant timely investigated plaintiff's claim and awarded benefits on a portion of the loss does not make it any more likely that defendant had a reasonable basis for denying payment for the stolen coins. Accordingly, Mr. Craver's opinions regarding the timeliness of defendant's claims handling are irrelevant to plaintiff's bad faith claim and will be excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiff lastly requests that the Court exclude Mr. Craver's opinions regarding fraudulent insurance claims and Special Investigation Unit (\"SIU\") investigations. Docket No. 54 at 11-12. In his report, Mr. Craver states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   It should also be noted that the Colorado legislature, through C.R.S. \u00a7 10-1-128, makes it clear that there is a strong public policy within the state wherein the state is critically interested in investigating and stopping insurance fraud. The General Assembly has stated that insurance fraud is expensive and that it increases premiums and places businesses at risk. Insurance fraud reduces the customer's ability to raise their standard of living and decreases the economic vitality of the state. I am not suggesting here that Owners Insurance has alleged its insured is committing insurance fraud. I think it is simply important for a jury to know that a critical investigation into theft claims and the amount of the damages sustained, including the use of SIU departments to investigate background, credit and financial issues, is clearly authorized and in fact encouraged by the state's statutes and regulations. There was nothing unusual in an insurer conducting an SIU investigation in a claim of this nature.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Docket No. 54-1 at 9. Plaintiff contends that these opinions are irrelevant and prejudicial because there is no evidence that defendant suspected Mr. Wray of reporting a false or fraudulent claim. Docket No. 54 at 11. The Court agrees. Although plaintiff's claim was initially referred to the SIU for investigation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 60-4 at 2-5, 34:1-35:23, 40:1-41:1, there is no evidence that anyone at Owners suspected Mr. Wray of lying about the stolen coins.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 62-24 at 6-7, 24:14-25:4; Docket No. 67-11 at 4 (2/1/16 claim note); Docket No. 77-4 at 3, 15:6-13. The sole reason defendant gave for denying plaintiff's claim was that plaintiff had failed to provide adequate documentation of the stolen coins.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 63-13. Any statements or opinions regarding insurance fraud and SIU investigations will therefore be excluded as irrelevant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Statements Regarding Applicable Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiff identifies nineteen statements in Mr. Craver's expert report which allegedly constitute impermissible statements of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 54 at 6-7. These statements appear to set forth the various legal standards Mr. Craver applied in reaching his conclusions. According to defendant, the statements were meant to \"provide context as to the legal parameters for insurance industry standards.\" Docket No. 60 at 9-10. The Court notes that statements eleven through thirteen and nineteen, as identified in plaintiff's motion,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 54 at 7, have already been excluded as irrelevant. However, the Court agrees with plaintiff that statements one through eight and fourteen and fifteen should also be excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Tenth Circuit has held that \"a witness may refer to the law in expressing an opinion\" or \"aid the jury in understanding the facts in evidence even though reference to those facts is couched in legal terms.\"\n   <em>\n    Specht v.

However, witness testimony that aims to \"direct the jury's understanding of the legal standards upon which [its] verdict must be based\" improperly usurps the role of the trial judge and is therefore inadmissible.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10545659\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/853/805/#p809\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10545659\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/853/805/#p809\">\n    at 810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court finds that the first eight statements challenged by plaintiff fall within this prohibition.

Docket No. 60 at 10. But defendant's argument fails to distinguish between those statements of Mr. Craver that merely rephrase the determinative legal standard in this case-whether defendant acted reasonably in denying plaintiff's claim-and Mr. Craver's references to statutory and regulatory provisions that, though not conclusive of liability, may illustrate what constitutes \"reasonable\" conduct in the insurance industry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hangarter v.

Pursuant to this distinction, the Court finds that statements sixteen through eighteen regarding Regulation 5-1-14 are admissible. In contrast to the other challenged statements, Mr.\n   Craver's reference to the regulation is not an attempt to \"define the legal parameters within which the jury must exercise its fact-finding function.\"\n   <em>\n    Specht\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10545659\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/853/805/#p809\">\n    853 F.2d at 809-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court finds that the following challenged opinions in Mr. Young's expert report suffer from these flaws: (1) Ms. Larson lacked final authority regarding the claim, Docket No. 83-2 at 5; (2) the Home Office prevented Ms. Larson from paying plaintiff's claim and forced her to assert every possible argument against paying the claim,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268511\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/233/917/#p925\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; (3) \"[w]hen the value of the claim went up and the reserves were adjusted, the claim became harder to resolve,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268511\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/233/917/#p925\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; (3) \"[w]hen an insurer assigns its SIU to a claim it is to find a\n   reason not to pay the claim,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6;\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   (4) \"[w]hen the insured filed a police report with the Arvada Police Department, he subjected himself to investigation as to whether the filing of the police report was accurate because there are grave penalties to a party filing a false police report,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; and (5) through his testimony that every claim must be treated differently, \"Donald Gibson seems to be saying that Owners Insurance Company has no [standards for reasonable claims handling].\" Docket No. 83-3 at 3. Plaintiff argues that these opinions are \"extrapolated from the fact that Owners denied TBL's claim for failure to present a 'complete inventory' of stolen coins\" when plaintiff had already provided the handwritten list and APD Report and allowed access to its books and records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 84 at 12. But plaintiff's argument does not address, let alone remedy, Mr. Young's failure to explain the basis for each of his conclusions. Moreover, to the extent Mr. Young's opinions are based solely or primarily on his experience as a public adjuster, he was required to \"explain how that experience leads to the conclusion reached, why that experience is a sufficient basis for the opinion, and how that experience is reliably applied to the facts.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Fredette\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9379898\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/315/1235/#p1240\">\n    315 F.3d 1235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1240 (10th Cir. 2003) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 702 advisory committee's note to 2000 amendments). He has failed to do so. The Court therefore finds that the opinions identified above do not satisfy the foundational requirements of Fed. R. Evid. 702(b)-(d). Accordingly, those opinions will be excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Court reaches the opposite conclusion as to Mr. Young's statements regarding the legal standards applicable in this case. Defendant challenges the following statements in Mr. Young's report:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    Couch on Insurance\n   </em>\n   points out, however, that [a provision requiring the insured to provide an inventory of damaged and undamaged property] \"must be given a reasonable construction, and should not be used to relieve the insurer from liability for loss where literal compliance with the contract has become impossible....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Docket No. 83-2 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   Colorado Law (Colorado Revised Statute \u00a7 10-2-1104) requires an insurer to effectuate a prompt fair and equitable settlement of claims when liability has become reasonably clear.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   Colorado's Unfair Claims Practices Act requires each insurer to develop standards for reasonable claims handling. ( Colorado Revised Statute \u00a7 10-3-1104(h) ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Docket No. 83-3 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   State Statutes and Standard of Care in the Industry also dictate appropriate behavior in the adjustment of claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Defendant contends that these opinions are unreliable because Mr. Young fails to adequately describe the legal standards he cites. Docket No. 83 at 7. But defendant does not argue that Mr. Young's descriptions of the above-cited legal standards are inaccurate or that the standards themselves are irrelevant to the issues in the case. Accordingly, defendant's argument goes to the reliability of Mr. Young's application of the standards to the facts in this case, not to the reliability of his citations to\n   the standards themselves. Mr. Young's purported lack of comprehension as to the relevant legal standards may call into question the reliability of his ultimate conclusions regarding the reasonableness of defendant's conduct; however, it is not a sufficient basis for excluding any reference to the applicable legal standards. These opinions will therefore not be excluded.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Court further declines to exclude certain factual statements deemed \"erroneous\" by defendant. Defendant specifically challenges the following statements in Mr. Young's expert report: (1) \"Jayme Larson testified in her deposition that the conduct of Auto Owners in this case was unreasonable,\" Docket No. 83-2 at 3; (2) the applicable insurance policy requires the insured to submit to an examination under oath as a duty after loss,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4; (3) \"Owners would not accept [the hundred of pages of documents submitted by TBL Collectibles, including past business records and the Arvada Police Department Inventory, as] proof of the loss,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; and (4) Donald Gibson is an SIU adjuster. Docket No. 83-3 at 3; Docket No. 83 at 12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   To the extent these opinions or statements are inaccurate, the Court finds, as it did with respect to Mr. Craver's statements above, that the accuracy of Mr. Young's interpretation of the evidence is an issue more appropriately reserved for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Whether Opinions Will Assist the Trier of Fact\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Defendant argues that certain of Mr. Young's opinions will not assist the trier of fact because they are either irrelevant,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 83 at 8, or generally unhelpful to resolving the issues in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Defendant first contends that Mr. Young's opinions regarding the SIU have no bearing on the ultimate issues in the case-whether plaintiff complied with the terms of the policy and whether defendant acted unreasonably in denying the insurance claim. Docket No. 83 at 8. In his expert report, Mr. Young makes three references to the SIU. First, he observes that \"Mr. Gibson told [Ms. Larson] that this claim should be run past SIU,\" Docket No. 83-2 at 3. Second, he suggests that \"[t]he Home Office blocked [Ms. Larson] from paying the claim and forced her to throw every possible argument not to do so,\" including \"reporting the claim to the SIU.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Finally, Mr. Young opines that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   the SIU (Special Investigative Unit) is called upon to review claims when one or more issues exist: (1) there is suspected\n   fraud involved, (2) there is questions of coverage or (3) when the insurer suspects a lawsuit. When an insurer assigns its SIU to a claim it is to find a reason not to pay the claim. The SIU in this case saw no reason to proceed and, after a brief review, took the SIU out of further investigation of the claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant argues that the SIU investigation is entirely irrelevant to this case because defendant does not assert that Mr. Wray was dishonest in the reporting of his claim. Docket No. 83 at 9. The Court agrees. As discussed above, there is no evidence that defendant suspected plaintiff of having filed a false or fraudulent claim or that defendant denied plaintiff's claim on that basis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Mr. Young's statements regarding the SIU are not necessary to \"rebut any insinuation that Owners denied [plaintiff's] claim because TBL or its principle [sic], Bruce Wray, were being untruthful about the loss.\" Docket No. 84 at 10. These statements will therefore be excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Finally, defendant challenges Mr. Young's assertions that (1) \"Owners Insurance Company has attempted to create a level of ownership proof that the insured cannot meet when in fact, the insured HAS complied with the Duties After Loss provision of his policy,\" and (2) Owners has failed to \"effectuate a prompt fair and equitable settlement of claims.\" Docket No. 83-2 at 6; Docket No. 83 at 11. Defendant argues that these are unhelpful conclusory opinions because Mr. Young never explains what \" 'reasonableness' means within the context of insurance claims handling in Colorado\" or \"how Owners' failed to comport with such standards.\" Docket No. 83 at 11. The Court agrees. Although Mr. Young appears to base his opinions-at least in part-on the standards set forth in \u00a7 10-3-1104, he does not articulate the factual basis for his conclusions or explain how the standards applied relate to the issue of defendant's reasonableness. As the Supreme Court has noted, \"nothing in either\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   or the Federal Rules of Evidence requires a district court to admit opinion evidence that is connected to existing data only by the\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   of the expert.\"\n   <em>\n    Joiner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11471033\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/136/#p146\">\n    522 U.S. at 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11471033\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/136/#p146\">\n    118 S.Ct. 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, the dictionary definition of \"inventory\" is \"a detailed list of assets,\" \"an itemized list of current assets,\" or \"the quantity of goods or materials on hand,\"\n   <em>\n    Inventory\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014);\n   <em>\n    Inventory\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (11th ed. 2007), indicating that an \"inventory\" is simply a list of items. And although the parties do not cite any cases interpreting similar policy terms, decisions of this Court have taken for granted that a list of stolen items, created after a theft, can qualify as an \"inventory\" for insurance purposes.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Walker v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-cv-00118-PAB-STV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201386341\">\n    2017 WL 1386341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (D. Colo. Feb. 23, 2017) (noting that plaintiff \"provided an\n   <em>\n    inventory\n   </em>\n   of the stolen property\" where he supplied insurance company with list of stolen items after theft, but granting summary judgment for defendant on ground that plaintiff failed to comply with separate policy term requiring submission of \"bills, receipts, and related documents that substantiate the figure in the inventory\" (emphasis added) ),\n   <em>\n    report and recommendation adopted by\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201386346\">\n    2017 WL 1386346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.

Mar. 17, 2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Second, the phrase \"complete inventories\" contemplates more than a single record of purchases and sales. The phrase appears to require an insured to provide separate \"inventories\" of both damaged and undamaged property-a task that would be impossible before a loss occurs. Further, because the term \"complete\" is most naturally read as modifying both types of \"inventories,\" an insured satisfies\n   its obligations under duty five by providing, at the insurer's request, a complete inventory of damaged property and a complete inventory of undamaged property. Ms. Larson testified that she did not request a complete inventory of undamaged property,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , items not stolen. Docket No. 68-3 at 11, 133:18-24. Thus, plaintiff's list of stolen property appears to satisfy plaintiff's obligations under the plain language of duty five.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   This conclusion is further supported by duty five's use of the term \"include.\" Duty five states: \"give us complete inventories of the damaged and undamaged property. Include quantities, costs, values and amount of loss claimed.\" Docket No. 63-12 at 9. Because the word \"include\" instructs the policyholder how to create the \"complete inventories\" (i.e., make sure the inventory includes quantities, costs, etc.), it supports an interpretation of duty five that the inventories are created after the loss. Use of the word \"include\" as a directive is inconsistent with defendant's interpretation since, under defendant's theory, the inventory already exists. Directing the insured on what to include in the \"inventories\" makes sense only if the inventories are created after the loss. In this case, Mr. Wray supplied defendant with an inventory of stolen coins that he created from memory after the burglary. The Court finds that this satisfied plaintiff's obligations under the plain language of the insurance policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   To the extent that the term \"inventory\" is ambiguous, the Court reaches the same conclusion. Ambiguous policy terms must be \"construed against the insurer ... and in favor of the insured.\"\n   <em>\n    State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12254277\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/940/384/#p387\">\n    940 P.2d at 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, even if \"inventory\" is susceptible to defendant's interpretation, plaintiff's construction of the term as requiring only a list of items created after a loss must prevail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Defendant argues, in the alternative, that even if an \"inventory\" can be created from memory, the Court should grant summary judgment because plaintiff has provided no documentation substantiating the ownership or existence of the specific coins allegedly stolen.

Moreover, it is undisputed that defendant's denial of plaintiff's insurance claim was not predicated on plaintiff's failure to comply with this policy term.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Docket No. 62 at 5, \u00b6\u00b6 12, 14;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Colard\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10408384\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/709/11/#p15\">\n     709 P.2d at 15\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (holding that insurer waived right to assert particular defense to liability by not raising it until litigation following denial of insurance claim).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"36\">\n   <p id=\"p-186\">\n    Defendant disputes this fact, asserting that \"Paul DeBoer's analysis actually revealed that there was no substantiation of the existence of the coins.\" Docket No. 67 at 8, \u00b6 22.

Moreover, there is some indication in the record that DeBoer initially declined to express an opinion on whether the documents provided were sufficient to substantiate the claimed loss. Instead, he informed defendant that it was defendant's choice whether to base the claim on the \"exact documented loss\" or on plaintiff's \"spending pattern.\" Docket No. 67-11 at 3-4 (2/1/16 entry).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"37\">\n   <p id=\"p-187\">\n    Given the Court's determination that plaintiff complied with its obligations under the insurance policy, the Court need not address plaintiff's alternative argument that defendant has waived the right to require, and/or should be estopped from requiring, additional documentation substantiating plaintiff's claim.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Docket No. 68 at 15-17.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
