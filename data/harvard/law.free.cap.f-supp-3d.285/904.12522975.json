Mot., ECF No. 39; Mem. Supp., ECF No. 40. On December 4, 2017, the Claimant filed a Memorandum in Opposition to Motion to Reopen Limitation Action. Mem. Opp'n, ECF No. 41. On December 11, 2017, the Limitation Plaintiff filed a Reply. ECF No. 42. For the reasons below, the court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   the Limitation Plaintiff's Motion to Reopen. Consequently, the court\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSES WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   the Limitation Plaintiff's Motion for Entry of Judgment of Exoneration by Default (\"Motion for Entry of Judgment\"). ECF No. 32. Furthermore, the court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   the Claimant's Counsel's Motion to Withdraw because Counsel has provided no facts to enable the court to find withdrawal appropriate at this point. ECF No. 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 18, 2011, the Claimant filed a civil lawsuit against the Limitation Plaintiff in Newport News Circuit Court, alleging negligence, unseaworthiness, and failure to pay maintenance and cure, for injuries he sustained while working aboard the Limitation Plaintiff's vessel. ECF No. 1-1. On August 1, 2011, the Limitation Plaintiff submitted a Complaint in Admiralty for exoneration from or limitation of liability in this court pursuant to the Limitation of Liability Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2030501\">\n    46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 30501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 30512. ECF No. 1. On August 5, 2011, this court issued an Order of Publication and Stay, staying all other claims against the Limitation Plaintiff. ECF No. 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 28, 2011, the Claimant submitted the only Answer and Claim in the limitation action. ECF Nos. 12, 13. On December 1, 2011, the Claimant submitted a Motion to Lift Injunction and Stay Limitation Action in order to pursue his claims in Newport News Circuit Court. ECF Nos. 17-19. That Motion was granted on December 5, 2011. ECF No. 20. On November 27, 2012, this court issued an Order of Closure, administratively closing the present lawsuit, pending the conclusion of the Claimant's state court action. ECF No. 27. In the Order of Closure, the court provided that \"the parties have thirty (30) days in which to file to reopen this proceeding in this federal court at the conclusion of the state court action, if appropriate.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2030501\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 27, 2013, the Claimant's Counsel withdrew as counsel of record in his state action. ECF No. 28-1. Subsequently, the state lawsuit remained inactive in Newport News Circuit Court until June 2016. ECF No. 30-1. At that time, in light of the impending dismissal of the Claimant's suit for failure to prosecute under Virginia Code \u00a7 8.01-335(B), the Claimant requested and received an additional year to acquire new counsel and pursue his action.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2030501\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That one-year period expired\n   with no action by the Claimant, and on June 27, 2017, the Virginia court \"struck ... and discontinued\" the Claimant's case from its docket pursuant to \u00a7 8.01-335(B). ECF No. 31-1. In its Striking Order, the court provided that the case \"may be reinstated, on motion, after notice to the parties of interest ... within one year.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2030501\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 4, 2017, the Limitation Plaintiff filed a Motion for Entry of Judgment in this court, arguing that the Claimant had failed to prosecute the action in state court. Mot. Entry J., ECF No. 32; Mem. Supp. Entry J., ECF No. 33. The Claimant's Counsel, who continues to represent the Claimant in this court, filed a Memorandum in Opposition to Motion for Entry of Judgment on October 16, 2017. ECF No. 34. On October 23, 2017, the Claimant's Counsel filed to withdraw as counsel in this court as well. Mot. Withdraw, ECF No. 36; Mem. Supp. Mot. Withdraw, ECF No. 37. In an Order on October 30, 2017, the court held both motions in abeyance and directed the parties to file a motion to reopen, addressing whether the Claimant's \"state court action ha[d] concluded,\" as required per the court's Order of Closure. ECF No. 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In its instant Motion to Reopen, the Limitation Plaintiff argues that the Claimant's state court action has concluded because \"the state court has struck the action from its docket.\" Mem. Supp. at 2. The Limitation Plaintiff also claims that \"the purpose of the Court's [O]rder of [C]losure no longer exists\" because the Claimant \"has had an opportunity to litigate his claims in state court.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2030501\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2030501\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Claimant, through Counsel, responds that \"a lawsuit is not concluded until every legal option available to the plaintiff has been exhausted.\" Mem. Opp'n at 2. The Claimant also responds that \"[a] state court action is not concluded because it is struck from the state court's docket.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2030501\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In fact, Virginia courts have no discretion to deny the reinstatement of a discontinued claim because \u00a7 8.01-335(B)\"does not provide for notice or an opportunity to be heard before such cases are discontinued or dismissed.\"\n   <em>\n    JSR Mech.

It would also call into question the constitutionality of \u00a7 8.01-335(B) as applied to the Claimant, because the application of the statute would subject the Claimant to the consequences of a dismissal without affording him the benefit of the reinstatement period of \u00a7 8.01-335(B). Because the Claimant may still act to reinstate his claim, and because the Claimant's ability to do so pursuant to \u00a7 8.01-335(B) is essential to that provision's constitutionality, the court\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUDES\n   </strong>\n   that his state court action remains available and ongoing until the one-year period expires on June 28, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   For these reasons, the Limitation Plaintiff's Motion to Reopen is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   to refile it, and the Limitation Plaintiff's Motion for Entry of Judgment is, therefore,\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\n   </strong>\n   The Limitation Plaintiff is cautioned that any motion to reopen must be filed within thirty (30) days of the conclusion of the Claimant's state court action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order of Closure, ECF No. 27.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B.
