Plum Island\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plum Island is an 840-acre island off the coast of Southold in Long Island, New York. (Compl. [DE 1] \u00b6 1.) Plum Island has been owned and operated by the Federal Government since 1826, originally as an army fort. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In 1954, Plum Island was transferred to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (\"USDA\") to establish a research facility for foot-and-mouth disease. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.) In 2003, the Island was transferred to the DHS, but USDA continues to use the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (\"PIADC\") for research. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The total developed and maintained area of Plum Island consists of 170 acres, which includes 35 acres associated with the PIADC (including transportation facilities such as ferry docking and other support facilities) and 30 acres for the former Fort Terry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) Access to Plum Island has and continues to be limited due to the nature of the research conducted at the PIADC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) As a result of limited human interference Plum Island is a unique ecological resource with a largely undeveloped habitat for migratory birds, mammals, and other endangered species.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plum Island provides habitat for several federally endangered and threatened flora and fauna species. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49-56.) Among the federally-listed bird species that can be found on the Island are the Roseate Tern and the Piping Plover. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.) Federally listed plant species on the Island include the sandplain gerardia, seabeach knotweed, seabeach amaranth, and small whorled pogonia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.) There are also federally listed marine species that have been identified in the waters surrounding Plum Island, including Atlantic hawksbill sea turtles, Kemp's Ridley sea turtles, Atlantic Sturgeon, and others. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.) Additionally, several New York State threatened species are present on the island. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.) Finally, Plum Island is home to the largest \"seal haul-out area in southern New England.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Appropriations Act and the Subsequent Environmental Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On September 30, 2008, the President signed the \"Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance and Continuing Appropriations Act\" of 2008 (the \"2008 Appropriations Act\"). This Act, among other directives, provided that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [S]hould the Secretary of Homeland Security determine that the National Bio and Agro-defense Facility be located at a site other than Plum Island, New York, the Secretary shall liquidate the Plum Island Asset by directing the Administrator of General Services to sell through public sale all real and related personal property and transportation assets which support Plum Island operations, subject to such terms and conditions as necessary to protect government\n   interests and meet program requirements[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Pub.

The proceeds from the sale of Plum Island and the PIADC are to be used to purchase a new site and construct the National Bio and Agro-defense Facility (the \"Facility\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20Stat.%203574\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This intent was again reiterated in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 (the \"2012 Appropriations Act\"), which states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of law during fiscal year 2012 or any subsequent fiscal year, if the Secretary of Homeland Security determines that the National Bio- and Agro-defense Facility should be located at a site other than Plum Island, New York, the Secretary shall ensure that the Administrator of General Services sells through public sale all real and related personal property and transportation assets which support Plum Island operations, subject to such terms and conditions as may be necessary to protect Government interests and meet program requirements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Pub. L. No. 112-74 \u00a7 538(a). The 2012 Appropriations Act also requires that the \"proceeds of such sale ... shall be deposited as offsetting collections\" into a designated account \"and, subject to appropriation shall be available ...for site acquisition, construction, and costs related to the construction of the [new Facility].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20Stat.%203574\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 538(b). In the time since the 2008 Appropriations Act, there have been several attempts to repeal the law.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g,\n   </em>\n   Plum Island Conservation Act, S. 1675, 114th Cong. (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In January 2009, the DHS made a determination that the PIADC should be closed and its activities moved to a new location. (Singh Decl. Ex. 3 (January 16, 2009 ROD) at 3065.) As such, Defendants began the environmental review process pursuant to NEPA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In May 2010, Defendants held the required public scoping meetings regarding the scope of the EIS. (Compl. \u00b6 72.) Numerous governmental entities offered comments during the scoping period, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (\"FWS\"), and the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.) On July 20, 2012, Defendants, as joint lead agencies, issued the Draft EIS (\"DEIS\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87.) Defendants then held two public meetings regarding the DEIS on October 17 and 18, 2012. (Singh Decl. Ex. 5 (FEIS) at 1-8.) The DEIS received a total of 119 comments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at H-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On June 25, 2013, Defendants issued the Final EIS (\"FEIS\"). (Compl. \u00b6 107.) In response to the FEIS, Defendants received additional comments from state and federal agencies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 111-121.) For example, the EPA sent a letter stating that the FEIS had not considered \"an ordinance that would create a conservation area that would limit development and preserve much of the island\" and did not \"offer mitigation options as EPA recommended in our comment letter on the DEIS.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 116.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On August 29, 2013, Defendants issued a Record of Decision (\"ROD\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 122.) The ROD states that Defendants have \"proposed to transfer Plum Island, New York and its support facilities out of federal ownership by way of public sale. This Record of Decision (ROD) documents the decision to proceed with that process.\" (Singh Decl. Ex. 6 (August 29, 2013 ROD) at 1.) The conclusion to the ROD states the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Having given consideration to all of the factors discovered and analyzed during the NEPA process, it is the Joint Lead Agencies' decision to proceed with the Proposed Action. When the time frame for the DHS relocation from PIADC to\n   NBAF [the Facility] in Kansas is known, the Joint Lead Agencies will re-examine the EIS specifically for the purpose of ensuring that it reflects the then current knowledge of the conditions on the property, versus those conditions that existed on the date of this ROD, and will supplement the EIS as necessary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On July 7, 2016, Plaintiffs brought this action claiming that the EIS violates NEPA, the Appropriations Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"). (Compl. at 1.) In their Complaint, Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief and ask the Court to enjoin Defendants from completing the environmental review process and selling Plum Island until an adequate EIS has been completed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 217-22.) Defendants filed the instant motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on March 16, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A case may properly be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1)\"when the district court lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate it.\"\n   <em>\n    Makarova v.

Defendants contend that the test does apply, and that Plaintiffs' claims should be dismissed as unripe under each of the test's three elements. (Mem. in Supp. at 25.) Plaintiffs argue that the test does not apply to procedural harms under NEPA, but that even under\n   <em>\n    Ohio Forestry\n   </em>\n   test their claims are ripe for review. (Mem. in Opp. at 14 n. 3.) This Court declines to resolve the apparent confusion regarding whether the\n   <em>\n    Ohio Forestry\n   </em>\n   test controls or if final NEPA documentation is ripe for judicial review by its very nature. Rather, the Court assumes the\n   <em>\n    Ohio Forestry\n   </em>\n   factors apply, and finds that Plaintiffs' claims are ripe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   B. The Motion to Dismiss on Ripeness Grounds is Denied\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Defendants claim that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because there has been no finality to Defendants' action as they \"have not concluded their review, and any potential sale is years away and subject to multiple conditions precedent.\" (Mem. in Support [DE 33] at 2-3.) Plaintiffs counter that Defendants violated NEPA in numerous ways and that \"[e]ach and every one of these well-pleaded violations occurred the moment that Defendants issued their flawed FEIS and ROD.\" (Mem. in Opp. [DE 34] at 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Under the first\n   <em>\n    Ohio Forestry\n   </em>\n   factor, withholding consideration at this time could cause significant hardship to Plaintiffs as they may not have another opportunity to seek appropriately robust environmental review. For example, Defendants cannot point to any specific section of the ROD or FEIS where they have committed to undertaking further review of alternatives. Even if Defendants do supplement their environmental review in the future, they have stated that they will do so to \"ensure that [their review] reflects the then current knowledge of the conditions on the property, versus those conditions that existed on the date of this ROD[.]\" (Singh Decl. Ex. 6 (August 29, 2013 ROD) at 5.) The FEIS echoes this language by stating that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   [T]he Joint Lead Agencies may have to supplement the EIS when the timing of the sale becomes clearer ... [at which time] the Joint Lead Agencies will be able to re-examine what further work should be done to\n   <em>\n    bring it up to date\n   </em>\n   to ensure that the federal government meets its responsibilities[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (Singh Decl. Ex. 5 (FEIS) at ES-12, 2-1) (emphasis added).) Neither of these statements, nor anything else in the record, indicate that Defendants will conduct further analysis of alternatives, and the alternatives analysis is at the heart of NEPA review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Furthermore, Defendants issued a ROD setting forth their decision to proceed with a public sale of the entirety of Plum Island even though they concede that supplemental review will be required. The ROD does not state that Defendants will review their decision to proceed with the sale based on the results of that supplemental review, which suggests that any future review will be limited in scope and that the decision to sell may be a fait accompli. Withholding consideration could harm Plaintiffs through the ramifications of Defendants' alleged failure to conduct appropriately thorough environmental review, which does not appear likely to be remedied by supplemental environmental review of changed conditions on the property. Therefore, the first element is met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Under the second\n   <em>\n    Ohio Forestry\n   </em>\n   factor, there is no reason for the Court to believe that judicial intervention would inappropriately interfere with further administrative action. As discussed directly above, the\n   FEIS and ROD are final environmental documents and there is little likelihood based on the facts presented that the limited scope of proposed future environmental review will overcome all of the alleged shortcomings of the FEIS. Additionally, even if Defendants were to undertake supplemental review at some uncertain time in the future, an interim robust analysis of alternatives, for example, would have no negative impact on the future environmental review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Under the final\n   <em>\n    Ohio Forestry\n   </em>\n   factor, there is nothing in the record to suggest that there would be a benefit to awaiting further factual development of the issues presented. Defendants have issued an FEIS and a ROD setting out their decision. Based on the language in these documents quoted above, it does not seem that any supplemental environmental review prior to the sale of Plum Island will be sufficiently robust or include additional analysis of alternatives. Notably, Defendants never state in their moving papers that they will consider additional alternatives at any time in the future. Rather, they state that \"the ROD at issue here does not expressly exclude the option of revisiting the alternatives considered[.]\" (Reply Mem. in Further Supp. [DE 35] at 8.) This language does not establish any kind of commitment, or even likelihood, that Defendants will revisit the alternatives section or review alternatives they have not yet considered. Therefore, the Court sees no reason to wait for further factual development.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   As such, Plaintiffs meet the\n   <em>\n    Ohio Forestry\n   </em>\n   test for ripeness. However, even if they had not met this test, there is sufficient logic to the dicta in\n   <em>\n    Ohio Forestry\n   </em>\n   stating that a NEPA claim can never be riper than at the time of the procedural failure. Defendants expended a significant amount of ink trying to distinguish an FEIS from a final agency decision for purposes of judicial review. However, this Court is not convinced by the hair-splitting. In the case Defendants cite, the Second Circuit found that a challenge to a draft EIS-for which an FEIS had been prepared and made available but for which there was no ROD-was not ripe.\n   <em>\n    Greene\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"228638\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/490/256/#p258\">\n    490 F.2d at 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Defendants have issued an FEIS and a ROD. The ROD repeatedly sets out Defendants' decision to proceed with the sale of Plum Island, irrespective of the result of future environmental review. The ROD's mentions of supplemental environmental review at some unknown future date does not negate the finality of these agency actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   For all of these reasons, Defendants' motion to dismiss on the basis that Plaintiffs' claims are not ripe for review is rejected as unconvincing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Finally, Defendants note that Plaintiffs do not have an ongoing right of access to Plum Island and that \"Plum Island is not a public property held in trust for the people pursuant to the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976.\" (Mem. in Opp. at 31.) While Defendants do not specifically argue that this lack of public access undermines Plaintiffs' standing, they do state that any admittance to Plum Island has been solely at the discretion of the DHS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plaintiffs respond that they have the required connection to the area of concern because each Plaintiff and their members \"live, work, and recreate in the communities and waters surrounding Plum Island.\" (Mem. in Opp. at 27 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ocean Advocates v.

Plaintiffs claim that they or their members sail, boat, bird-watch, marine-life watch, and otherwise study and enjoy the environment on and around Plum Island. (Mem. in Opp. at 28.) For example, Plaintiff Ruth Ann Bramson organizes community tours of the Island, during which she and her tour groups \"observe and appreciate the wildlife and woodlands of Plum Island.\" (Compl. \u00b6 16.)

For purposes of this motion to dismiss, Plaintiffs have met that burden by alleging that their members have used and will continue to use the Plum Island environment for bird-watching, animal-watching, etc. The prospect of injury to Plaintiffs' direct aesthetic and recreational interests in the Plum Island environment is sufficient to plead an injury-in-fact under NEPA. The fact that Plaintiffs have no ongoing right to access Plum Island does not impede their ability to bird-watch or animal-watch on the Island, to boat along the coast of the Island, to fish in the Island's waters, to enjoy the scenic vista of the Island from the land or surrounding sea, or to traverse the Island itself with permission for the foregoing purposes as Plaintiff Bramson has done numerous times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Finally, it is inconsequential that Defendants \"have not yet determined the exact method of public sale\" or that \"Plaintiffs are free to purchase the property, if it is publicly sold.\" (Mem. in Opp. at 30.) Plaintiffs are seeking to enforce a procedural right, namely, the requisite thorough environmental review under NEPA. Thus, the injury-in-fact does not stem from how Defendants will sell the Island or who buys the Island, but rather from Defendants' alleged failure to comply with the proper procedure. Such alleged injury occurred at the time the FEIS and ROD were issued. The proposed future environmental review is unlikely to remedy this injury because Defendants, by their own language, have only made the commitment to supplement the FEIS and ROD as is necessary to update the documents to reflect the then-current environmental conditions. Therefore, Defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to allege an imminent injury-in-fact is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Prudential Mootness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Defendants' final argument is that even if the Court finds that it has subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' claims, the Court should decline to exercise its jurisdiction pursuant to the doctrine of prudential mootness \"to permit the agencies the opportunity to conclude their administrative process under NEPA, the ESA, and the CZMA.\" (Mem. in Support at 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The \" '[p]rudential mootness doctrine often makes it appearance in cases where a plaintiff starts off with a vital complaint but then a coordinate branch of government steps in to promise the relief she seeks.' \"\n   <em>\n    Kurtz v. Kimberly-Clark Corporation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310164\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/321/482/\">\n    321 F.R.D. 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D.N.Y. 2017) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Winzler v. Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3884567\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/681/1208/#p1210\">\n    681 F.3d 1208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1210 (10th Cir. 2012) ). Here, no other branch of government can step in to promise Plaintiffs the relief they seek by way of the requisite environmental review under NEPA because Defendants are the lead agencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Thus, the Court is not swayed that it would be appropriate to invoke the prudential mootness doctrine here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Moreover, the single case that Defendants cite in which a district court dismissed NEPA claims under this doctrine is easily distinguished. In\n   <em>\n    Los Alamos Study Grp. v. U.S. Dep't of Energy\n   </em>\n   , the lead agencies were in the process of supplementing their EIS with a Supplemental EIS (\"SEIS\") that would\n   <em>\n    supersede\n   </em>\n   the original EIS being challenged.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4192214\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/794/1216/#p1222\">\n    794 F.Supp.2d 1216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1222-23 (D.N.M. 2011),\n   <em>\n    aff'd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3514949\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/692/1057/\">\n    692 F.3d 1057\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2012). It easy to understand in that situation why the Court exercised its discretion to find that plaintiffs' standing to challenge the soon-to-be superseded EIS was prudentially moot. That is not the case here, where Defendants have issued a ROD setting out their decision and are not in the process of conducting supplemental environmental review or issuing an SEIS that will supersede the FEIS. The ROD's references to future environmental review at the time of the sale/transfer of Plum Island does not render the current FEIS and ROD interlocutory. In fact, there is no indication whatsoever that any future environmental review would supersede the allegedly insufficient sections of the current FEIS. Therefore, the Court rejects Defendants' request that it decline to exercise jurisdiction pursuant to the doctrine of prudential mootness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. ESA and CZMA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   As a final note, the Court acknowledges Defendants' argument that Plaintiffs also lack standing to bring claims under the ESA and the CZMA. In reviewing the Complaint, none of the eight causes of action allege a violation of the ESA independent of NEPA, the Appropriations Act, and/or the APA. While the seventh cause of action does allege a violation of NEPA, the APA,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the CZMA for failure to perform a consistency determination, Plaintiffs then go on to specify that NEPA expressly incorporates this requirement. (Complaint at \u00b6 194;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Opp at 21 n.6.) Plaintiffs also clarified in a letter to the Court dated October 27, 2016, that they \"do not allege a stand-alone violation of the CZMA.\" (\n   <em>\n    See Mem. in Support\n   </em>\n   at 13 n. 7 (citing Oct. 27, 2016 Letter in Response to Defendants' Letter at 3.) Therefore, there is no need for the Court to analyze whether it has subject matter jurisdiction over standalone claims under the ESA and the CZMA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Plum Island's unique ecological resources has been attested to by Plaintiffs and by numerous members of the government.
