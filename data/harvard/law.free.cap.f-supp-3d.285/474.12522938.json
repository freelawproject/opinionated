INTRODUCTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On April 26, 2013, Hoff Stauffer, as administrator of the estate of his late father, Carlton Stauffer, (the \"Estate\") sought a refund for overpaid taxes for the year ending on December 31, 2006. The claim was submitted past the October 15, 2010 deadline applicable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206511\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Estate, however, submitted a statement by Stauffer's treating psychologist alleging that Stauffer had suffered from a \"financial disability\" that justified suspension of the limitations period under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206511\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(2). The IRS nevertheless denied the claim as untimely because the psychologist's letter did not satisfy the requirement of Revenue Procedure 99-21 that a person claiming financial disability submit a statement from a \"physician,\" which is defined as a \"doctor of medicine or osteopathy\" and excludes psychologists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Estate sued. The IRS moved to dismiss, arguing that this court lacks jurisdiction because the Estate did not properly file its refund claim during the limitations period. On February 24, 2017, the Magistrate Judge issued a report recommending that the motion be denied because the IRS did not justify its decision not to consider the statement from Stauffer's psychologist as proof of his disability. For the reasons explained below, the court is adopting in part and modifying in part the Report and Recommendation, and the motion to dismiss is being denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   II.

His son, Hoff Stauffer, became the administrator of his estate. While closing the Estate, Hoff Stauffer discovered that his father had not filed tax returns for the tax years 2006 through 2012. Accordingly, on April 26, 2013, Hoff Stauffer filed those returns with the IRS. Stauffer claimed that his father overpaid taxes for the 2006 tax year in the amount of $137,403.

The IRS moved to dismiss the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 19. The IRS argued that the suit is barred by sovereign immunity because the Estate failed to file a timely claim for a refund with the agency. The court referred the case to the Magistrate Judge for pretrial purposes and a Report and Recommendation on the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On February 14, 2017, the Magistrate Judge issued his report and recommended that the motion be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   V.

By Revenue Procedure 99-21, the IRS \"requires\" that a refund claim must be submitted in a particular \"manner:\" with a doctor's note attached. Therefore, to be \"duly filed\" as required by the terms of the Internal Revenue Code's limited waiver of sovereign immunity, an untimely refund claim must be submitted with a letter from a medical doctor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3509194\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/691/992/#p995\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3509194\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/691/992/#p995\">\n    at 995\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Accordingly, in\n   <em>\n    Abston\n   </em>\n   , the Eighth Circuit held that a district court must dismiss a refund suit in which the taxpayer did not substantially comply with Revenue Procedure 99-21.

No. 19). Hoff Stauffer (\"the plaintiff\" or Stauffer) is the administrator of the estate of his late father, Carlton Stauffer. In 2013, Stauffer filed several years' worth of estate tax returns with the United States Internal Revenue Service (the IRS or \"the defendant\"), and requested for the 2006 tax year a refund for an overpayment of more than $100,000. The IRS denied the claim as untimely under the statute. The plaintiff concedes that he filed the refund claim late but argues that the limitations period was tolled because his father was financially disabled during the relevant period. The defendant argues that the failure to comply with the statute's timing requirements divests the Court of subject matter jurisdiction. For the reasons discussed below, I recommend that the defendant's motion to dismiss be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    I. RELEVANT FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The relevant facts framing the lawsuit are apparently not in dispute. Carlton Stauffer passed away in October 2012 at the age of 90 and the plaintiff became the administrator of the estate. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6). In the course of fulfilling that role the plaintiff discovered that his father had neglected to file tax returns for the tax years 2006 through 2012. (Compl. \u00b6 6). Seeking\n   to rectify the delinquency, the plaintiff filed the outstanding returns on or about April 26, 2013. (Compl. \u00b6 7). Relevant here, the estate claimed that it overpaid taxes for the 2006 tax year by $137,403, and the plaintiff accordingly requested a refund for that amount. (Compl. \u00b6 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   On or about February 18, 2014, the IRS denied the request for refund as untimely under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206511\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Compl. \u00b6 8). The plaintiff pursued the claim via the IRS's internal appeals process. (Compl. \u00b6 8). The IRS will excuse a late filing if the taxpayer was \"financially disabled.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206511\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h). In that regard, the plaintiff submitted a written explanation from a licensed psychologist who had previously treated Carlton Stauffer from 2001 until his death in 2012. (Compl. \u00b6 9). The psychologist's explanation detailed a variety of mental and physical conditions which, he opined, had prevented Carlton Stauffer from managing his financial affairs from at least 2006 until his death. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   By letter dated December 2, 2014, the IRS preliminarily rejected the plaintiff's claim. (Compl. \u00b6 11). The IRS stated that while it will accept an explanation from a \"physician,\" a psychologist is not a physician under the definition contained in Revenue Procedure 99-21. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 11-12). On January 7, 2015, the IRS formally denied the plaintiff's claim for a refund. (Compl. \u00b6 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Among other things, and relevant here, Revenue Procedure 99-21 provides that one claiming a financial disability must submit \"a written statement by a physician\n   <em>\n    (as defined in \u00a7 1861(r)(1) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(r) )\n   </em>\n   , qualified to make the determination ...\" R.P. 99-21, \u00a7 4(1) (emphasis added). As such, Revenue Procedure 99-21 does not itself define the term \"physician,\" but instead borrows a definition of the term as used by the Social Security Administration (SSA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   As an initial matter, it is not patently obvious what the IRS deems the definition of \"physician\" to be in this context. The revenue procedure refers to section \"1861(r)(1)\" but that is confusing because section 1861(r) does not formally contain any subsections. Rather, section 1861(r) sets out in one large paragraph a definition for the term \"physician\" that includes five enumerated categories of professionals, including: (1) \"a doctor of medicine or osteopathy,\" (2) \"a doctor of dental surgery or of dental medicine,\" (3) \"a doctor of podiatric medicine,\" (4) \"a doctor of optometry,\" and (5) \"a chiropractor.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1861(r). Assuming as a matter of common sense that the IRS's reference to a subsection one is meant to refer to the first enumerated category, some confusion still remains\n   because the revenue procedure directly links section \"1861(r)(1)\" to \" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(r)\"-a statute that essentially tracks verbatim the wording and format of section 1861(r), but does not contain a corresponding reference to a subsection one. Indeed, section 1395x(r), like section 1861(r), does not formally contain any subsections. So, is the reference to a subsection one in section 1861(r)(1) a scrivener's error, or is it meant to purposely narrow the scope of the meaning of a physician to a doctor of medicine or osteopathy?

The precedent cited above suggests that even if not accorded\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference, a revenue procedure may warrant deference if it survives scrutiny under the\n   <em>\n    Skidmore\n   </em>\n   standard.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Navarro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9495058\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/261/90/\">\n    261 F.3d at 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (choosing to apply\n   <em>\n    Skidmore\n   </em>\n   standard to agency's regulation where\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference not warranted).

This is where\n   the IRS's reliance on Revenue Procedure 99-21 falls short.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The purpose of Revenue Procedure 99-21 is to provide guidance for taxpayers who need to show a disability under section 6511 to excuse their late filing. To that extent, Revenue Procedure 99-21 at its most basic level requires the taxpayer to bring a doctor's note, an entirely reasonable proposition. However, section 6511(h) allows a disability to be based on a showing of a \"mental impairment\" and Revenue Procedure 99-21 directly undermines that goal where it demands a note from a physician but then defines that term to exclude a whole class of professionals generally considered competent to opine on the existence of a mental impairment. On the record before the Court, there is no evidence that the IRS has considered the implications of its interpretation of the word \"physician\" as used in the revenue procedure. On the contrary, and as noted, Revenue Procedure 99-21 was drafted principally by a single IRS employee who without elaboration or explanation selected a definition of \"physician\" as used by the SSA. In the absence of additional information, there is just no basis to assess the soundness of the IRS's interpretation of the word \"physician\" in Revenue Procedure 99-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Moreover, if the IRS's goal was to look to the SSA for instructive guidance on who may be competent to opine on a disability based on a physical or mental impairment, then its interpretation of the word \"physician\" in Revenue Procedure 99-21 directly contravenes that purpose, because the SSA\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   permit psychologists to opine on whether an individual is disabled as a result of a mental impairment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1527\">\n    20 CFR \u00a7 404.1527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) (\"[m]edical opinions are statements from physicians\n   <em>\n    and psychologists\n   </em>\n   or other acceptable medical sources that reflect judgments about the nature and severity of your impairment(s)....\") (emphasis added).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Weiler v.

Mass. 1996) (\"The opinion of a treating psychologist is considered an acceptable medical source under the treating-physician rule.\"). Indeed, the SSA and IRS both use definitions of \"disability\" that are in relevant part virtually identical.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20423\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A) (\"The term \"disability\" means the inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity\n   <em>\n    by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months.\n   </em>\n   \") with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206511\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(2)(A) (\"an individual is financially disabled if such individual is unable to manage his financial affairs\n   <em>\n    by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment of the individual which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\n   </em>\n   \") (emphasis added). So, to the extent the goal underlying Revenue Procedure 99-21 was to implement a disability-determination process based on principles consistent with those of the SSA, the interpretation of \"physician\" urged by the government here undermines that purpose where the SSA treats psychologists as physicians and welcomes their medical opinions in disability determination matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   To be clear, this is not to suggest that the IRS should have also incorporated the SSA's regulation endorsing the acceptance of medical opinions from psychologists, or defined \"physician\" more broadly to encompass and reflect the SSA's practice. Rather, the point is that where the IRS has taken its definition of \"physician\" from an agency that demonstrably does not interpret it in practice to exclude psychologists from opining on a patient's impairment, the failure of the IRS to provide any insight explaining the deliberative process\n   it went through in implementing Revenue Procedure 99-21 gives rise to the concern that the IRS did not thoroughly consider the implications of interpreting the word \"physician\" as it did, or how applying that definition might thwart a taxpayer's ability to show a legitimate mental impairment-based disability, or how, if the IRS did consider such things, why the policy should nonetheless be enforced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Perhaps the IRS is in possession of such information. On the present record, though, I am not persuaded that the Court should defer to the defendant's view that a psychologist's statement describing a mental impairment cannot constitute a physician's statement within the meaning of Revenue Procedure 99-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   None of the authority cited by the defendant compels a different result. In\n   <em>\n    Abston v.

Similarly, all of the cases cited by the\n   <em>\n    Abston\n   </em>\n   court and relied on by the defendant either explicitly involve\n   <em>\n    physical\n   </em>\n   impairments-the sort of impairment one might not consider a psychologist competent to comment on, or make no mention of the type of impairment, but none discusses the appropriateness of relying on a psychologist's statement to satisfy Revenue Procedure 99-21 or section 6511(h). The defendant does cite to one case where the Tax Court observed that a psychologist is not a physician under Revenue Procedure 99-21.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Green v. Commissioner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20T.C.M.%201542\">\n    97 T.C.M. (CCH) 1542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). In that case, however, the IRS itself appears to have accepted and considered the psychologist's letter opining that the taxpayer suffered from a mental impairment, and instead argued only that the facts demonstrated that the taxpayer was actually able to handle her financial affairs and thus was not disabled.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20T.C.M.%201542\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Regardless, the Tax Court has also noted that revenue procedures are not entitled to deference where, as here, \"[t]here is no reasoning in support of the conclusion stated in the revenue procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    Corbalis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3580015\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tc/142/46/#p54\">\n    142 T.C. at 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In sum, I conclude that the defendant's interpretation of the term \"physician\" in Revenue Procedure 99-21 is not entitled to deference here. I conclude further that to the extent the psychologist's statement the plaintiff submitted supports a financial disability based on a mental impairment, the IRS was not required to reject it on the ground that it did not constitute a \"physician's\" statement. Consequently, I find no basis on this record to deem the plaintiff's claim for refund untimely under section 6511(h), and thus do not agree that the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the plaintiff's suit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.

First, the defendant argues that even assuming a psychologist's statement is acceptable, the plaintiff's claim still fails because the plaintiff did not submit the statement at the same time he submitted the claim for refund, but instead submitted it with the estate's initial appeal. I reject this argument, as have other courts. Where refund claims may technically be deficient by virtue of missing some piece of information, the practice is to accept the missing information at a later stage so it and the taxpayer's claim may be considered.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Abston\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3509194\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/691/992/#p995\">\n     691 F.3d at 995\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (where claim for refund was denied as untimely for failure to submit certain information, plaintiff permitted on appeal to IRS to submit the missing information);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Walter v. United States\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%205062391\">\n     2009 WL 5062391\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *10 (W.D. Pa. Dec. 16, 2009) (\"No case has ever held that a treating physician's statement that contains a technical deficiency that is easily corrected is insufficient under 6511(h). On the contrary, there is a doctrine of allowing informal refund claims that are 'deficient merely in one or two of the technical requirements imposed by the Treasury regulation.' \") (quoting\n    <em>\n     Commissioner v. Ewing\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"31345\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/439/1009/#p1015\">\n     439 F.3d 1009\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1015 (9th Cir. 2006) ). Finally, the defendant argues in a closing footnote, and without citation to any authority, that it is \"questionable\" whether the psychologist was qualified to opine that Carlton Stauffer was disabled where the psychologist appears to have based his determination in part on the taxpayer's physical ailments, matters outside a psychologist's area of expertise. The sufficiency of the psychologist's statement is not before the Court so there is no need to address this claim. But, even assuming the psychologist may not have been qualified to assess the significance of Mr. Stauffer's physical impairments, it does not mean that his mental impairments were not sufficient on their own to support a determination of financial disability.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
