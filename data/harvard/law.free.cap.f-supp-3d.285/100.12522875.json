MCFADDEN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Organic Consumers Association (\"Plaintiff\") brings this action under the District of Columbia Consumer Protection Procedures Act (\"CPPA\"), seeking to prevent Defendant Hain Celestial Group, Inc. (\"Hain Celestial\") from labeling its \"Earth's Best\" infant and toddler formula products as \"organic,\" at least when those products are in the District of Columbia. The complaint's only count alleges that the products contain synthetic ingredients that are not permitted under the federal Organic Food Production Act of 1990 (\"OFPA\"), and thus the \"organic\" label is a misrepresentation that violates the CPPA. Hain Celestial moves to dismiss, contending,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that private enforcement of organic labeling via state law is preempted by the OFPA. For the reasons that follow, I conclude that Plaintiff's claim is federally preempted, and grant the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff filed a single-count complaint in D.C. Superior Court, alleging that Hain Celestial's infant and toddler formulas under the \"Earth's Best\" brand (the \"Challenged Products\") contain \"[a]t least 29 ingredients\" (the \"Challenged Ingredients\") not permitted under the OFPA. Compl. 4. According to Plaintiff, these ingredients are \"nonagricultural substances,\" some of which pose health risks\n   to the public, and all of which are illegal in \"organic\" infant formula because they are not permitted under the OFPA and its regulations. Compl. 4, 12-23. Plaintiff seeks a declaration that Defendant's conduct in marketing the Challenged Products violates the CPPA, an order enjoining the conduct and requiring \"corrective advertising and revised labeling,\" costs and disbursements (including attorneys' fees), and punitive damages. Compl. 27-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Hain Celestial removed to federal court on the basis of diversity and federal question jurisdiction, and Plaintiff did not contest the removal.

Although Plaintiff seeks to enforce those national standards, it misunderstands the explicit method that Congress adopted for unfolding and enforcing them: certifying agents managed by the USDA. Through a national system of approved certifying agents, the USDA ensures that products marked \"organic\" have been produced according to an approved organic plan. Non-compliance with the OFPA and its implementing regulations can result in revocation of a certification, and civil penalties.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20205.66\">\n    7 C.F.R. \u00a7 205.66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By regulating \"organic\" products through a national certification process, rather than state-by-state lawsuits, the OFPA ensures that a truly national standard exists. If Plaintiff were allowed to proceed and prevail in this action, the immediate result would be that Hain Celestial would not be able to market the Challenged Products in the District of Columbia, while the status quo would remain unchanged in the rest of the nation. What was once a truly national standard would no longer be uniform. Even after a sustained process of state-by-state litigation, unanimity would be unlikely to result, since the relevant state statutes will vary, and the underlying merits of the federal question-actual compliance with the OFPA-is not an easy victory for either side.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Second, the OFPA was enacted \"to assure consumers that organically produced products meet a consistent standard.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206501\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2). Plaintiff's suit could certainly help to assure consumers that OFPA standards were rigorously enforced. However, the suit could also confuse a well-informed consumer about the standard itself. If Plaintiff prevailed here, a savvy consumer would know that the Challenged Products are not considered \"organic\" in Washington D.C., but would wonder why they were labeled as \"organic\" elsewhere. In other words, the suit would not help \"assure consumers that ... products meet a\n   <em>\n    consistent\n   </em>\n   standard.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206501\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Third and finally, the OFPA was intended \"to facilitate interstate commerce in ... food that is organically produced.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206501\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3).
