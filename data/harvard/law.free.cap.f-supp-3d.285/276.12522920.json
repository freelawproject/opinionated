(Baldino's) brought suit against Google\n   LLC and two online directories in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The suit alleged that the defendants had violated the Lanham Act and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) by listing numerous scam locksmiths on their websites, thus harming the plaintiff's business.\n   <em>\n    Baldino's Lock &amp; Key Serv., Inc. v.

The district court dismissed the case, reasoning that the defendants enjoyed immunity under the Communications Decency Act (CDA) as providers of an \"interactive computer service\" against a suit trying to hold them \"liable for content originating with a third-party information content provider,\" and that each count independently failed to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307488\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/88/543/#p546\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307488\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/88/543/#p546\">\n    at 546-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Fourth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision without mention of the CDA, since Baldino's had abandoned all RICO claims on appeal, and the Lanham Act claim failed because the district court had \"correctly determined\" that the \"locksmiths who generated the information that appeared on Defendants' websites are solely responsible for making any faulty or misleading representations.\"\n   <em>\n    Baldino's Lock &amp; Key Serv., Inc. v.

This time, the suit names search engine providers Google, Yahoo! Inc., and Microsoft Corporation (the Providers) as defendants. Baldino's is now the lead plaintiff in a putative class action, joined by licensed locksmiths from around the country (the Locksmiths), who allege that the Providers are burying legitimate locksmiths under scam locksmiths in search results on the Providers' websites, forcing legitimate locksmiths to pay for premium advertising slots or face the reality of an eroding customer base. First Am. Compl. 8-9 (Compl.). The Locksmiths allege violations of the Lanham Act and the Sherman Antitrust Act, and assert five state law causes of action. In an effort to avoid a repeat outcome, the Locksmiths emphasize that the Providers create mapping information based on scam locksmiths' allegedly false location claims, contending that the Providers have thus created original content not immunized by the CDA. Nonetheless, the Providers move to dismiss, claiming that they enjoy immunity under the CDA for seven of the eight counts, that all counts independently fail to state a claim, and that claim preclusion bars Baldino's allegations against Google. Defs.' Mot. Dismiss i, 4-24. For the reasons that follow, I conclude that CDA immunity bars all of the Locksmiths' claims except for breach of contract, and that the Locksmiths have failed to adequately plead that claim. Accordingly, all counts will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

In contrast, the Locksmiths allege that they are licensed and/or registered to perform their trade pursuant to the requirements of their respective jurisdictions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-8, 11-12. Because states publish public lists of licensed locksmiths and registered businesses, the Locksmiths allege that the Providers have actual knowledge of which locksmiths are scammers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Locksmiths allege that the Providers not only re-publish information generated by the scam locksmith websites, but also \"enhance those listings ... by creating brand new original content not found on the original web sites.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.

For example, \"if a scam locksmith states that it is located in Falls Church, Virginia, but gives no location information, the search engine will create a map and arbitrarily place a pinpoint someplace in Falls Church. The map and pinpoints are created entirely by the search engine provider, not by 'another.' \" Opp. to Defs.' Mot. Dismiss 5 (Opp.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   By thus burying legitimate locksmiths under scam listings that appear legitimate and local, the Locksmiths allege that the Providers have caused \"a large number of formerly viable locksmiths\" to go \"out of business entirely,\" while the Plaintiffs themselves \"have lost 30-60% of their gross revenue since 2009 in the specific business arena of outbound consumer service calls.\" Compl. 9. And since the Providers not only list the scammers, but also allow scam locksmiths to themselves purchase advertising, the Locksmiths allege that the Providers pressure them to pay for expensive advertising.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30.

The Providers also allegedly violate the Lanham Act by making false representations pertaining to the scam locksmiths, and commit five violations of state law: fraud, tortious interference with an economic advantage, unfair competition, breach of contract, and conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-37.

In January 2017, the Court granted leave to amend the complaint. The first amended complaint, currently operative, added 13 new\n   locksmiths and the class action allegations. Microsoft successfully moved to stay the claims against it made by Baldino's and Joe East Enterprises pending a decision on the motion to dismiss, on the ground that contracts with those parties arguably required that all such claims be decided in arbitration.

Here, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Roommates.com\n   </em>\n   , there is no allegation that the Providers require the scam locksmiths to provide the allegedly fraudulent information at issue, or that the Providers have created a stand-alone platform for the provision of services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   However, the Ninth Circuit's logic is nonetheless helpful.\n   <em>\n    Roommates.com\n   </em>\n   emphasized that \"providing neutral tools to carry out what may be unlawful or illicit searches does not amount to 'development' for purposes of the immunity exception.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3738362\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/521/1157/\">\n    521 F.3d at 1169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"If an individual uses an ordinary search engine to query for a 'white roommate,' \" the Ninth Circuit reasoned, \"the search engine has not contributed to any alleged unlawfulness in the individual's conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3738362\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/521/1157/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court also explained that the same reasoning governed\n   <em>\n    Carafano v.

The same reasoning applies here, where the Providers' offer neutral mapping functionality with no encouragement for websites to provide false or misleading location claims. The fact that scam locksmiths make use of these neutral mapping tools does not constitute \"development\" of the underlying location claims by the Providers, for purposes of the CDA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Under the logic of\n   <em>\n    Roommates.com\n   </em>\n   , the \"development\" of content is \"not merely ... augmenting the content generally, but ... materially contributing to its alleged unlawfulness.\"\n   <em>\n    Roommates.Com\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3738362\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/521/1157/\">\n    521 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1167-68 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

To the extent that the Locksmiths press this argument, I conclude that the Providers' mapping information\n   does not materially contribute to the alleged unlawfulness of the underlying information. As the Sixth Circuit reasoned in\n   <em>\n    O'Kroley v. Fastcase, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the CDA immunizes a search engine's \"automated editorial acts.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055447\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/352/#p355\">\n    831 F.3d 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 355 (6th Cir. 2016). When a search engine re-publishes information originally created by a third party, CDA immunity applies even when confusion may result.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055447\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/352/#p355\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, it is the scam locksmiths who provide the original location claim, and the Providers have created a website that simply re-publishes that information along with associated mapping information. The extra information is wholly dependent on the original location claim, and does not materially contribute to the alleged unlawfulness of the original claim. After all, the Locksmiths do not even allege that the Providers should ban those who make false location claims. Compl. 17-18. It is the scam locksmiths'\n   <em>\n    unlicensed status\n   </em>\n   that Plaintiffs claim should prompt a ban, and they infer from this fact that \"we're a local business\" claims are questionable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In short, the maps are essentially unrelated to any unlawful conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In common sense terms, it is the scam locksmiths and not the Providers who are providing the information that potentially creates liability here. The complaint strains to avoid this conclusion, alleging that the mapping information \"independently and deliberately deceives consumers beyond the original deception purveyed by the scam locksmiths,\" and \"facilitate[s], enhance[s], and legitimize[s]\" the scam locksmiths. Compl. 19-20. But most websites that incorporate content from elsewhere could be said to \"facilitate, enhance, and legitimize\" original content by amplifying its reach or improving its relevance and presentation. By presenting Internet search results to users in a relevant manner, Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft facilitate the operations of every website on the internet. The CDA was enacted precisely to prevent these types of interactions from creating civil liability for the Providers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The fundamental legal question is whether the Defendants \"provided\" the specific information for which Plaintiffs seek to hold them liable. The gravamen of this complaint is\n   <em>\n    precisely\n   </em>\n   that the Providers are financially liable for re-publishing the scam locksmiths' information. Accordingly, I conclude that the Locksmiths seek to hold the Providers liable for \"information provided by another information content provider,\" satisfying the CDA's second requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20230\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Furthermore, none of the CDA's exceptions apply here, as the Locksmiths concede. Tr. of Proceedings 10; Opp. 3-7 (never mentioning a statutory exception). One exception requires that \"[n]othing in [ Section 230 ] shall be construed to impair the enforcement of ... any ... Federal criminal statute.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20230\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1). Although the Plaintiffs do plead criminal violations of the federal antitrust laws, the\n   exception \"is limited to criminal prosecutions\" and \"excludes civil suits.\"\n   <em>\n    Jane Doe No. 1 v.

Breach of Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Locksmiths also sue for breach of contract, claiming a violation of the \"implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.\" Compl. 32-33. The amended complaint inconsistently alleges that both one and many plaintiffs have \"contracted some of listed defendants for paid advertising services,\" but none of the actual contract(s) are provided.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. 22, 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Providers argue that because the complaint does not identify what particular contracts exist, it therefore fails to put them on notice of the basis for the claim.
