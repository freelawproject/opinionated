The plaintiff's unsupported representations that he did not make the allegedly insensitive comments referenced in the report or that his comments were taken out of context fail to show that the District acted with retaliatory animus.

To the contrary, the record is devoid of any evidence suggesting that Young had any involvement in drafting or submitting the report to the Chief Counsel or played any role in the underlying investigation conducted by Kim McDaniel.

However, the plaintiff has failed either to address or rebut any of these explanations asserted by the District, and therefore, has not carried his burden of producing evidence sufficient to demonstrate pretext regarding the District's reasons for engaging in these alleged adverse employment actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mulrain v.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court finds that the temporal proximity of the relocation of the plaintiff's workstation, coupled with his proffer of evidence rebutting the District's explanation for the relocation, is sufficient to establish pretext and for a reasonable juror to infer retaliation. Thus, the plaintiff may proceed with his Title VII retaliation claim solely based upon the adverse employment action of relocating his workstation to an allegedly undesirable location. However, the Court concludes that the plaintiff has failed to produce evidence sufficient for a reasonable juror to believe that the District's legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for each of the other alleged adverse employment actions were not the actual reasons for them, and that the actual reasons were based in retaliatory animus. Accordingly, the Court will grant in part and deny in part the District's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   this 3rd day of January, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    At the motion to dismiss stage in this litigation, the Court dismissed the plaintiff's Title VII discrimination and hostile work environment claims, as well as the plaintiff's ADA claims.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Massaquoi v.
