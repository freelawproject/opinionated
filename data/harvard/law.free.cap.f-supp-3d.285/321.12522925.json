R &amp; D Masonry, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%207428533\">\n    2015 WL 7428533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (D.D.C. Nov. 20, 2015) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \"Indeed, when the forum preferred by the plaintiff is not his home forum, and the defendant prefers the\n   <em>\n    plaintiff's\n   </em>\n   home forum, then there is little reason to defer to the plaintiff's preference.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%207428533\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Here, Tower is a Connecticut corporation with its principal place of business in Centerbrook, Connecticut. Plaintiff thus has substantial ties to that state, which is indeed its home forum. The only link it can muster to the District of Columbia is the fact that its attorneys are located here. Yet, \"[t]he location of counsel carries little, if any, weight in an analysis under \u00a7 1404(a).\"\n   <em>\n    Brown v. SunTrust Banks, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4178167\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/66/81/#p85\">\n    66 F.Supp.3d 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 85 (D.D.C. 2014) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff's choice of forum, then, weighs only slightly against transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   b. Defendant's Choice of Forum\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   While a defendant's choice of forum is a consideration when deciding a \u00a7 1404(a) motion, it is not ordinarily entitled to deference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mahoney v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3803312\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/545/123/#p127\">\n    545 F.Supp.2d 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 127 (D.D.C. 2008). And here, where Defendants move to transfer over Plaintiff's opposition, they must establish that the added convenience and justice of litigating in their chosen forum overcomes the slight deference given to Plaintiff's choice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Vitamins Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9116678\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/263/67/#p69\">\n    263 F.Supp.2d 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 69 (D.D.C. 2003). To the extent this factor carries any heft, it weighs in favor of transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   c. Whether Claim Arose Elsewhere\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Court next examines whether there is a nexus between the underlying transactions giving rise to the claim and the forum selected.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Gipson v. Wells Fargo &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4090703\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/563/149/#p158\">\n    563 F.Supp.2d 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 158 (D.D.C. 2008). When the material events that form the factual predicate of a plaintiff's claim did not occur in his chosen forum, transfer is favored.\n   <em>\n    Intrepid Potash-N.M., LLC v. U.S. Dep't of Interior\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3814905\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/669/88/#p95\">\n    669 F.Supp.2d 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 95 (D.D.C. 2009). Where claims arise from actions in several fora, \"this factor does not weigh in favor or against transfer.\"\n   <em>\n    Bederson v. U.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4270400\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/756/38/#p48\">\n    756 F.Supp.2d 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 48 (D.D.C. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"In a patent case, the locus of operative facts usually lies where either the patent-in-suit or the allegedly infringing product was designed, developed, and produced.\"\n   <em>\n    JetBlue Airways Corp. v. Helferich Patent Licensing, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3837546\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/960/383/#p400\">\n    960 F.Supp.2d 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 400 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). There is no contention here, of course, that any such activity occurred in this city, but Tower maintains that the patent was \"conceived and reduced to practice in Ohio\" and is not \"being developed in Connecticut.\" Transfer Opp. at 7 (citations omitted). This factor thus is neutral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   d. Convenience of Parties, Convenience of Witnesses &amp; Ease of Access to Sources of Proof\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The three final factors all relate to convenience, and here they favor transfer. As Defendants correctly point out, where Plaintiff has its principal place of business in Connecticut, it \"cannot reasonably claim to be inconvenienced by litigating in its home forum.\" Transfer Mot. at 11-12 (citations omitted). Indeed, setting depositions and attending trial will be considerably easier for a number of Plaintiff's witnesses there. Although Tower asserts that actions related to the '215 patent did not occur in that state,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Transfer Opp. at 4, it views the case through too narrow a lens. Corporate records and executives are all in Connecticut, and Defendant will no doubt seek, at a minimum, to depose Rule 30(b)(6) designees and company officials. As for Defendants, the fora are equally inconvenient, as most of its witnesses reside abroad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The private-interest factors, accordingly, tip in favor of Defendants' position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    2. Public-Interest Factors\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The public-interest factors lean the same way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   a. Transferee's Familiarity with the Governing Laws\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Both parties agree that the legal issues presented here could be handled competently by a federal court in either district and that this factor is neutral.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Transfer Mot. at 14-15; Transfer Opp. at 7;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n v. Harvey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5663785\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/437/42/#p49\">\n    437 F.Supp.2d 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 49 (D.D.C. 2006) (where \"both courts are competent to interpret the federal statutes involved[,] ... there is no reason to transfer or not transfer based on this factor\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   b. Relative Congestion of the Courts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Although Defendants contend that \"[t]he relevant statistics suggest the parties are likely to proceed to trial more quickly in the District of Connecticut,\" Transfer Mot. at 15, the Court believes that this factor is in equipoise. While the numbers cited by Defendants may well be accurate, this Court individually does not have a congested calendar and could proceed with reasonable alacrity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. v. H &amp; R Block, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5905910\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/789/74/#p84\">\n    789 F.Supp.2d 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 84-85 (D.D.C. 2011) (treating relative congestion of dockets as neutral factor in transfer analysis, noting that \"statistics provide, at best, only a rough measure of the relative congestion of the dockets in the two districts. They do not, for example, reflect the differences in the caseloads carried by different individual judges in each district. Any disparities between the lengths of time from filing to trial may also reflect differences other than congestion, such as differences in the types of cases that are likely to be tried in each district and the level of discovery and pre-trial motion practice required in those cases.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   c. Local Interest in Controversies\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiff disclaims any Connecticut interest in the case, maintaining that the patent \"was conceived and reduced to practice in Ohio\" and that the invention \"is not practiced by Plaintiff in Connecticut.\" Transfer Opp. at 7. This, however, is an odd approach and omits the salient facts that Tower is incorporated in Connecticut and has its principal place of business there. States certainly have an interest in protecting companies headquartered within their borders from alleged patent infringement by others. Any financial recovery, additionally, would inure to Connecticut. The District, meanwhile, has minimal interest in the result of this dispute, given that its only tangential connection is the one Lush store located here. Four others, however, sit in Connecticut, thus dwarfing any interest D.C. possesses along these lines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   While all of the factors considered together may not overwhelmingly favor transfer, they do tip the scales sufficiently such that the Court believes the case belongs elsewhere.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court will issue a contemporaneous Order granting both of Defendants' Motions.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
