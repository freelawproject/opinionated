Because of its interest in Charity Health, Bon Secours's \"Audit and Compliance Committee oversaw Charity and its operations-including Good Samaritan-and Bon Secours appoints and employs every Good Samaritan Hospital chief executive officer and executive vice president.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The allegations concerning Good Samaritan derive from the installation and use at Bon Secours subsidiaries of a billing system known as \"McKesson billing software.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 69-70.

The impetus for this requirement is that \"Medicaid typically reimburses providers for the full cost of a patient's treatment, whereas Medicare reimburses at a flat rate lower than the actual cost of treatment ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 138.

No examples of improper billing at Good Samaritan are included in the proposed SAC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Bon Secours objects on grounds of futility, undue prejudice, and undue delay to the inclusion of the proposed Good Samaritan allegations, and thus any claim by relator that Bon Secours may be held liable for Good Samaritan's conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   It contends that the proposed amendments are futile for four reasons: (1) because Bon Secours does not control Good Samaritan such that it can be held liable for Good Samaritan's conduct under the \"alter ego\" doctrine, commonly referred to as \"piercing the corporate veil,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs. Opp'n at 12; (2) because the claims regarding Good Samaritan could not survive a challenge under Rule 9(b),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16; (3) because the allegations are time-barred,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19; and (4) because the allegations are barred by the FCA's seal requirement,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. Inasmuch as we agree with Bon Secours's first argument for futility and find that it would be unduly prejudiced by including these allegations, it is unnecessary to address the remaining futility arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We note that Raffington argues that the Good Samaritan allegations do not constitute new causes of action and thus that any futility argument, insofar as it applies Rule 12(b)(6) to the new allegations, is therefore inapplicable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rel. Mem. at 14. She cites no case law for this argument and we find none. It would be one thing if the new allegations merely added additional factual support for an existing claim. Here, however, we view the new allegations regarding Good Samaritan as supporting an essentially new claim: namely, that Bon Secours caused Good Samaritan to submit false claims to the Government and that Bon Secours must now be liable for those false claims. The allegedly false claims submitted by Good Samaritan were not previously part of the complaint. We believe Bon Secours could move to dismiss just this aspect of Raffington's False Claims Act claim were the SAC filed. Thus we conclude that we may properly assess whether the allegations regarding Good Samaritan could withstand a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"The Second Circuit's common law standard [for veil-piercing] is taken\n   directly from New York law.\"\n   <em>\n    Lakah v.

Raffington contends that the SAC sufficiently pleads domination because the SAC alleges that \"[Bon Secours] owned, operated, and exercised significant control over Good Samaritan ... [and it] names specific [Bon Secours] executives ... who created, implemented and oversaw Defendants' split-billing fraud.\" Rel. Reply at 7 (citing SAC \u00b6\u00b6 11-14, 139-41, 159, 163, 166-77). An allegation of \"significant control,\" however, is insufficient for veil-piercing. Where a party seeks to hold a parent liable for the actions of its subsidiary, as Raffington does here, New York law-and thus federal common law-requires that \"the intervention by the parent in the management of the subsidiary must be to such an extent that the subsidiary's paraphernalia of incorporation, directors and officers are completely ignored.\"\n   <em>\n    Beck v.

The SAC does not contain such allegations as to Bon Secours's control of Good Samaritan. The closest it comes are allegations that \"Bon Secours' Audit and Compliance Committee oversaw Charity [Health] and its operations-including Good Samaritan-and Bon Secours appoints and employs every Good Samaritan Hospital chief executive office and executive vice president.\" SAC \u00b6 12. This allegation is inadequate most obviously because neither Charity Health nor \"Good Samaritan Hospital\" are the entities over which Raffington alleges Bon Secours exercises complete domination-rather, it is Good Samaritan (that is, the Good Samaritan Home Care Agency).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.

Analysis of the second prong is therefore unnecessary. Because the SAC's allegations as to Good Samaritan would fail to survive a motion to dismiss, it is futile and thus Raffington's motion to add the proposed allegations relating to Good Samaritan,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 11-13, 139-41, 166, 168-69, 173, 175, 177, must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Finally, we would in any event deny the motion to amend to add the Good Samaritan allegations on the basis of prejudice.

Specifically, the SAC seeks to allege that the \"McKesson system ... was deliberately programmed\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to do split-billing ....\" SAC \u00b6 141 (emphasis in original). The defendants contend that this proposed allegation transforms what was previously an allegation that defendants knowingly failed to split-bill Medicare and Medicaid into an allegation that the defendants operated \"a billing system in a manner that\n   <em>\n    prevented\n   </em>\n   'split-billing.' \" Defs. Opp'n at 27 (emphasis in original). We question whether defendants can properly seek to prevent the addition of a single allegation where it does not result in the addition of a new claim.

Opp'n at 24. This argument fails, however, because denying the truth of an allegation in a proposed pleading is not a basis for opposing leave to amend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Henneberry v.

But, as defendants' argument impliedly concedes, they have been on notice of this allegation since the filing of the FAC. The proposed amendment, SAC \u00b6 141, only substitutes \"the McKesson system\" for \"billing software\" and adds the word \"deliberately\" to a sentence that already implied as much.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 141 (\"McKesson system ... was deliberately programmed\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to do split-billing ....\")\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 109 (\"Schervier had programmed the billing software so that it did not even allow for split-billing.\"). We do not see how the changes could materially alter the scope of discovery. Thus, defendants have not carried their burden of showing that the modified split-billing allegation, SAC \u00b6 141, will require the expenditure of significant additional resources on discovery or significantly delay the proceedings. We thus grant Raffington leave to amend the complaint to add paragraph 141, except to the extent it seeks to add claims regarding Good Samaritan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Materiality Allegations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In response to the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Univ.

Statutes of limitations, however, are applied to claims, not to \"allegations.\" The Court does not read the allegations as setting forth new claims from a particular time period but rather as alleging conduct by defendants that support the claims already present in this case.
