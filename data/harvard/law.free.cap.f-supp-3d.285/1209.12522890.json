(Doc. 20.) Jurisdiction arises under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Having considered the submissions of counsel and the relevant law, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    GRANT IN PART\n   </strong>\n   the Motion as outlined below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Jaime Loree Armijo drove a delivery truck for FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. (FedEx) for three years. During her tenure as a driver, she routinely worked substantial overtime hours, but because she was hired as an \"independent contractor,\" FedEx was not obligated to pay her a penny of overtime. She was also responsible for a wide variety of business charges. Plaintiff, on behalf of herself and others similarly situated, now brings suit to dispute the legality of her relationship with FedEx and recover monetary damages to which she feels entitled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"On July 27, 2013, Plaintiff executed a contract with FedEx Ground to work as a 'pickup and delivery contractor' \" (a \"driver\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1 (Compl.) \u00b6 10;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1-1.) Plaintiff alleges that despite this contract, the terms and conditions of her employment were such that she and other drivers were employees of FedEx, not independent contractors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-41.) The question of whether Plaintiff was an independent contractor or an employee is not directly at issue in FedEx's Motion; consequently, the Court will assume for purposes of its analysis that Plaintiff can successfully demonstrate she was an employee of FedEx.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When Plaintiff was hired as a driver for FedEx, she signed a \"Pick-up and Delivery Contractor Operating Agreement\" (Operating Agreement). (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 1, 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1-1.) The Operating Agreement provides for certain deductions to be made from the driver's paycheck (referred to as a \"settlement check\" or a \"settlement statement\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1-1 at 14-16)),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   including, but not limited to, fuel products, a \"Time-Off Program,\" and a \"Business Support Package,\" which includes \"uniforms, communications and data processing equipment, D.O.T. inspections, equipment washing, drug tests meeting D.O.T. requirements, and other items and services found in ... Addendum 7\" to the Operating Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    at 18-19, 37, 62, 70-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Plaintiff elected, at a minimum, to participate in the \"Business Support Package.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71-72.) The Operating Agreement also provides that FedEx \"shall have no responsibility to make deductions for, or to pay wages, benefits, health, welfare and pension costs, withholding for income taxes, unemployment insurance premiums, payroll taxes, disability insurance premiums, social security taxes, or any other similar charges ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that \"[f]or most of her tenure at FedEx Ground, [she] routinely worked 60 hours a week, or more.\" (Compl. \u00b6 13.) Plaintiff did not receive overtime pay for any hours she worked over 40 in a week. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff brings three claims against FedEx. First, she alleges that FedEx violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2050-4-22\">\n    N.M. Stat.

Second, Plaintiff claims FedEx violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2014-13-11\">\n    N.M. Stat.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 60-67.) Third, Plaintiff asserts a common law claim for unjust enrichment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 68-74.) FedEx now moves to dismiss Plaintiff's second and third claims, as well as the claim for liquidated damages in Plaintiff's first claim for relief.

Interpretation of Section 14-13-11\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that a wage deduction is the same as a wage assignment; thus Section 14-13-11's requirement that \"[a]ll assignments of wages or salaries due\" be notarized and recorded applies to deductions taken by an employer. (Doc. 30 at 9.) An assignment is \"[t]he act by which one person transfers to another, or causes to vest in that other, the whole of the right[,] interest, or property which he has in any realty or personalty, in possession or in action, or any share, interest, or subsidiary estate therein.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Assignment\n   </em>\n   , The Law Dictionary, available at https://thelawdictionary.org/assignment/).) Plaintiff believes this \"definition easily covers the transaction at issue, which is FedEx's retention of certain sums otherwise payable to Armijo and the class.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) While the Court agrees that the plain meaning of \"assignment\" could possibly be construed to cover some of the deductions FedEx retained from Plaintiff's paycheck, it finds that such a meaning does not neatly fit\n   within the larger context of the statutory scheme when read in its entirety.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cummings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1566487\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/121/821/\">\n    918 P.2d at 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Sections 14-13-1 through -25 are found in Chapter 14 of the New Mexico Statutes, which is entitled \"Records, Rules, Legal Notices, Oaths\" and includes articles such as the Preservation, Restoration and Destruction of Records (Article 1), Inspection of Public Records (Article 2), Recording (Article 8), Records Affecting Real Property (Article 9), Notary Public (Article 12a), and Electronic Authentication of Documents (Article 15). Section 14-13-11 is specifically found in the article on Acknowledgments and Oaths (Article 13). Article 13 also contains sections on Administration of Oath (Section 1), Oaths; Power to Administer (Section 3), and Validation of Certain Prior Acknowledgments (Section 24). Neither Article 13 nor Chapter 14 is relevant, as a whole, to employment relationships; Article 13 and Chapter 14 deal with recordings and notices. Section 14-13-11 sets out the legal requirements of one particular type of legal assignment of one's wages and the process by which such assignment shall be recorded in order to be valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court cannot find a definition of \"assignment\" in any section of Article 13. As FedEx notes (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 33 at 6), applying Section 14-13-11 to employer deductions would lead to strange results, as the statute requires that a copy of the assignment be \"served upon the employer or person who is to make payment.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2014-13-11\">\n    N.M.

The more logical interpretation of \"assignments\" is that it applies to transfers of a portion of the employee's wages to a third party, such as a creditor. In fact, Section 14-13-11 is cross-referenced under Section 35-12-7, which governs Garnishment; exemptions.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2035-12-7\">\n    N.M.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1-1 at 18 (\"At Contractor's election ...

Such a construction is not possible here, however, because the procedure mandated in Section 14-13-11 for assignments is inconsistent with the lesser requirements of Section 50-4-2. Where Section 14-13-11 requires notarization and recording of an assignment to be valid, Section 50-4-2(B) requires only that a payroll deduction be \"specifically stated in a written contract of hiring entered into at the time of hiring.\" There is no mention of notarization or recording in Section 50-4-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   If the Court were to construe \"assignments\" to include employer deductions specified in a \"contract of hiring,\" then the statutes cover the same subject matter and are in conflict.

Section 14-13-11, nestled among a legislative scheme that is overwhelmingly unrelated to employment law, more generally addresses the discrete issue of an assignment of wages by an employee.

In both of these sections, the LRD regulations do not distinguish minimum wage claims from overtime claims. Indeed, the regulations omit that pesky word, \"minimum,\" when defining a wage claimant's damages.

To deny overtime claimants all monetary recovery solely because of the reference to \"minimum wages\" would \"thwart[ ] the MWA's remedial purpose\" and lead to \"injustice, absurdity[,] or contradiction\" of the broad \"any provision\" language immediately preceding the clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sinclaire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=287%20P.3d%20978\">\n    287 P.3d at 981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted). The Court finds such a result untenable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In short, the Court finds that the plural \"minimum wages\" language in Section 50-4-26(C) clearly refers to the title of Section 50-4-22, as Section 50-4-26(C) provides damages for claimants bringing a claim under \"any provision\" of Section 50-4-22. The Court \"must assume the [L]egislature chose\" this plural form \"advisedly,\" and to assume otherwise injects unnecessary ambiguity into the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Diamond\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=283%20P.3d%20260\">\n    283 P.3d at 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted). Even if the \"minimum wages\" language of the penalties provision is ambiguous, the Court is compelled to find that both minimum wage and overtime claimants are entitled to liquidated damages due to the MWA's broad remedial purpose, the \"any provision\" language in Section 50-4-26(C), and the LRD regulations, which do not distinguish between the types of wage claimants.
