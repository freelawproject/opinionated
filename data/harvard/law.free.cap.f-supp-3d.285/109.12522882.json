Before the Court are two motions to dismiss jointly filed by the PV defendants: a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and a motion to dismiss pursuant to the D.C. Anti-SLAPP Act. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PV Defs.' 12(b)(6) Mot., ECF No. 14; PV Defs.' Anti-SLAPP Act Mot., ECF No. 15.)

FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Democracy Partners, LLC, is \"a company including a number of other consultants and vendors to progressive organizations and Democratic campaigns and committees, who market their services collectively through the company.\" (Compl. \u00b6 19.) Strategic Consulting Group, NA, Inc. (\"Strategic\") is a member of Democracy Partners. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) It \"provides campaign-related services to progressive organizations and Democratic campaigns and committees.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) Robert Creamer is the sole owner of Strategic. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.) \"Democracy Partners' private offices ... are not accessible to the general public, have 24-hour security, and are only accessible if one signs into the building at the lobby security desk, if one is provided entrance by [p]laintiffs' receptionist, and/or if one has an electronic pass card[, which] ... is required to access the elevators to the office outside of regular business hours[,] and a key[, which] is required to enter the office when no one is present.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Project Veritas (\"PV\") and Project Veritas Action Fund (\"PVAF\") are both nonstock, nonprofit corporations founded by James O'Keefe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 12.) PVAF is an \"arm\" of PV, and O'Keefe is the President of both corporations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Allison Maass and Daniel Sandini were, at the relevant times, employees of, or contractors to, PV and PVAF. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.) Through the actions described below, they infiltrated Democracy Partners' offices, stole confidential documents and secretly recorded hours of conversation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On or about June 24, 2016, Sandini, using the false name of Charles Roth and representing himself as a potential donor to a nonprofit organization that Creamer had worked for, was introduced to Creamer and the two men had a meeting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) A few weeks later, on or about July 15, 2016, Sandini \"told Creamer that he had a niece who wanted to volunteer to do some kind of political work for Democratic candidates or organizations while she was\n   on a brief hiatus from college.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) Sandini told Creamer that his niece's name was \"Angela Brandt.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In reality, no such person existed; rather, Angela Brandt was a false name used by Maass. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) Unaware of her real identity, Creamer connected Maass \"with a progressive organization working in Cleveland, Ohio during the 2016 Republican National Convention,\" believing that Maass had performed volunteer work for that organization during the convention. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In late August 2016, Sandini called Creamer and told him that his niece would like to gain more experience, leading Creamer to interview Maass \"for an internship with Creamer and Strategic in the Democracy Partners office.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) During the interview, Maass provided Creamer fictitious background information and falsely \"told Creamer that her interest in obtaining an internship was to gain work experience in political and advocacy work.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Based on this false information, Creamer told her that she might qualify for an internship at Democracy Partners. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) A few days later, in early September, Maass \"called Creamer and said she would like to intern at Democracy Partners and could work three days per week.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 21, 2016, Maass started her internship at Democracy Partners. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.) She was given an electronic pass card, which allowed her access to the entire office at all times, \"including areas that contained file cabinets and computers with confidential information,\" and an account and password allowing her to use a company computer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) She also met with Creamer, who gave her an overview of the work Democracy Partners/Strategic was performing, and he explained \"how it interacted with clients and other information that was pertinent for an intern to know in order to perform her tasks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) The \"information Creamer disclosed to Maass included confidential and sensitive business information including the identity of clients, client information and programmatic details, and the identity of partners.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He \"explicitly told Maass that based on the confidential and sensitive nature of the mission and programming of [Democracy Partners/Strategic], the information, and any additional information she was given over the course of her internship, was confidential and not to be shared with anyone other than persons with whom she had specifically been instructed to share that information.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, she was asked to provide a resume, so the following day she provided a fabricated resume for \"Angela Brant\" that omitted her current employment with Project Veritas and her past work for other conservative news outlets and provided instead \"an entirely false and fabricated work history and education.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) Maass' tasks as an intern included \"coordinating and joining meetings with clients about highly sensitive and confidential political programs; putting together news clips; and researching and drafting client updates.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.) She was \"included among the recipients of highly confidential emails and in confidential discussions in in-person meetings and on conference calls,\" \"sent confidential documents,\" and \"brought to confidential client meetings.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.) \"These calls, emails and documents all contained confidential business information which Creamer told her was confidential and not to be shared with anyone with whom she had not been instructed to share it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to the complaint, \"[t]he procedures for pulling news clips and the client update memos were proprietary to Democracy Partners and its clients.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In early June 2016 Strategic had entered into a subcontract with a contractor for the Democratic National Committee\n   (\"DNC\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) Strategic's contract was \"to assist the DNC in arranging events in opposition to the candidacy of Donald Trump for President, including events to take place before and/or after Trump campaign events in various cities,\" which were \"sometimes referred to as 'bracketing' events.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The \"bracketing program\" was \"[o]ne of the most important projects that Maass was involved with.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) As part of this program, Maass \"coordinated press events in areas being visited by then-candidates Donald Trump and Mike Pence.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"Prior to the public announcement of each event, information relating to the timing, location, nature of and the program to take place during each such event, was maintained in strict confidence by the DNC, other groups directly involved in the event, and their respective consultants.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-37.) \"Maintaining that information in confidence was essential in order for each such event to be successful; otherwise the Republican Party and the Republican presidential campaign could adjust their own plans to anticipate or deflect the 'bracketing' event.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) \"Maass participated in planning calls for these 'bracketing' events, sitting in on meetings, and drafting emails and reports that contained information about upcoming events and after-event reporting.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During her internship, unbeknownst to plaintiffs, Maass carried concealed video and audio recording devices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.) She secretly recorded her discussion with Creamer on her first day of work, along with \"other confidential internal conversations with Creamer and other Democracy Partners members, as well as confidential conversations they had with [Strategic] and Democracy Partner clients in-person and via conference call.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) She provided these unauthorized audio and video recordings to PV and PVAF. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35.) Without permission, she also provided them with a number of confidential documents and emails. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40, 60-61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Had Creamer known Sandini's and Maass' true identities, their connections to PV, PVAF and O'Keefe, and Maass' intentions, he never would have hired her as an intern, given her confidential documents, included her in meetings and on emails, brought her to meetings, or given her open access to the office and its computers and files. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42, 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On October 14, 2016, Creamer went to lunch with Mike Carlson, whom Sandini had falsely claimed was his financial advisor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.) Just as they were finishing, Creamer was accosted by a reporter, Raffi Williams, and a film crew from Circa Media, a subsidiary of Sinclair Broadcasting, who asked him to respond to two secretly recorded video clips of Creamer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The reporter indicated that O'Keefe had been the one to tip him off to Creamer's whereabouts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) When Creamer returned to his office, Maass was no longer there, and she never returned. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Later that day, Williams called Creamer and told him that O'Keefe had provided his network with hundreds of hours of raw videotape and that Sinclair Media had agreed to syndicate four nightly news pieces based on the videos, which would begin the following week. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.) He also asked Creamer if he would agree to an on-camera interview to respond to the videos. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) That same evening, Creamer and his attorney met with Williams and viewed approximately three hours of videotape, much of it footage secretly recorded by Maass during her internship. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.) On Monday, October 17th, 2016, Creamer and his attorney met with Sinclair Media's management and attorney, reviewed additional\n   footage, and discussed legal and factual issues relating to the videos. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.) \"During that meeting, Sinclair Media's attorneys said that they would postpone the first installment of their four-part series as they reviewed the legal and factual issues surrounding their recording and release.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.) Ultimately, Sinclair Media did not run any stories on the videos. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On October 17, 18, 24 and 26th, however, PVAF released a series of videos to PV's YouTube channel that contained footage from Maass' recordings of Creamer, Democracy Partners, and its clients. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35, 50, 54, 56, 57.) Each was \"heavily edited and contained commentary by O'Keefe that drew false conclusions.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 55, 57.) On October 26, 2016, PVAF published the confidential documents and emails Maass had obtained on its website under the heading \"VeritasLeaks\" and described them as \"supporting documents for the Democracy Partners videos we have been releasing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On June 1, 2017, plaintiffs filed suit against the PV defendants, Maass, and Sandini, alleging that various actions during the course of their undercover operation violated federal and District of Columbia law. The complaint includes claims for: (1) breach of fiduciary duty against Maass (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 69-77); (2) trespass against Maass (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 94-101); (3) violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202511\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"Federal Wiretap Act\") against all defendants (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 78-85); (4) violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2023-541\">\n    D.C.

Falwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"13322\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/46/\">\n    485 U.S. 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"13322\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/46/\">\n    108 S.Ct. 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"13322\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/46/\">\n    99 L.Ed.2d 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988), establishes that reputation damages are not recoverable without pleading a viable defamation claim. (Mem. at 11.) Plaintiffs do not dispute that\n   <em>\n    Hustler\n   </em>\n   establishes that a claim for reputation damages that is based on an act of expression or publication must satisfy the First Amendment standards that apply to a defamation or libel claim, but they contend that it does not bar a claim for reputation damages caused by non-expressive conduct, which is all they are seeking. As they explain it, they are only seeking reputation damages caused by the \"disclosures and actions of Maass described in paragraphs 27-44 [of the Complaint],\" which \"make no reference whatsoever to the creation or posting of the Project Veritas videos or any other publication.\" (Opp'n at 10 (\"The clear implication of these allegations is that damage to [p]laintiffs' reputation resulted from their clients' displeasure with the breach of client confidentiality-the fact that highly sensitive client confidential information was disclosed to outsiders without the client's authorization.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Taking plaintiffs at their word that they are not seeking damages based on the publication of the videos (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 10 (\"Plaintiffs are not seeking reputational or any other damages for any act of expression or publication.\")), the Court agrees that\n   <em>\n    Hustler\n   </em>\n   does not bar their claim for reputation damages. As Judge William H. Orrick, recently explained in a case involving a similar set of allegations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   Whether First Amendment scrutiny applies ... does not turn on the label of the cause of action but on whether the \"challenged conduct\" is to some form of expression and relatedly whether the damages sought stemmed from that form of expression....

Resolution of this issue is more appropriately addressed at summary judgment or trial.\"). Accordingly, the Court will not dismiss plaintiffs' claim for reputation damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Lost Contract Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The PV defendants argue that plaintiffs' claims for lost contract damages should be dismissed because lost contract damages are not recoverable without pleading a tortious interference with contract claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. at 16 (\"all claims for 'lost contract' damages must be dismissed unless a proper tortious interference claim can be supported\").) In the alternative, they argue that even if plaintiffs had adequately pled a claim for tortious interference, the claim would be barred by the First Amendment because the cause of the lost contracts was defendants' publication of the secretly-recorded videos. Neither argument is persuasive. First, the PV defendants' contention that plaintiffs were required to plead a tortious interference with contract claim lacks any legal support. Second, as previously discussed, plaintiffs have represented that they are not seeking any damages based on the\n   <em>\n    publication\n   </em>\n   of the videos, but rather are seeking damages for non-publication conduct. Where the underlying conduct is not expressive, and the damages sought are \"non-reputational,\" there is no First Amendment issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Steele v. Isikoff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11132659\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/130/23/#p29\">\n    130 F.Supp.2d 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 29 (D.D.C. 2000) (\"If a party seeks damages for non-reputational harms, which include lost jobs and diminished employment prospects, then the First Amendment does not bar suit as long as the claims are brought under generally applicable laws.\"). Accordingly, plaintiffs' claim for lost contract damages will not be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Diminishment of the Economic Value of Confidential and Proprietary Information\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The PV defendants argue that plaintiffs' claim for damages for the \"diminishment of the economic value of confidential and proprietary information\" should be dismissed either (1) because \"[t]he Complaint offers no details on this theory. No specific pieces of confidential or proprietary information are identified as having been damaged, nor is a specific dollar value of damages assigned to each piece of information\"; or (2) \"[p]laintiffs appear to be seeking compensation for damage to intangible property without pleading the appropriate claims under D.C. law.\" (Mem. at 19.) Defendants, again, fail to cite any legal authority to support their arguments. In addition, the lack of detail in the complaint is not a basis for dismissing a claim for damages at this early stage of the litigation as plaintiffs are under no obligation to plead damages with particularity.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Alemayehu v. Abere\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175625\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/199/74/#p86\">\n    199 F.Supp.3d 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 86 (D.D.C. 2016). Accordingly, the Court will not dismiss plaintiffs' claim for damages for the \"diminishment of the economic value of confidential and proprietary information.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Diminution of the Economic Value of Office\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   As to the trespass claim, the PV defendants argue that the claim for damages for the \"diminution of economic value of office\" should be dismissed either because (1) it is effectively a claim for damage to the economic reputation of plaintiffs' office or to the prospect of future business contacts, which is not a trespass damages claim but rather a restatement of plaintiffs' claim for reputation damages; or (2) if it is something else, plaintiffs fail to explain what such damages are and why they are recoverable for trespass. The argument suffers from the same problems\n   that have plagued defendants' other damages arguments: no citation to legal authority and no obligation to plead damages with particularity. In addition, as previously noted, there is no need to allege actual damages to state a claim for trespass. Given these considerations, whether the damages plaintiffs seek are recoverable for trespass can be more adequately addressed later in the litigation process. Accordingly, the Court will not dismiss plaintiffs' claim for damages for the \"diminution of the economic value of office.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    II. MOTION TO DISMISS UNDER D.C. ANTI-SLAPP ACT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The PV defendants have also moved to dismiss the complaint under the District of Columbia Anti-Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (Anti-SLAPP) Act of 2010,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2016-5501\">\n    D.C.
