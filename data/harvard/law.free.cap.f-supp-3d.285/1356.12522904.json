Vance, Chair\n  <strong>\n   Before the Panel:\n  </strong>\n  <footnotemark>\n   *\n  </footnotemark>\n  Plaintiffs in two actions (\n  <em>\n   Rose\n  </em>\n  and\n  <em>\n   Edwards\n  </em>\n  ) move under\n  <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201407\">\n   28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407\n  </extracted-citation>\n  to centralize pretrial proceedings in this litigation in the Central District of California. This litigation currently consists of nine actions pending in nine districts, as listed on Schedule A.\n  <footnotemark>\n   1\n  </footnotemark>\n  All defendants\n  <footnotemark>\n   2\n  </footnotemark>\n  and plaintiffs in two actions (\n  <em>\n   Bishop\n  </em>\n  and\n  <em>\n   In re Behr Process Corp.\n  </em>\n  ) oppose centralization, representing that they have reached an agreement in principle to settle the putative class claims in this litigation through a nationwide class settlement. Plaintiffs in four actions on the motion and two related actions support centralization, but request the Eastern District of California.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-7\">\n  On the basis of the papers filed and hearing session held, we conclude that centralization is not necessary at this time for the convenience of the parties and witnesses or to further the just and efficient conduct of the litigation. Plaintiffs' actions commonly allege that Behr DeckOver resurfacing and coating products prematurely peel and degrade and that defendants Behr and Home Depot falsely advertised the products' durability. But the parties in two actions on the motion recently reached an agreement on a nationwide class settlement, and a motion for preliminary approval of their proposed settlement is anticipated in less than a month. All interested parties will have the opportunity to object to or otherwise raise issues as to the adequacy of the proposed settlement when the motion for preliminary approval is filed. Centralization at this time could delay the settlement approval proceedings with little or no benefit to the parties and putative class members.\n  <em>\n   See, e.g.,\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   In re: Wells Fargo Fraudulent Account Opening Litig.\n  </em>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522616\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/282/1360/\">\n   282 F.Supp.3d 1360\n  </extracted-citation>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201283679\">\n   2017 WL 1283679\n  </extracted-citation>\n  , at *1 (J.P.M.L.
