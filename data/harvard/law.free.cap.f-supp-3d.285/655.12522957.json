SAC \u00b6\u00b6 4, 12-15, 18.

Here, Plaintiffs allege that Burnett and Farrell are insured by Anthem; as such, they were \"Covered Individuals\" entitled to receive \"Covered Services\" under the PBM Agreement. Therefore, they argue, it is immaterial whether their employers contracted directly with ESI, because ESI's ability to inflate prices for Burnett and Farrell, like all Plaintiffs, was tied to the provisions of the PBM Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Motions to Dismiss (\"Pl. Mem.\") (Doc. 109) at 14; PBM Agreement \u00b6\u00b6 1.14, 1.17 (defining covered individuals and covered services). However, Burnett and Farrell have not put forward evidence showing that their insurance plans provided for prescription drug services through Anthem, rather than through ESI directly. The PBM Agreement only governs ESI's relationship to individuals who are entitled to receive drugs, devices, supplies, or equipment \"in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions ... of the applicable [Anthem-provided insurance] Plan.\" PBM Agreement \u00b6\u00b6 1.14, 1.17, 1.45. ESI's evidence that Burnett and Farrell were\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   entitled to receive drugs or devices under their employers' Anthem insurance plan is therefore not immaterial to determining standing. Because Plaintiffs did not offer evidence to controvert Ms. Adler's sworn declaration and it is Plaintiffs' burden to establish standing by a preponderance of the evidence, ESI's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs Burnett and Farrell is granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Anthem Mem. at 20. The third and fourth claims are brought by both the Subscriber ERISA Sub-Class and the Plan Class and allege that Anthem breached its fiduciary duty by entering into the PBM Agreement, accepting money for the sale of the NextRx entities into Anthem's personal account while agreeing to higher prescription drug payments for its subscribers, failing to monitor ESI's performance under the PBM Agreement, and causing the plans to engage in prohibited transactions. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 331-33, 338-41.

Mem. at 34-41. In the\n   SAC, Plaintiffs contend that Anthem had discretion over the management of Plaintiffs' prescription medication benefits. SAC \u00b6 207. Therefore, they argue, Anthem had the discretion to use any number of means-purchasing drugs directly, using an in-house PBM, or contracting with a separate PBM-to provide prescription drugs and set prices for those prescriptions. Anthem's choice of ESI-and its alleged delegation of pricing and plan management to ESI-was an exercise of that discretion and gave rise to Anthem's fiduciary duty. Pl. Mem. at 36. According to Plaintiffs, by negotiating with ESI to determine prescription medicine pricing and PBM services for its clients, Anthem further exercised its discretion over the plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Anthem, in contrast, argues that its negotiations with ESI over the sale of NextRx and ESI's provision of PBM services involved purely business decisions that did not give rise to fiduciary status.
