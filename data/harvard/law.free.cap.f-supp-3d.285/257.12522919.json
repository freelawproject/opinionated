Sept. 6, 2017). Prior to the events relevant to this case and the related\n   <em>\n    Nio\n   </em>\n   case, this expedited path to citizenship meant that officers under DOD's control could, and would often, certify a Selected Reservist's honorable service after one qualifying day of drilling service by checking \"yes\" or \"no\" on the Form N-426. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 46, 64.) Under this non-formalized policy, executed by DOD officers through at least 2017, plaintiffs and the class were eligible for an honorable service certification\n   based on their past qualifying service, and this certification was routinely granted to similar enlistees in an expeditious fashion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 27, 64, 89.) In short,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   what typically happened to a MAVNI in the Army's Selected Reserve is that the enlistee would sign the enlistment contract and go to IET in approximately 180 days.... If MAVNIs did not have certified N-426s before they entered IET, they would receive one and apply for citizenship at IET. IET would be completed in ten to twelve weeks, and by the end of IET, USCIS would have adjudicated their N-400 naturalization applications, and the MAVNIs would be granted citizenship.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Kirwa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522912\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/21/\">\n    285 F.Supp.3d at 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204862763\">\n    2017 WL 4862763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Sometime in 2017 DOD began to reevaluate their N-426 policy, and on August 17, 2017, before plaintiffs could get certified N-426s, DOD \"directed relevant commands to withhold issuance of any N-426 certifications to Selected Reserve soldiers at least until these soldiers serve in an active-duty status\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 48), a status that would not be satisfied by drill periods. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51-53.) Thereafter, plaintiffs filed suit on September 1, 2017 challenging the August 17th policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   However, on October 13, 2017, defendants issued a new policy that no longer required active-duty status, but instead, it specified that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   no service member is eligible to receive an N-426 honorable service certification until all of the following criteria are met:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   1.

Plaintiffs allege that DOD's October 13th Guidance is\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   directly at odds with DoD's own past interpretation and practices with respect to honorable service certifications under Section 1440. The reality is that DoD previously regularly and routinely certified the honorable service of hundreds, if not thousands, of MAVNI soldiers without any service in an active-duty status, without any minimum service period requirement, without any new so-called definition of \"honorable\" service, and without any of the other unlawful requirements now being imposed by DoD. This includes numerous health care professional MAVNIs over the years of the program and approximately 500 MAVNI soldiers, including \"language\" MAVNIs, in recent months. DoD even has acknowledged, on multiple occasions, that a valid measure for a Selected Reserve MAVNI's eligibility for naturalization is two half-day drills (the equivalent of one day of drilling service).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 121-30.) On November 17, 2017, defendants filed the instant motion-invoking many arguments that the Court had previously addressed and rejected in its decision granting a preliminary injunction-and adding a challenge to plaintiffs' constitutional claims. In addition, defendants argued that summary judgment should be granted based on the administrative record that it filed, but in making this argument, defendants relied primarily on a declaration by Stephanie Miller; a declaration that was not part of the administrative record and was executed by Stephanie Miller a month after the October 13th Guidance was adopted. On December 1, 2017, plaintiffs filed their opposition, and on December 8, 2017, defendants filed their reply.

However, prospective changes are not the same as retroactive changes to preexisting and longstanding policies. Plaintiffs were put on notice that their status, pay, allowances, etc. could change going forward, but would defendants argue, for example, that they could ask for pay back from Selected Reservists because they lowered compensation going forward? That is precisely what defendants purport to do with the October 13th Guidance, by redefining the meaning of honorable service already performed. As alleged by plaintiffs, defendants are attaching new legal consequences to events completed before the October 13th Guidance.

Local Civil Rule 7(h)(2) requires \"motions for summary judgment and oppositions thereto [to] include a statement of facts with references to the administrative record.\" Defendants provided an administrative record with an index but no statement of facts referencing that record. Thus, because defendants rely on a declaration that is not a part of the administrative record, and because they failed to comply with D.C. Local Civil Rule 7(h)(2), the Court cannot evaluate defendants' motion for summary judgment against the administrative record as presently compiled by defendants.
