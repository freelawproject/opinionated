Section 2255 (\"Motion\") (ECF No. 12). THIS MATTER was referred to the Honorable Patrick A. White, United States Magistrate Judge, who issued a Report (ECF No. 15), recommending that (1) Petitioner's motion be granted and (2) no certificate of appealability be issued. No objections have been filed and the time to do so has passed.

The ACCA defines \"violent felonies\" as any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that: \"(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or (ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives,\n   <strong>\n    or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\n   </strong>\n   ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1)(B) (emphasis added).

In the Report, Judge White noted an uncertainty over a \u00a7 2255 Petitioner's burden of proof,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Report at 8-12, and applied the following threshold standard: a \"movant should prevail on his Section 2255 motion if he shows ... the sentencing court\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   have relied on ACCA's residual clause ....\" (emphasis in original)).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report at 12-13. The Report then found that Petitioner satisfied this threshold burden \"because it is unclear from the record which of [the] ACCA's clauses the Court relied on in sentencing the movant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Beeman v. United States\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit established that, \"[t]o prove a Johnson claim, the movant must show that-more likely than not-it was use of the residual clause that led to the sentencing court's enhancement of his sentence.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266600\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1215/#p1221\">\n    871 F.3d 1215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1221-22 (11th Cir. 2017).
