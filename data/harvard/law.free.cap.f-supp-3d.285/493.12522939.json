The named Plaintiff is Juan Montoya, a former employee of the Defendants, CRST Expedited, Inc., and CRST International, Inc.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   His complaint asserts causes of action under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), and various provisions of Iowa law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In March 2016, the Defendants moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) or to transfer to the Northern District of Iowa under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). They relied primarily upon a forum-selection clause in one of Montoya's employment contracts that fixes venue in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. At a hearing in February 2017, the Court denied the motion without prejudice, mainly due to concerns about whether Montoya, whose native language is Spanish, was able to comprehend the forum-selection clause, which, like the rest of the contract, was written in English. The Court also expressed uncertainty over what weight to afford a forum-selection clause in an FLSA action. After discovery, the Defendants renewed their motion to dismiss or transfer in September 2017, which the Plaintiff opposed. The renewed motion is now ripe for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After considering the initial record and the parties' supplemental materials, the Court declines to enforce the forum-selection clause against Montoya because to do so would be unreasonable and unjust. The Court further concludes that CRST has not met its substantial burden to override the plaintiff's choice of forum, as required under \u00a7 1404(a) when the parties are not bound by an enforceable forum-selection clause. Therefore, the Court again\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DENIES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   the Defendants' motion to dismiss or transfer (Docket No. 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following facts are drawn from the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (Docket No. 90) (\"FAC\") and attached documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Montoya, a resident of Boston, Massachusetts, worked for CRST from October to December 2014. Both CRST entities are Iowa corporations that ship goods in interstate commerce. The Defendants recruited drivers, including Montoya, by promising sign-on bonuses and \"free\" commercial driver's license (\"CDL\") training. CRST requires new drivers to complete a training program that consists of four phases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In Phase 1, participants must attend, without pay, a driver training program at an educational facility operated by a third party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Phase 2 consists of orientation, also unpaid, at a site selected by CRST.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Phase\n   3 entails hands-on over-the-road training with another CRST driver. In Phase 4, drivers receive specialized classroom training and mentoring. During Phases 3 and 4, drivers are paid at a per-mile rate while they are driving, but they are not paid when the truck is not moving (e.g., loading and unloading time) or when another driver is driving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Drivers are required to attend Phase 1 training regardless of whether they already possess a valid CDL. Only after traveling to the third-party facility are drivers asked to sign a Pre-Employment Driver Training Agreement, the first of two contracts relevant to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Pre-Employment Agreement explains that CRST considers the amounts it pays upfront for trainees to attend the Phase 1 and Phase 2 programs-for instance, their travel, lodging, and tuition expenses-to be advances. Accordingly, the Pre-Employment Agreement provides, in part, that if a driver is dismissed or withdraws from the program prior to Phase 3, or breaches the subsequent Employment Contract or is terminated within eight months of being hired, the driver must repay the advanced sums-an amount that \"will equal or exceed the sum of $2,000\"-plus interest. Alternatively, once a trainee completes the first week of Phase 4, CRST begins to deduct up to $40 per week from the driver's weekly pay until the advanced sums are repaid in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After completing Phase 2, drivers are required to sign the second relevant contract, the CRST Driver Employment Contract. This document reiterates the repayment provisions just discussed. It also includes a choice-of-law and forum-selection clause stating that Iowa law shall govern interpretation of the contract and that \"any claim, litigation, or dispute arising from or related to this Contract shall be litigated in the appropriate federal or state court located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The FAC alleges that, as a result of the practices described above, CRST drivers are often paid less than the federal minimum wage. It also alleges, among other things, that CRST makes deductions from drivers' paychecks for improper purposes, that certain deductions constitute unlawful kickbacks to the Defendants, and that CRST charges an excessive interest rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Enforceability of the Forum-Selection Clause\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Which Way to the Forum\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In seeking to enforce the forum-selection clause through dismissal or transfer, CRST argues that Montoya's English language proficiency is irrelevant to whether the clause is enforceable. In the alternative, it argues that Montoya's job application, deposition testimony, and other evidence unearthed in discovery reveal that Montoya's English is not so poor as to preclude enforcement of the forum-selection clause. It also argues that forum-selection clauses are routinely enforced in FLSA cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Montoya argues that discovery has bolstered his assertion that he is unable to read written English and therefore could not have understood the forum-selection clause in the Employment Contract. He also argues that the circumstances under which he signed the Employment Contract would make it unreasonable and unjust for the Court to enforce the forum-selection\n   clause against him. Alternatively, Montoya argues that reasons of public policy permit the Court to override the forum-selection clause even if it is enforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Legal Standard Under\n    <em>\n     Atlantic Marine\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The threshold question is the standard for evaluating a dispute over the enforceability of a forum-selection clause. The Supreme Court addressed the issue in\n   <em>\n    Atl. Marine Const. Co. v. U.S. Dist. Court for W. Dist. of Texas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702000\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/49/\">\n    571 U.S. 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702000,12584659\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/568/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702000,12584659\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/568/\">\n    187 L.Ed.2d 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). According to\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Marine\n   </em>\n   , \"the appropriate way to enforce a forum-selection clause\" is \"through a motion to transfer under \u00a7 1404(a)\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   or, if the clause points to a state or foreign forum, \"through the doctrine of forum non conveniens.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702000,12584659\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/568/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 579-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the Supreme Court \"explicitly declined to express a view as to whether a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is a proper alternative.\"\n   <em>\n    Claudio-De Leon v. Sistema Universitario Ana G. Mendez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341183\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/775/41/\">\n    775 F.3d 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 46 n.3 (1st Cir. 2014) (citing\n   <em>\n    Atl.

Accordingly, the First Circuit has advised that \"the use of Rule 12(b)(6) to evaluate forum selection clauses is still permissible in this Circuit,\" and courts should \"not decline to review or enforce a valid forum selection clause simply because a defendant brought a motion under 12(b)(6) as opposed to under \u00a7 1404 or forum non conveniens.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702000,12584659\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/568/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Here, CRST's motion to dismiss or transfer travels in two lanes-under both Rule 12(b)(6) and \u00a7 1404(a). Given the Supreme Court's apparent preference for enforcing forum-selection clauses under the rubric of \u00a7 1404, the Court will primarily apply that framework. Under the typical \u00a7 1404(a) analysis, a forum selection clause is \"prima facie valid\" and should be enforced absent a \"strong showing\" by the resisting party that the clause is \"unreasonable\" under the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Claudio-De Leon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341183\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/775/41/\">\n    775 F.3d at 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    M/S Bremen v.

In this case, the parties disagree about what standard the Court should use to determine the facts underlying the reasonableness question. Montoya argues that a summary judgment standard should apply because CRST has renewed its motion to dismiss after conducting discovery, which, according to Montoya, requires the Court\n   to convert the motion from one under Rule 12(b)(6) into one under Rule 56.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rivera v. Centro Medico de Turabo, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034498\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/10/#p15\">\n    575 F.3d 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 15 (1st Cir. 2009) (describing how, when materials outside the pleadings are considered, motion to dismiss based on forum-selection clause must be decided \"under the more stringent standards applicable to a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment\"); Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d) (discussing procedure to convert motion under Rule 12(b)(6) to one for summary judgment under Rule 56). Concerned about the potential for a jury trial on the issue of forum, CRST urges the Court to conduct its own fact-finding, similar to the way it would when faced with a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hilsinger Co. v. FBW Investments\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365734\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/109/409/#p417\">\n    109 F.Supp.3d 409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 417 (D. Mass. 2015) (discussing various standards for fact-finding relevant to personal jurisdiction disputes).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The parties do not provide any cases squarely addressing this question, and\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Marine\n   </em>\n   did not discuss it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   34 S.Ct. at 581 n.5 (noting that Supreme Court's analysis \"presupposes a contractually valid forum-selection clause\"). Ultimately, the Court need not resolve the question here because, as discussed in more detail below, the Court's conclusion is based upon facts that are, for purposes of this motion, undisputed. Accordingly, the same result would obtain under either a Rule 56 standard or under any of the personal jurisdiction standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Analysis of \"Unreasonable and Unjust\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The question before the Court is whether it would be \"unreasonable and unjust\" to enforce the forum-selection clause against Montoya. The parties burn a lot of rubber discussing Montoya's comprehension of written English. As CRST points out, in\n   <em>\n    Soto v. State Indus. Prod., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3384551\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/642/67/\">\n    642 F.3d 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1st Cir. 2011), the First Circuit followed the \"general and well established principle of contract law that 'one who is ignorant of the language in which a document is written, or who is illiterate,' may be bound to a contract by negligently failing to learn its contents.\"\n   <em>\n    Soto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3384551\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/642/67/\">\n    642 F.3d 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 78 (quoting 1 Richard A. Lord, Williston on Contracts \u00a7 4:19 (4th ed. 2010) ) (applying Puerto Rico law). However, Montoya's language skills are very much in dispute and cannot be resolved on this record. Accordingly, the Court does not rely on this ground in reaching its conclusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   With the disputed question of Montoya's English skills set aside, CRST has not contested the following facts: In October 2014, enticed by a postcard promising \"free\" training, Montoya traveled by Greyhound bus to Marine City, Michigan, where he was presented with, and signed, the Pre-Employment Agreement. This contract did not contain a forum-selection clause, but it bound Montoya to owe CRST a minimum of $2,000, and possibly more, depending on how the employment relationship developed, to reimburse the company for various training-related expenses. Two weeks later, after traveling to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and completing CRST's orientation program, Montoya was presented with, and signed, the Employment Contract. This contract contained the forum-selection clause at issue here. Thus, at the point in time where Montoya was first presented with the forum-selection clause,\n   he would have owed CRST at least $2,000, and possibly more, if he walked away from the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Given that CRST has not disputed these circumstances, even if Montoya spoke Shakespeare's English, the Court has little trouble concluding that Montoya has met his burden to \"clearly show that enforcement [of the forum-selection clause] would be unreasonable and unjust.\"\n   <em>\n    Bremen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9136358\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/1/#p10\">\n    407 U.S. at 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9136358\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/1/#p10\">\n    92 S.Ct. 1907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiff's Choice of Forum\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   CRST argues that Montoya's choice of forum in the District of Massachusetts is entitled to little weight because Montoya seeks to represent a nationwide class, and so far, the other opt-in plaintiffs reside in Mississippi, Michigan, and Florida, thereby diluting whatever weight the Court might afford to Montoya's choice of forum. Montoya counters that the selection of forum by FLSA plaintiffs deserves more, not less, deference because, unlike a typical Rule 23 class, members of an FLSA class must \"opt-in\" rather than \"opt-out\" of the collective action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Court finds the \"opt-in\" mechanism of FLSA classes to be a persuasive distinction in this case. In essence, it means that FLSA class members who \"opt-in\" to this litigation are, at least implicitly, signaling that they prefer to join this case in Massachusetts rather than file a claim closer to home.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. VCG Holding Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4195808\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/767/208/#p215\">\n    767 F.Supp.2d 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 215-16 (D. Me. 2011) (discussing cases that, based on FLSA \"opt-in\" procedure, concluded \"Congress intended to give plaintiffs considerable control over the bringing of an FLSA action\"). Thus, unlike typical Rule 23 class members, the \"opt-in\" plaintiffs in this case have, in a sense, joined in Montoya's selection of forum in Massachusetts. Accordingly, the Court agrees that a plaintiff's choice of forum in an FLSA case is entitled to deference.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4195808\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/767/208/#p215\">\n    767 F.Supp.2d at 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This factor weighs in Montoya's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    2. Convenience of the Parties and Witnesses\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   CRST argues that a transfer to the Northern District of Iowa will best serve the convenience of the parties and witnesses because that is where the vast majority of the relevant witnesses are located. Because CRST is headquartered in Cedar Rapids, all of its personnel-related functions, including its payroll, dispatch, and finance departments, are located there. This includes the employees responsible for determining the amounts charged to trainees for the Driver Training Programs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Montoya argues that the convenience factor weighs in his favor because most of the witnesses will be the parties themselves and, as discussed above, the \"opt-in\" plaintiffs have all chosen to litigate this case in Massachusetts. He also argues that CRST, as a large corporation, is better positioned to absorb any inconvenience than Montoya, an hourly worker. Montoya further argues that, in terms of air travel, Boston is a far more accessible destination than Cedar Rapids. Finally, he argues that because other CRST employment contracts\n   have forum-selection clauses fixing venue in California, Florida, and Oklahoma, the Court can infer that the convenience of litigating in Cedar Rapids is not an overwhelming concern for CRST.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The parties appear to agree that most of the witnesses would be either the parties or, in CRST's case, agents. However, the convenience factor remains difficult to evaluate because the witness list is not clear.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Princess House, Inc. v. Lindsey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7850311\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/136/16/#p18\">\n    136 F.R.D. 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 18 (D. Mass. 1991) (\"A party seeking transfer on this basis [convenience] must, therefore, specify the key witnesses to be called, accompanied by a general statement as to what their testimony will entail.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, cases support the principle that \"the balance of convenience focuses on the comparative financial abilities of the parties and the cost of litigation should be borne by the party in the best position to absorb and spread it.\"\n   <em>\n    Sigros v. Walt Disney World Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11130987\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/129/56/#p71\">\n    129 F.Supp.2d 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 71 (D. Mass. 2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Here, there can be little doubt that a large corporation like CRST is in a better position to absorb the cost of an inconvenient forum than an hourly employee like Montoya. As a result, even if the number of Iowa-based witnesses slightly favors transfer, this consideration is neutralized by the fact that CRST is better able to absorb the cost of such inconvenience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    3. Location of Documents\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   CRST argues, without providing any detail, that transfer is appropriate because the vast majority of the relevant documents are located in Iowa. However, the Court agrees with Montoya's rejoinder: \"This factor seems like a holdover from a time when businesses kept important records, including payroll records, in paper and the difficulty of physically accessing the paper documents and the burden of transporting them across jurisdictions could be onerous.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4195808\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/767/208/#p215\">\n    767 F.Supp.2d at 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In 2018, digital documents are just a click away. Accordingly, this factor does not weigh in favor of either party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    4. Application of Iowa Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The final factor the parties raise is that several counts in the FAC call upon the Court to apply Iowa law. Although district courts are \"undoubtedly capable\" of applying the laws of states outside of their districts, \"[a] district's familiarity with the governing law is an appropriate factor to consider\" in the \u00a7 1404(a) analysis.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4195808\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/767/208/#p215\">\n    767 F.Supp.2d at 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At best, this factor tips slightly in favor of transfer because it is plausible that a district court in Iowa may be somewhat \"more familiar\" with Iowa law and \"in a better position to apply it\" than a district court in Massachusetts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4195808\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/767/208/#p215\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   On balance, the \u00a7 1404(a) factors weigh against transfer. Given the considerable deference owed to the plaintiffs' choice of forum in an FLSA collective action, CRST-in the absence of an enforceable forum-selection clause-has not done enough to overcome the \"strong presumption in favor of the plaintiff's choice of forum.\"\n   <em>\n    Astro-Med, Inc. v.
