(Docket No. 198.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In moving to dismiss, Defendants argue that: (1) Plaintiffs' complaint fails to sufficiently allege the application of the strict liability doctrine to this case; and (2) Plaintiffs failed to establish that Defendants, as part of the supply chain of the allegedly contaminated shrimp, had a duty to perform tests to detect the presence of saxitoxin. (Docket No. 60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The District Court turned to Puerto Rico's highest court to answer the question of Puerto Rico law that arose in this case. The Court stressed that there was no local precedent to guide this Court's ruling and that the question certified was vital to this case's resolution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 11, 2015, the District Court asked the following questions to the Puerto Rico Supreme Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-12\">\n   Under the principles of product liability, is a supplier/seller strictly liable for the damages caused by human consumption of an extremely poisonous natural toxin found in a shrimp, even if said food product (and its \"defect\") are not a result of manufacturing or fabrication process?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n    If the previous question is answered in the affirmative, would it make a difference if the \"defect\" of the food product is readily discoverable scientifically or otherwise?\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-14\">\n    (Docket No. 198.)
