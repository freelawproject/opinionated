The specific misconduct alleged by Plaintiff is \"the use of unauthorized electronic devices, such as iPads and BlackBerrys, for government business by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the threshold, the Court observes that the focus of Plaintiff's FOIA request is information that would support its claim of allegedly egregious underlying conduct, as opposed to a focus on the contents of the discussions and whether those discussions reflect evidence of a serious breach of responsibility by government officials. In other words, Plaintiff's allegation does not concern any allegedly egregious discussion that Defendant withholds, but rather allegedly egregious underlying conduct. Plaintiff's effort to avail itself of the government misconduct exception accordingly is suspect under the case law discussed above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Turning to the documents themselves, the Court finds that Defendant's Exemption 5 withholdings can be helpfully described in at least five, often-overlapping categories: (1) discussion of technology options available to the Secretary and her senior staff; (2) discussion of these senior officials' technology preferences; (3) discussion of security risk levels associated with certain technology options in light of senior officials' preferences; (4) discussion of recommendations to senior officials by other staff to address security concerns; and (5) discussion of the actions of senior officials and other staff. Interspersed amongst these categories are withholdings that reference the role of specific people or entities in these discussions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court has not found any discussion that satisfies a narrow interpretation of a government misconduct exception. These documents show that agency leadership apparently sought to use personal electronic devices in ways that were not customary within the agency. In turn, agency staff engaged in discussions of the leadership's preferences and the efforts to accommodate those preferences. While staff had to resolve some disagreements in the process, these discussions do not evince \"nefarious motives\" or warrant a finding of \"extreme government wrongdoing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff essentially asks the Court to make, or rely on, a determination that the Secretary's conduct constituted wrongdoing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply in Supp. of Cross-Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 32, at 1-3. But it is unnecessary to decide that issue because the discussions themselves do not rise to the level so as to trigger the exception, regardless of the lawfulness, or propriety, of the underlying conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Whistleblower Ctr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3817922\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/903/59/#p67\">\n    903 F.Supp.2d at 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The Court ... makes no determination as to the ultimate question of the lawfulness of Defendant's actions; it merely finds that the misconduct necessary to supersede the deliberative-process privilege of Exemption 5 is not present in the reviewed documents.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court concludes that the government misconduct exception does not apply to the material withheld by Defendant pursuant\n   to FOIA Exemption 5. Accordingly, Plaintiff is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

But in the event that Defendant withheld, in full or in part, some of the documents under one or more FOIA exemptions, then perhaps Plaintiff also would seek disclosure of those materials as part of this case or other pending cases.
