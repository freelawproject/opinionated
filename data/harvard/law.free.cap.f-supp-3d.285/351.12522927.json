At the urging of Plaintiff Amgen Inc., the FDA issued a written request asking that Amgen conduct pediatric studies of its drug Sensipar (cinacalcet hydrochloride), and Amgen endeavored to fulfill the request. Ultimately, however, the FDA found that Amgen had failed to complete a study on the safety of cinacalcet hydrochloride in children ages 28 days to &lt; 6 years and concluded that Amgen's studies did not \"fairly respond\" to the written request. The FDA, accordingly, denied Amgen's request for pediatric exclusivity. Subsequently, the FDA denied both Amgen's request for reconsideration and its appeal of that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Amgen challenges the FDA's decision as well as the agency's underlying interpretation of the \"fairly respond\" requirement.

A sponsor may ask the FDA to issue a written request by filing \"a proposed pediatric study request\" (\"PPSR\"). 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355a(d)(3). Before issuing the written request, the FDA must consult with the sponsor, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355a(d)(1)(A), and submit the request for review by the Pediatric Review Committee, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355a(f)(1), (2). That committee includes experts in, among other fields, pediatrics, biopharmacology, chemistry, and \"the appropriate expertise pertaining to the pediatric product under review.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355d.

Neither party disputes this aspect of the FDA's interpretation. The parties' disagreement, instead, centers on the second prong of the test. Under that prong, even where \"specific terms\" of the written request are not met, the FDA will nonetheless \"generally consider the sponsor's studies to have 'fairly responded' \" to the written request if the agency, \"apply[ing] its scientific expertise,\" determines that the underlying \"objectives of the [written request] have ... been met.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11082484\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/148/27/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That is, the studies will be accepted if the FDA determines that the studies yielded information that is \"clinically meaningful across all age groups and uses cited in the\" written request.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11082484\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/148/27/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

In a final letter decision denying Amgen's administrative appeal, the agency set forth the interpretation of \"fairly respond\" described above.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part I.B.

First, Amgen contends that the FDA's interpretation of \"fairly respond\" \"violate[s] the pediatric exclusivity statute.\" Dkt. 60-1 at 25. Second, it argues that the FDA's denial was arbitrary and capricious because the agency treated Amgen differently from similarly situated entities and refused to consider evidence on the challenges of enrolling participants in Study 3.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3218891\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/587/13/#p18\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, Amgen contends that the FDA's application of its \"fairly respond\" standard to Amgen \"without any notice\" contravened both \"due process and APA principles.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3218891\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/587/13/#p18\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The FDA responds that its interpretation of \"fairly respond\" is entitled to deference under\n   <em>\n    Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v.

Statutory Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   According to Amgen, the FDA's interpretation of \"fairly respond\" is incompatible with the text of the pediatric exclusivity statute. Dkt. 60-1 at 25. As explained above, that interpretation recognizes two ways in which a sponsor's studies may \"fairly respond\" to the written request. First, if the sponsor's studies meet the \"specific terms\" of the written request, the studies \"fairly respond\" to the written request. AR 1637. Second, even if the studies deviate from the \"specific terms\" of the written request, the FDA will nonetheless conclude that they \"fairly respond\" to the written request if they yield \"clinically meaningful\" information \"across all age groups and uses cited in the\" written request.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because all agree that Study 3 did not meet the \"specific terms\" of the FDA's written request, the first prong of the test has no bearing on this case. Instead, the focus is on the second prong. It is this prong of the test that Amgen contends is both narrower than the statute mandates and \"incompatible\" with the \"limited role\" Congress accorded the FDA.

Amgen offers a number of arguments why the FDA's interpretation of \"fairly respond\" falls outside\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   's ambit, but none are persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , Amgen argues that Congress's use of the adjective \"only\" to describe the FDA's \"responsibility in accepting or rejecting\" a sponsor's reports, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355a(d)(4), signals that Congress \"did not intend to delegate rulemaking authority\" concerning the meaning of \"fairly respond\" to the FDA, Dkt. 60-1 at 27. The statute, in relevant part, reads as follows: \"[t]he [FDA's]\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   responsibility in accepting or rejecting the reports shall be to determine ... whether the studies fairly respond to the written request\" and fulfill the other two statutory criteria. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355a(d)(4) (emphasis added). Amgen is partly correct-but only partly. It is correct that the word \"only\" \"narrow[s] ... the agency's discretion\" by \"expressly limit[ing] what the agency can and cannot do.\" Dkt. 60-1 at 27. But it is incorrect that this limitation has anything to do with the FDA's authority to interpret the phrase \"fairly respond.\" Indeed, just the opposite is true. The statute accords the agency the \"responsibility ...\n   <em>\n    to determine\n   </em>\n   ... whether the studies fairly respond to the written request.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355a(d)(4) (emphasis added). Without construing the meaning of \"fairly respond,\" the FDA cannot discharge that statutory responsibility. It follows, moreover, that-to the extent \"fairly respond\" is ambiguous, which is the sole question presented at\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   step one-Congress must have intended to confer interpretative authority on the FDA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Amgen asserts that \"a court does not defer to an agency's interpretation under\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   \" if the matter does not \"implicate[ ] the agency's unique technical or scientific expertise.\" Dkt. 60-1 at 27. This misunderstands the relevance of expertise to the\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   framework. Expertise can come into play at two levels. First, Congress might opt to delegate interpretive power to an agency because, in Congress's judgment, the agency possesses valuable expertise. But, if it does so, the justification for judicial deference to an agency's interpretation is the congressional delegation itself, not the Court's assessment of the agency's expertise.

Finally, Amgen's contention that the FDA's current reading of the statute constitutes \"an unexplained about-face from [its] prior understanding,\" Dkt. 60-1 at 29, is belied by the administrative record.

The pediatric exclusivity provision sets forth an intricate, multi-step process for determining when a sponsor's pediatric research justifies a valuable, six-month extension of the sponsor's market exclusivities and patent rights. The FDA, tasked with effectuating this process, occupies center stage in the statutory scheme. Among other duties, the agency is charged with deciding whether to \"accept or reject\" the sponsor's \"reports of [its] studies.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355a(d)(4). Fulfilling this \"responsibility\" requires the FDA \"to determine ... whether the studies fairly respond to the written request.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605053\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1918/#p1924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As noted, the agency has found that a sponsor's study reports constitute a \"fair response\" if they either meet the specific terms of the written request or meet its objectives by yielding \"information [that] is clinically meaningful across all age groups and uses.\" AR 1637.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The statute provides important guidance by specifying that the requirement can be satisfied by something short of perfect compliance: the sponsor need only \"fairly\" respond to the written request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Merck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11082484\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/148/27/\">\n    148 F.Supp.2d at 30-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But this is where the text runs out. The statute does not define what constitutes a \"fair\" response, and, as the FDA argues, \"fairly respond\" is \"an inherently ambiguous\n   term.\" Dkt. 65-1 at 30. To take just one source, the Oxford English Dictionary suggests that the term \"fairly\" has two different senses. Fairly, adv., Oxford English Dictionary (2018) [hereinafter OED].\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The first \"relat[es] to amount, extent, or degree,\" suggesting a more quantitative assessment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12602432\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/958/#p966\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Amgen's preferred definitions-\"moderately,\" \"passably,\" and \"reasonably well\"-fall within this category. Dkt. 60-1 at 31;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fairly, Merriam-Webster Dictionary (2018) (\"to a full degree or extent\");\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fairly, Collins English Dictionary (2018) (\"to quite a large degree\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The second sense, however, draws on a more substantive conception of the term: \"[i]n a fair manner, so as to be fair.\" OED. This sense of the word \"fairly\" includes definitions such as \"[b]y proper or legal means; legitimately,\" \"[i]n accordance with what is right or just[;] ... with good reason, rightfully,\" and-perhaps most relevant here-\"[i]n a proper or suitable manner; appropriately, fittingly.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12602432\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/958/#p966\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The FDA interprets the word \"fairly\" in a manner that draws on both senses: \"how much of a response there was\" as well as \"the quality of the response.\" Dkt. 65-1 at 31. The statute does not dictate one sense of the word \"fairly\" over the other, nor does it indicate which of the competing meanings within each sense (for instance, \"moderately\" versus \"to a full degree\") Congress intended. What\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   clear, however, is that the FDA's \"clinically meaningful information\" interpretation is not \"unambiguously foreclosed\" by the statutory text. There is no textual or other evidence that the statute prohibits the agency from considering the extent to which the data responds to the goals of the study.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Amgen offers a number of counterarguments, none of which compels a different conclusion. First, Amgen contends that \"fairly respond\" necessarily means \"answer reasonably well,\" Dkt. 60-1 at 31, and that-when combined with the limiting term \"only\"-this shows that Congress unambiguously foreclosed the FDA from adopting a \"results[-]oriented\" standard, Dkt. 74 at 33 (Tr. 33:10-11, :21-23). But, for the reasons explained above, the word \"only\" does not modify the phrase \"fairly respond;\" it merely means that the FDA should not add requirements to those that Congress specified. Reading the phrase \"fairly respond\" to mean \"answer reasonably well,\" moreover, does nothing to clarify the standard; \"answer reasonably well\" is just as ambiguous as \"fairly respond.\" For purposes of\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   step one, the question is whether Congress left a gap for the agency to fill, and substituting the phrase \"answer reasonably well\" for \"fairly respond\" neither fills the existing gap nor demonstrates that the FDA's reading of the statute is unambiguously foreclosed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   When asked at oral argument to describe how the FDA should \"decide whether [a] response was reasonable,\" Dkt. 74 at 21 (Tr. 21:12-14), Amgen offered that the agency must assess reasonableness in light of \"the volume of what ... [was] put in front of the agency\" as well as \"what the sponsor did in order to achieve that data,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 24 (Tr. 24:17-19). In other words, Amgen explained, \"reasonableness includes both the extent of the data [provided] and the amount of the effort [undertaken].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27 (Tr. 27:10-12). Amgen concludes that, under that standard, it \"did everything it could ... to satisfy the terms of the [written] request,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 24 (Tr.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   24:23-25), and it is therefore entitled to pediatric exclusivity. An effort-based interpretation of \"fairly respond,\" however, finds no warrant in the statutory text. The question is whether the\n   <em>\n    study reports\n   </em>\n   -not the sponsor-\"fairly respond\" to the written request. In other words, the statute focuses on the studies themselves, not the length of time the studies took, nor the number of attempts needed to complete the studies, nor the expenses incurred in carrying out the studies. An effort-based interpretation of \"fairly respond\" is untenable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Amgen offers an additional reading of the statute, which includes a textual anchor and builds on the FDA's goal-focused approach. Under this interpretation, a sponsor's studies suffice if they generate any information that results in a labeling change mandated by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355a(j). That provision provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   If ... the [FDA] determines that a pediatric study ... does or does not demonstrate that the drug [in question] is safe and effective, including whether such study results are inconclusive, in pediatric populations or subpopulations, the [FDA] shall order the labeling of such product to include information about the results of the study and a statement of the [FDA's] determination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"969600,3450291\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/437/75/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to Amgen, because the results of its studies were added to the Sensipar label pursuant to \u00a7 355a(j), the FDA was not free to second-guess\n   <em>\n    the congressional\n   </em>\n   determination that the results were meaningful. Dkt. 60-1 at 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Amgen's argument suffers from a number of flaws. First, \u00a7 355a(j)'s labeling requirement was enacted ten years after Congress imposed the \"fairly respond\" requirement,\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act, Pub. L. No. 110-85, \u00a7 502,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=121%20Stat.%20823\">\n    121 Stat. 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 876-90 (2007) (adding 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355a(j) ),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 105-115, \u00a7 111,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=111%20Stat.%202296\">\n    111 Stat. 2296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2305-09 (1997) (adding \"fairly respond\" requirement), and there is no evidence that Congress intended \u00a7 355a(j) to amend or clarify the meaning of its earlier enactment. Second, the FDA has explained that it has interpreted \u00a7 355a(j) to require labeling changes regardless of whether the studies yielded any clinically meaningful results; rather, according to the FDA, \u00a7 355a(j) applies mechanically to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   such studies. Understood in this light, Amgen's argument proves too much. It would mean, among other things, that the \"fairly respond\" requirement is meaningless and that the FDA must grant pediatric exclusivity to a sponsor that is utterly unsuccessful in responding to a written request. At oral argument, for example, Amgen acknowledged that this argument would mean that it would have \"fairly responded\" to the FDA's written request even if only \"one patient\" had completed Study 3. Dkt. 74 at 90 (Tr. 90:10-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Finally, Amgen asserts that the FDA's \"clinically meaningful information\" standard would undermine the incentive structure Congress envisioned when it provided for pediatric exclusivity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 60-1 at 34-36. This contention, however, bears more on the reasonableness of the FDA's interpretation than on whether the statute \"unambiguously forecloses\" the FDA's approach. The Court will therefore consider Amgen's purposive argument at\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   's second step.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Because the phrase \"fairly respond\" is ambiguous,\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   teaches that Congress \"has implicitly delegated the authority\" to interpret this term to the FDA.\n   <em>\n    ALDF\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265594\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/602/#p616\">\n    872 F.3d at 617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That conclusion is particularly apt, moreover, because-as this case demonstrates-the meaning attached to that phrase implicates the type of policy-laden judgment that is better left to the\n   politically accountable executive branch than to the unelected judiciary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/\">\n    467 U.S. at 864\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[P]olicy arguments are more properly addressed to legislators or administrators, not to judges.\").

The FDA works to achieve this goal by drafting each written request, with input from the Pediatric Review Committee, \"to maximize the potential to elicit such information.\" AR 1637.

The agency has determined that this objective is best served by an interpretation of \"fairly respond\" that allows the agency to accept a sponsor's reports when (1) there is perfect compliance or (2) the studies generate \"information\" that \"is clinically meaningful,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , information that practitioners would find useful. AR 1637. Although this interpretation may not be the best one, it is eminently reasonable in light of the \"the goals of the [statute]\" and is \"rationally related\" to those objectives.\n   <em>\n    AT &amp; T Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076593\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/366/#p388\">\n    525 U.S. at 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076593\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/366/#p388\">\n    119 S.Ct. 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Amgen offers three counterarguments. It first contends that the FDA's \"clinically meaningful information\" standard goes beyond \"the limited assessment Congress empowered the agency to make.\" Dkt. 60-1 at 37. But, for the reasons discussed at the first step of the\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   inquiry, Amgen has not offered a persuasive account of \"the limited assessment\" that it believes Congress contemplated. It is true that Congress limited the FDA to considering the requirements identified in the statute, but it did not limit the FDA's authority to consider whether\n   <em>\n    those\n   </em>\n   requirements were satisfied.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part III.A.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Second, Amgen notes that the FDA initially had only 90 days to decide whether to accept or reject a sponsor's reports, and it argues that the original allotment of 90 days would not have afforded the FDA enough time to conduct its \"clinically meaningful information\" inquiry. Dkt. 60-1 at 37 (citing 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355a(d)(3) (2003) ). Given the fact that the FDA participates in the ongoing process-and, indeed, formulates the written request and any amendments to it-that contention is far from convincing. And, the fact that Congress subsequently extended the time allowed for the FDA's review, if anything, supports the conclusion that Congress did not intend for the decision whether to accept or reject a sponsor's reports to be a mechanical one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Finally, as noted above, Amgen contends that the FDA's interpretation is at odds with congressional intent because it injects \"deep uncertainty into the process\" and thus \"radically undermines the terms of Congress's bargain.\" Dkt. 60-1 at 34-35. Even assuming that Amgen is correct that \"[t]he central feature of this statutory bargain is that the sponsor knows the terms of th[e] bargain before it ... decide[s] whether to conduct the pediatric studies,\" Dkt. 60-1 at 34 (emphasis omitted), it is far from clear that Amgen's reading of the statute provides greater certainty or predictability than the FDA's. Under the FDA's construction of the statute, a sponsor can earn six months of additional exclusivity if its studies either (1) meet the terms of the written request or (2) yield clinically meaningful information that achieves the specified objectives of the written request. Either way, the sponsor's success can be measured against the prescribed terms and goals of the written request. Under Amgen's proposed construction of the statute, in contrast, the FDA would be required to assess the\n   quantity of information provided and the sponsor's effort without any specified benchmark or standard. Similarly, it is not obvious that Amgen's reading of the statute is likely to yield more information about pediatric uses of drugs. Although Amgen might be correct that sponsors may be more likely to submit PPSRs to the FDA with a more forgiving interpretation of the statute, they may also be less likely to complete their studies in the manner contemplated by the written requests. It is not, of course, the Court's role to decide whether Amgen's account of the relevant incentives is more or less compelling than the FDA's, but only to determine whether the FDA's understanding of the statutory scheme is a reasonable one. For the reasons explained above, the Court concludes that it is.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Because the term \"fairly respond\" is ambiguous and because the FDA's interpretation of that term is reasonable, the Court must defer to the FDA's statutory construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

As the foregoing discussion demonstrates, the FDA drew on its expertise and articulated a \"rational connection between the facts\" and its decision to deny pediatric exclusivity for Sensipar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Amgen offers three reasons why, in its view, the FDA's denial of pediatric exclusivity was arbitrary and capricious: (1) its studies satisfied the \"fairly respond\" requirement, even under the FDA's reading of the statute; (2) the FDA arbitrarily refused to consider evidence of Amgen's efforts to enroll additional patients in Study 3; and (3) the FDA treated Amgen differently than two similarly situated entities, without offering a reasoned basis for doing so.

For the reasons discussed above, the Court is unpersuaded that \u00a7 355a(j) is coterminous with the FDA's \"clinically meaningful information\" standard,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Part III.A.2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 65-1 at 42, and more to the point for present purposes, the FDA has rejected the linkage that Amgen posits, and the FDA's reading of the relevant provisions is eminently reasonable. As the FDA has explained, \u00a7 355a(j) mandates the inclusion of all results of studies undertaken in response to a written request, regardless of whether those results are clinically meaningful. The agency's decision to require labeling changes for Sensipar pursuant to \u00a7 355a(j), accordingly, does not mean that Amgen's studies \"achieved 'meaningful labeling' \" for purposes of the \"fairly respond\" requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The FDA's Refusal To Consider Evidence of Amgen's Effort\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   According to Amgen, the FDA \"acted arbitrarily\" by \"refusing\" to accept and consider a \" 'briefing document ... describ[ing] the efforts Amgen ... made enrolling pediatric patients' \" for Study 3.

Amgen further asserts that the FDA erred in claiming that Amgen \"could have\" achieved the minimum number of patients for Study 3 with \"greater effort.\" AR 1646;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 60-1 at 51.

Relying on this\n   rule, Amgen contends that the FDA's decisions granting pediatric exclusivity for Orencia (abatacept) and Ortho Tri-Cyclen (ethinyl estradiol; norgestimate) are inconsistent with its denial for Sensipar, and that the agency has failed to \"provide a legitimate reason\" for treating Sensipar differently.

As explained below, the Court agrees with Amgen about one of these precedents, but not the other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court is unconvinced that the FDA, without explanation, applied a more onerous standard in rejecting Amgen's studies than it applied in accepting the studies submitted by Orencia's sponsor, Bristol-Myers Squibb (\"BMS\"). Amgen is correct that the FDA granted pediatric exclusivity for Orencia even though one of BMS's studies-involving the intravenous use of Orencia in patients ages 6 to 17 years, AR 1727-did not meet the terms of the written request. AR 1492. As the FDA explained to Amgen in its reconsideration decision, however, it granted pediatric exclusivity because the \"overall data\" from the studies BMS conducted \"provided a sufficient safety database to draw supportable conclusions about the drug's safety in the relevant pediatric age groups\" and \"was sufficient to label the product for pediatric use.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"395817\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/963/20/#p27\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The difference between the BMS and Amgen studies, moreover, was marked: BMS submitted data from 164 of the required 180 patients, whereas Amgen submitted data from only 4 of the required 15 patients in Study 3.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"395817\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/963/20/#p27\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the FDA's expert opinion, BMS's studies produced \"robust clinical trial data,\" while Amgen's studies, in contrast, \"did not yield an interpretable evaluation of product safety.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"395817\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/963/20/#p27\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Notwithstanding these \"important\" differences,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"395817\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/963/20/#p27\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Amgen contends that the FDA's Orencia decision is inconsistent with its Sensipar decision for two reasons. First, Amgen argues that the FDA considered the \"overall data\" from the two Orencia studies to assess whether they yielded \"clinically meaningful information,\" but for Sensipar the FDA restricted itself to \"analyzing Study 3 in isolation.\" Dkt. 60-1 at 50. The record, however, contradicts that characterization of the FDA's approach to Sensipar. The agency found that \"[d]ata from Study 3 were not sufficient to evaluate ... safety in the younger population,\" AR 1645, and that this \"shortage\" was \"not compensated by additional safety data gathered in children &lt; 6 years old in Study 1 (single dose study), a retrospective observational study, and a prospective cohort registry study,\" AR 1647. The FDA thus considered overall data in both cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Second, Amgen contends that the FDA rejected its study reports because they did not result in meaningful labeling changes but accepted BMS's reports even though BMS's studies did not result in a labeling change. Dkt. 60-1 at 48. The fact that the FDA did not require a labeling change for Orencia, however, does not mean that the BMS's studies did not yield meaningful labeling information or, indeed, \"information ... sufficient to label the product for pediatric use.\" AR 1492. Rather, as all agree, the FDA had previously approved labeling information regarding the intravenous use of the drug in pediatric patients.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 1736, 1773-74. The FDA reasonably concluded that an additional study was nonetheless warranted, and it reasonably concluded that the results of that study and the overall data confirmed that \"the product was safe for use\" by patients ages 6 to 17 years. AR 1491-92. Although Amgen suggests that this confirmation must not have been \"clinically meaningful\" because the FDA, under its own regulations, required \"substantial evidence\" to\n   approve the prior label, Dkt. 67 at 27-28, that argument asks that the Court tread on the agency's expert assessment of whether a further study was warranted in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   For Ortho Tri-Cyclen, however, Amgen has a point. In its reconsideration decision for Sensipar, the FDA distinguished the agency's grant of exclusivity for Ortho Tri-Cyclen on the ground that the studies conducted by Ortho Tri-Cyclen's sponsor, Johnson &amp; Johnson, AR 1888, met all of the terms of the written request. AR 1493;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   AR 1485. As Amgen argues, however, it is-at best-unclear from the administrative record whether that premise is correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The written request asked Johnson &amp; Johnson to conduct two studies:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   <em>\n    Study 1:\n   </em>\n   A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to examine the efficacy and safety of Ortho Tri-Cyclen \u00ae in the treatment of adolescent patients with anorexia nervosa (AN).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   <em>\n    Study 2:\n   </em>\n   A pharmacokinetics (PK) study to assess the single-dose and steady-state or alternatively, population PK of ethinyl estradiol (EE), norgestrel (NG), and norelgestromin (NGMN) in pediatric patients with [anorexia].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   AR 1871. The objective of Study 1 was to \"assess the effect\" of Ortho Tri-Cyclen \"on bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine and hip in patients with anorexia.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"395817\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/963/20/#p27\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The objective of Study 2 was to \"assess the single-dose and steady-state or, alternatively, population [pharmacokinetics] of [norelgestromin ], [norgestrel ], and [ethinyl estradiol ] in pediatric patients with [anorexia].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"395817\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/963/20/#p27\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The written request set forth more detailed requirements for both studies. As relevant here, Study 1 specified the following design parameters: one year in duration and \"approximately 120 adolescent women\" ages \"12 through 17 years\" with anorexia as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (\"DSM-IV\"). AR 1872. Amgen contends that many of the women enrolled in Study 1 \"did not meet ... the DSMIV diagnostic criteria for anorexia.\" Dkt. 60-1 at 47 (quoting AR 1916).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   In its Sensipar reconsideration decision, the FDA offers little support for its conclusion that Johnson &amp; Johnson satisfied the terms of Study 1. The agency acknowledges that it was \"unable to locate the Board's decision granting exclusivity\" to Johnson &amp; Johnson, and asserts, without explanation, that the deciding official \"reviewed other relevant documents and determined that the sponsor's studies met the terms\" of the written request. AR 1493. In its brief before this Court, moreover, the FDA identifies only one possible source supporting its conclusion: in a clinical review prepared after the FDA had granted Johnson &amp; Johnson's request for pediatric exclusivity, a medical reviewer noted that he had previously \"recommended that [Johnson &amp; Johnson] receive pediatric exclusivity, since the requested study was conducted in agreement with the [w]ritten [r]request.\" AR 1885. This document reflects the reviewer's recommendation on exclusivity, but not the analysis or conclusions of the deciding official. And the reviewer did not explain what he meant by \"conducted in agreement with the [w]ritten [r]equest.\" Given the deferential standard of review, however, this might ordinarily suffice to sustain the FDA's decision.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Envtl.

Following a May 2005 clinical review, however, the FDA found that \"the majority of the 123 subjects treated ... did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   meet either the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa or the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria modified by the sponsor for anorexia nervosa.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   AR 1916;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR 1921 (noting that only 77 of the 123 patients \"had the word 'anorexia' listed\" in their medical histories). In particular, 76 patients \"had a baseline Body Mass Index (BMI) at or above the 10th percentile for age and [therefore] should not have been enrolled into the study.\" AR 1948. And, at least in part because \"a significant number\" of treated patients \"did not me[e]t the DSM-IV criteria,\" the FDA \"reviewer consider[ed] the data ... insufficient to address safety concerns regarding the use of Ortho Tri-Cyclen in subjects with anorexia.\" AR 1937.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Based on this record, Amgen argues that the FDA granted pediatric exclusivity even though the sponsor's study reports \"neither met the terms of the written request nor generated meaningful labeling.\" Dkt. 60-1 at 45. Although the FDA addresses some of Amgen's arguments, it has not responded to Amgen's contention that the majority of the 123 patients treated in Study 1 did not meet the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa, as required by the written request. There may be an answer to Amgen's contention. It is possible, for instance, that the FDA granted Johnson &amp; Johnson pediatric exclusivity based on the mistaken belief that Study 1 was conducted in full compliance with the terms of the written request, and that the failure to enroll patients meeting the DSM-IV criteria was discovered only after the fact. Or it may be that Johnson &amp; Johnson's study did, in fact, comply with the requirement. Or the FDA may have some other basis for distinguishing, disregarding, or abandoning the Ortho Tri-Cyclen precedent. If so, however, the agency must explain that rationale and identify the relevant evidence for its conclusions in the administrative record. Because the FDA has yet to do so, the Court concludes that the agency's decision is-at least in this one respect-arbitrary and capricious and that a limited remand is necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lilliputian Sys., Inc. v.

But Amgen has failed to identify any precedent beyond those contexts in which the courts have applied the \"ascertainable certainty\" requirement to agency adjudicative actions involving questions of statutory or regulatory interpretation. It is common, moreover, for agencies to set forth their statutory interpretations in the adjudicative process. Against that backdrop, the implication of Amgen's argument-that the \"ascertainable certainty\" standard applies to all adjudications in which a party has a substantial stake or a reliance interest-would substantially rework the regulatory process. And it would do so for no good reason:\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   and the overarching arbitrary and capricious standard already prevent agencies from engaging in the type of \"Kafkaesque\" endeavors that Amgen fears.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 60-1 at 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Amgen's argument also fails on the facts.

Among other things, when Amgen realized that it would be unable to meet the terms of the written request, it sought to amend that request-it did not simply rest on the assumption that its best efforts or the limited results that it did obtain would suffice. AR 1091-92. In addition, when Amgen submitted its study report and requested pediatric exclusivity, AR 1152, it argued that pediatric exclusivity was warranted because\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   sufficient data has been collected in the overall cinacalcet pediatric development program ...\n   <em>\n    to satisfy the primary objectives of this study\n   </em>\n   , which were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of cinacalcet in pediatric patients ages 28 days to &lt; 6 years and to characterize the PK profile in pediatric patients.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   AR 1160 (emphasis added). Although not a perfect match, Amgen's argument for why it deserved pediatric exclusivity closely reflects the FDA's understanding that the studies must produce results sufficient to meet \"the objectives of the\" written request. AR 1637.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Finally, Amgen relies on the following statement from the FDA's website, which it argues is inconsistent with the FDA's interpretation: \"Pediatric exclusivity is not tied to approval of labeling containing information on pediatric use based on the studies conducted.\" Dkt. 60-1 at 40 (quoting Dkt. 60-2 at 3 (emphasis omitted) ). The website, however, goes on to explain that the FDA's decision whether to grant pediatric exclusivity is based on the agency's assessment of whether \"the [sponsor's] studies were conducted in accordance with the terms of the [w]ritten [r]equest.\" Dkt. 60-2 at 3. That statement is entirely consistent with the first prong of the test that the FDA now espouses: the FDA will grant pediatric exclusivity to a sponsor that \"properly execute[s]\" the requested studies, even if the sponsor's studies fail to \"result in pediatric use information\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , information useful in labeling. AR 1637. The statement that Amgen identifies from the FDA website, accordingly, can be faulted-if at all-for addressing only the first prong of the current test, and not adding that a sponsor can also qualify for pediatric exclusivity if it fails to \"properly execute[ ]\" the studies but, nonetheless, achieves results that satisfy the objectives of the studies. That omission does nothing to advance Amgen's \"fair notice\" argument. The fact that the FDA subsequently applied a\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   generous test than the one articulated on its website could not have\n   <em>\n    unfairly\n   </em>\n   surprised Amgen. Amgen would hardly be better off if the FDA had relied\n   solely on the test alluded to on its website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The Court, accordingly, will grant the FDA summary judgment on Amgen's APA claim and due process claim based on a purported lack of \"fair notice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Retroactivity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Amgen's contention that the FDA's determination violated \"the principles of retroactive rulemaking,\" Dkt. 60-1 at 43, fares no better.

It is not enough to show that the affected party might have relied on an assumption regarding the state of law; the relevant question is whether it reasonably relied \"on settled law contrary to the rule established in the adjudication.\"\n   <em>\n    Qwest Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3330738,3568220\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/509/531/\">\n    509 F.3d at 540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   For the reasons discussed above, the FDA's retroactive application of its \"clinically meaningful information\" standard did not work a manifest injustice. Indeed, if anything, it is Amgen's proposed standard that lacks any precedential pedigree. The truth is, the FDA relied on an overly restrictive test before\n   <em>\n    Merck\n   </em>\n   ; the district court in that case correctly observed that the FDA's prior test could not be squared with the statutory text; and, in this case, the FDA articulated a standard that is consistent with the statutory text and the\n   <em>\n    Merck\n   </em>\n   decision.
