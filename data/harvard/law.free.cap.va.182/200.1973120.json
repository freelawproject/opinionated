J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AJ3\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">This is an action for insulting words, under the Acts of 1940, page 294, (Michie\u2019s Code 1942, section 5781), brought by S. T. Massey against Luther C. Jones and Franklin D. Robins, individually and as agents for Jones and Robins, Incorporated. The action is based upon oral and written communications, alleged to be false and defamatory, and, under the said statute, to constitute insulting words within the purview thereof. The offending language is alleged to have been spoken during the trial of a chancery suit instituted by Massey against Robins, Jones and others, then pending before the Law and Equity Court, of the City of Richmond, and later heard by this court upon an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-13\">By agreement of the parties litigant, the record in the aforesaid chancery suit, <em>Robins </em>v. <em>Massey, </em>179 Va. 178, 18 S. E. (2d) 385, is treated as a part of the notice of motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>In order to present the allegedly libelous matter in its proper setting, the material averments of the notice are set forth in a footnote to this opinion.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>To the notice of motion the defendants demurred, on the ground: \u201cThat the said notice of motion shows on its face that all allegations relating to certain depositions and court records are privileged and therefore cannot be the basis for a cause of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The trial court was of opinion that the alleged slanderous or insulting words. (which were a part of the testimony in the chancery cause of <em>Robins </em>v. <em>Massey, supra, </em>given in the regular trial thereof) were pertinent and relevant to the matters under inquiry in said chancery cause, and sustained the demurrer on the ground that the language complained of, having been spoken in the course of a judicial proceeding, was privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"AzO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>This action of the court is assigned as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">It is beyond dispute that the language upon which the action is based' was uttered in the course of a judicial proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Since this court, in <em>Lightner </em>v. <em>Osborn, </em>142 Va. 19, 127 S. E. 314, and <em>Penick </em>v. <em>Ratcliff e, </em>149 Va. 618, 140 S. E. 664, has stated the applicable rule in cases similar to the case at bar, it is unnecessary to consider the English rule or the rule prevailing in other jurisdictions. By those cases we are committed to the doctrine that absolute privilege protects an individual against liability for defamatory words spoken in the course of a judicial proceeding, when such words are pertinent and relevant to the subject of inquiry, or in response to the question, irrespective of malice or falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Counsel for plaintiff contends there is a sharp distinction apparent betw\u00e9en a case in which the allegedly libelous matter goes to the essence of the case in the pleadings, as in the <em>Penick case, supra, </em>and a case in which such allegedly slanderous matter flows from the mouth of a witness under examination, as in the <em>Lightner case, supra, </em>and that, therefore, the trial court was in error when it held that the case at bar was ruled by the <em>Penick case, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">In view of this contention, it becomes necessary to advert to the facts appearing in the two cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The Lightner Publishing Company employed Osborn as managing editor of \u201cThe Peanut Promoter.\u201d The written contract obligated Osborn not to enter thereafter into competition, directly or indirectly, with the corporation within a period of five years. Subsequent to signing the contract, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Osborn severed his connection with the corporation and started publication of a similar trade paper called the \u201cPeanut Journal.\u201d Thereupon, the Lightner Publishing Corporation filed a bill in the Circuit Court of the city of Suffolk, praying that Osborn be enjoined from publishing the \u201cPeanut Journal,\u201d That was the sole issue involved in the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">During the progress of the injunction suit, Lightner, testifying as a witness, repeated with emphasis a statement contained in a letter which he had written to one J. R. Fleming. \u201cThe letter accused Osborn of shortage in his accounts, of robbing the customers of Lightner Publishing Corporation, and stated that he had the knack of robbing a man and make him like it and that he would \u2018sting\u2019 those who advertised in the \u2018Peanut Journal.\u2019 \u201d (Opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The above language was the basis of Osborn\u2019s action at law to recover damages for insulting words, under section 5781 of the Code of 1919. The trial resulted in a verdict for Osborn.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">It was the contention of Lightner, in this court, that the statements made in the trial of the injunction suit were-absolutely privileged and relieved him of any liability. Judge West, delivering the opinion of the court, disposed of the contention in this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">\u201cLightner\u2019s statements while testifying in the chancery suit were privileged only in so far as they were pertinent and material to the issue raised therein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">\u201cIn Newell on Slander and Libel (2d ed.) 424, paragraph 27, this, is said: \u2018And the same doctrine is generally held in the American courts, with the qualification as to parties, counsel and witnesses, that their statements made in. the course of an action must be <em>pertinent </em>and <em>material </em>to the-case. The qualification of the English rule is adopted in order that the protection given to individuals in the interest of an efficient administration of justice may not be abused as a cloak from beneath which to gratify private malice.\u2019' (Italics ours).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>\u201cThe bill in the chancery suit was a pure bill for an injunction, the only issue being whether Osborn had violated his contract not to enter into competition, directly or indirectly, with Lightner Publishing Corporation within a period of five years, and not to accept employment with any competitor or competing publisher. The issue involved did not warrant the statement as to Osborn\u2019s \u2018shortage\u2019 or that he, while in the defendant\u2019s employ, was \u2018robbing our customers.\u2019 As said by Newell, at page 425: \u2018The privilege is limited and that limit is: That a party or counsel shall not avail himself of his situation to gratify private malice by uttering slanderous expressions, either against a party, witness or third person, which have no relation to the cause or subject matter of the inquiry.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">These are the facts in the <em>Penick </em>case, <em>supra-. </em>Penick and fifteen other qualified voters of Henrico county filed their petition in the circuit court, contesting the election of W. Conway Saunders as a supervisor for the county of Henrico. Ratcliffe was named one of the defendants. It was alleged in the petition that Ratcliffe, who acted as one of the judges of the election, was a school trustee, and, as such, was in a position of influence when contracts for the transportation of school children were to be placed. It was also alleged in the petition that while, acting as judge of election, he attempted to bribe a voter by offering to give him a contract for this transportation, if he would vote for Saunders. Thereupon, Ratcliffe brought his action of slander against Penick and the other petitioners, to recover damages for the alleged libelous language in the petition. There was a trial by jury which resulted in a verdict for Ratcliffe. In this court it was contended by Penick that the language complained of was pertinent and relevant to the relief sought under the prayer of the petition, and, therefore, he was not liable in damages. In sustaining the contention of Penick, Mr. Justice Holt said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">\u201cIn a note to 16 A. L. R. 743, is this statement of the rule:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>\u201c \u2018As to the degree of relevancy or pertinency necessary to bring the alleged defamatory matter within the privilege, the courts favor a liberal rule. Thus, the matter to which the privilege does not extend must be so palpably wanting in relation to the subject matter of the controversy that no reasonable man can doubt its irrelevancy and impropriety.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">\u201cIn the light of the foregoing statements of the law, were the offending charges material, relevant or pertinent to the relief that might have been legitimately sought under the petition into which they were incorporated? We think they were. They were pertinent as a primary proposition and our judgment here is fortified by the fact that they must be so construed whenever the matter is in doubt. Public policy demands that within all reasonable limits a litigant should have the right to state his case as he sees fit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">See also 33 American Jurisprudence, sec. 150, p. 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">In <em>Guide Pub. Co. </em>v. <em>Futrell, </em>175 Va. 77, 7 S. E. (2d) 133, Mr. Justice Hudgins quoted from <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>157 Va. 215, 160 S. E. 190, this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-8\">\u201cIn Virginia both the truth and privilege are complete defenses in bar of any action for defamation, whether it be for common law slander or libel, or for insulting words, and the same rules of law with reference to the <em>pleadings </em>and <em>proof </em>of these defenses apply in an action under section 5781 as in an action for common slander or libel.\u201d (Italics-supplied) .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">It is, in our opinion, impossible to draw a distinction. between the doctrine stated in the <em>Lightner case </em>and that-stated in the <em>Penick case. </em>Whether the action for the recovery of damages be brought upon the charge of slander or upon the charge of libel, the test to be applied upon a plea, of privilege is the relevancy and pertinency of the alleged offending language to the matter- in inquiry. This being-our view of the applicable rule of law, the -question for determination is, was the language here complained of pertinent and relevant to the matter under inquiry in the; chancery suit of <em>Robins </em>v. <em>Massey, </em>Record No. 2468, supra?</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>We are unable to agree with counsel for plaintiff that the suit of <em>Robins </em>v. <em>Massey </em>was \u201ca chancery suit for an injunction.\u201d In this view we are fortified by the statement found in the petition for a writ of error. There we read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\">\u201cThe pleadings consist of bill of complaint, alleging the cause of action and with prayer for injunction to preclude sale of said stock, and for an accounting of the debt secured thereby, joint and several answer of the defendants, denying in large part the allegations of the bill of complaint, cross-bill of Jones &amp; Robins, Inc., seeking settlement of its account with Massey, and cross-bill of Robins seeking\u2019 an adjudication that ten of the fifty-five shares of stock belonged to him by virtue of facts and agreements alleged therein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The prayer of the bill of complaint of <em>Robins </em>v. <em>Massey, </em>etc., (Record 2468) is, in brief, that Jones, Robins and Jones &amp; Robins, Incorporated, be enjoined and restrained from advertising or selling the fifty-five shares of stock claimed by Massey; that they be required to render an account as to the indebtedness claimed to be due them by Massey; that a proper- accounting be had between the parties; and that the rights of the parties under said accounting be determined and, through such accounting, a proper judgment entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Another evidence of the scope of the inquiry in the chancery suit is the record (2468) containing two hundred and forty-eight pages dealing with the many controverted issues presented by the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">To attempt a <em>seriatim </em>discussion of the many questions involved would serve no good purpose. The <em>crux </em>of the present case is shown by the following facts: During the examination in chief , of Massey, it was brought out that in the year 1931 he had, without the knowledge or consent of any of the officers or directors of the Massey Builders\u2019 Supply Corporation, withdrawn for his personal use approximately ten thousand dollars of the corporate assets; that these withdrawals were discovered in February, 1932; that, on February 15, 1932, Massey wrote a letter to Jones in which he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>\u201cFebruary 15, 1932.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">\u201cMr. L. C. Jones,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">\u201cc/o Jones &amp; Robins,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-7\">\u201cRichmond, Virginia</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-8\">\u201cMy Dear Sir:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-9\">\u201cReferring further to our interview relative to my excess withdrawals from Massey Builders\u2019 Supply Corporation, I beg to confirm my statement to you that I intend to offer to the Board of Directors of the Company on account of these withdrawals, all of the unencumbered assets that I now have, or sufficient amount thereof to fully settle the account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-10\">\u201cIn doing this, I do not mean or intend in any way to weaken any security to you for any indebtedness that I may have to you, but do confirm my previous oral assignment to you of any equity that I may have in the fifty-five (55) shares of capital stock of the Massey Builders\u2019 Supply Corporation, now hypothecated with Central National Bank as collateral on what I owe, and this amount secured by the stock being now approximately Thirty-two Hundred Dollars ($3,200.00), and in order that there will be no misunderstanding about this matter, I hereby in consideration of the sum of Ten Dollars ($10.00) cash in hand paid to me by you, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, and other valuable consideration, do transfer, sell and assign to you all right, title and interest owned by me in said fifty-five shares of capital stock of Massey Builders\u2019 Supply Corporation over and above the claim of the said Central National Bank against said stock on account of the said debt of mine to the Bank for approximately Thirty-two Hundred Dollars, and any other obligations that I may owe to the said Bank, this assignment to be held by you as collateral for any and all obligations at this time owed by me to you and for any additional advances that you may make to me during the calendar year 1932.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-11\">\u201cWitness my hand and seal this 15th day of February, !932.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-12\">\u201cS. T. Massey. (Seal).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>It is shown, also, that pursuant to this letter he assigned 55 shares of the stock-of the corporation to secure certain indebtedness; that a meeting of the stockholders was held to consider these unauthorized withdrawals and at this meeting, mainly through the efforts of Jones, a brother-in-law of Massey, there was an adjustment of this matter over the protest of a minority of the stockholders who threatened criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">In this bill of complaint Massey denied any indebtedness to Jones and Robins and directly sought to control the future management of the corporation'. In an effort to show how the indebtedness to Jones and Robins, alleged in the cross-bill, came about, Jones was introduced as a witness. It was during his examination that the offending language was uttered.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">As we comprehend the testimony of Jones, it was clearly pertinent and relevant to show, if possible, the indebtedness claimed, and also to show the alleged unfitness of Massey to manage the corporation in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">The first assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">As the second assignment was not discussed in the petition for a writ of error, it will not be discussed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\u201c \u2018During the year 1931 Mr. Massey became financially involved with Massey Builders\u2019 Supply Corporation, whereby he had overdrawn his account in excess of $10,000.00 during 1931, and the early part of 1932, and Mr. Massey, with 107 shares of stock, Mr. Robins with 70 shares of stock, and myself with 70 shares of stock, held a controlling interest in the Massey Builders\u2019 Supply Corporation. When it was discovered that this shortage occurred, which was during the audit for the year 1931, I discussed the matter fully with Mr. Robins and Mr. Massey, and persuaded Mr. Robins to go along with me at a stockholders\u2019 meeting to save Mr. Massey harmless of any suit that might be brought that would involve him in any criminal affair.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\u201c(Meaning and intending to be believed that the plaintiff deliberately, fraudulently, and by theft attempted to wreck his business to his own personal profit, and that as a result thereof, that the plaintiff was facing arrest and criminal prosecution, with the inference that plaintiff had committed a crime.)</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">\u201cAnd further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">\u201c \u2018 * * * covering a part of the funds which he had withdrawn from the Company without consent or approval of any of the officers or directors.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-9\">\u201c(Meaning and intending it to be believed that the plaintiff fraudulently withdrew from his company, without proper approval, certain funds; that he was a common embezzler and unfit and untrustworthy to deal with the public.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">\u201cAnd further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-11\">\u201c \u2018A.

I think the record will indicate in the voting at this meeting that Mr. Robins and myself and Gordon Maynard and Bob Frye were the only people who stood by him. All the other people were bitterly opposed to my shielding him in this affair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-12\">\u201c \u2018Q.
