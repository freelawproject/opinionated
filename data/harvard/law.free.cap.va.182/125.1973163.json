For fear that an injustice may have been done appellee if the original order of this court is allowed to stand, we now modify so much of the opinion as directs a final decree on this issue to be entered against the appellee. For the purpose of correcting the decree entered by this court on the nth day of October, 1943, a rehearing will be granted and another, decree entered here remanding the case to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>circuit court with direction to ascertain the value of this stock in the two Building and Loan' Associations, owned by the appellee or her husband on the 27th day of September, 1938, or when sold, to ascertain whether or not G. F. Stroebel or his administratrix has paid this sum or any part thereof to apellee, and to enter a decree accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
