His order reads in part as follows: \u201c(4) That defendant pay into the registry of the court the sum of $524,990.16, there to await the final determination of this action. (5) That upon paying said sum of $524,-\u2022990.16 into the registry of the court defendant be and is discharged from any and all liability either in this action or otherwise with respect to the credit balance of $524,990.16 heretofore held by it in the name of The Directorate General of The Postal Remittances and Savings Bank. * * * (8) That this Court retain jurisdiction of this cause for the determination of the rights of the plaintiffs and the inter-pleaded defendants in and to said sum of $524,990.16.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b387-13\">Before LEARNED HAND, CHASE and FRANK, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b387-14\">FRANK, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b387-15\">1. Plaintiffs brought suit against but one defendant, the Express Company. The order, from which plaintiffs appeal, discharged that sole defendant \u201cfrom any and all liability\u201d to the plaintiffs. Thus there ended the plaintiffs\u2019 action against the only person they had sued. As the district judge said in his opinion, the effect of the order is that, \u201cfor all practical purposes,\u201d the Express Company has become \u201cmerely an indifferent bystander.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> [95 F.Supp. 744.] Such an order clearly seems, on its face, final and appealable. But the Express Company argues that it is not so, on this account: The order was entered on the Express Company\u2019s counterclaim which brought in new defendants, claiming to be entitled to the money owing by the Express Company, and the suit will now go forward between plaintiffs and those new defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-17\">Aside from Rule 54(b), Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. 28 U.S.C.A., which we shall discuss later, support for that argument must be found in the doctrine of Hohorst v. Hamburg-American Packet Co., 148 U.S. 262, 13 S.Ct. 590, 37 L.Ed. 443. But we think the Hohorst doctrine inapposite here. It applies where the dismissal is of a party or parties jointly charged, or jointly claiming, with other parties who are not dismissed;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but there is no doctrine that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>finality is lacking in an order simply and solely because it dismisses less than all the parties. Where \u201cjointness,\u201d in some form,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is absent, the test in multiple party cases is whether the order terminates the suit \u201cas a severable matter,\u201d or a \u201cdistinct matter,\u201d with respect to the party dismissed. See, e. g., Gibbons v. Equitable Life Assur. Soc., 2 Cir., 173 F.2d 337, 339; Zarati S. S. Co. v. Park Bridge Corp., 2 Cir., 154 F.2d 377, 379; Withenbury v. U.

Roberts, 8 Cir., 59 F. 836, 839, where the court held appealable an order denying interpleader; \u201cA case cannot be brought to this court piecemeal. An order, judgment, or decree which leaves the rights of the parties to the suit affected by it undetermined \u2014 one which does not substantially and completely determine the rights of the parties affected by it in that suit \u2014 is not reviewable here until a final decision is rendered, nor is an order retaining or dismissing parties defendant, who are charged to be jointly liable to the complainant in the suit, appealable. U.S. v. Girault, 11 How. 22, 32, [13 L.Ed. 587]; Hohorst v. Packet Co., 148 U.S. 262, 263, 13 S.Ct. 590 [37 L.Ed. 443], But a final decision which completely determines the rights, in the suit in which it is rendered, of some of the parties who are not claimed to be jointly liable with those against whom the suit is retained, and a final decision which completely determines a collateral matter distinct from the general subject of litigation, and finally settles that -controversy, is subject to review in this court by appeal or writ of error. In Withenbury v. U. S., 5 Wall. 819, [18 L.Ed. 613], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>several libels were filed for the condemnation, as prize of war, of large quantities of cotton and other property. These libels were consolidated, and various claims were interposed in the consolidated suit for portions of the property, and among them the claim of Withenbury &amp; Doyle. An order was made dismissing this claim, with costs, while the suit remained pending and the cotton and its proceeds undisposed of. The supreme court held that this order was appealable, because it completely determined the whole matter in controversy between these claimants and the United States, and was final as to all the parties to that severable controversy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The following kinds of orders have thus been held appealable: (a) An order dismissing claims of some only of several plaintiffs in a trust accounting action, where the divers claims are not joint.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (b) An order dismissing a claim of a creditor in a receivership proceeding, although the several claims of other creditors remain undetermined.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (c) An order denying the title of but one of several claimants in a condemnation suit, the claims not being joint.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (d) An order denying intervention when it is a matter of right.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-16\">In Dickinson v. Petroleum Conversion Corp., 338 U.S. 507, at pages 513-516, 70 S.Ct. 322, at page 325, 94 L.Ed. 299, the Supreme Court (reversing this court, at this court\u2019s invitation)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> said: \u201cWhen its claims were dismissed by the decree of April 1947, any grievance that Petroleum Conversion Corporation had was fully matured. At that point Petroleum was out of the case. The decree was not tentative, informal nor incomplete as to it; and the case was concluded and closed as to its counterclaims. The court\u2019s reservation of jurisdiction to supervise the distribution of the shares of stock and the provision for further proceedings to determine the individual shares in the aggregate recovery allowed did not in any manner affect Petroleum\u2019s rights. What the court reserved was essenti\u00e1lly supervisory jurisdiction over the distribution among the class of the recovery awarded the inter-venors as the class\u2019 representatives. The only questions were, so to speak, internal to the intervening interest. Petroleum no longer had any concern with these questions and, however they were resolved, Petroleum could not possibly have been affected. The court obviously selected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>with deliberation the issues it would close by the decree and those it would reserve for future decision. If it had any purpose to leave open any issue concerning Petroleum\u2019s contentions, or affecting its interests, half a line in the decree would have done so. But that half-line was not written.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">The precise question of the appealability of an order discharging an interpleading \u201cstakeholder\u201d is new in this Circuit. The Third and Eighth Circuits have held such an order appealable. See Bank of Taiwan v. Gorgas-Pierie Mfg. Co., 3 Cir., 273 F. 660; Huxley v. Pennsylvania Warehousing Co., 3 Cir., 184 F. 705; Liberty Oil Co. v. Condon National Bank, 8 Cir., 271 F. 928, 930.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Professor Moore, citing those cases, maintains that such an order is appealable. He says :<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cSince such interpleader action \u2018involves two successive litigations: one between the plaintiff and the defendants as to whether the defendants shall interplead; the other between the different defendants on the conflicting claims\u2019<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u2014 the order granting or denying interpleader should be considered a final order.\u201d With this statement we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Opposed to our conclusion is Credit Bureau of San Diego v. Petrasich, 9 Cir., 97 F.2d 65, where the court cited and relied upon Huxley v. Pennsylvania Warehousing &amp; Safe Deposit Co., 170 F. 587, but neglected to note that there the stakeholder had not been discharged and that in a later stage of the Huxley Case, 3 Cir., 184 F. 705, the Circuit Court entertained an appeal from the discharge order. Other cases cited by the Express Company are not in point.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-19\">As above noted, Standley v. Roberts, 8 Cir., 59 F. 836, held that an appeal will lis from an order denying interpleader.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Express Company argues that, although such an order is final, it is unlike that here, because \u201cit disposes of all the rights of the interpleading party against all the claimants, and refuses him an equitable remedy of long standing.\u201d But the order here, discharging the interpleading party, \u201cdisposes of all the rights\u201d of the plaintiffs against that party.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-20\">2. However, thanks to Rule 54 (b) as amended in 1948, the order is not final and appealable because here there are multiple claims, and because the trial judge did not \u201cdirect the entry of a final judgment * * * upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment.\u201d We interpret the Rule as meaning no more than this: Before the Rule, an order of the kind described therein, even if it would otherwise have been final, was nevertheless interlocutory when the trial judge stated that he was reserving the power to alter it, for then it was but a provisional or tentative order. As, by his explicit reservation, he left the order revocable, he kept it in suspense, and therefore truly interlocutory, hence not appealable.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The only effect of Rule 54(b) is that it requires us to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>treat the trial judge\u2019s silence concerning an order covered by that Rule as the equivalent of such an explicit reservation; in failing to utter a \u201cdetermination,\u201d he is deemed to have made his order subject to his own recall at any time before the end of the entire litigation ;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> so interpreted, there is no question of the Rule\u2019s validity, as there might be if it diminished the statutory jurisdiction of the upper courts under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Our experience indicates that at least some trial judges are not aware that orders within Rule 54(b), although they would otherwise be final, are not appealable without such \u201cdeterminations,\u201d so that at times the withholding of the requisite formula has apparently been inadvertent; in several cases, in each of which we said we would entertain an appeal if the trial judge supplied the \u201cdetermination,\u201d he has done so.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In the instant case, it is difficult to believe that the trial judge, by his silence, intended to render his discharge order not final. For pretty obviously he intended that, if the plaintiffs elsewhere sued the Express Company, or if the impleaded defendants sued that Company, his discharge order would be available to the Express Company by way of <em>res judicata. </em>Yet, as that order, absent a \u201cdetermination,\u201d is not now final, it can have no <em>res judicata </em>effect.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-19\">In all probability, the Express Company will deplore that result and will therefore join the plaintiffs in a request to the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>judge to enter a \u201cdetermination,\u201d and in all likelihood he will comply with that request. Accordingly, we need not consider whether, in any circumstances, mandamus will issue,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and whether, if so, this would be a proper case for the use of that writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Following our previous decisions,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> we hold as follows: If the plaintiffs procure from the trial judge the prescribed action, they may file a new appeal; and if all parties file a consent to such a course, we will decide' the questions raised upon the present appeal record as thus supplemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-18\">. According to the record of the district eourt, the Express Company, since the entry of the order, has deposited the money in the registry of the district court. That fact is not a part of the record before this court. We could direct that it be made part of the appellate record. But that seems an idle ceremony, as the fact is incontrovertible. Cf. Dunham v. Townshend, 118 N. Y. 281, 23 N.E. 367; De Luca v. Atlantic Refining Co., 2 Cir., 176 F.2d 421, 423.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AlU\">. In the Hohorst case itself, the court specifically emphasized the fact of al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>leged joint liability; see 148 U.S. at page 266, and the court\u2019s discussion at page 265, 13 S.Ct. at page 591, of earlier decisions. Judge Sanborn, in Standley v. Roberts, 8 Cir., 59 F. 836, 839, discussing Hohorst, underscored the element of a joint liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">In the following eases which, either before or after Hohorst, applied the Hohorst doctrine, the joint element was present and, usually, was pointed out: Frow v.

The Supreme Court has said that the 1934 statute which empowered it to promulgate procedural rules for \u201cthe district courts\u201d gave it no authority to affect the statutory jurisdiction of any of the courts and particularly of the appellate courts. In Sibbach v. Wilson, 312 U.S. 1, 10, 61 S.Ct. 422, 425, 85 L.Ed. 479, the Court, citing and construing this very Rules statute, referred to \u201cthe inability of a court, by rule, to extend or restrict the jurisdiction conferred by a statute.\u201d In support of this statement, the Court cited several cases. In one of those cases, Hudson v.
