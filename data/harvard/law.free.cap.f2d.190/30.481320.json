Penn Jersey Welding Co. v. Lowe, 3 Cir., 1950, 183 F.2d 936; Hampton Roads Stevedoring Corp. v. O\u2019Hearne, Deputy Commissioner, 4 Cir., 1950, 184 F.2d 76; Brown-Pacific Maxon Co. v. Cardillo, S.D.N.Y. 1950, 91 F.Supp. 968.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Apparently no court has held to the contrary. Appellant contends that the mentioned cases were incorrectly decided, relying on passages in the legislative history of the amendatory act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Cases in various state courts are also cited, involving somewhat similar questions under state legislation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After considering the contentions of the appellant, and the materials on which they are based, we are satisfied that the cited decisions of the Third and Fourth Circuits and of the District Court for the Southern District of New York are correct and should be followed. Accordingly, the judgment appealed from will be</p>\n<p id=\"Az\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b82-25\">.

While the case here on appeal arises under the District of Columbia Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, that Act is the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, supra, made applicable to workers in the District of Columbia by the act of May 17, 1928, 45 Stat. 600, D.C.Code, \u00a7 36-501.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b83-9\">. Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare on S. 2237 and Related Bills, 80th Cong., 2d Sess., April, 1948, p. 56; H.R.Rep.No.2095, 80th Cong., 2d Sess., June 1, 1948, p. 9. We regard this material as indicating the desire of Congress to avoid retroactive application of the amendatory act, as well as to avoid administrative difficulties and constitutional questions. But such matters are not directly involved in the instant proceeding, and we do not find anything in the legislative history which requires us to give a strained construction to what we regard as the clear language of section 6 of the' amendatory act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b83-13\">. Among the cases cited are: In re Beausoleil\u2019s Case, 1947, 321 Mass. 344, 73 N.E.2d 461; Hardin v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, 1937, 118 W.Va. 198, 189 S.E. 670; Cote v. Bachelder-Worcester Co., 1932, 85 N.H. 444, 160 A. 101, 82 A.L.R. 1239; Stanswsky v. Industrial Comm., 1931, 344 Ill. 436, 176 N.E. 898; Thorpe v.

We do not, however, regard cases arising under state statutes providing for contractual liability of employers as being controlling in respect of legislation of the type here involved, which is compulsory.
