They are covered by the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which not only grants compensation benefits but also expressly forbids them from suing the Government for injuries received in the course of their duties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Congress has thus, in most instances, left no doubt as to its desire to limit Federal employees to their remedy under the Compensation Act and to preclude double recovery or an election of remedies. If the members of the United 'States Park Police are covered by the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act, appellant would in consequence be barred from maintaining this suit. The coverage of that Act is, however, 'left to the primary determination of the agency administering it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As that agency has expressed no views on whether the Compensation Act covers the Park <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Police, and as we need not reach that question in disposing of this case, we deem it inappropriate for our consideration here. For we think that whether or not the Act is applicable to appellant, this suit cannot be maintained. Accordingly, we express no opinion on the effect of the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act other than to note it as a general statement of a congressional policy favoring a remedy through compensation rather than by action in tort for Federal employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The Supreme Court has recently had occasion to pass upon a case somewhat similar to the one now before us, a suit brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act by a member of the armed services injured on active duty through the negligence of another soldier. Feres v. United States, 340 U.S. 135, 71 S.Ct. 153. In concluding that such suits were not maintainable, Mr. Justice Jackson had this to say, among other things;</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\u201cThe primary purpose of the Act was to extend a remedy to those who had been without; if it incidentally benefited those already well provided for, it appears to have been unintentional. Congress was suffering from no plague of private bills on the behalf of military and naval personnel, because a comprehensive system of relief had been authorized for them and their dependents by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">\u201cWe know of no American 'law which ever has permitted a soldier to recover for negligence, against either his superior officers or the government he is serving. Nor is there any liability \u2018under like circumstances,\u2019 for no private individual has power to conscript or mobilize a private army with such authorities over persons as the Government vests in echelons of command.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-14\"><em>* </em>* * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b75-15\">\u201cThis Court, in deciding claims for wrongs incident to service under the Tort Claims Act, cannot escape attributing some bearing upon it to enactments by Congress which provide systems of simple, certain, and uniform compensation for injuries or death of those in armed services.\u201d 340 U.S. at pages 140, 141, 142, 144, 71 S.Ct. at pages 156, 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-16\">By parity of reasoning we think the same result must be reached in this case. Like the soldier in the Feres case, the Park Policeman obtains the benefit of \u201csystems of simple, certain, and uniform compensation for injuries or death.\u201d Members of the Park Police are by congressional enactment entitled \u201cto all the benefits of relief and retirement\u201d furnished by the \u201cpolicemen and firemen\u2019s relief fund, District of Columbia\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That \u201cstatutory scheme contemplates a broad system of relief, by way of medical and hospital care and treatments, pensions, retirement * * <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As was said in the Feres case, \u201cIf Congress had contemplated that this Tort Act would be held to apply in cases of this kind, it is difficult to see why it should have omitted any provision to adjust these two types of remedy to each other.\u201d 340 U.S. 135, 144, 71 S.Ct. 153, 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-18\">The analogy to the Feres case is given additional strength by the fact that a member of the United States Park Police, though a civilian employee,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> occupies a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>status involving a high degree of discipline and physical risk. 'Sound policy would seem to require \u2014 and we think that Congress has required \u2014 that employees in such positions be not relegated to a remedy in tort but rather be protected by a well-defined system of compensation for the hazards of their employment. Here such a system exists by congressional enactment. And in view of the general policy of Congress not to permit Federal employees to recover under the Tort Claims Act for injury at work, it certainly would seem unwarranted to permit members of the Park Police \u2014 uniquely among Federal employees \u2014 to maintain suits for damages, since the nature of their work and the benefits they receive suggest the contrary result. See Dahn v. Davis, 258 U.S. 421, 432, 42 S.Ct. 320, 66 L.Ed. 696; Dobson v. United States, 2 Cir., 27 F.2d 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Congress is the body which must ultimately pass on the question of the amount and sufficiency of the benefits to be received by the Park Police, or by any other group of Federal employees. Congress am nually appropriates for their salaries and for the amounts to be contributed by the Federal Government under legislation providing for retirement pay and compensation, for injuries. Congress can increase or reduce these amounts. It can grant new gratuities through private bill or general legislation. And \u201cif we misinterpret the Act, at least Congress possesses a ready remedy.\u201d Feres v. United States, supra, 341 U.S. at page 138, 71 S.Ct. at page 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">In view of the conclusion we have-reached, we 'find it unnecessary to discuss-the other defenses raised by the Government, including the so-called \u201cfellow-servant\u201d doctrine. The judgment of the District Court, dismissing the complaint, is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b74-14\">.
