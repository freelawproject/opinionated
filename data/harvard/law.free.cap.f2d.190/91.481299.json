Neither party took testimony and no appearance was recorded here for appellee when the cases were reached for argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">The record discloses that on May 16, 1945, applicant, Perfumes Habana, S. - A., a corporation organized under the laws of Cuba and doing business there at 316 San Lazaro Street, Havana, filed an application under section 5 of the Act of 1905, now 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052, for the registration of a-trade-mark for use on perfumes, eau de cologne, rouges, and lip colorings.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">The applicant\u2019s mark, as shown in the accompanying drawings, consisted of four parts: a box frame or outline within which the word \u201cChance\u201d is printed over a- small pictorial feature of the head and shoulders of a man and woman facing each other, beneath which design, in printed script, is the word \u201cCherigan.\u201d Continuous use of the mark by the applicant and its predecessors was alleged since 1937.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">The applicant\u2019s mark was passed in due course for publication in the Official Gazette, and on July 23, 1947, appellant, Coty, Inc., a Delaware corporation filed a notice of opposition which alleged prior use since 1909 -by itself and its predecessors in the United States and many other countries of the three trade-marks \u201cLorigan,\u201d registered September 27, 1921; \u201cL\u2019Origan,\u201d registered May 20, 1924; and \u201cL\u2019Origan,\u201d with the pictorial feature of a leaf, registered August 5, 1924. There is no dispute that such registrations are the property of appellant and that they have been properly renewed and assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">Appellant\u2019s marks were registered under the provisions of the Act of 1905, now 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1051 et seq., for use on goods which include the identical articles and goods of the same descriptive properties for which the applicant, Perfumes Habana, S. A., sought to have its mark registered in this country;</p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">With respect to the products sold by appellant under its respective marks .down through the years, and with respect to the newcomer\u2019s applications to register, appellant made the following allegations, among other things, in its notice of opposition :</p>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">\u201c2. Said products [of appellant\u2019s] having been manufactured with great care and skill and made of the finest ingredients, have attained an enviable reputation and a good will which have been and remain of great value to the opposer herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-13\">\u201c6. Since the adoption of the term \u201cL\u2019ORIGAN\u201d opposer has given the goods bearing such identifying indicia widespread publicity and by means of advertising, such as by newspapers, magazines, trade papers, radio and other media, such products have become well and favorably known in the United States of America.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-14\">\u201c10. The mark sought to be registered by the applicant is confusingly similar to-the opposer\u2019s trade marks herein described and would cause confusion in the trade and in the mind and eyes of the consuming public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-15\">The Examiner of Interferences, H. H. Kalupy, rendered his decision on May 2, 1949, wherein he not only sustained the opposition instituted by appellant, but also decided that the applicant was not entitled to the registration of its mark. On' the issue of confusing similarity the examiner held:</p>\n<p id=\"b144-16\">\u201cWhile the mark of the applicant is a composite one containing certain pictorial features and other matter, it obviously is dominated by the words \u2018Chance\u2019 and \u2018Cherigan\u2019, which comprise the principal features thereof. W. B. Roddenbery Co. v. Kalich, 596 O.G. 287, 158 F.2d 289, [34] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>C.C.P.A. [Patents, 745], * * * it is noted that the words \u2018Chance\u2019 and \u2018Cheri-gan\u2019 do not appear together as a unitary-expression in the mark disclosed on the drawing of the applicant\u2019s application, but rather, each of these words is shown standing alone, being separated a substantial distance by the pictorial matter. Manifestly, each of these words is an arbitrary and distinctive term capable of denoting origin, and it seems only reasonable to assume therefore, notwithstanding applicant\u2019s contention to the contrary, that purchasers would quite frequently rely upon the term \u2018Cherigan\u2019 alone in calling for the applicant\u2019s products. The suffix portion of this term \u2018Cherigan\u2019 is identical with the suffix portion of the opposer\u2019s mark \u2018L\u2019Origan\u2019, and in sound this term is believed to be so nearly like .the opposer\u2019s mark \u2018L\u2019Origan\u2019 as clearly to be confusingly similar thereto. Similarity in sound alone is sufficient to determine confusing similarity between marks. Marion Lambert, Inc., v. O\u2019Conner [O\u2019Connor], 477 O.G. 244, 86 F.2d 980, [24] C.C.P.A. [781]; McKinnon &amp; Company v. HyVis Oils, Inc., 484 O.G. 746, 88 F.2d 699, [24] C.C.P.A. [1105]\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Perfumes Habana, S. A., appealed from the decision of the Examiner of Interferences to the Commissioner of Patents who, acting through Assistant Commissioner Daniels, reversed the examiner\u2019s decision in so far as it sustained the notice of opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Recourse to the official report of the decision by the commissioner, 83 U.S.P.Q. 438, discloses that the instant' application for registration by Perfumes Habana, S. A., also had been opposed by two other corporations of this country, namely, Chanel, Inc., and Cheramy, Inc., and in each of the resulting proceedings the opposition was sustained by the concurring decisions of both the Examiner of Interferences and the Commissioner of Patents. Cheramy, Inc. v. Perfumes Habana, S. A., 81 U.S.P.Q. 550, [two cases]; Chanel, Inc. v. Perfumes Habana, S. A., 83 U.S.P.Q. 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">The three cases just cited, together with the pertinent holdings upon which the commissioner based his reversal in the instant case, are discussed in the following excerpts from the commissioner\u2019s decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-9\">\u201cIt is applicant\u2019s contention that the inclusion of the word \u201cChance\u201d in its mark eliminates any likelihood of confusion. \u201cCherigan\u201d is, however, a conspicuous, independent portion of applicant\u2019s mark, <em>and as found in a previous opposition involving this mark, Cheramy, Inc., v. Perfumes Ha-bana, S. A., 624 O.G. 975, 81 U.S.P.Q. 550, the inclusion of the word \u201cChance\u201d is not sufficient to eliminate likelihood of confusion.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-10\">ijs * sfc * ^ *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-11\">\u201cConsidered in their entireties, there appears to be little similarity in appearance and the final portion of the mark does not appear to be so emphasized in any reasonable pronunciation of the marks as to indicate likelihood of confusion. Yeasties Products, Inc., v. General Mills, Inc., 22 C.C.P.A. 1215, 77 F.2d 523. * * * <em>Whether or not applicant is entitled to the registration for which it has made application must however depend upon the final outcome of certain other proceedings brought against this application. Cheramy, Inc. v. Perfumes Habana, S. A., supra; Chanel, Inc. v. Perfumes Habana, S. A., opposition No. 26,569, decided by the examiner of interference June 14, 1949.\" </em>(Italics supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">The applicant, Perfumes Habana, S. A., has not appealed from the first portion of the concurring decisions of the Patent Office hereinbefore set forth, which held that the inclusion of the word \u201cChance\u201d in the applicant\u2019s mark was not sufficient to eliminate the likelihood of confusion. In that respect the applicant is bound by the decision of the Patent Office,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the point need not be further considered here.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>The issue of confusing similarity must be resolved by comparing the appearance, sound, and meaning of the respective marks and evaluating those three factors in their entirety as assembled in each contested mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Supplementing what has been said about the contested marks in this case by the tribunals of the Patent Office, it is noted that \u201cCherigan,\u201d \u201cLorigan,\u201d and \u201cL\u2019Ori-gan\u201d are terms of three syllables each and that the first syllable is but a small part of the entire mark. Two-thirds of each mark, the suffixes thereof, are identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">It is worthy of consideration that the portion of \u201cCherigan\u201d which differs from \u201cL\u2019Origan\u201d is the first syllable \u201cChe,\u201d taken from the famous trade-mark \u201cCheramy,\u201d owned and in use on goods of the same descriptive properties by Cheramy, Inc., supra. The \u201cChan\u201d in \u201cChance\u201d was likewise appropriated by the applicant from the mark \u201cChanel\u201d of Chanel, Inc., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The two words here in issue are identical in appearance and sound in so far as the applicant has appropriated the last five letters of the eight letters of which appellant\u2019s entire marks are comprised. In other words, there can be no doubt, since the majority of the letters and syllables of both of these marks are identical, and identically assembled, that when the marks are pronounced as written they sound a great deal alike. That factor alone has often been the cause of rejection in this court of the newcomer\u2019s application for registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The action by which the Acting Commissioner of Patents put an end to appellant\u2019s contentions and overruled the Examiner of Interferences in these proceedings was embraced in this one effective paragraph from the commissioner\u2019s decision :</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">\u201cWith respect to similarity between \u201cCherigan\u201d and \u201cL\u2019Origan,\u201d I am unable to agree with the examiner of interferences. It is true that the last letters of each word' are the same. They clearly, however, have no similarity in meaning. (See discussion of meaning of opposer\u2019s mark in the Le Blume Import Co., Inc., v. Coty et al., [2 Cir.] 293 F. 344).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">The meaning of appellant\u2019s mark thus imported into these proceedings from the case cited by the commissioner embodies the newcomer\u2019s unsuccessful defense there whereby Le Blume sought to justify the unlawful appropriation and concurrent use of the word \u201cOrigan\u201d on the ground that \u201cLorigan\u201d or \u201cL\u2019Origan\u201d consisted merely of a descriptive term which in French was the name of a rare plant or flower used in making perfume<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the other hand, the commissioner accepted and applied that portion of the examiner\u2019s decision which held, as hereinbefore set forth, that the applicant\u2019s mark \u201cCherigan\u201d was merely an \u201carbitrary and distinctive term capable of denoting origin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">Thus by decapitating two marks of world-wide distinction, \u201cCheramy\u201d and \u201cL\u2019Origan,\u201d and by transplanting the head of one upon the body of the other, the applicant, Perfumes Habana, S. A., stands before the court with the new and arbitrary word \u201cCherigan\u201d which has no meaning whatever. By intermeshing those two marks applicant derived a device designed to trap the unwary.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">This court was once confronted with an analogous case involving perfume and every legal point advanced before the tribunals of the Patent Office in the instant case. See E. Daltroff &amp; Cie v. Vivaudou, Inc., 715, 53 F.2d 536, 537, 19 C.C.P.A., Patents. The applicant\u2019s contentions there, which are directly in point here, were recited and overruled by the late Judge Hatfield writing for a unanimous court and stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-13\">\u201cIt is true, as argued by counsel for appellant, that the involved marks are not identical in appearance, sound, or meaning. They differ slightly in each of those characteristics. However, the question before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>us is whether the marks are confusingly similar, not whether they are identical. Counsel for appellant has laid considerable stress upon the difference in meaning of the two marks. It is urged that \u2018Chez Lui\u2019 has a strictly masculine meaning, \u2018his home,\u2019 whereas 'Chez Moi,\u2019 not so restricted, means \u2018my home.\u2019 From this, it is argued that the masculinity of the mark \u2018Chez Lui\u2019 is sufficient to cause women, who, it is claimed, are practically the exclusive purchasers of perfumery, to distinguish between the two marks, and therefore confusion would not result.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">It must be remembered that the validity of an opposer\u2019s mark, as decided in the case last cited, will not be considered in a trade-mark opposition proceeding and that the mark of the newcomer must be such as to clearly avoid not only confusion in trade under the law of trade-marks, but also under the law of unfair competition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, the rights to be considered in an opposition proceeding are not only the private rights of the parties to the action but also the rights of the public which are paramount to those of the respective contestants. The same rule applies in other federal courts with respect to infringement, as evidenced by the decision in the Le Blume case, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Throughout these proceedings and for more than a generation it has been recognized on all sides that appellant\u2019s trademark and products here in issue have together achieved world-wide eminence for quality and distinction. That was so determined by the federal courts of this country, as well as the validity of appellant\u2019s mark, in the case of Le Blume Import Co., Inc., v. Coty, Inc., et al., 2 Cir., 293 F. 344, 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The prestige of a famous trademark may not be relied upon by a newcomer, however, as a license under which the courts may authorize the registration of an identical mark of foreign origin or a confusingly similar counterfeit for use on goods of the same descriptive properties.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">The Commissioner of Patents, in placing the imprimatur of the Patent Office of the United States Government upon applicant\u2019s marks by granting registration thereof, pursued a method of reasoning whereby the trivial was exploited and the important ignored. As Mr. Justice Holmes put it, writing for a unanimous Court in Coca-Cola Co. v. Koke Co. of America, 254 U.S. 143, 41 S.Ct. 113, 65 L.Ed. 189; \u201cOf course a man is not to be protected in the use of a device the very purpose and effect of which is to swindle the public.\u201d Justice Holmes further pointed out there that the defects of an owner\u2019s trade-mark \u201cdo not offer a very broad ground for allowing another to swindle him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">Outstanding at this time are two unmodified decisions of the Commissioner of Patents which hold that the applicant\u2019s mark here in issue is confusingly similar to the marks of two other distinguished concerns dealing in perfumes and cosmetics. One of those prior decisions, at least,, was known to the commissioner and recorded in the Patent Office when the decision in the instant case was handed down.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-13\">The commissioner has not explained the results that will follow in the market place from his refusal on the one hand to register the applicant\u2019s mark because it is confusingly similar to those recorded in the two other cases while at the same time authorizing the applicant on the other hand, so far as appellant is concerned, to continue the use of applicant\u2019s mark by reason of its registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-14\">The decision of the Commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>o\u00ed Patents in the instant case should be reversed on the ground of public interest; the same ground. upon which he was reversed by this court in the recent case of Tidy-House Paper Products, Inc., v. Tidy House Products Co., Etc., 189 F.2d 280, 38 C.C.P.A., Patents,-.</p>\n<p id=\"AQ8\">Reversed,</p>\n<p id=\"AqD\">WORLEY, J., dissents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-13\">.
