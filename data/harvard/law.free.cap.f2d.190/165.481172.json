The court held that restitution should be denied because all of the overcharges were collected more than one year prior to the commencement of the action. From a judgment dismissing the action the United States has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">The premises were not decontrolled by conversion, because no order was issued by the Housing Expediter decontrolling them. The Housing and Rent Act of 1947, as amended by the 1949 Act, 50 U.S.C.A.Ap-cbndix, \u00a7 1881 et seq., \u00a7 202(c) (3) (A) reads, in part, as follows: \u201cProvided, however, That any housing accommodations resulting from any conversion created on or after the effective date of the Housing and Rent Act of 1949 (April 1, 1949) shall continue to be controlled housing accommodations unless the Housing Expediter issues an order decontrolling them, * *</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">The sole remaining question presented is whether the court erred in denying restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-13\">On authority of United States v. Fo-galey, 10 Cir., 190 F.2d 163, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
