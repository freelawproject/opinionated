The applicant\u2019s, second mark, as shown in the accompanying drawings, likewise consisted of four' parts: a box frame or outline within which the words \u201cfleurs de\u201d are printed above a pictorial feature of two leaves, beneath which is the word \u201cCherigan\u201d in printed' script. The leaves of the applicant\u2019s mark are substantially identical with the leaf or leaves in the specimens of its marks submitted by appellant with its notice of' opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-22\">The examiner in the second proceeding, held that the words \u201cfleurs de\u201d were merely the French equivalent for the English\u2019 words \u201cflowers of\u201d and possessed little if any trade-mark significance; that purchasers would rely on the word \u201cCherigan\u201d' in calling for and identifying the source of applicant\u2019s products; and that that word,, for the reasons stated in the companion-opposition, was confusingly similar to appellant\u2019s mark \u201cL\u2019Origan,\u201d with or without the accompanying leaf. The examiner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>\u25a0further held that the applicant was not \u2022entitled to register its second mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The commissioner in reversing the examiner\u2019s decision in the second proceeding, 83 U.S.P.Q. 438, relied upon his comments and conclusions in the first case. This court, in turn, hereby reverses the decision of the commissioner in the second proceeding, for the reasons set forth in our decision in the companion appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">WORLEY, Judge, dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
