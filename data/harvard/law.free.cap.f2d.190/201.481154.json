Arrangements were made for such students to attend classes in the Fort Worth School District, and safe and adequate transportation for this purpose was provided and furnished for the trip of some 15 miles. In the present suit, the action of the Board of Trustees was attacked as contrary to the law of Texas, and as a discrimination because of race, contrary to the Federal Constitution. The suit sought a declaration to this effect, and to enjoin a continuance of the alleged discrimination. The Court did not grant an injunction, but awarded the declaratory relief sought and adjudged the arrangement discriminatory and invalid. The school trustees, officially and as individuals, have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-23\">Upon the argument here, appellees conceded that no administrative \u25a0 appeal from the action of the Board of Trustees was attempted, although it was also conceded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>that provision therefor is made by the laws of Texas. In these circumstances, upon application of the principles ruled in Cook v. Davis, 5 Cir., 178 F.2d 595, 602,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Federal Court should not have adjudicated the issue unless, and until, the state administrative procedures had been exhausted. We make no ruling upon the merits, but we reverse and set aside the judgment of, and remand the cause to, the trial Court for action consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Judgment reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b254-23\">.
