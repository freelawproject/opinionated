Title 29, \u00a7 160(b). The sole ground for that contention, as expressed in the petition for rehearing, is that, \u201cThese other unfair labor practices have never been the subject of a charge to the Board\u201d. In concluding that the Board had power to issue the complaint based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>such other alleged unfair labor practices, we held that the complaint merely \u201celaborated the charge with particularity.\u201d It follows that none of the unfair labor practices charged in the complaint were barred by limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">The petition for rehearing is Denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
