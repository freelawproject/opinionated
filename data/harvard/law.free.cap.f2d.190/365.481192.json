Clark, 335 U.S. 188, 68 S.Ct. 1443, 92 L.Ed. 1898; and also because it raises only factual issues concerning his guilt, which facts were known to him at the time of his trial, Sunal v. Large, 332 U.S. 174, 67 S.Ct. 1588, 91 L.Ed. 1982;</p>\n<p id=\"b417-27\">It is ordered that the Proceeding be treated as a motion to withdraw the plea of guilty, and, being so considered, the judgment of the District Court dismissing the Proceeding is affirmed.
