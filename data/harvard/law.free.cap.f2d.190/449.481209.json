As the evidence sustains the judge\u2019s findings on the issues of defendant\u2019s negligence and unseaworthiness, we affirm the dismissal of the first cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-28\">2. On the findings, which are not \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d Sperbeck was a seaman. Carumbo v. Cape Cod Steamship Co., 1 Cir., 123 F.2d 991; Sullivan v. United States, 2 Cir., 179 F.2d 924. He was therefore entitled to be paid the expense of maintenance and cure. The evidence sustains the finding that defendant had failed to pay it.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-29\">There remains the question of the survival of the claim for the unpaid expense of maintenance and cure which, of course, accrued before Sperbeck\u2019s death.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Judge Coxe has held that such a claim does survive.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Third Circuit, without discussion, has also so held.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It has been decided that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>hospital can recover from a shipowner, hy way of subrogation, the value of treatment of a seaman when the defendant failed to supply it;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> if that is correct, the claim here survived, for usually the same test applies for determining assignability (or subrogation) and for determining survival, We have discovered no other direct authorities (except a dictum in Cortes v. Baltimore Insular Line, 287 U.S. 367, 53 S.Ct. 173, 77 L.Ed. 368, which we shall discuss later).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Absent a statute, the general rule is that claims sounding in contract survive the death of either the obligor or the obli-gee, while those sounding in tort, if of a \u201cpersonal\u201d character, do not. These distinctions, it has been said, lack any present rhyme or reason.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If we turn for light to history, we find that the origin of the non-survival of \u201cpersonal\u201d tort claims is ancient and obscure.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Some say that it came about through the careless use by English judges 0f the maxim \u201cactio personalis moritur cum persona,\u201d and that in particular Coke \u2014often disingenuously inventing or misapplying sententious Latin phrases when he lacked good arguments or precedents<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\u2014 with unfortunate success popularized his erroneous version of that maxim.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>part, the opposition to such survival apparently owed much to the erstwhile criminal element of \u201cpersonal\u201d torts,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> an element not present in contract claims. Perhaps that partly explains the fact that, generally, quasi-contractual claims do not expire with the claimant or the claimee.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> At any rate since the non-survival rule is explicable historically only, not rationally, it would seem that, where no precedent otherwise requires, the rule should not be extended beyond the realm of torts.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Attempts to fit all the varieties of claims into neat categories, usable for all purposes, have never been satisfactory. Even the crudest of such attempts have never sought to shove into the category of torts all claims that are not contractual; for almost every purpose, it is granted that quasi-contractual (\u201cas if\u201d contractual) claims are not to be classified as torts, and that many claims arising from legal obligations imposed without regard to the intention of the obligated persons are quasi-contractual. Claims based on status seem clearly to be of that sort. To be sure, \u201cstatus\u201d is an ambiguous, leaky word.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Some status claims are partly contractual, partly not. This appears when one considers that frequently a contract itself creates a sort of status,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> since it often gives birth to obligations, legally imposed by the courts, for reasons of policy, which the parties to the contract did not intend or contemplate,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> so that many so-called contractual obligations may be viewed as to some extent quasi-contractual.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Here we come upon something like an unrecognized pun, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>and should <em>beware </em>of \u201cthe flatulencies that gather round the unacknowledged puns of language.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">With that caution in mind, it is important to perceive that the right to maintenance and cure lies on the 'borderline between \u201ccontract\u201d and \u201cquasi-contract\u201d: (1) It arises because there is a contract. More than a century ago, Mr. Justice Story, singularly wise in matters maritime, said of this right that it is \u201ca part of the contract for wages, and is a material ingredient in the compensation for the labor and services of the seamen\u201d;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the Supreme Court more recently quoted that statement with approval.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (2) On the other hand, the Court has said that the right is \u201cimplied in law as a contractual obligation,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>is quasi-contractual ;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and, noting that the right developed long before modern notions of contract,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the Court currently emphasizes its status (or \u201crelational\u201d) character.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Certainly such a right does not sound in tort; even more certainly, it never was and is not now founded upon a tort for \u201cpersonal\u201d injury.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-19\"><em>In Cortes v. </em>Baltimore Insular Line, 287 U.S. 367, 53 S.Ct. 173, 77 L.Ed. 368, a seaman fell ill without fault on the part of the ship, and later died. His administrator sued under the Jones Act, alleging that his death resulted from the ship\u2019s failure to afford him proper medical care. No claim was made for the expense of accrued maintenance and cure. This court \u2014 2 Cir., 52 F.2d 22- \u2014 held that.the obligation to provide cure was contractual, and that non-performance of a contractual obligation could not be deemed \u201cnegligence\u201d within the meaning of the Jones Act, which provides that the seaman\u2019s personal representative may recover for \u201cinjury or death\u201d of the seaman resulting from \u201cnegligence.\u201d The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the suit could be maintained if, on the facts, there was a causal relation between (a) the negligence in failing to furnish cure and (b) the death. The Court said that a failure to afford cure might yield two rights: (1) A right to the expense of the cure, regardless of negligence;<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> this right, the Court indicated in a dictum, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>would survive death without the aid of a statute. (2) A right, if the breach was negligent, for ensuing harm to the seaman\u2019s health; this second right does not survive except by a statute, such as the Jones Act,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> because it is on account of something in the nature of a \u201cpersonal\u201d tort <em>(i.e., </em>what is sometimes called a \u201ctortious breach of contract.\u201d)<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Azu\">Here the asserted right is the first kind, <em>i.e., </em>for the expense of accrued maintenance and cure, a right which had fully matured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>while the seaman lived, and which could then have at once been precisely determined in money terms. Surely (as the defendant itself vigorously asserts in its brief) this right did not grow out of a tort or a \"tortious breach of contract.\u201d For that reason we think inapplicable the New York statute<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> keeping alive actions for \"personal\u201d torts, despite Just v. Chambers, 312 U.S. 383, 61 S.Ct. 687, 85 L.Ed. 903,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and although we are aware of the present rather anemic condition of the doctrine of Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, 244 U.S. 205, 37 S.Ct. 524, 61 L.Ed. 1086.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> For the same reason, we regard as irrelevant the non-survival (other than by statute) of a claim for a seaman\u2019s wrongful death,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> since such a claim is for a tort or a \"tortious breach of contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-15\">We have here, then, a wholly non-tort obligation, \u201crelational\u201d or status in nature, and thus quasi-contractual but emerging from a contract, an obligation said to resemble closely the equitable duty of a trustee to his <em>cestui </em>or a guardian to his ward.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> As already noted, many quasi-contractual obligations survive,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> including those derived from status.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> So, too, do many claims for breaches of equitable duties.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-16\">Accordingly, believing that, although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>death maxim is not yet dead, it should not be given enlarged potency, we hold \u2014 on the bases of history, analytic classification, analogy, common sense, reason, and justice \u2014that the claim here did not follow the seaman into his grave.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-13\">.

(1895) 13, 25-26: \u201cSecond, the fact that the great majority of legal maxims are clothed in the words of a dead language has had, in some instances, the effect of preventing proper inquiry into their meaning. A phrase couched in Latin seems to some persons invested with \u2018a kind of mysterious halo.\u2019 Of course, Judge Lord was right when he said: \u2018There is nothing of mystery or of sanctity in the words-of a dead language.\u2019 But no one who reflects on the subject can doubt that some useless Latin maxims, and some untrue Latin maxims, have continued current, and that other Latin maxims have been misapplied, when this would not have happened if those maxims had been expressed only in the vernacular. How else- can we account for the way in which certain phrases are put forward as containing the reason for a rule, when the same phrase reduced into plain English is obviously nothing more than a restatement of the rule itself? A phrase, when put to such a use, may fairly be characterized as a \u2018question-begging maxim.\u2019 It is not an explanation; \u2018it is merely an artificial statement of the thing to be explained\u2019; it is \u2018dogma,\u2019 not \u2018reasoning.\u2019 Lord Bacon tells us that he put the maxims in Latin, because he regarded that language \u2018as the briefest to contrive the rules compendiously, the aptest for memory, and of the greatest authority and majesty to be vouched and alleged in argument.\u2019 No doubt these advantages are entitled to consideration; but there is the obvious disadvantage that maxims \u2018put in Latin\u2019 will be more liable to be misunderstood by the average lawyer than by a man of Bacon\u2019s scholarship. And although the maxims have now been translated by modern editors, yet they are still generally cited in their Latin garb.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-14\">In our day, long English words of Latin origin \u2014 sometimes in the form of sociological or pseudo-scientific gobblydegook \u2014often have hypnotic or sleep-inducing effects. Disturbed by the vagueness of many legal words, some of our profession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>seek greater precision by resorting to the high-sounding but often meaningless vocabulary of the more unimaginative among tlie so-called social scientists. For criticism, see Orwell, Politics and Language. \u201cHere,\u201d he writes, \u201cis a well known verse from Ecclesiastes: T returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is neither to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.\u2019 Here it is in modern English: \u2018Objective consideration of contemporary phenomena compels the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable measure of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account.\u2019 \u201d Rogers, Notes On The Language of Politics, 64 Pol.Se.Q. (1949) 481, quotes the following samples of sociological jargon: \u201cOrientation to particular situations is only partially determined by institutional norms even within the realm where this is intrinsically possible.\u201d \u201cFundamental psychological processes and reaction patterns are involved in types of deviance from an established set of institutional roles and definitions of the situations which lead to structural innovation.\u201d \u201cInstitutions are the patterns which define the essentials of the legitimately expected behavior of persons insofar as they perform structurally important roles in the social system.\u201d Rogers remarks, \u201cA distinguished sociologist, Louis Wirth, has said: \u2018The findings of social science are sometimes regarded as elaborate statements of what everybody knows in language that nobody can understand.\u2019 Mr. Wirth might have added that the reader frequently is unaware that what is being said is something that he already knows.\u201d See also Ruby, Logic (1950) 31; Trilling, The Liberal Imagination (1950) 285.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b503-12\">.

The Court said, 287 U.S. at 370-371, 373-375, 53 S.Ct. at pages 174, 175, 77 L.Ed. 368: \u201cBy the general maritime law, a seaman is without a remedy against the ship or her owners for injuries to his person, suffered in the line of service, with two exceptions only. A remedy is his if the injury has been suffered as a consequence of the unseaworthiness of the ship or a defect in her equipment. The Osceola, 189 U.S. 158, 23 S.Ct. 483, 47 L.Ed. 760; Chelentis v. Luckenbach S. S. Co., 247 U.S. 372, 38 S.Ct. 501, 62 L.Ed. 1171; Pacific S. S. Co. v. Peterson, 278 U.S. 130, 134, 49 S.Ct. 75, 73 L.Ed. 220. A remedy is his also if the injury has been suffered through breach of the duty to provide him with \u2018maintenance and cure.\u2019 The duty to make such provision is imposed by the law itself as one annexed to the employment. The Osceola, supra. Contractual it is in the sense that it has its source in a relation which is contractual in origin, but, given the relation, no agreement is competent to abrogate the incident. If the failure to give maintenance or cure has caused or aggravated an illness, the seaman has his right of action for the injury thus done to him; the recovery in such circumstances including not only necessary expenses, but also compensation for the hurt. The Iroquois, 194 U.S. 240, 24 S.Ct. 640, 48 L.Ed. 955. On the other hand, the remedy for the injury ends with his death in the absence of a statute continuing it or giving it to another for the use of wife or kin. * * * The failure to provide maintenance or cure may be a personal injury or something else according to the consequences. If the seaman has been able to procure his maintenance and cure out of his own or his friends\u2019 money, his remedy is for the outlay, but personal injury there is none. If the default of the vessel and its officers has impaired his bodily or mental health, the damage to mind or body is none the less a personal injury because he may be free at his election to plead it in a different count. Cf. Pacific S. S. Co. v. Peterson, supra, 278 U.S. at pp. 137, 138, 49 S.Ct. 75, 73 L.Ed. 220. Nor is liability escaped by appeal to the distinction between acts of omission on the one hand and those of commission on the other. Moch Co. v.

A division is sometimes drawn between the termination of a relation at a time when it is still executory or future, and its termination when performance has gone forward to such a point that abandonment of duty becomes an active agency of harm. Moch Co. v. Rensselaer Co., supra. The respondent is not helped though its treatment of the seaman be subjected to that test. Ilere performance was begun when the vessel started on her voyage with Santiago aboard and with care and cure cut off from him unless furnished by officers or crew. From that time forth withdrawal was impossible and abandonment a tort. Given a relation involving in its existence a duty of care irrespective of a contract, a tort may result as well from acts of omission as of commission in the fulfilment of the duty thus recognized by law. * * * While the seaman was still alive, his cause of action for personal injury created by the statute may have overlapped his cause of action for breach of the maritime duty of maintenance and cure, just as it may have overlapped his cause of action for injury caused through an unseaworthy ship. Pacific Co. v. Peterson, supra, 278 U.S. at p. 138, 49 S.Ct. 75, 73 L.Ed. 220; Baltimore S. S. Co. v. Phillips, 274 U.S. 316, 321, 324, 47 S.Ct. 600, 71 L.Ed. 1069. In such circumstances it was his privilege, in so far as the causes of action covered the same ground, to sue indifferently on any one of them. The overlapping is no reason for denying to the words of the statute the breadth of meaning and operation that would normally belong to them, at all events when a consequence of the denial is to withhold any remedy whatever from dependent next of kin. A double remedy during life is not without a rational office if the effect of the duplication is to carry the remedy forward for others after death.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b505-15\">.

Those courts said that the death maxim was unjust, not in keeping with the spirit of justice and equity which had always imbued the admiralty jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-17\">The ancient opposition to such actions at common law is more readily explicable than the opposition to the survival of actions for \u201cpersonal\u201d injuries suffered before death; It seems to have been felt that, as the asserted claim did not exist before death, and the wrong could come into being only at the very moment when the dead man ceased to exist, he never possessed any claim which passed to his estate; in other words, the claim was regarded as too ghost-like.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b506-18\">.
