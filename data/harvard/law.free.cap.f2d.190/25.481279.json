During the period from the passage of the Zoning Act to 1946, it appears that the south side of Florida Avenue, Northwest, marked the limit of commercial development on Connecticut Avenue, at least below the Taft Bridge. Appellants\u2019 property (along with the property known as \u201cTemple Heights,\u201d on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>northeast corner of Connecticut and Florida Avenues) was thus the southern extremity of the residential area on Connecticut Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">On July 8, 1946, the Zoning Commission rezoned the area on Connecticut Avenue just opposite appellants\u2019 premises \u2014 a 2% acre triangle in Temple Heights, north of Florida Avenue \u2014 as \u201cFirst Commercial.\u201d Appellants consented to that rezoning, and shortly thereafter filed a petition with the Zoning Commission for similar action with regard to their own property. After an adverse report by the Zoning Advisory Council, a public hearing was held by the Zoning Commission. Later, the Commission inspected appellants\u2019 property. Finally, on July 17, 1947, the Commission denied appellants\u2019 petition. It adopted the report and recommendation of the Zoning Advisory Council, which concluded that the proposed change was \u201cundesirable and unjustified * * * based on several factors, (1) lack of need; (2) substantial character of existing residential improvements; and (3) the possibility that at least four of the properties are eligible for restricted commercial use under the provisions of Paragraph 22, Part 2, Section XXIII of the Zoning Regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Appellants then sued in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking a mandatory injunction which would require appellees to change the classification of the property to \u201cFirst Commercial.\u201d After answer was filed, appellants moved for summary judgment. Ap-pellees made a similar motion, which was granted. From this judgment appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">In considering the propriety of any zoning order it must be remembered that zoning, by definition, requires that a boundary be drawn at some point, even though practical conditions may not change abruptly as the line is crossed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cSome must suffer by the establishment of any territorial boundaries.\u201d L\u2019Hote v. New Orleans, 177 U.S. 587, 597, 20 S.Ct. 788, 792, 44 L.Ed. 899. That is the price to be paid in order that we may have effective zoning. The necessity and desirability of zoning and city planning can no longer be subject to debate. Uncontrolled, haphazard development causes blighted neighborhoods, with their residents deprived of the amenities of decent living and of the environment which breeds good citizenship.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, Congress has given considerable discretion to the Zoning Commission for the establishment of a comprehensive zoning plan, so that the public welfare may dominate the development of the capital city.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">In reviewing the exercise of that discretion, \u201cIt is not the function of the court to substitute its judgment for that of the <em>Commission even </em>for reasons which appear most persuasive. A suit to declare a zoning order void is not an appeal on the merits of the issues presented to the Commission at its hearing.\u201d Wolpe v. Poretsky, 79 U.S.App.D.C. 141, 143-144, 144 F.2d 505, 507-508. \u201cThe action of zoning authorities, as of other administrative officers, is not to be declared unconstitutional unless the court is convinced that it is \u2018clearly arbitrary and unreasonable, having no substantial relation to the * * * general welfare.\u2019 [Citing cases] If the question is \u2018fairly debatable,\u2019 the zoning stands.\u201d Leventhal v. District of Columbia, 69 App.D.C. 229, 230, 100 F.2d 94, 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-12\">Appellants\u2019 primary contention is that when the Zoning Commission on July 8, 1946, extended the commercial classification to include a 2% acre segment of Temple Heights, it established \u201ca new comprehensive plan for Connecticut Avenue,\u201d and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>it acted arbitrarily in excluding appellants from the benefit of this new plan. They argue that the Commission\u2019s action is \u201cinvalid by reason of its arbitrary, discriminatory characteristics * * * bearing no real or substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare * * *\u201d (Brief, p. 7). They refer to this court\u2019s decision in Wolpe v. Poretsky, 81 U.S.App.D.C. 67, 154 F.2d 330, certiorari denied 329 U.S. 724, 67 S.Ct. 69, 91 L.Ed. 627, and contend that the action of the Commission here amounts to \u201cspot zoning\u201d within the condemnation expressed in that case. Reference is also made to the statement of this court in Leventhal v. District of Columbia, supra, with regard to the iri- \u25a0 jury which may be suffered by an owner of a \u201cresidence-zoned island or peninsula in a commercial-zoned sea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">There appears to be no dispute about the governing facts: Appellants are located at a busy intersection, the. other corners of which have now been classified ,for commercial use. The stream of traffic passing appellants\u2019 property is exceedingly heavy; the attendant noise and activity may well render it of marginal desirability for residential purposes. At the same time, this condition is not entirely novel. For a generation, commerce has been separated from appellants\u2019 property merely by the width of Florida Avenue. The only major change is with regard to Temple Heights.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">It is unquestionably true that the partial commercialization of Temple Heights is a factor lending considerable support to appellants\u2019 position, as they\u2019 no doubt realized when they supported that step in 1946. But it is by no means conclusive. There is nothing arbitrary <em>per se </em>\u201cin the mere zoning of one side of a street for business uses and the other side thereof for residential uses, where this is part of a comprehensive and reasonable zoning plan.\u201d 8 McQuillan, Municipal Corporations, p. 159 (3rd ed. 1950). Appellants do not here argue that the District does not have (in general) a comprehensive and reasonable plan, but rather that they have been improperly excluded from certain of its benefits. That, of course, can only be determined by considering the facts of the particular case. For different treatment of two tracts of property in the same locale is only discriminatory if the properties are similarly situated, and no reasonable grounds exist for differentiation. McQuillan, supra, at 87-88, 155-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\"> The materials before us indicate that Temple Heights is situated quite differently from appellants\u2019 property. It is a tract not yet developed, which is to be cut through by an extension of T Street. A new thoroughfare and new parking area will thus be created. The reclassified portion of Temple Heights is a vacant triangle of some <em>2y2 </em>acres bounded by busy streets. A residential development on such a site could not logically be expected: commercial use is more in keeping with future trends. Further, it would appear that the location and characteristics of the 2^2 acre segment are such that its reclassification will expose neighboring residential areas to a minimum of commercial encroachment, a statement which could hardly be made as to a comparable change respecting appellants\u2019 property.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And it has long been recognized that one of the purposes of zoning is to-\u201cstabilize the uses of land\u201d and \u201cfurnish a protection to residential neighborhoods which will cause them to maintain themselves in a decent and sanitary way for a longer time than they otherwise would. * * * By this process obsolescence is greatly retarded.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that the differentiation in classifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>tion of which appellants complain is not discriminatory, so as to render the Commission\u2019s action arbitrary <em>per se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">We turn to the three grounds upon which the Zoning Commission relied in refusing to rezone appellants\u2019 property. All are vigorously attacked by appellants. The first ground, \u201clack of need,\u201d is alleged by them to be merely a sheltering of certain other property owners, i. e., those now possessing commercially-zoned property, against competition on the part of appellants. We see no basis for imputing such a motive to the Commission. Rather we believe that the Commission\u2019s action can be more accurately described as tending to cause existing commercial zones to become fully developed before additions to such zones are made. This appears to us to be a reasonable objective.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cAn unlimited supply of commercial sites invites unnecessary and wasteful expansion of enterprises. * * * The over-supply of store facilities inevitably leads to the blighting of the neighborhood.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Further, to provide for the development of concentrated business districts, distinct from residential districts in which the amenities are preserved, would certainly appear to be a more desirable arrangement than to allow mixed commercial-residential areas not offering much in the way of comfortable living. See Planning for Residential Districts, supra, at p. 33. The Commission makes a showing that many properties in the commercial area neighboring appellants\u2019 premises are not yet used for business purposes. We believe the Commission did not exceed its authority when it took that factor into consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">The Zoning Commission also gave as a reason for its denial of appellants\u2019 petition the fact that residential improvements of substantial character are located on appellants\u2019 parcels. Appellants contend that this is an irrelevant consideration; that it is not a factor clearly related to health, safety, and welfare. But the Zoning Commissioners are entitled to consider the entire situation in a particular locality. They need not close their eyes to such factors as the adequacy and good condition of existing buildings for the uses to which they are presently being put; the need of the community for those uses, the style and attractiveness of existing buildings, and the like. All of this is certainly relevant to the preservation of the values of surrounding property. If buildings of substantial size and real utility to the community are to be torn down or rebuilt, and it is not clear that buildings of equal or greater attractiveness and community usefulness are to replace them, the Zoning Commissioners can hardly be expected to give consent without carefully weighing these factors. In the present case it would appear that the existing residential structures include at least one substantial apartment house; that they are well occupied; and that they form a useful part of the housing accommodations of the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">The third ground relied upon by the Zoning Commission was the eligibility of appellants\u2019 properties for limited commercial use. It appears that while the classification of appellants\u2019 properties is, and has been, \u201cresidential,\u201d certain of them may (upon proper permit) lawfully be used for, and by, educational or philanthropic institutions, trade associations, and professional persons. (Zoning Regulations, District of Columbia, Paragraph 22, Part 2, Sec. XXIII.) Appellants contend that an order predicated on such a basis amounts to a \u201cpiecemeal distribution of zoning privileges,\u201d and argue that it should not defeat their contention that the Commission\u2019s action was invalid in its entirety. In this regard they cite Hazen v. Hawley, 66 App.D.C. 266, 86 F.2d 217. We do not regard that decision as pertinent here. We consider, on the contrary, that the alternative course of action which is open to appellants is a factor for the Commission\u2019s consideration. As a practical matter it may well help to cushion for them the pecuniary loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>which they may have to suffer in connection with the changing character of their neighborhood. McQuillan, supra, 85-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">We do not consider, after careful study of the record and the briefs, that appellants have established that the Commission\u2019s action was arbitrary and unreasonable. We must add, however, that the challenge here is to the validity of the action which the Commission took in 1947. Determinations of that sort should not be regarded as final and not subject to reopening upon a showing of changed conditions. We do not wish to encourage the filing of a flood of vexatious and repetitious petitions to the Commission. But if after a reasonable time has elapsed a new application is made to the Zoning Commission based on a showing of intervening occurrences and changed conditions, we do not think that the Commission would be entitled to regard its previous action, and the action which this court is now taking, as being necessarily conclusive against the appellants.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">For these reasons, the judgment of the District Court will be</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b78-12\">.
