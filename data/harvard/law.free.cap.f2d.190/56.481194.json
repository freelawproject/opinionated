That finding alone is enough, if valid, to justify an order under \u00a7\u00a7 8 (a)(1) and 8 (a) (3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The respondent\u2019s defense seems to rest upon a mistaken understanding of the recent decision of the Supreme Court in Universal Camera Corporation v. National Labor Relations Board, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, that we are to review findings of the Board <em>de novo </em>and reverse them when we should reverse those of a district judge. It is unnecessary here to attempt to appraise what changes that decision may have made in our powers of review, because the finding of the Board is amply, indeed conclusively, supported by the testimony of Kerker, the respondent\u2019s \u201cexecutive vice-president,\u201d that he discharged McMasters because she came to ask for the wage increase, and not because her production was too low and her \u201cscrap\u201d was too high. Kerker\u2019s declarations made in his affidavit verified before the hearing, which he confirmed on the stand, show that, when he discharged McMasters, he did not tell her that he did so because of the poor quality of her work; but only because, as he did tell her, that he did not want \u201cdissatisfied\u201d employees in the respondent\u2019s factory, which under the circumstances was so transparently a euphemism for his resentment at her demand that discussion is unnecessary. True, he did testify that in fact the reason why he discharged her was the record of her production, and we need not say that that record might not have justified \u2014 though it by no means compelled \u2014a finding that she had been less efficient than the average employee; but, even if the evidence had compelled such a finding, it would not have followed that her inefficiency was the reason for her discharge. It is extremely unlikely that, if it had been, Kerker would have suppressed it and told her, instead, that she was unsatisfactory because she was discontented. Upon the evidence before us we should unhesitatingly have held that a judge\u2019s finding to the same effect was not \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d and Universal Camera Corporation v. National <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Labor Relations Board, supra, did not make the findings of the Board as vulnerable as those of a judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">It is not necessary to discuss whether McMasters should be now reinstated after the lapse of two years.
