The unions which were named as defendants in petitioner\u2019s complaint below (together with another union with which they are all affiliated) move to intervene as defendants in this proceeding. Petitioner and respondent have waived objections to the proposed intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-27\">No authority is cited in support of the motion and we have found none in the Act or elsewhere which permits intervention in this court. To the contrary see Aluminum Ore Co. v. N.L.R.B., 7 Cir., 131 F.2d 485, 147 A.L.R. 1; Stewart Die Casting Corp. v. N.L.R.B., 7 Cir., 132 F.2d 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-28\">The motion to intervene is denied without prejudice to the applicants to petition for leave to file briefs as amicus curiae.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
