The bus driver, no longer employed by appellant, and disinterested witnesses testified to the effect that the bus was going at a moderate speed and a cab \u201ccut in from the right in front of the bus\u201d, \u201cpulled out from the curb and stopped right in front\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-20\">Appellee alone testified to the contrary. She said the bus was \u201ctraveling at a high rate of speed\u201d, \u201cbetween 30 and 35 miles an hour\u201d. She said she did not see any reason for the bus to stop. On. cross-examination she testified as follows: \u201cQ. Mrs. Maske, did you see this car pull out in front of the bus that had stopped? A. No, sir, I did not. Q. You don\u2019t deny that that did not [sic] happen? A. No, sir, I don\u2019t. * * * Q. Were you looking in the same direction the bus was traveling? A. Yes, sir. Q. And you say there was no car there ? A. I wouldn\u2019t state positively there wasn\u2019t any car there because I was hurt. Q. Did you look before the accident? A. But I didn\u2019t see a car there. I looked before the accident and I didn\u2019t see any. Q. Did you again look after the accident? A. I was hurt so badly that I didn\u2019t look, no, sir. Q. Were you looking at the time the bus came to the sudden stop, as you have characterized it? A. Yes, sir, I was. Q. And there was no car there then ? A. No, sir.\u201d It was proved beyond reasonable doubt, although appellee denied, that she had told her doctor the \u201cbus and an auto almost had a collision\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-21\">Though it may be more likely that one interested witness will overlook or forget something than that several disinterested witnesses will all imagine something, the jury in a particular case may not be unreasonable in believing the one and disbelieving the others. But in view of appellee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>relative uncertainty on the witness stand, and particularly in view of her previous contradictory statement to her doctor, we must conclude the verdict lacks substantial support. In the absence of a statute entitling injured passengers to compensation in such cases as this, we must hold that appellant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict should have been granted. We do not consider other alleged errors including the fact that appellee, through no fault of counsel and perhaps inadvertently, volunteered a vague reference to insurance. Cf. Radin-sky v. Ellis, 83 U.S.App.D.C. 172, 167 F.2d 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
