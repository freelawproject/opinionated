The Board hearing grew out of a charge by its General Counsel that appellant, while appearing as counsel in a proceeding before a trial examiner of the Board, committed an unprovoked physical assault of an aggravated character upon a Board attorney. In seeking judicial intervention to forestall the hearing, appellant alleges that the Board is not authorized, either expressly or impliedly, to conduct disciplinary proceedings against him, and that even if it did possess some such inherent power, it has not exercised that power in the manner required by \u00a7 3(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>he rests his claim for relief not only upon general principles of equity hut also upon the ground that under \u00a7 10(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appellees\u2019 repeated refusals to discontinue the disciplinary proceeding constitute illegal \u201cfinal agency action\u201d which will result in irreparable damage for which he has no other adequate remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">We agree with the court below that this suit must fail. Whether the Board inherently possesses the requisite authority to discipline those who practice before it or possesses such authority as a necessary incident to the powers conferred upon it by its governing statute is a question which should be answered by the Board in the first instance. If given such an opportunity, it may resolve this as well as the other procedural issues in appellant\u2019s favor. And even if they should be decided against him, the Board may conclude on the merits to take no disciplinary action. In either event, judicial relief may ultimately prove unnecessary. We do not think that, under the circumstances of this case, the nature of the injury alleged by appellant warrants relaxation of the rule that administrative remedies must be exhausted before judicial relief may be sought.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b657-14\">. \u00a7 3 of the Act, 5 U.S.O.A. \u00a7 1002, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-15\">\u201cExcept to the extent that there is involved (1) any function of the United States requiring secrecy in the public interest or (2 )any matter relating solely to the internal management of an agency\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-16\">\u201c(a) Every agency shall separately state and currently publish in the Federal Register (1) descriptions of its central and field organization including delegations by the agency of final authority and the established places at which, and methods whereby, the public may secure information or make submittals or requests; (2) statements of the general course and method by which its functions are channeled and determined, including the nature and requirements of all formal or informal procedures available as well as forms and instructions as to the scope <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>and contents of all papers, reports, or examinations; and (3) substantive rules adopted as authorized by law and statements of general policy or interpretations formulated and adopted by the agency for the guidance of the public, but not rules addressed to and served upon named persons in accordance with law.
