He pleaded not guilty and after trial by jury was convicted on both counts. It is from the judgment of conviction that he appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-27\">On the night of March 23-24, 1950, the office of the Standard Transfer &amp; Storage Company, in Washington, D. C., was broken into and some $2,600 stolen in money and travellers\u2019 checks. The next day the police received information from someone identified only as \u201cHarvey\u201d that he had recently overheard his neighbor, Ernest White, discussing various housebreaking jobs with several people, including appellant Judd. From this they concluded that the Standard Transfer larceny might be involved. Accordingly, police officers proceeded to the house where Ernest White lived and secreted themselves in a room adjoining White\u2019s. They heard White enter with another unidentified person and dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>cuss leaving town for Philadelphia. After the person with White, still unidentified, had left, the police entered White\u2019s room, placed him under arrest, and commenced a search, locating some of the stolen checks. Appellant Judd was not in the room at that time and there was no evidence that he \u2022 had been present earlier in the evening, or that he was the person who had come in with White. Shortly after \u00b1he arrest of White, Judd entered the apartment and was immediately arrested. He denied any knowledge of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">At the trial the sole affirmative evidence linking Judd with the crime was the testimony of a laboratory technician, that the print of a shoe taken from Judd\u2019s apartment matched a shoeprint found on a carton inside the Standard Transfer &amp; Storage Company building, under or near a window which apparently had been entered for purposes of the theft. The shoe and a photographic copy of the impression on the box carton were introduced in evidence. It is Judd\u2019s contention that the shoe was captured by an unconstitutional search and seizure and should not have been admitted in evidence. If he is correct in that contention, the conviction, of course, cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">From the testimony on the motion to suppress, the following picture may be drawn: The appellant was arrested without a warrant at 11 o\u2019clock at night, when he entered the premises of White. He was taken to jail and \u201cbooked on an open charge.\u201d He was not then formally committed. While held in custody for purposes of investigation, he was interrogated \u25a0for several hours by police officers concerning general criminal activity, possible possession of burglar\u2019s tools at his home, and whether he had committed the Standard Transfer burglary. He was also asked whether he had certain items of clothing at home, including shoes. At approximately 2:00 A.M., in the custody of four police officers, and while handcuffed, he was taken to his own home, which was in a different part of town. The apartment was then searched and the shoes found. Appellant testified that all this was against his will and without any consent. A police officer testified that while he and another officer were interrogating Judd at the jail concerning burglar\u2019s tools and his clothing and shoes, they asked him whether \u201che minded us going over to his room and taking a look, and he said no. * * * We asked him if he would go over and he said yes. * * * He didn\u2019t give us actual consent to search it. He gave us consent to go. in there. I told him I was looking for a pair of shoes and he said it was all right to go over there * * The other officer testified: \u201cWe questioned him as to whether he had any tools that could be used in ripping safes. * * * So, he said we would go out to his place and see, if we believed he had any of these things there. * * * I told him where we were going, and he was well aware of the fact that we were going to his home. He said he had nothing to conceal or hide out there, and it was perfectly all right for us to go out there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">This is the basis of the Government\u2019s case. The Government, admitting that no warrant had been obtained, contends that the appellant voluntarily consented to the search and seizure, thus making the issuance of a warrant unnecessary. There is no claim that consent was given when the officers reached the apartment, reliance being placed solely on the statements made by Judd while in jail. The Government argues that the validity of the arrest, never having been formally challenged, is not before us and, in any event, is irrelevant to the issue of consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">Searches and seizures made without a proper warrant are generally to be regarded as unreasonable and violative of the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> True, the obtaining of the warrant may on occasion be waived by the individual; he may give his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>\u2022consent to the search and seizure. But such a waiver or consent must be proved by clear and positive testimony, and it must be established that there was no duress or coercion, actual or implied. Amos v. United States, 255 U.S. 313, 41 S.Ct. 266, 65 L.Ed. 654; United States v. Kelih, D.C.S.D.Ill.1921, <em>272 </em>F. 484. The Government must show a consent that is \u201cunequivocal and specific\u201d (Karwicki v. United States, 4 Cir., 55 F.2d 225, 226), \u201cfreely and intelligently given.\u201d Kovach v. United States, 6 Cir., 53 F.2d 639; Thus \u201cinvitations\u201d to enter one\u2019s house, extended to armed officers of the law who demand entrance, are usually to be considered as invitations secured by force. United States v. Marquette, D.C.N.D.Cal.1920, 271 F. 120. A like view has been taken where an officer displays his badge and declares that he has come to make a search (United States v. Slusser, D.C.S.D.Ohio 1921, 270 F. 818), even where the householder replies \u201cAll right.\u201d United States v. Marra, D.C.W.D.N.Y.1930, 40 F.2d 271. A finding of consent in such circumstances has been held to be \u201cunfounded in reason\u201d. Herter v. United States, 9 Cir., 27 F.2d 521. Intimidation and duress are almost necessarily implicit in such situations; if the Government alleges their absence, it has the burden of convincing the court that they are in fact absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">This burden on the Government is particularly heavy in cases where the individual is under arrest. Non-resistance to the orders or suggestions of the police is not infrequent in such a situation; true consent, free of fear or pressure, is not so readily to be found. United States v. Novero, D.C., 58 F.Supp. 275; United States v. McCunn, D.C.S.D.N.Y.1930, 40 F.2d 295. In fact, the circumstances of the defendant\u2019s plight may be such as to make any claim of actual consent \u201cnot in accordance with human experience\u201d, and explainable, only on the basis of \u201cphysical or moral compulsion\u201d. Ray v. United States, 5 Cir., 84 F.2d 654, 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-13\">In the case at bar, do the circumstances justify the finding of consent? As we have noted, the appellant was arrested late at night without a warrant, booked on an open charge for \u201cinvestigation,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> questioned for several hours by various police officers, then taken to his home some distance away, while handcuffed, and in custody of four officers. His statements while in jail, which are relied on as consent, may be summarized as: I have nothing to hide, you can go there and see for yourself. Conceivably, that is the calm statement of an innocent man; conceivably, again, it is but the false bravado of the small-time criminal. But, however it be characterized, it hardly establishes willing agreement that the officers search the household without first procuring a warrant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Comparable statements have been held insufficient where the victim of the search was safely in his home,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> his place of business,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or in his automobile.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Surely they acquire no more force when procured under the circumstances here pres <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>ent.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Further, the testimony of one officer was that Judd \u201cdidn\u2019t give us actual consent to search it. He gave us consent to go in there.\u201d Before a court holds that a defendant has waived his protection under the Fourth Amendment, \u201cthere must be convincing evidence to that effect.\u201d Nueslein v. District of Columbia, 73 App. D.C. 85, 89, 115 F.2d 690, 694. Here, the officers themselves do not appear completely convinced.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">The relative credibility of the witnesses is not the central issue in this case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The real issue is whether the evidence offered by the Government, taken at full value, meets the required standard. We hold that it does not; that there has not been a sufficient showing of true consent, free of duress and coercion. Standards of this sort must be maintained and enforced by the trial and appellate courts.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If they are not, the guarantees of the Bill of Rights can quickly disappear through tacit nullification. We must hold that there was no consent and that the search and seizure were not permissible. Accordingly, the evidence was inadmissible and the motion to suppress should have been granted. The conviction cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">Since we reverse, we need not comment on appellant\u2019s other allegation of error, namely, that there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction and that secondary evidence was improperly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-12\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-13\">CLARK, Circuit Judge, dissents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b702-6\">. \u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d U.S.Oonst.

While not controlling in this decision, we may note that Judd was not charged with housebreaking or any other offense until several hours after his arrest (and after the search); nor does it appear with certainty from the record before us that he was promptly taken before a committing magistrate, as required by Rule 5 (a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
