The Court held: \u201cIt was shown that in granting quantity discounts the <em>defendant did not adhere to the various brackets of its quantity discount schedule. To the contrary, </em>it began to divide and classify all of its customers into three groups designated as \u2018A\u2019, \u2018B\u2019 and \u2018C\u2019. * * *\u201d [187 F.2d 919, 921.] (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Even though the record evidence does sustain the contention that defendant adhered in some sort to its quantity discount schedule, we adhere to our former holding that such schedule was nevertheless discriminatory for the reason that the discounts granted were based almost entirely on the annual volume of purchases, and were legally unjustified as having practically no relation to the actual cost of selling customers, or reasonable classes of customers. In this connection, our former 'opinion speaks exactly and succinctly in this wise: \u201cThus, for all practical purposes, the above grouping of defendant\u2019s customers was based almost entirely on the annual volume of their respective purchases, and was in no wise governed by the actual cost of selling customers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">.Appellant further complains of the statement in the opinion to the effect that plaintiff\u2019s competitors, Engelman Gardens of Texas and Morgan Packing Company of Indiana, \u201chad received from the defendant <em>special discounts </em>on the price of a particular type Iscan <em>which had been denied to plaintiff.\" </em>(Italics ours.) In the above quoted language, the court had reference to that testimony concerning the alleged \u201csecret low price\u201d on the 3.12 Iscan which was offered to plaintiff\u2019s competitor, En-gelman Gardens, in the Fall of 1939, and later made available to Morgan Packing Company in June, 1940. We adhere to our former holding that this lower price, <em>or its </em>equivalent, was actually and in effect \u201cdenied to plaintiff\u201d for the reason that defendant failed, to adhere to its established freight pricing policy with respect to the 3.12 Iscan shipments desired by plaintiff by refusing to quote a price on such shipments which would include the freight to plaintiff\u2019s Tampa plant, and that, under the circumstances such action was unlawful and discriminatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Appellant fastens upon the statement in our opinion that \u201cthe unlawful discrimina-tions of the defendant * * * had the effect of restricting its (plaintiff\u2019s) can quota <em>[for the duration of the war]\u201d </em>as a basis for the contention that this Court arbitrarily awarded damages for that entire period. Neither the trial court nor this Court has ever condoned such an award; and such contention is wholly without substance or merit. No damages were included in the award for the period subsequent to December 9th, 1942, as it is without dispute that Order M-81 did not adversely affect plaintiff\u2019s sales after that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">That portion of the opinion wherein it is held that none \u201cof defendant\u2019s customers except plaintiff were ever required to pay freight on a shipment of the 3.12 Iscan\u201d is explained by insertion of the phrase \u201cunusual and discriminatory\u201d before the word \u201cfreight\u201d, making the challenged quotation read: \u201cIt was not shown that any of defendant\u2019s customers except plaintiff were ever required to pay <em>[unusual and discriminatory] </em>freight on a shipment of the 3.12 Iscan.\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Upon further consideration of the motion for the assessment of additional attorneys\u2019 fees we conclude that counsel for appellee are entitled to an additional allowance in the amount of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) for their services upon this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">With the opinion thus modified, the petition for rehearing is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">Denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
