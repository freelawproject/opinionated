The subject-matter of the appeal is not concerned with the facts of the plaintiff\u2019s employment or the evidence on which his claim is based. The determining point is a question of law and has to do with the application of Rule 41(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-25\">This Rule provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b355-26\">\u201cRule 41. Dismissal of Actions</p>\n<p id=\"b355-27\">\u201c(a) Voluntary Dismissal: Effect Thereof</p>\n<p id=\"b355-28\">\u201c(1) <em>By Plaintiff; by Stipulation. </em>* * an action may be dismissed by the plaintiff without order of court (i) by filing a notice of dismissal at any time before service by the adverse party of an answer or of a motion for summary judgment, whichever first occurs, or (ii) by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared in the action. Unless otherwise stated in the notice of dismissal or stipulation, the dismissal is without prejudice, * *</p>\n<p id=\"b355-29\">\u201c(2) <em>By Order of Court. </em>Except as provided in paragraph (1) of this subdivision of this rule, an action shall not be dismissed at the plaintiff\u2019s instance save upon order of the court and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper. * * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Unless otherwise specified in the order, a dismissal under this paragraph is without prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">What happened in Ockert\u2019s case was this. The cause was called for trial. A medical witness, thought by Ockert\u2019s counsel to be necessary to the presentation of his claim, had written a note stating that he could not be present that day. A continuance was requested by Ockert\u2019s counsel. This was denied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Then counsel asked for a dismissal without prejudice. This was objected to by the defense and the court denied the motion and directed that the trial proceed. The plaintiff claims that he was entitled to a voluntary dismissal without prejudice as a matter of right. If that is correct the action of the trial judge was obviously error.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">There are some situations in which a plaintiff is entitled to dismiss of his own motion without any limitations by the trial judge. They are set out in Rule 41(a) (1), quoted above. The stated instances show clearly a thought-out purpose behind such provisions. They are to give a man a right to take his case out of court when no. one else will be prejudiced by his doing so. The situation is quite different when answers have been filed, especially if a counterclaim is included. It is likewise an increasingly burdensome matter to one\u2019s opponent if a case has been prepared, trial date set and the party and his witnesses on hand and ready for trial. While it is quite true that the practice in many states has permitted a voluntary non-suit as of right at advanced stages in the litigation, sometimes even after submission of a case to a jury, we think the object of the federal rules was to get rid of just this situation and put control of the matter into the hands of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-18\">The view that, except in the instances provided for, the grant or denial of voluntary dismissal without prejudice is a matter of judicial discretion has been accepted by the great majority of the District Courts and the Courts of Appeals <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in this country. It is supported by the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The one notable exception is a recent opinion by our brethren in the Seventh -Circuit in which it was said that the \u201cterms and conditions\u201d are the only matter to which the trial court\u2019s discretion is to be applied.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The view of this Circuit has already been expressed in a previous decision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We stated that the matter was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>one for the discretion of the trial judge. We are content to follow our previously expressed view, which is supported, as already indicated, by the great weight of authority. We follow it not only because it is the majority view 'but because we think it is right.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">Once it is established that the matter of voluntary dismissal is controlled by the discretion of the trial judge there is little question to be made that the exercise of his discretion must stand in this instance. This case, at the date reached for trial, had been pending for almost two years. It was placed on the trial list by counsel for the plaintiff himself. He selected the day. Not only was the defendant\u2019s lawyer in court, but he had found his witnesses in various parts of the country<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and brought them to court. He had the company\u2019s physician there also. Plaintiff appeared with a pencilled message from the physician who had examined him the night before explaining that he could not be in court on the day set for trial. But the physician was not subpoenaed. This set of facts is certainly sufficient to uphold the refusal of the trial judge to permit the plaintiff to hack out at this point and begin all over again.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">This matter of the discretion regarding voluntary dismissal is the only important point in the case. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence was of such nature that a judgment in his favor would have been very hard either to secure or to sustain.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-6\">. Appellant concedes that the denial of a continuance may be reversed only upon showing of an abuse of discretion. See Thompson v. Selden, 1857, Withers &amp; Co., 20 How. 194, 198, 15 L.Ed. 1001; Preferred Accident Ins. Co. v. Patterson, 3 Cir., 1914, 213 F. 595, 598; United States v. Pacific Fruit &amp; Produce Co., 9 Cir., 1943, 138 F.2d 367. We find no abuse of such discretion here.
