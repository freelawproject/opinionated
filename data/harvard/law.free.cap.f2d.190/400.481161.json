As such, they were entitled to enter for permanent residence. Cheung Sum Shee v. Nagle, 268 U.S. 336, 45 S.Ct. 539, 69 L.Ed. 985; Haff v. Yung Poy, 9 Cir., 68 F.2d 203. Such an entry complies with Section 329(b) of the Nationality Act of 1940, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 729(b), and qualifies, <em>pro tanto, </em>the appellees for naturalization. United States v. Yung Poy, 9 Cir., 177 F.2d 144; Jow Gin v. U. S., 7 Cir., 175 F.2d 299; United States v. Lee Cheu Sing, 10 Cir., 189 F.2d 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">In the certificate of arrival issued to each appellee by the Immigration and Naturalization Service on its printed form, the printed statement that the entry was for permanent residence was stricken out, and in its stead was inserted a notation that the entry was made under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act of 1924, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 203(6), as the child of a treaty merchant. Since the facts are undisputed, the appel-lees are entitled to have their certificates of arrival amended to show entries for permanent residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-14\">Although the evidence that Lee Woon is the husband of an American citizen is rather meagre, it is sufficient to prevent its recognition from being clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-15\">The order of the District Court is modified to amend the several certificates of arrival in accordance with this opinion, and, as so modified, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b453-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
