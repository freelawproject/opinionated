James Carstairs called upon me some time in the summer of 1834, and inquired of me if I would be willing to join in the expense pf laying a pipe up the alley. The pipe was laid by agreement accordingly as had been agreed upon by the parties, for which I paid my proportion of the expense ; I.recollect Robert Looney rendering this bill to me; it is dated August 4, 1834. I paid my proportion of it; I paid one-fourth at least; I paid all that was apportioned to me; no opposition was made during the time I lived there, nearly fourteen years, and I enjoyed the uninterrupted use of the alley until within a few months before I left it, when it was boarded up by somebody, and I was subjected to considerable inconvenience as respects water. There was a leaden pipe running up the alley at the time Miss Care purchased: it went up the alley across Swaim\u2019s lots; all the houses on Chesnut street were supplied from .that pipe at that time; the iron pipe was laid as far as the property of Smith, Carstairs, and Swaim; I attached a leaden pipe to the iron. pipe and carried it up to my house; I believe that Miss Care is now supplied from Chesnut street.

Dr. Swaim, Mr. Carstairs, and Mr. Smith, each paid me his proportion of my bill for -the pipe; this is my bill dated Aug. 4, 1834; it was paid; Dr. Shoemaker paid me seventeen dollars and fourteen cents; I think Mr. Carstairs paid me, and very pleasantly too; each paid a proportion of what passed him; all paid in proportion as it passed Mr. Carstairs\u2019s ground; the iron pipe according to this bill, extends from the centre of Eighth street, ninety-five and a half west, and there is a piece of strong lead pipe which is used between the public and private iron pipes, which, perhaps, would make it go further a foot or two ; there is pipe beyond the ninety-five feet west communicating with the houses on Chesnut street, or some of them; it supplies Dr. Swaim\u2019s two houses, and Dr. Shoemaker; I know nothing of the others on Chesnut street; two others on Eighth street are supplied by this pipe, Mr. Carstiars and Mr. Sims.

From a user of the alley for twenty years by the defendants, you may presume a grant of a right of way, but not not from any less period. There is no evidence of any such user. Another question has been raised, viz. whether the evidence in the cause, of the plaintiff\u2019s having called upon the other parties to contribute towards the expense of repairing the water pipes, is sufficient to estop him from asserting his right to the alley exclusively of the defendants; my answer is that the plaintiff is not estopped.

Nor is there any thing in the agreement with Carr stairs to make the alley a mere appurtenance to the ground on both sides. The words are not, as they usually are, to E. S. Burd, his heirs and assigns, \u201c owners and occupiers\u201d of the adjoining ground, but to him, \u201chis heirs and assigns,\u201d generally. The case is distinguishable from <em>Kirkham </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>(1 <em>Wharton\u2019s </em>Rep. 335.) The right of .soil in the 2 feet 6 inches is certainly not in the plaintiffs below, yet they have attempted to deprive the defendants of the right of laying pipes under the surface. Mr. Burd might have granted the right of way in gross, if he pleased. <em>Yelverton, </em>159. Tomlin,, 794. Carstairs made the agreement with full notice of the right reserved by Mr. Burd to grant a participation of the alley to any other person.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-6\">2. The-defendants claimed a right by virtue of the presumption arising from lapse of time in analogy with the statute of limitations. From 1817 to 1835, more than seventeen years, there was clear evidence of undisturbed use: and there was evidence from which the jury might have been allowed to presume an user as far back as 1815, nearly twenty years before the obstruction of the way by the plaintiffs. In a question of presumption arising from a lapse of time, less 'than twenty-one years, evidence of acts of ownership and of admission of right ought to be thrown into the scale; and the jury ought to have been told that they were entitled to weight. <em>Eldridge </em>v. <em>Knott, (Cowper, </em>414.) <em>Bealy </em>v. <em>Shew, </em>(6 <em>East, </em>208.) <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>(11 <em>East, </em>56.) 3 <em>Kent\u2019s Comm. </em>450. <em>Ricard </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>(7 <em>Wheaton, </em>109.) <em>Morris Aqueduct Case, </em>(4 <em>W.

There was clearly no right under the deeds. The right must be appurtenant, and could not exist in gross. The reservation to Mr. Burd and those to whom he might grant the right, plainly refers to the grant to Sims. The language in the deed to Sims is restrained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>by the deed to Carstairs. It may be conceded that the words give a power to license; but they are modified by the contract with Carstairs.

There can be no estoppel, either equitable or otherwise, from the circumstances of the case in evidence. The small contributions for repairing the pavement, indicate perhaps a temporary license, but nothing more. The iron pipes may be considered permanent, but they were not in question.

This appears plainly from the agreement of the parties and the pleadings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-12\">The case of <em>Kirkham </em>v. <em>Sharpe </em>is distinguishable from this by the circumstance, among others, of the stable-wall which is mentioned by the Chief Justice in his opinion as serving as a terminus or limit to the alley. Besides, there are no words here giving the \u201c full and free\u201d privilege of the alley, which were relied on in that case. The power was not exhausted by the grant of Burd to Murray. The judge ought to have left it to the jury upon the circumstances to presume a grant. <em>Folk </em>v. <em>Beidleman, </em>(6 <em>Watts, </em>339.) The principle of the rule of equitable estoppel is applied to many cases in the books; such as standing by and seeing property sold without notice; allowing a man to build on the land of the party, or encouraging him to make repairs. This rule is enforced as between the original parties ; but this is a stronger case for the application of it, because it appears that the present owners of the property bought under a full belief that that there was a right of way and of a water-course; and if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>alley is now closed against them they will have no outlet. As to the <em>amount </em>of the contribution for expenses, that is never weighed. But here there was evidence of several payments.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The opinion of the court was delivered by -</p>\n<author id=\"b207-7\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Auy\">Two principal subjects of direction are comprised in the assignment of errors,\u2014Mr. Burd\u2019s reservation of a right in the alley for himself and his grantees, subsequently confirmed by the plaintiff,\u2014and the defendants\u2019 adverse enjoyment of.the alley, in connexion with their contribution to the expense of keeping it in order, on a common understanding that all were liable for their proportion of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">By the conveyance in which the reservation is contained, Mr. Burd granted to Mr. Sims a lot butting on an alley, of which Mr. Burd had then the exclusive use, \u201c together with the free use and privilege of the said alley as a passage in common with the said E. S. Burd and his heirs, and those to whom he may likewise grant the same;\u201d and the first question is whether his power to grant was appurtenant or in gross. The alley was contiguous, not only to the ground granted, but also to Mr. Burd\u2019s other ground; and did the matter stop here, the spirit of the decision in <em>Kirkham </em>v. <em>Sharp </em>would go far to restrain it to the former. Such a reservation, however, \u201e was unnecessary; for it was settled in <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Bioren, </em>(1 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>227,) that each grantee of a parcel of ground to which such an easement is appurtenant, is entitled to the benefit of it; and Mr. Burd\u2019s grantees would consequently have been entitled without it. The parties, however, seem to have been ignorant of that; and the object of the reserved power, unexplained by the subsequent agree- \u2022 ment with the plaintiff, might seem to be no more than expressly to append the use of the alley to the other ground, and to put Mr. Burd\u2019s right to pass it as an appurtenance, beyond the reach of cavil: for it would be unreasonable to intend that the parties had in view a power to sell the privilege, and thus let in all the neighbouring proprietors. Mr. Sims would -probably have refused to purchase on terms that would have allowed Mr. Burd to surcharge. Even had such a power been' reserved, it is doubtful whether it could have been exercised by Mr. Burd\u2019s grantee. It is certain that a privilege merely personal, cannot be granted over; and thus if a man lend his horse, the borrower cannot lend him to another: nor can a right of way for life, or common of estovers be granted. 2 <em>Rol. </em>46. But, however that may be, the easement passed from Burd to Murray as appurtenant to the residue of Burd\u2019s ground; and it could pass in no other way, for the conveyance contained no power in gross to grant it without stint. On that state of the case, then, Murray could not append it to ground to which it was not appendant before; and how can his, or Mr Burd\u2019s, power be enlarged by the agreement with the plaintiff?</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>If there were a doubt about the object of the reservation as it appears in the conveyance to Sims, this agreement would solve it. Mr. Burd had laid off only a narrow strip of the original lot for the alley; and that it was not enough for the purpose, was well understood by the parties at the <em>time </em>of the conveyance. A few months after-wards, the plaintiff agreed to throw in an additional foot on the other side, in consideration of being allowed to use the alley in common with the other two. That this agreement was contemplated by the original parties at the time of the conveyance, which is expressly mentioned in it, and that the end of the reservation was to provide for it so as to introduce the plaintiff as a third party by the description of a grantee, is undisputable; and the agreement, then, was an entire execution of the power.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">. But though no right to the easement passed to the defendants by the conveyance of Burd, or of Murray his grantee, it remains to be seen whether there was not presumptive evidence of some other1 grant which might have been left to the jury; and whether the facts said to be proved by it, did not constitute an equitable estoppel in favour of an innocent purchaser, who may have parted with his money on the faith of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">In the conveyance to Murray, the easement is described as an alley and \u201c water-course over and along the same.\u201d It is as obvious to the spectator that these alleys are used as much for drainage as for passage, as it is obvious to the lawyer, that the word watercourse was here used in a sense very different from its technical one. \u25a0 A water-course, it is said in 3 <em>Bulstr. </em>340, begins not by prescription, nor yet by assent, but <em>ex jure natures ; </em>and that being a natural course, it may not be diverted. And we know that our interest in it will be protected, even when it sinks below the surface. But a water-course over and along an alley is, by the words of its description, a superficial, as well as an artificial one,; and the ownership of it consequently gives no right to break up the soil for the purpose of laying pipes, which, being - a subject of separate grant, might be acquired by adverse use, without, at the same time, acquiring a right of way. Now should it be found that the evidence had regard to expenditure for laying pipes, or for replacing the pavement; having laid them, it would go to prove a contribution to a' general charge of a very different nature from that which would imply the existence of a joint right to the alley as a passage and a drain. On the other hand, if the expenditure was for the ordinary repairs of the alley, the payment of Mr. Biddle\u2019s proportion of it, could be looked upon in no other light than that of contribution to a common burden founded in a common obligation and con\u2019elative <em>right in the </em>thing which was the subject of it; and as such a right could exist only on the basis of a grant, the admission of obligation implied from the act of contribution, would be an admission of a grant, the evidence of which would be proper for the jury, not as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>conclusive or even necessarily <em>prima facie, </em>but as operating just so far as it should produce conviction ,&lt;of the fact. As a ground of equitable estoppel, however, it might be conclusive, if, to the appearance of adverse enjoyment occasioned by the plaintiff\u2019s supineness, were added positive acts of acquiescence, on his part, which may have encouraged an innocent purchaser to pay his money on the faith of them. This estoppel has its root in a plain \u2022 and familiar principle of equity, vvhich casts a loss from a voluntary, though innocent act, on the author of it. Now, though the evidence did not show very clearly the specific object to which Mr. Biddle\u2019s contribution had been applied, there was still something to be left to the jury. The testimony of Doctor Shoemaker and Looney undoubtedly had regard to expenditure for laying pipe; but Mr. Biddle testified that he paid his contribution for repairs done to the alley; and in that, he is corroborated by Mr. Sims\u2019s receipt for so much paid for Mr. Biddle\u2019s own, and Mr. Craig\u2019s, proportion of the'expense incurred for paving it. Now this paving could not have been a part of the expense incidental to the laying of the pipe spoken of by the other witnesses; for that was done in 1834, and Mr. Biddle\u2019s payment was in 1821. It is certaintly true, that there was a pipe there before, \u25a0 but how long, is not stated. Doctor Shoemaker speaks of its existence at the time of Miss Care\u2019s purchase ; blit that was so late even as 1833. There was nothing therefore to connect Mr. Biddle\u2019s payment with the expense of any pipe whatever; and the attention of the jury was withdrawn from its importance by having been exclusively directed to the evidence of adverse possession for a period equal to that of the statute of limitations. Though the direction was accurate as regards the abstract principle laid down, it tended directly to mislead by inducing the jury to understand, that under the'circumstances of the case, the duration of the naked possession was the only criterion.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
