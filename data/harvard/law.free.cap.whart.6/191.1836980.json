Exceptions were filed by the committee to this account; and on the 23d of August, 1839, the Court of Common Pleas made a decree amending the account ' reported by the auditors, and directing the prothonotary to state an account accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-14\">From this decree an appeal was taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b191-15\">Mr. <em>Ihrie, </em>for the committee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AgF\">now moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that this court had no jurisdiction.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b191-16\">Mr. <em>Maxwell </em>and Mr. <em>Porter, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b191-17\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqs\">An appeal not expressly or necessarily given, can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>not be entei\u2019tained; and certainly none is expressly given in this instance, for the first section of the act of the 16th of May, 1836, has regard to removals only by common law process for correction of errors and irregularities, and not to removals by an appeal, which lays open the cause to revision on the merits, and which has been borrowed from -the civil law. It is argued, however, that as the Common Pleas is put upon a footing in regard to a lunatic\u2019s committee, with the Orphans\u2019 Court in regard to a guardian, there is consequently the same appeal from its judgment or decree in regard to their accounts. But the 25th paragraph of the 23d section of the act of the 13th of April, 1836, from which the inference is attempted,\u2018 has regard expressly <em>to no more than the \u201c control, </em>removal, dismissal, and discharge\u201d of such committees, and not to the settlement of their accounts. It is clear, therefore, that the decree of the Common Pleas is conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Appeal quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
