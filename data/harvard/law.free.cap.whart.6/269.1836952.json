If this is allowed, the office of coroner is abolished, and the fee, (though none is allowed to the justices by the fee bill,) would be claimed by \u25a0them. n The office of the coroner is a high prerogative. In England he is still elected.

In England it would seem they have several coroners in a county. 6 <em>Pet. Ah. </em>407; no precise number is required\u2014in some counties six coroners; in some 4; in others 2. The power of the judges of the King\u2019s Bench is not confined to the court. They may act individually; if so, it is <em>ex officio, </em>as conservators of the peace. Thus courts and judges have the same power; and so have the judges of the oyer and terminer, and justices of the peace. A justice of the peace in Pennsylvania is as much a conservator of the peace as the chief justice. No precise case fixes their power; it flows from their duty as conservators of the peace. In that capacity it is important that they should act in cases of murder. If the coroner is sick or absent, &amp;c., is the duty not to' be performed 1 and ought not the same fees to be paid. It would be difficult in our large counties, where there is but one coroner, to get along without this power in the justices : and if so, it is by our common law well exercised by a justice, whose duties are of the same general class as those of the chief justice or the judges of the Supreme Court. Such inquisitions are held every day. In 2 <em>Hale\u2019s P. C. </em>58, it is said that a coroner cannot make a deputy; but if he do not inquire, the justices of the peace in oyer and terminer may; and so may the justices of the King\u2019s Bench, though it is traversable. 6 <em>Barn.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGq\">The prevalent notion that a justice of the peace has concurrent power to inquire into the circumstances of a sudden or violent death, upon view of the body, has doubtless arisen from inadvertence to the source of the coroner\u2019s authority. In England, and perhaps in Pennsylvania, justices of the peace have authority, in certain cases, to take inquisitions by the examination of witnesses; but the 4 Ed. 1, St. 2, which is in force with us, commands the coroner alone to go to the place where any one is slain or has suddenly died; and, by warrant to the bailiffs or constables, to summon a jury from the neighbouring <em>towns to </em>inquire into the manner of the killing, or the circumstances of the death. He is not expressly directed to take the inquest on view of the body, but a direction to that effect is to be inferred from the duty imposed on him of repairing to the spot; and it has always been held that an inquisition taken otherwise is void, particularly in the case of the <em>Welchmen, (Poph. 109.) But it is </em>because this species of inquisition, and no other, is entrusted to the coroner, and to him exclusively, that the common law inquisition, by the examination of witnesses before commissioners or justices, either of oyer and terminer or of the peace, must still be taken where the body cannot be found; as is said in <em>The King </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>(2 <em>Lev. </em>141;) and the <em>King </em>v. <em>Aldenham, (Id. </em>152.) In <em>Foxley's case, </em>(5 <em>Rep. </em>111,) it is said to have been resolved in <em>Laughton\u2019s case, </em>by Poph <em>am, C. J., </em>and the whole court, that if the body be cast into the sea, or buried so secretly that the coroner cannot have the view, the justices of the peace, justices of oyer and terminer, or others who have authority to inquire of felonies, may take a presentment of it. From the words of the statute it results also that the coroner\u2019s jurisdiction is a special one, and that no one else can take an inquisition in the manner prescribed. Accordingly, it was said in the <em>King and Queen </em>v. <em>Bunney, </em>(2 <em>Salk. </em>190,) that if his inquisition be quashed, he must take a new one <em>super visum corporis </em>as he did before ; but that if a <em>melius inquirendum </em>be granted on a <em>male se gessit, </em>the new inquiry must be before sheriffs or commissioners, not <em>super visum corporis, </em>but upon affidavits ; for that none but the coroner can inquire <em>super visum corporis, </em>and he is no longer to be trusted. To the same effect is <em>Stanlack\u2019s case, </em>(1 <em>Vent. </em>182,) in which it is said the King\u2019s Bench may inquire, or make commissioners to inquire ; but not <em>super visum corpor is. </em>In the case of the <em>Wardens and Commonalty of Saddlers, </em>(4 <em>Rep. </em>57,) it was indeed said by Lord Coke to have been resolved by Chief Justice Finieux, in the reign of Henry the seventh, that an inquisition taken by the chief justice of the King\u2019s Bench, as supreme coroner of all England, upon view of the body of one killed in open rebellion, was good and worked a forfeiture of his est\u00e1te. It is to be remarked of that case, that the resolution had regard to a forfeiture; and that no decision of a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>pendent judiciary betwixt a sovereign so rapacious and his subject, ought to be drawn into precedent for any thing. The chief justice of the King\u2019s Bench is doubtless a coroner by virtue of his office, as others are coroners, without election, by charter or commission of privilege; and even were they coroners within the purview of the statute\u2014and the authorities quoted show that they are not\u2014it surely could not be pretended that justices of the peace are such. They are not coroners in name ; nor have they ever been called so. In a few special cases they have power to take inquisitions by the testimony of <em>witnesses; </em>but they have neither part nor lot in the power confined by the 4 Ed. 1, from which alone authority to take inquisitions on view of the body is derived. It is indeed said by <em>Hawkins, </em>(B. 2, ch. 9,) that the statute is wholly directory and affirmative of the common law; but whether it be so or not, it permits none but the coroner to 'exercise the power specified in it,, as we must suppose the common law did. It is in force, as I have said, in Pennsylvania; but I know of no authority of our own in relation to the point in contest, unless my decision in the <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brock, </em>may be called so. At a court of oyer and terminer, held by me as president of the eleventh judicial district at Wilksbarre, in 1814, the prisoner was capitally convicted of the murder of one Dixon; but a new trial was awarded on- great consideration, because an inquisition <em>super visum corporis, </em>taken by a justice of the peace, had been put before the jury; and that was the first instance, I believe, in which a new trial was granted in a capital case, for any reason whatever. It results in the case- before us, that the warrant, having issued as it did on an inquisition taken <em>coram'non judice, </em>is illegal and void by the ninth article and sixth section, of the constitution, which declares that no warrant to search any place or to seize any person or things, shall issue without probable cause supported by oath or affirmation.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Prisoner discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
