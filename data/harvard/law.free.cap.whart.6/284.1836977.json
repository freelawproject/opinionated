I received it a day or two after its date; it came to me through the post; I have seen a hand-writing said to be defendant\u2019s which looks like it; I never saw him write, nor heard him acknowledge his writing; I am not acquainted with his hand-writing.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-13\">Upon being cross-examined he said\u2014\u201c I kept it in my possession a day and a night, and then I gave it to the plaintiff. I have seen it since then once or twice; the first time was a month or so after; and then six months or a year before I saw it again; I don\u2019t know if I saw it again after then till to-day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-14\">I made no mark on it at any time; I know it to be the same, because I know its general appearance, the letters, and every thing connected with it, and every word of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-15\">The plaintiff then called James Hunt, who testified as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-16\">\u201cI know the defendant\u2019s signature. This (looking at a paper handed him) dont\u2019t look like his signature; I believe this to be his signature; (looking at a paper marked No. 1, and dated Jan. 2, 1837;) and this is his, I have no doubt, (looking at a paper No. 2, dated Jan. 2, 1836;) and this is his, I have no doubt, (looking at a paper No. 2, dated Sep. 6,1826;) and this,\u201d looking at No. 3, dated March, 13, 1826.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-17\">Being cross-examined, he said\u2014\u201c I have seen the defendant write often; not for two years; I have seen him sign his name repeatedly. \u25a0I don\u2019t think I ever saw him write, except his signature ; as to what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>I have seen him write is confined to his signature. There is generally a manifest difference between a common hand and signature: there is a considerable difference between the characters of writing and the signatures., The writing in these papers, (looking at the papers marked No. 1, 2, 3 and 4) is his. I have seen writing in checks acknowledged to be his; I am acquainted with his hand-writing; I have no doubt that it (the alleged libel,) is in Mr. Baker\u2019s handwriting ; I never saw it before.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-6\">Upon being cross-examined, he said, \u201c I have no knowledge of his (the defendant\u2019s) hand-writing, except what I have stated.

The paper was then read in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-8\">Other witnesses were called by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel in respect to the circumstances upon which the supposed libel was founded.

I have seen him write often.\u201d (Looking at the alleged libel,) \u201c this I would not take to be his.\u201d The plaintiff concealed one pig of Dr. Uhler\u2019s lead; I saw it in his cellar; I had marked it with my finger nail.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-12\">Upon being cross-examined, <em>f\u2018 </em>This paper, (marked No. 4,) is the defendant\u2019s signature, but I don\u2019t think the body of it is his writing.

I went to the defendant\u2019s, to examine his writing: he wrote a bill to compare with his book; I examined them, and told the plaintiff I thought the libel was not the defendant\u2019s hand-writing, because of a particular letter; the plaintiff showed me a bill; I can\u2019t say this is it; I never thought the libel was the defendant\u2019s hand-writing.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-6\">George Weaver, called by the defendant, testified as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AEW\">\u201c I am well acquainted with the defendant\u2019s writing; I have seen him write often.\u201d (Looking at the libel,) \u201cThe libel is not the defendant\u2019s writing; the defendant writes a stiffer and better hand.

The evidence of what is stated in the letter would not convict the plaintiff of larceny. Dr. Uhler states that he delivered the lead to the plaintiff to purify. To charge a man with the commission of an act which appears by the circumstances not to amount to it, is not actionable. 6 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>Slander, C. Words are to be taken <em>in mitiori sensu.

One may be acquainted with the party\u2019s handwriting even without having seen him write. One having only seen a signature written is a witness. Then the libel being proved, we went on to corroborate by showing the malicious interference of the defendant, and on one occasion calling'him thief. We further proceeded to give evidence of comparison of handwriting. We positively proved .these other papers to be the handwriting of the defendant; yet they were not offered until the end of the case, when the whole evidence was gone through. They were then objected to as comparison of hands. This it is important to attend to. In the course of the defence a point of'evidence was produced which is material. Mr. O'Neil examined a book, and said that he was satisfied the libel was not the defendant\u2019s writing. We called for the book, and it was produced, and was the main evidence to show that the libel was the defendant\u2019s handwriting. And it was after this that our other papers were given. No. 5 did not go to the jury: this it is true we offered to show that the libel was not written by Augustus Johnston, as was pretended, but the judge struck it out. <em>Atstook </em>v. <em>Roach, </em>(1 <em>Esp. Rep. </em>351,) was a suit on a bill of exchange; defence forgery: the witness said* he had seen the defendant write three times, and believed the bill his handwriting. Another witness who produced five bills accepted by the defendant, proved before the commissioners of bankruptcy; said on comparing that he did not think them to be his writing. For defendant said he knew his hand, and, on seeing the bill had no doubt it was not his. The plaintiff offered some bills which were objected to, but admitted. It is true that this is not now sustained in England, but on what reason ? It is said sometimes jurors can\u2019t write. That is absurd here. The presumption is the other way. Every paper given in evidence here is referred to the jury. Again, it is said the party may pick out and arrange writings to suit his purpose. This presupposes knavery which is not to be presupposed but proved. If there be a trick it may be shown. T\u00edtere are two kinds of comparison; first, the witness is to compare; second, the jury are to do it. In England the first is followed. But, in this country, both are practised. Our reports show this. <em>M\u2018Corkle </em>v. <em>Binns, </em>(5 <em>Binn. </em>349,) where newspapers were compared. <em>F.

Others go even further-3 <em>Phill. Ev. (by Hill. &amp; Cowan.,) </em>1329, contains a reference to all these cases. The last case is, <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Newcombe, </em>(21 Pick. 315,) proved specimens are evidence to compare by. <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Rowell, </em>(17 <em>Pick. </em>490.) <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Fenner, </em>(1 <em>Gall. </em>175.)

[Rogers, J.\u2014Must the standard not be when the witness can swear he saw the party write, or sign, or heard him admit itl] Our cases all go (especially <em>Callan </em>v. <em>Gaylord,) </em>much further,- it is sufficient if the handwriting be proved in the usual way, by one acquainted with it, and swearing to his belief. This, in corroboration, has always been admitted here. The jury then have a right to it. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>(1 <em>Wash C. C. </em>7,) is relied on by the other -side. It is a very short case. <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Craig, </em>(4 <em>W. C. C. R. </em>729,) is another U. S. case, and they seem all to refer to another kind of comparison of hands than our -state courts,- and they in criminal cases have followed the English. 1 <em>Baldw. </em>39. <em>Strother </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>(6 <em>Pet. </em>763.) 2 <em>Phill.

I don\u2019t think that arises here. No. 1,1 take for example, which is, perhaps, the 'strongest. The only witness to it is Hunt, and his evidence might authorise the libel to go to the jury, but not the specimens. Johnston won\u2019t swear to it. No. 2 and 3 are also proved by Hunt. Johnston says of No. 4, it is the defendant\u2019s signature, but not the body. Of No. 3 he says, he don\u2019t know the writing. So of No. 2. No. <em>1, he </em>says has a resemblance, but he won\u2019t swear to it. [Mr. Dallas\u2014Weaver, a witness for the defendant, says-that 2, 3, and 4, are defendant\u2019s handwriting.] Yes, but he says the libel is not. The paper No; 1 was no better proved than the libel, by the same witness, and on opinion. <em>Ignotum per ignotius. </em>In <em>M\u2018Corkle </em>v. <em>Binns, </em>the paper was bought at the defendant\u2019s shop; there was presumption, and of the fact, not opinion. In the <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Whitehill, </em>the defendant admitted the administration account to be his handwriting. In <em>Vickroy </em>v. <em>Kelley </em>com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>parison of hands was not allowed, <em>i. e. </em>evidence of belief that a writing is in the handwriting of another, and then that to go to the jury. Here Hunt, the only witness, speaks merely as to having seen the signature of the defendant. The thing called a standard is no better than the writing itself. <em>Callan </em>v. <em>Gaylord </em>is not a case like this. Many witnesses gave their opinion as to the writing of the libel. Other persons proved the account books, it is to be presumed. At any rate the fact was proved. Such evidence as that offered here is no corroboration\u2014it leaves it as doubtful as ever..</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b291-7\">Rogers, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-e\">The evidence preliminary to the introduction of the alleged libel was sufficiently strong to justify the court in submitting the paper to the inspection of the jury. The ordinary proof of the opinion of the witness was given, and under these circumstances the question, whether it was the handwriting of the defendant, was for the jury, who are the ultimate judges of the genuineness of the paper. There is nothing in the. first exception.. The second exception was properly abandoned: but it is insisted that there is error in permitting the plaintiff to give in evidence the papers, as specified in the third exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">The doctrine in this state is, that mere unaided comparison of hands is not in general admissible. But in corroboration of testimony previously given, such testimony may be received. In <em>M\u2018 Corkle </em>v. <em>Binns, </em>(5 <em>Bran. </em>340,) it is ruled that evidence from comparison of handwriting, supported by other circumstances, is admissible, And on the same principle from a comparison of the types, devices, &amp;c. of two newspapers, one of which is. clearly proved, and the other imperfectly, the jury may be. authorised to infer that both were printed by the same person. After evidence has been given in support of a writing, it may be corroborated by comparing the writing in question, with a writing, concerning which there is no doubt. The same principle is affirmed in <em>Vickroy </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>(14 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle,. </em>372.) <em>Callan </em>v. <em>Gaylord, </em>(3 <em>Watts, </em>321.) <em>Lodge </em>v. <em>Pipher, </em>(11 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle, </em>333.) <em>Farmer\u2019s Bank </em>v. <em>Whitehill, </em>(10 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle, </em>110.) <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>(1 <em>Penn. </em>Rep, 161)</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">But the. objection is not to the general principle; but it is contended there is no adequate proof the genuineness of the papers which are intended as the,standards of comparison. And on this point I am not aware of any direct decision;. although in several cases it is plainly indicated that no doubt must remain as to the handwriting of the test paper. Thus in <em>M\u2018Corkle </em>v. <em>Binns </em>the chief justice says, the paper must be identified beyond all doubt. And again., in the same case, he says, it may be compared with the writing concerning which there is no doubt. <em>The Farmer\u2019s Bank </em>v. <em>Whitehill, </em>was an original administration account, settled by the defendant and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>mother, respecting the estate of the defendant\u2019s father, and i\u2018t was proved by the register of wills, that it was signed by the defendant and his mother, and s worn to by them. It was also admitted on the trial that it was his handwriting. Here nothing was left to conjecture or doubt. In the <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>the test paper was admitted to be genuine; and Mr. Justice Smith says, that when a witness has seen a person write, and declares he knows his writing, he may compare it with writings which he has seen the person write, or which it is admitted he wrote. <em>Callan </em>v. <em>Gaylord </em>is supposed to have a strong bearing on the point, because, in the argument, a distinction is attempted between papers admitted that it is said may go to the jury in corroboration, but not papers proved. But it must be remarked that this practice is not noticed by the court; and, in truth, there is no such distinction; for there can be no doubt that papers proved may be admitted for purposes of comparison. The dirhculty is not as to the character of the proof, but the manner of the proof. The court, ruled the broad principle, that comparison of hands is evidence in corroboration of other evidence which tends strongly to prove that a libel is in the handwriting of' the defendant. The chief justice takes it for granted that the book, which was offered in corroboration, was, in fact, written by the defendant. It does not appear to have been denied that the entries in the plaintiff\u2019s book were in the handwriting of the defendant; and this, in truth, could not be done, as he had been in his employment as his book-keeper.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Mr. Justice \u25a0 Shaw, in <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Rowell, </em>(17 <em>Pick. </em>495,) seems to intimate that proof of the genuineness of the standard offered for comparison, must be directed to the fact of its having been written by the party, by one who saw him write it. See also <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Newcombe, </em>(21 <em>Pick. </em>317.)</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">We conceive it to be very material that strict proof of the genuine or test paper should be first given; that no reasonable doubt should remain on that point; and nothing short of evidence of a person who saw him write the paper, or an admission of being genuine, or evidence of equal certainty, should be received for that purpose. Any other rule would lay \u2019the doctrine open to Mr. Starkie\u2019s principal objection to the general principle, who, speaking as to the receipt of evidence as to comparison of hands, says, that, perhaps, after all, the most satisfactory reason for its exclusion is, that if such comparisons were allowed, it would open the door to the admission of a great deal of collateral evidence, which would go to a very inconvenient length. For in every case it would be necessary to go into distinct evidence to prove each specimen produced to be genuine; and even in support of a particular specimen evidence of comparison would be receivable, in order to establish the specimen, and so the evidence might branch out to an indefinite extent. 2 <em>Stark. Ev. </em>375. This inconvenience is in a measure avoided by exacting preliminary proof which leaves no reasonable doubt as to the genuine<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>ness of the standard or test paper. This ryould seem to be reasonable from the very nature of a standard or test, which should itself be certain and fixed.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The preliminary evidence which was given, was an opinion of the principal witness on whom the plaintiff rested this part of his\" case, with the aid to be derived from the opinion of another witness, who says that the papers No. 1, 2, 3, and 4, are his, that is, the deT fendant\u2019s. It is, however, nothing more than his believing at last, as it is not pretended he saw him write them, nor is it any where said that the defendant acknowledged the writing to be his. There is rather stronger evidence that the specimen is not his hand-writing, than of the authenticity of the alleged libel, as we have the opinion of one more witness of the one than of the other. It is very plain that without the restrictions which have been indicated, evidence of comparison of hands, would very 'often be used \u2018for very oppressive and pernicious purposes. As the party who offered them would have the selection of the criterion or test specimen, it would very frequently happen that it would be out of the power of the adverse party to disprove the allegation that the writing was his. In the case at bar, the libel is as much a test of the authenticity of the standard of comparison, or nearly so, as the latter is of the authenticity of the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">As this cause goes down for another trial, we refrain from expressing an opinion on the six last errors. If the declaration be defective in any respect, as alleged, it may be amended before or on the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Judgment reversed, and <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
