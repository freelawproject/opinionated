An offer to pay money was made by me, but the plaintiffs refused to receive it. The circumstances were as follows:\u2014I went to the counting-house of Messrs. Dorr, on the 4th of October, in the year 1837, and offered, to one of the partners, not the gentleman now present, who represents himself to be S. F. Dorr, the amount of twenty-six per cent, on the amount of the debt due them; he said that he had no authority to receive it; that he would converse with the other partner, and wished me to call again in two hours time, when one,-or both of them would be in. I called accordingly, and offered Mr. Samuel F. Dorr, then -in, twenty-six per cent, on the amount of the firm\u2019s debt, their claim being between nineteen hundred and two thousand dollars. He said that he could not receive it. I asked him a second time to receive it; he did not appear very well pleased at my doing so, and again refused to receive it. On the 7th of October, three days afterwards, I again went to the store of Messrs. Dorr, and saw Mr. Samuel F. Dorr, and told him that I came to pay him, as assignee to the estate of Tyson and Brother, twenty-six per cent, on the amount of his debt, in specie; he refused to receive it, and appeared angry. I then went away.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-13\">\u201c First cross-interrogatory.\u2014If you answer, there was a dividend offered, state particularly when, where, and at what counting-house, place of business, and when <em>1 </em>To what person particularly, and to what firm that person belongs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-14\">Second cross-interrogatory.\u2014State particularly your proceedings, under the assignment, in reference to the plaintiffs,1 and when you acted in your capacity as assignee, and when as agent for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-15\">Third cross-interrogatory.\u2014Do you know any thing else material to the plaintiffs 1 If so, state it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-16\">Answers.\u2014\u201c 1. That he hath already deposed to all he can say in reply to this interrogatory, in his answer to the sixth interrogatory, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>on the part of the defendants. The offer referred to in the answer to the said sixth interrogatory, was made to Samuel F. Dorr; but what was the style of the firm to which he belonged, at the time, or now belongs, witness does not know; but he said he had the conducting of the claim' on Tyson and Brother, and had employed an attorney in Philadelphia, he believes, by the name of Miles, to attend to the claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-6\">2. That as to the proceedings under the assignment, in reference to the plaintiffs, he hath nothing-further to state, that he knows of. That he left Philadelphia eighteen months ago: that he has never made any legal renunciation, as assignee, but presumes, that since he left Philadelphia he has been acting as agent of the defendants; the estate being closed and wound up, or nearly wound up, he presumed. he had nothing further to do; and being absent from the city of Philadelphia, he was not acting under the assignment, unless legally called upon so to do. [He further states, in answer to this interrogatory,.! tendered the money as assignee to the estate of Tyson and Brother, and told Mr. Dorr that I did so; but he appeared so vexed at the time, and angry, that I believe he did not hear me through his passion; that since \u00cd have been in New York, I consider myself as acting as assignee and agent for the defendants: this matter of S. &amp; F. Dorr being the only thing, called upon me to act as assignee.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-7\">- 3. He received the specie above spoken of fro.m the defendant\u2019s attorney. He- had it with him on the 7th of October last, when at the counting-house of Messrs. Dorr. I told Mr. S. F. Dorr I came prepared to pay it to him; but did not show it to him, because he refused to receive it, and told me so. The specie was partly in gold, and partly in silver.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-8\">The evidence being closed, the counsel for the defendants requested the .court to charge the jury,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-9\">\u201c 1. That the release, signed by the plaintiffs, is good against them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-10\">2.

The assignment of the defendants is a peculiar one, without precedent, I believe, in this country. (The judge here stated the substance of the assignment.) The assignment was altogether void at the outset; or at least voidable at the option of the creditors; I apprehend, however, it was void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-9\">(The judge then read the release.) This is a conditional release, not a full release. The plaintiffs had no interest whatever under the assignment. The condition annexed to their release by the plaintiffs, was a valid one, but it prevented the assignee from distributing the goods to the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-10\">Upon the points proposed by the defendants\u2019 counsel, I charge as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-11\">Upon the first point, I say, That the release would be good against the plaintiffs, if there had been a compliance on the part of the defendants with the condition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-12\">As to the second point, I say, that the condition annexed by the plaintiffs, was not a void one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-13\">To the third point,\u2014the release not being in accordance with the terms of the assignment, the plaintiffs had no interest in the assignment, and it was, consequently, not their duty to call upon the assignee for his execution of the trust committed to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-14\">To the fourth point, I answer as requested by the defendants\u2019 counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-15\">The fifth point, I consider irrelevant, for the reason given by me in answer to the second question. And the sixth point I answer negatively; the release is not a bar. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-16\">To the seventh point, I answer, it is matter of defence; a compliance with the condition should have been shown by the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-17\">On the whole, the defence has utterly failed; and your verdict should be for the plaintiffs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-18\">Exceptions were taken to this charge; and a verdict having been given in conformity with it, this writ of error was taken by the defendants; and the following errors were assigned:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-19\"><em>\u201c </em>1.

A condition inserted in h\u00eds- release-by a creditor,- that-he- should receive-twenty-; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>five per cent, of his debt, was held to be bad, as not in compliance with the terms of the assignment, and as throwing on the assignees difficulties and embarrassments incompatible with the execution of their trust. But in that case there was no release executed; there was merely a letter written by the creditor, agreeing to become a party to the assignment and release, on condition of the fund paying twenty-five per cent, of his claim. This was held to be in its nature merely an executory agreement which could not be enforced without a consideration, and as the creditor could not come upon the fund, his agreement to release would not be enforced. In the present case there is not merely an executory agreement, but a technical release, executed under hand and seal; and the result is different. For, as is said in <em>Agnew </em>v. <em>Dorr, </em>it is certain that a technical release will discharge a duty at law, without consideration, and that chancery will not relieve against it, where the releasor has acted with full knowledge of all necessary circumstances. The release, therefore, is in the present case clearly binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">If, then, the release be binding, and the condition inoperative, by reason of its repugnancy to the terms of the assignment, and the impossibility that it should be performed, the consequence is, that the release remains single and absolute, and extinguishes the debt. For the principle of law has long been settled,\u2019 that if one gives an obligation with condition to be void on the performance of that which is impossible at the time of its execution, the bond is single, and it is the same as if there were no condition at all; and so of a feoffment. <em>Co. Lit. </em>206. <em>Sav. </em>96. <em>Leon. </em>189. <em>Bro. </em>155. 1 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>649; and the distinction is drawn between a bond or deed executed, and an agreement executory; for if an estate be to arise, or a duty to commence on a precedent condition that is impossible, they can never have effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Now the condition of this release is, that the assignment pays over twenty-five per cent, of the claim. But this could never be; for the assignees could not divert the funds from their appropriate channel, which was first to the preferred creditors; next amongst those who executed perfect releases; and lastly, to the assignors. Under no possible circumstances could the assignment pay the releasors anything whatever, if they did not release according to the terms of the assignment; nor \u25a0 could the assignees voluntarily pay any portions, without a breach of their trust, which the law will not suppose beforehand, nor recognise when done as valid in its operation. . \u201e</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">Again, a man cannot release a personal action as an obligation, with a condition subsequent, but the condition will be void: for a personal action once suspended is extinguished forever. 1 <em>Rol. Ab. 412. </em>For instance, a release, if once operative, cannot be avoided: so that one may make a release to operate on a contingency, .'but cannot make a release to.be void on a condition. 1 <em>Inst. 274, </em>b. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>thing once extinguished cannot be revived; or, in other words, if the release be on a condition subsequent, the release is good, and the condition void. 2 <em>Shep. Touch, </em>by <em>Preston, </em>325, <em>Law Lib. </em>91st part, 154. The present is not an instrument by which on a future contingency the release is to become operative: but a release first with a condition which is intended to defeat it subsequently, if the releasor should not receive twenty-five per cent.; and the release ' remains binding, though such condition be never performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
