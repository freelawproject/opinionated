It appears that -the two first suits were brought for two of the heirs of old Mr. Stecher; one for Henry Stecher, the son of John George Stecher; and one for Mary, the daughter of old Mr. Stecher. The other two suits were brought for and by Andrew Stecher. No one of the suits was brought by or for John Stecher, for whose use this suit was brought. Can those suits, or any of them be pleaded in abatement of this suit I By the act of 1832, suits are to be brought on administration bonds, in the same manner as suits are brought on sheriff\u2019s bonds. By the act of 1803, each person aggrieved, may bring suit on the sheriff\u2019s bond, or recognizance, in \u25a0 the name of the Commonwealth, for his use, and recover judgments for the damages he may have sustained. Under the act of 1832, until its repeal in 1836, each individual interested might bring suit on an administration bond, and recover the amount of money due him, in the name of the Commonwealth, for his use. The name of the individual must be placed on the record. An action is given to each one separately, adapted to the particular circumstances of his case. The actions which are pleaded in abatement, stood in the name of the Commonwealth alone. John had not caused them, or any of them to be brought. He was not' a party to any of them, nor could he have been legally made a party to any one of the suits. Nor had he any control over them, nor could he have discontinued them, tie could not have recovered his money in any of those suits. This being the case, I cannot see why they should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>stand in his way, either to impede or interrupt his action, properly brought, for the recovery of his share of his father\u2019s estate. Prior to the act of 1832, the law authorised the bringing of one suit on an administration bond, and if judgment was obtained, it stood for the benefit of all concerned. On this judgment each had a separate remedy for the recovery of his individual claim. This is entirely changed by the act of 1832, by which each party interested may at once bring a suit in the name of the Commonwealth, for his use, and thus recover his own debt. If this is correct, as I think it is, the plea of abatement is cut up by the roots. The court decides against the defendant on the plea of abatement,- and gives judgment of respondeat ouster.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-6\">The defendants then pleaded payment with leave to give the special matters in evidence; and upon this issue the cause came on for trial before Judge Banks, on the 28th of November, 1839; when the plaintiff having proved the execution of the bond, gave in evidence a report of auditors upon the estate of George Steeher, deceased, dated the 13th of January, 1835, and confirmed <em>nisi </em>on the 23d of the same, by which it appeared that there was a balance in the hands of the administrator of $6472 01 for distribution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel then tendered .a refunding bond with surety, and asked leave of the court to file the same, which was allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-8\">The defendants\u2019 counsel, in the course of the trial, offered in evidence\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-9\">1.

A report of auditors upon the estate of George Steeher, deceased, dated the 21st day of March, 1833.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-12\">Which were severally objected to by the counsel for the plaintiff, and rejected by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-13\">The learned judge charged the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-14\">\u201c The defendants\u2019 counsel have requested the court to charge the jury, that the plaintiff cannot recover, because he did not, before suit brought, give a refunding bond, according to the provisions of the act of the 24th of February, 1834. The 39th section of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>act provides for distribution under the direction of the Orphans\u2019 Court. The 41st section directs the security which shall <em>be </em>given by the person entitled to <em>receive </em>any share in the said distribution. This security must be given before he shall be entitled to receive his share. This is when distribution is made in the Orphans\u2019 Court, or by agreement, and does not apply to suits in a court of law. The 45th section also applies to distribution in the Orphans\u2019 Court; and then the security must be given, before the person is entitled to receive his share. The act does not appear to provide for a suit brought in a court of law. The same act provides that no action shall.be brought for the'recovery of a legacy, until reasonable demand shall have been made of the executor; nor shall such legatee be entitled to execution in such actions until security shall have been given, in the manner directed in the sections I have referred to. <em>The </em>legislature, no doubt, supposed that the remedy given in the Orphans\u2019 Court was ample, and that a distributee would not find it necessary to resort to a suit or action at law. But if the distributee does not resort to the Orphans\u2019 Court for redress, but brings his suit as is provided in case of a legacy, why may not the security be given before execution, as if it was a legacy. Security to creditors is the object in both cases. I therefore do not see any reason why the security may not be given in this case, before execution, in the same manner as is provided in case of a suit for the recovery of a legacy. I therefore do not think that it was necessary that the security should have been given before suit brought: and the court refuses <em>to </em>charge you as the defendants\u2019 counsel have requested.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-6\">A bill of exceptions was tendered to this charge; and the jury having found for the plaintiffs, this writ of error was taken, and the following errors assigned..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-7\"><em>\u201c </em>1.

The act of 1834, as to refunding bonds, does not apply to a. case where the party died before the passing of the act. The prior acts required the refunding bond to be tendered before suit brought. <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Nicholl, </em>(6 <em>Watts, </em>379.) <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Davidson, </em>(2 <em>Rawle, </em>52.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b65-8\">Mr. <em>Brodhead, </em>contra\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-9\">1. The plea in abatement was too late, because not put in until after four days from the filing of the declaration. But it was properly overruled, because the former suits were not between the same parties. The act of 1836 did not apply to this case. The administrator might have escaped costs by depositing the money in court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-10\">2. The' auditor\u2019s report was free from ambiguity; and having been confirmed by the Orphans\u2019 Court, it was conclusive upon the parties. <em>M\u2018Fadden </em>v. <em>Geddes, </em>(17 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>339.) <em>App </em>v. <em>Dreisbach, </em>(2 <em>Rawle, </em>301.) <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>M\u2018Gaw, </em>(2 <em>Watts, </em>164.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-11\">3. The refunding bond was tendered in'time. <em>Bixler </em>v. <em>Blankenbiller, </em>(8 <em>Watts, </em>64.) <em>Baughman </em>v. <em>Kunkle, </em>(3 <em>Watts, </em>483.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b65-12\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b65-13\">Rogers, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAh\">The suits which formed the subject-matter of the plea in abatement, were brought under the act of 1832. By that .act, suits may be brought in the same manner as on sheriff\u2019s bonds and recognisances. In this, reference is made to the act of the 28th of March, 1803, by which each person who may be aggrieved by the misconduct of the sheriff, is authorised to bring suits on the bond and recognisance, and to refcover judgment for the injury he may have sustained. The pendency of a suit by one, in general cannot be pleaded in abatement by another. And in another particular the plea is bad, because it is not for the same cause of action. The plaintiff, John Stecher, was no party to those suits, had no control over them, and cannot therefore be affected by them in any way whatever. The act of 1836, which took effect in October of the same year, does not touch this case, as the original actions were instituted during the existence of the former act; which, although it repeals it, contains a saving clause, so far as' may be necessary to finish proceedings commenced before that time. The act of 1832 made an entire change in the practicefor previously suits were brought on the administration bond in the name of the commonwealth, and judgment, when rendered, remained, for the benefit of all indebted; the remedy for each being had by <em>scire facias </em>on the continuing judgment. The act of 1832 alters this, by \u00e9nabling each \" <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>party, in the first instance, to bring an action in the name of the commonwealth for his use, and to recover his own debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">The evidence contained in the bills of exception was offered to explain an alleged ambiguity in the report of the auditors. But we are not convinced that any ambiguity exists; and if it did, it would be improper to admit parol evidence to explain it: the report is final ana conclusive. The evidence was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">The cases of <em>Bixler </em>v. <em>Blankenbiller, (8 Watts, </em>64,) and <em>Baughman v. Kunkle, </em>(8 <em>Watts, </em>484,) particularly the latter, are an answer to the objection, that it was necessary to tender a \u2022 refunding bond, before suit brought. In construing the acts of 1794 and 1792, a distinction has been taken between a suit for a distributive share, and an action to recover a legacy.' In the former, the act requires the bond to be filed before the distribution made of the estate by <em>the </em>administrator, whereas the latter orders a refunding bond before suit brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
