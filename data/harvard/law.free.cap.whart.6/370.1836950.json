The appellants except to the aforesaid direction of the Orphans\u2019 Court, both on its intrinsic demerits, and on the ground that although the furniture composing said item may have been a pure gift by the intestate, it may, nevertheless, operate as an advancement.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b372-10\">Mr. <em>C. J. Jngersoll </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-11\">The depositions don\u2019t alter the ease. It was, in fact,an advancement though the intestate chose to call it a gift or present. He must have used this language, though he meant an advancement <em>He </em>was not selling the furniture to her. \u201c Advancement \u201d is a technical word, not commonly used <em>or </em>understood. In <em>Oyster v. Oyster, </em>(1 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>425,) it is called a gift <em>Hoke </em>v. <em>Hoke, (5 Watts, </em>82,). <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>(6 <em>Watts, </em>257.) Act of the 8th of April, 1833. The object is to .equalise distribution; whereas, if the child had been advanced to one half of the estate, the case would be the same a.S the present. All would go as a gift according to the opposite construction, to .the injury of the other children. <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Pratt, (Fitzgibbon, </em>285.) The Massachusetts acts throw the burden of proof on the party alleging an advancement ,\u2022 bui, as we have no such acts, the burden is thrown on the other party. Here it is to be presumed an advancement until the contrary is shown.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b372-12\">Mr. <em>J. H. Campbell </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-13\">The estate is shown by the accounts to have exceeded $120,000, There were four children. Maria was the only daughter. It would be strange if a father under such oircums.tances could not make, a present to a daughter. There was a book of the intestate produced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>on the hearing, below, containing entries of expenditures for the other children; but UP entry of this. The rule in Pennsylvania has been that the party averring an advancement must prove it. It is a question of intention- Surely a man may yet dispose of his property as he pleases, if he has no creditors. The depositions show that he intended a pure gift.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b373-6\">Mr. <em>J. R, Ingersoll </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-7\">Advancement is the correlative, of <em>debt, </em>not-of <em>gift. </em>If the estate had be.en small, the injury might have been great to the other children ; and they have, a right to say that this shall be an advancement on the death of their parent, intestate, whatever it might be as a gift in his lifetime. Here we show an advancement from the nature of the transaction. The amount is large, and the occasion was the marriage or fitting out of a child. If not an advancement, it must be a debt.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b373-8\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b373-9\">Sergeant, J.</author>\n<p id=\"APv\">The evidence in this case shows that the gift of the father to his daughter of furniture, at the time of her marrying, was intended as a present, and not as an advancement. It can be treated as the latter only on the principle contended for by the appellants, that every such gift by a father to his daughter must be deemed an advancement, in case of his dying intestate. No authority, however, has been produced in support of this-principle; nor does there seem any reason for saying that it never shall be in the power of such parent to make a present to his child during his lifetime, unless it falls within that class of small donations, which'the law holds to be presents and not advancements. Surely such parent has the fight of giving his property to his child as well as to a third person, if he chooses, provided he does nothing thereby to delay or hinder creditors. A daughter who leaves a parent, at her marriage, frequently relieves him from the burden of maintaining her, while the other children may remain with the parent for years, and become far more expensive to him; and it might be unjust that the children who remain should deduct the daughter\u2019s provision of furniture, when they are not charged with maintenance. All such questions must depend on the intention of the parent in making the gift: and of this, the declarations of the parent at the time would seem to be evidence, or the admissions of the children against themselves at the time, or afterwards. And in <em>Hengst\u2019s Case, </em>(G <em>Watts, </em>86,) entries in the father\u2019s books, made at his request, and signed by him, were held evidence against the child to show an advancement. If there be no evidence at all on the subject, then whether it was a present or an advancement may be judged of by its amount and character; of which there have been many cases in chancery, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>are referred to in 1 <em>Madd. Ch. </em>512, and other books.' But when the intention of the father is clearly proved, as here, it supersedes this inquiry, and settles definitely the character of the gift. In fact, nothing is more usual than for the father, on the marriage of his daughter, to provide her with furniture for housekeeping: and whether he will charge it to her as an advancement, or make it a free and absolute gift, to be her\u2019s without accountability in any event, is within his own breast, where he is in a solvent state. If there be. no evidence, it must be judged of according to the rules on the subject to which I have adverted. Here, it seems, the daughter married with the approbation of the father, and he chose, probably as a testimony of his satisfaction, to give the furniture as a present, which he had a right to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
