That such right of exclusion was incident to, and a part of their property in the lands; and, is as effective against the state, without compensation, as against individuals; and particularly where the state does not take for a public road, but authorises individuals to take for their own purposes.

The authority to the company takes from the owners the right to treat the company as trespassers, which appertained to them as owners of the street; and to treat the rail-road obstruction as a nuisance: the suppression of these rights is a taking of their property; an abridgment of the right of property is a taking of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-6\">Property consists as well in the right to exclude others from using the thing, as in the right to use it.

A dedication of ground for a public footway vests in the king or state as trustee. They cannot declare it a common thoroughfare or highway without violating the trust, nor without recompense. The right of the public is a right of passage only, and that too upon the private soil of another. The king\u2019s right of soil, or the public\u2019s right of soil, is a thing unknown to the law of highway. The owner retains all right of soil, of herbage, of minerals, and use of the land, not incompatible with the public right of passage.

The grant of the act of incorporation -^stipulates for numerous and onerous duties, consisting of expenditures of money for the public convenience, which constitutes a good consideration for the grant, and establishes it as a contract.

The state should be enforced to accord to them the advantages of those improvements, if not expressly, by implication granted them, in the charter. The state cannot incorporate individuals against their consent as public or private corporations; the act to incorporate takes effect from acceptance. 1 <em>Kant, </em>419. <em>Angel on Carp. </em>46, 7. 4 <em>0. &lt;Sg J. </em>129, 30. <em>Hil.

The powers of the corporation are as much fed from the powers of the corporators as of ther state; and the state is as much bound by the act as the inhabitants. Neither can revoke, cancel, rescind or annul any part, except as the power of doing so is provided for in the charter. The right of the district to the improvements and streets made under the charter cannot be abridged. Their right to exclude the rail-road cannot be taken from it and given to the company. The franchise of the district in the streets is protected by the constitution. 1 <em>Kent, </em>415. 2 <em>Wharton\u2019s Rep. </em>485.

It provides for compensation for a temporary use. It makes no provision for a perpetual use by the company. The omission is fatal under the amended constitution. The charters stipulate that no law or ordinance shall be made to alter the regulation of the street. Act 17th April, 1795. Sec. 11. 21. 30. 33. 16, 17, 18, of Act of Incorporation of Kensington. The implication is irresistible, that no use shall be made of them against the consent of the corporation, that requires an alteration of the regulation of them. A grant of them is implied so far as that they shall not be altered by any law in form or use. The result of the location will be, that the street can only be used in such way as will not interfere with the company. The private right of a full and free use of the street, and the common right of an equal use of it are destroyed. This is the effect of that law; and there is no difference in principle between a law that in terms impairs a contract, and one that' produces the same effect in construction and practical result. - 4 <em>Harris ,&amp;p Johnson, </em>109. <em>Baldwin, </em>215-20.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b38-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Mr. <em>Mattery </em>and Mr. <em>Meredith </em>for the company, argued'\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-6\">That <em>the first </em>exception was not well founded. That the application to the Court of Quarter Sessions for the appointment of viewers, was by petition signed by the president of the company ,* and that when the reports of the previous viewers were set aside, the Court on the application, of the solicitor of the company, appointed the third set of viewers, and it was not necessary to present a new petition. The petition was not rejected by setting aside the report. The company have, in every stage of the controversy, claimed the benefit of the proceedings had under the appointment, and How claim; which is sufficient evidence of authority from the company.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AS\">\u2022 The persons objecting to the location of the road cannot he injured by any matter alleged in the second exception. Whether the location was made by the company, in the first place,- and- that location, submitted to the jury for their approval; or made by tbe jury upon a view of the ground, and the location returned by them, With their approval, cannot be material. The company were authorised to make the location, and they might do it by the direct agency of the jury, as well as in any other manner. And the location having been so made and adopted by the company, it becomes their location, and it has been approved and sanctioned by the jury and by the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-7\">There is nothing upon the record to sustain the third error. It appears that the jurors were sworn according to law; but there hag been no law shown which requires them to be sworn at all, in the present case; and no form of oath, or any tribunal named, before whom any oath is <em>to </em>be taken. If no oath was required, it Cannot be an error'that <em>they </em>were sworn.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-8\">[The fourth, fifth, and sixth errors were passed, upon the suggestion of the court, that they contained nothing, which could be examined in this court upon this certiorari.j</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-9\">The seventh error, if true in point of fact, is not a ground of complaint here. The jury were to view themselves: they were to exercise their own judgment: they were not constituted a court, to call witnesses before them, administer \u2022 an oath to them, and dedde upon their testimony. They are to examine and judge for themselves, and not depend upon the judgment of others. And besides, there is nothing in the act requiring them to decide upon the claims of private property holders for damages. No such provision is found in said act. The company, in the location of <em>the </em>road in question, can only use some street or streets between the two given points; they cannot take private property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-10\">The provisions of the previous acts, relating to this company, Gap, have no bearing upon the provisions of the present act Under the former laws, the company, in the location of their rail-road, were excluded from <em>the </em>use <em>of. </em>all highways, except it should he liecessary for crossing the same; and were required to pay for the land used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>to the owner thereof; and the mode of ascertaining the value of the land, and the damage to the owner, is pointed out. But by the act of the 23dofMarch, 1839, the company are authorised to locate and construct a'rail-road, from their depot in the district of Kensington to their depot at the corner of Third and Willow streets, by the <em>best route </em>along the streets between the said depots, and for that purpose they may occupy such street or streets as shall be roost beneficial and convenient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-6\">It was not within the contemplation of the legislature that the company should make any location, except in the streets; and they are not required to pay any one for that privilege.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-7\">The eighth error is founded upon the supposition that the proceedings in this case are to be regulated by the practice in laying out roads under the general road law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-8\">But by a reference to the act of the 28d of March, 1839, under which the proceedings in this case were had, it will be manifest that the,practice under the general road law, cannot be adopted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-9\">The location and construction of the road are required to be done within one year; and if two terms were to be allowed for the confirmation of the report of viewers, and one or two- should be set aside as in the present case, the law would be entirely defeated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-10\">The company require only the report of the viewers and the approval of it, by the court. They need no <em>order </em>of tire court -to warrant the location or construction of the road, as in the case of proceedings under the general road law-.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-11\">[The ninth error was passed as containing no matter of review in _ this court.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-12\">The tenth error, and the specifications under it, strike at the. validity of the act, upon the ground that it is unconstitutional, and therefore void. In the first it is objected to the act that it is unconstitutional because it- violates the charter of incorporation of Kensington district-, in depriving the corporation of the power of the streets.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-13\">But upon examining the acts incorporating the district, it will appear that the streets in the said district are public highways, and are in the same situation as other highways, throughout the commonwealth. Pamphlet Laws of 1819,1820, p. 54.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-14\">The legislature have the same power over the streets, of Kensington as they have over the highways in other parts of the state, to regulate. the use of them, and to authorise any improved mode of travel-ling upon them. And there is nothing given to the corporation of that district, which can limit the power of the legislature over the streets, or render an act of the legislature upon that subject unconstitutional.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-15\">It is said again that the authority given by this- act to locate the rail-road along the streets, is unconstitutional, inasmuch a-s it takes private property for public use, Without making compensation to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>owner. This is assuming that private property is taken for the use of the rail-road which is denied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-6\">The streets have already been dedicated to public use, and the former owner of the soil has parted with his control over it so long as it shall be used by the public. The use, and the manner of using it, have been surrendered to the public, and are under the control of the legislature, as the guardians of the public. And by the act it is only the occupancy of the streets which is given, and only that can be taken\u2014and that belonged to the public; and the public, by an act of the legislature, have given it to the company. And it is not possible for any constitutional question to arise from this part of the case, even admitting that the right of soil in the street may be in the owners of the adjacent land. But if the owner of the land lays out a town, or a part of one, and opens streets, and dedicates the streets to public use, and then sells out lots, bounded upon the the streets, with the courses and distances, it may be doubted whether the owner of the lots can extend his claim of title to the middle of the street. <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>(11 <em>Pick. Rep. </em>198.) <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Hathaway, </em>(15 <em>John. Rep. </em>447.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-7\">But so far as the use of the public highways is concerned, the legislature have always exercised control over them, and have modified and varied the use of them. They have authorised a turnpike road to be laid upon a common road; a rail-road to be laid across highways and turnpike roads, and canals intersecting all of them; and it never would be allowed by the legislature, regarding the best interests of the public, that any or all her lines of improvements should be interrupted and broken, by every street that should fall in the way, and by every petty corporation that should lie in the direction of her improvements.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-8\">In no sense can the act impair the contracts existing between the rail-road company and the districts. The contract with the district of Kensington for the use of the former location of the road, and to pay a certain sum, while they use the same, and if they cease to occupy the street, the contract to be at an end, cannot be said to be impaired by the company ceasing to use that under an act to construct another road, any more than without an act or without any other road; nor is there any other contract in existence which can in any manner be impaired or affected by the act of assembly in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-9\">And in reply to the last error assigned, it is sufficient to say that the judges of the Court of Quarter Sessions of the County of Philadelphia, are referred to, in the act, <em>with </em>reference <em>to the </em>judicial character in which they were to act. And acting in a public and judicial character, it required the attendance of no greater number than would legally constitute a quorum. By article 5, sec. 7, of the constitution of Pennsylvania, the judges of the Court of Common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Pleas of each county, any two of whom shall be a quorum, shall compose the Court of Quarter Sessions of the peace.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-6\">It is enacted by the act of 1802, that <em>the justices </em>of the Court of Quarter Sessions in' each county, on petition, may grant views of roads, &amp;c., and it never has been doubted but two might legally act. <em>Purdon, </em>ed. 1830, p. 792. 5 <em>Binn. </em>481. 6 <em>Serg. Rawle, </em>170.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b41-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b41-8\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOZ\">A certiorari lies in all judicial proceedings in which a writ of error does not lie; and being a substitute for a writ of error, it is governed by the same, or strictly analogous, principles: consequently no point can be raised on it which is not apparent exclusively in the proceedings removed by it. Though not peculiar to road cases, this principle was enforced in the case of the <em>Schuylkill Falls Road, </em>(2 <em>Binney, </em>250;) of <em>Penn's Grove and </em>\u25a0 <em>Concord Road, </em>(4 <em>Yeates, </em>372;) and of <em>Spring Garden street, </em>(4 <em>Rawle, </em>194:) in all which this court refused to enter into the merits, or to decide facts on depositions. One exception alone has been made to it. In the <em>Case of the Baltimore Turnpike, </em>(5 <em>Binney, </em>484,) evidence was heard in <em>support </em>of the proceedings on a point which perhaps did not need it; as all presumptions favourable to regularity may be made in consistence with the record. The exceptions in the case before us, have been framed in disregard of the general rule. In the twenty-six points raised by them, I discern few that are legitimate subjects of re-examination; and as we sit here, not to settle abstract principles, but to determine matters which lie in the course of our functions, my first business will be to cast out such of them as are not determinable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">It is obvious that the fourth, fifth and sixth exceptions, and also the ninth, with its eight specifications, belong to the rejected class. The supposed misleading of parties by the advertisement; the alleged misconduct of the jury in refusing to hear the owners of property and their witnesses in support of their objections and claim to damages ; are matters that do not appear by the record: by reason of which, even were there substance in them, we would be compelled to dismiss them. We do not find, however, that the act by which the proceeding was directed, authorised the jury, or any one else, to assess damages; and objections to the route on the ground of policy or convenience, they were to determine, not on the testimony of witnesses, but on their own view, as was decided in <em>Johnson's case, </em>(2 <em>Wharton\u2019s Rep. </em>277.) The judges of the Quarter Sessions, as they had not viewed, might indeed have satisfied themselves of the propriety of the location by the information of others; but that they were satisfied without it, is not ground of error examinable here. The ninth exception, also, with its specifications, by which is alleged that the reported route agrees not with the directions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>act, depends on facts of which we judicially know nothing; nor would they perhaps avail the exceptants if they were properly before us. We perceive not that the act requires the assent of the districts to the location; nor did it appear on the diagram exhibited at the argument that the road is not laid upon streets between the depots ; and that it is not another rail-road upon another route; or that it is partly on private property. It may, as alleged, be partly on the track laid down under an agreement with the district of the Northern Liberties; but what of that! A part of that track may, notwithstanding, be on \u201c the best route along the streets between the said depots;\u201d and the act requires no more. As to its being laid on the track of the Northern Liberties and Penn Township Rail Road, the interference .might be made a subject of complaint by that company, but certainly by no one else; and the complaint could be heard only by the court below, no other tribunal having power to investigate the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The same remarks may be applied to three specifications of the allegation contained in the tenth exception. Of contracts made by the company with the exceptants or the Northern Liberties and Penn Township Rail Road Company, we judicially know nothing; and we cannot test the constitutionality of the statute by an allegation of matters which cannot legitimately appear in the proceedings or in our paper books. From the copies furnished, they appear to be contracts for privileges purchased in other streets; and the law does not disturb them. If they bound the company originally, they bind it still, and the parties may still have an action for any breach of the company\u2019s engagements. None of these matters, however, are subjects of revision by us; and I turn to those which properly belong to us, premising that most of them may be despatched in a few words.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">The first exception\u2014that the jury of view was not appointed pursuant to an' authorised application by the company\u2014seems not to be founded in fact. They were appointed on the motion of the company\u2019s solicitor; and were it not so, the manner of the appointment is a matter to which the exceptants cannot make objection, since the company\u2019s ratification of the appointment by claiming under it, is equivalent to a precedent authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">The second is, that the road was located by the jury instead of the company. In the act it is said that the company shall locate, and that the court may approve on a jury\u2019s report; but how the inhabitants could be prejudiced by allowing the act of location to be performed by the jury instead of the company\u2019s officers, has not been shown. It is not to be credited that the jury would be less disinterested and regardful of \u201c the public business, trade, and private property\u201d of the inhabitants,' than the company itself would be. It was the privilege of the company to make the location by its officers; and in surrendering it to the jury it renounced a benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>provided for it, which a common -law maxim too trite to be repeated, authorised it to do. Even were that not so, the jury might be considered as its agent, having made the location by its direction, as evidenced by its subsequent ratification of the act. The question before the court, however, regarded not the paternity of the location but the propriety of it. Not only the court, but the jury were to be satisfied of the propriety of the latter; and it is' not probable that the jury would have been as well satisfied with the propriety of any other, as with their own. The exception at best depends on a literal interpretation ,\u25a0 and it is not to be favoured.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The third is, that the jury were not sworn by the authority of the ' court, or in the terms prescribed by the law. What terms 1 The act itself prescribed none: nor did it direct the jurors to be sworn at all. And yet it is stated in the report that they were sworn or affirmed according to law; and as nothing in the record contradicts it, we are to take it as it is stated. It was provided that the jury should be appointed \u201c as directed \u201d\u2014and here the sentence was left incomplete by the omission of something intended to have be\u00e9n sub-, j.oined; but what that was, cannot be conjectured. In the case of <em>Adelphi Street, </em>(2 <em>Wharton\u2019s Rep. </em>176,) a proceeding to vacate a street, was held to be within the purview of a preceding section to vacate a particular alley, which was directed to be in the usual manner; and this on the ground that there were general principles of practice in laying out and vacating streets, to which the legislature must have referred.\" That-practice, however, has no relation to the proceeding before us which is <em>sui generis. </em>That it-was not intended to be regulated by the road law, is clear from the fact that no petition for a view was required; nor was there to be an order to view, because the jury were to act on being applied to, and consequently without a particular mandate. As then no oath was prescribed, it is not necessary that the jurors should have been sworn qt all; and this disposes also of the eighth exception that the court had not allowed, in conformity to the general road law, two full terms betwixt the appointment of the jury -and the confirmation of their report. <em>\u201e</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">The remaining exception is more important, because it calls in N question, for specific reasons, the validity of the statute which is the <em>\u25a0 </em>foundation of the proceeding, and which is said to be unconstitutional because it impairs the obligation of contracts; by violating the | chartered rights of the districts of Spring Garden and the Northern I Liberties; by violating the contract under which the right qf pass- f age is assured to the inhabitants of this particular street; by taking the property of the street without compensation to the districts of individual proprietors; and by monopolising the street in derogation of the public and private uses to which it had been applied. This, perhaps, is the substance of all these multifarious specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">What is the dominion of the public over such a street! In Eng<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>land, a highway is the property of the king as <em>parens patriae, </em>or universal trustee; in Pennsylvania, it is the property of the people, not\u2019of a particular district, but of the whole state; who, constituting as they do the legitimate sovereign, may dispose of it by their representatives, and at their pleasure. Highways, therefore, being [ universally the property of the state, are subject to its absolute direc- f tion and control. An exclusive right of ferriage across a navigable Stream, which is a public highway, is grantable only by it; and the navigation of the stream may be impeded or broken up by it at its pleasure. In the construction of her system of improvements, Pennsylvania has acted on this principle. Her dams across her principal rivers to feed her canals, have injured if they have not destroyed the , descending navigation by the natural channels; and this without a suspicion of want of constitutional power. The right of passage by ^ land or by water, is a franchise which she holds in trust for all her j citizens, but'over which she holds despotic sway, the remedy for an I abuse of it being a change of rulers and a consequent change of the law. No person, natural or corporate, has an exclusive interest in the trust, unless she has granted it to him. Her right extends even to the soil, being an equivalent for the six per cent, thrown into every public grant as compensation for what may be reclaimed for roads; and she has acted on the basis of it; for though damages for special injuries to improvements have been-allowed by the general road laws, nothing has been given for the use of the ground. This principle was broadly asserted in the <em>Commonwealth v. Fisher, </em>(1 <em>Penns. Rep. </em>466.)</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Such being a highway as a subject of legislative authority, in what respect is a street in an incorporated town to be distinguished from it? A municipal corporation is a separate community; and hence a notion that it stands in relation to its streets as the state stands in relation to the highways of its territory. That would make it sovereign within its precincts\u2014a cons\u00e9quence-notto be pretended. The owner of a town plot lays out his streets as he sees fit, or the owner of ground in an incorporated town, dedicates it to ; public use as a street; but it follows not that the dominion of the state <em>t </em>is not instantly attached to it. The general road law extends to every incorporated town from which it is not excluded by provision of the charter; and the statute book is full of special acts for opening, widening, altering, or vacating streets and alleys in Philadelphia and our other cities. Were it not for the universality of the \u2022 public sovereignty, the public lines of communication, by rail-roads and canals, might be cut by the authority of every petty borough through which they pass; a doctrine to which Pennsylvania cannot submit, and which it would be dangerous to urge. It would be strange, therefore, were the streets of an incorporated town, not public highways, subject perhaps to corporate regulation for purposes of grading, curbing, and paving; but subject also to the paramount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>authority of the legislature in the regulation of their use by carriages, rail-cars, or means of locomotion yet to be invented, and this without distinction between the inhabitants and their fellow-citizens elsewhere. The doctrine was carried to its extent in <em>Rung </em>v. <em>Shoenberger, </em>(2 <em>Watts, </em>23,) in which it was affirmed that, though a city has a qualified property in its public squares, it holds them as a trustee for the public for whose use the ground was originally left open; and that the enjoyment of them is equally free to all the inhabitants- of the commonwealth, subject to regulations not inconsistent with the grant. In <em>Barter </em>v. <em>The Commonwealth, </em>(3 <em>Penns. Rep. </em>259,) it was inadvertently-said that the title to the soil of a street'is in the corporation, whose right to improve it for purposes which conduce to the public enjoyment of it, is exclusive and paramount to the right of an inhabitant. The point was only incidentally involved, and consequently not very particularly considered; but the question of title, involving as it has done, no more than the bounds of the grant, has lain between the grantor and the grantee, or those deriving title from them. In no case has title been claimed by the corporation. In the <em>Union Burial Ground Company </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>(5 <em>Whart. </em>18,) in which the point was elaborately argued, the contest was betwixt the grantor and a purchaser from the grantee; and though the cause was eventually decided on another ground, the court inclined to think, on the authority of many-decisions, that the title to the street, even had it been opened, would have remained in the grantor; and such' appeal's to be the principle of <em>Kirkham </em>v. <em>Sharp, </em>(1 <em>Whart. Rep. </em>323.) The legal title to the ground, therefore, remains in him who owned it before the street was laid out; but even that is an immaterial consideration; for an adverse right of soil could not impair the public right of way over it, or prevent the legislature from modifying, abridging, or enlarging its use, whether the title were in the corporation or a stranger. I take itj <em>\u00b6 </em>then that the regulation of a street is given to a corporation only for|| corporate purposes, and subject to the paramount authority of the|!' state in respect to its general and moi\u2019e extended uses; and that Sl there would have been no invasion of chartered rights in this instance, even did either of these districts stand in a relation to the public, which would impart to its charter the qualities of a compact.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">What then is the interest of an individual inhabitant as a subject of compensation under the constitutional injunction that private property be not taken by a corporation for public usewithout it? Even;, agreeing that his ground extends to the middle of the street, the-public have a right of way over it. Neither the part used for the | street, nor the part occupied by himself, is taken away from him;\u00bb and as it was dedicated to public use without restriction, he is not within the benefit of the constitutional prohibition, which extends not to matters of mere annoyance. The injury of which he can complain, is not direct but .consequential. It consists either in an ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>struction of his right of passage, which is personal; or in a depreciation of his property by decreasing the enjoyment of it: but no part of it is taken from him and acquired by the company. The prohibition, even when it precluded a seizure of private property immediately by the state, was not largely interpreted, nor was there reason that it should be, as ample compensation was obtained from her sense of justice without it. The sufferers were overpaid, and this sort of aggression was always courted as a favour. But though she usually compensated consequential damage, it was of favour, not of right. Nor did she always make such compensation. In one well known instance, she destroyed a ferry by cutting off access to the shore, without provision for the sufferer; and in the <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richter, </em>(1 <em>Penns. Rep. </em>467,) damages were unavailingly claimed from her for flooding a spring by a dam. The clause in the amended constitution which narrows the former prohibition to a taking of private property for a public use by a corporation, is to \\ receive the same'construction; the word \u2018 taking \u2019 being interpreted to \\ mean, taking the property altogether; not a consequential injury <em>\\ </em>to it which is no taking at all. For compensation of the latter, the <em>\\ citizen </em>must depend on the forecast and justice of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">On the subject of the next specification, it seems scarcely necessary to say that monopolies are not prohibited by the constitution; and that to abolish them, would destroy many of our most useful institutions. Every grant of privileges so far as it goes, is exclusive ; and every exclusive privilege is a monopoly. Not only is every rail-road, turnpike, or canal such, but every bank, college, hospital, asylum, or church, is a monopoly; and the ten thousand beneficial societies incorporated by the executive on the certificates of their legality,by the attorney general and judges of the Supreme Court, are all monopolies. Nor does it seem more necessary to remark, on the subject of the concluding specifications, of exception to the confirmation ofthe report by the associate judges of the sessions alone, that the approval was an act of the court; and that they were competent to hold it.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Proceedings affirmed-</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
