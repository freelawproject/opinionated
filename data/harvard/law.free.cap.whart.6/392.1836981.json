In 1795, R. M. and others conveyed to J. N. and J.

N. and J. B., the trustees, should convey to certain persons named, for the purposes of sale, &amp;c., and <em>on </em>making such conveyance should be held harmless and blameless for any acts, &amp;c. In 1808, J. N. conveyed all his estate in the land pursuant to the agreement; but J. B. refused to convey, and died in 1816, having survived J. N.; and leaving as his heir at law J. M. B.; who on being applied to, refused to convey, alleging that he did not know how far the trust had been accepled and acted upon; that he had never accepted the trust; and that he had by an instrument under seal, which was recorded, renounced the trust and declared that he would not intermeddle with it. On a bill against J. M. B. to compel the conveyance of the legal estate, there being some evidence that J.

Is the respondent such trustee <em>1 </em>We say he is.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-8\">1. The legal estate was in John Barclay at the time of his death. This is charged by the bill and not denied by the answer, which merely alleges that it is <em>unknown </em>to the respondent how far the trust was accepted and acted upon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-9\">In the absence of proof, the presumption is that a trustee does accept the trust. <em>Wilt </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>(1 <em>Binn. </em>502.) <em>Lewin on Trustees, </em>114, 118, The respondent\u2019s offer to convey in 1818, goes far to show a previous acceptance by his father.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-10\">2. John Barclay then having accepted the trust, arid having survived his co-trustee John Nixon, such portion of the legal estate as did not pass by the conveyance of the latter on the 27th of April, 1808, vested in him alone; and on his death in 1816, descended upon his heir at law, the respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-11\">3. The legal estate being thus shown to have been vested in the respondent in 1816, the question arises whether it has been divested by the renunciation executed by him on the 9th of April,' 1832.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-12\">It is well settled that where a party has once accepted a trust, either in fact, or by operation of law, he cannot afterwards discharge himself from it by a simple renunciation. <em>Lewin on Trustees, </em>132, 133. <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>(2 <em>Sch. </em>&amp; <em>Lef. </em>245.) <em>Chalmer </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>(1 <em>Jac. </em>&amp; <em>Walker, </em>68.) 4 <em>Johns.

The representatives of Morris, Nicholson and Greenleaf, should be made parties to the bill. It does not appear upon the face of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>deeds creating the trust, that any shareholders in the North American Land Company are in existence, nor is there any proof of the fact, except that which may have been afforded by the production of the alleged company\u2019s books before the master. Upon this point the representatives of the grantors have a right to be heard; for in case no such shareholders exist, there is a resulting trust in favour of those representatives. If this were a trust created by a will, the heir at law would certainly be made a party.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-6\">2. The next question is, whether this court will decree a conveyance of lands <em>without </em>its jurisdiction. It is said that full chancery jurisdiction over the subject-matter is given by the 13th section of the act of 16th June, 1836. But we apprehend that the act of 22d March, 1825, <em>(Purd. </em>998-9,) establishes the system which has prevailed in Pennsylvania, according to which when a new trustee is to be appointed, it is done by decree only, without a conveyance from the party. Now if this conveyance be made by the respondent, on his being found within the jurisdiction of the courts in the / states where the lands lie, they might compel him to convey over <em>' </em>again, and he might be exposed to serious inconvenience.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-8\">In all the English cases cited, where a conveyance has been decreed of lands out of England, it has been where the lands were in a subordinate jurisdiction\u2014as in the colonies, or in Ireland; but we ask to be shown a decree of conveyance of lands in France, or other foreign country, as that alone would be a case analogous to the present.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-9\">3. The respondent has never acted in the trust, and no one is ever compelled to undertake a trust. <em>Lewin on Trustees, </em>525. The acceptance of John Barclay does not sufficiently appear, for though alleged in the bill, and not denied by the answer, the fact should be proved. This is the more important as being (after what has been intimated by the court) the point on which the whole case will probably turn; for if the trust did vest in John Barclay, it must be admitted that it descended upon the respondent, and he cannot avoid executing it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b398-10\">Mrl <em>B. Tilghman </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-11\">1. As to the necessity of making Morris, Nicholson and Greenleaf\u2019s representatives, parties to the bill, we reply, that they can have no interest, being estopped by the conveyances creating the trust. We have shown that their conveyances became fully operative, and that the North American Land Company existed, by showing the acts of more than two-thirds of the stockholders of that company, representing 17,132 shares of its stock, in 1806 and 1807. This proof furnished by the Examiner\u2019s Report has not been, and could not be, excepted to, and the facts are of course to be taken as true. The company thus existing, and having paid for the lands in question, are the only parties beneficially interested, and there is, of course, no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>resulting trust in favour of the heirs of Morris or the other grantors. This also appears by the fact that Greenleaf, one of the grantors, in 1818 requested the respondent to convey, according to the resolutions of the company mentioned in the bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-6\">2. As to the jurisdiction of the court. If the act of 1836 was not intended to enlarge the power conferred upon this court by the act of 1825, why was it made at all? The word \u201c control,\u201d in the act of 1836, is of most extensive signification; and as applied to a trustee, will at least reach the ordinary case of compelling him to execute a clear and undisputed trust.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-7\">As to the inconvenience which the respondent might suffer from \u25a0 making this conveyance, by being made amenable to the courts of other states, the decree of this court would surely be his protection. The English authorities are not confined to cases of lands -in subordinate jurisdictions. In <em>Lord Cranston </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>(3 <em>Vesey Jr. </em>170,) the case of lands in a <em>\u201c </em>foreign country,\u201d as distinguished from the \u201c British dominions,\u201d is expressly stated by the court to be included in the general rule. See also 2d <em>Paige, </em>606, before cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-8\">3. There is ample proof of the acceptance of the trust by John Barclay. Thomas Willing renounced at once in writing. In 1808, when John Nixon and John Barclay are called upon to convey, Nixon conveys, and Barclay refuses to convey. This refusal is an act under the trust. If he had not accepted, or if he had disclaimed the trust, he should then have said so. The admission by the respondent of his willingness to convey, in 1818, is an admission that the trust was then in him, which could not have been unless it had been accepted by his father. Then the presumption of law is, that a trustee accepts. Any ambiguity in his conduct will create such presumption.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b399-9\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b399-10\">Gibson, C. J.\u2014All</author>\n<p id=\"Axo\">the unconfessed parts of the bill are directly proved but the acceptance of the trust by the respondent\u2019s ancestor. To supplythe evidence of that, recourse is had to the doctrine of implied acceptance, which, however, is applicable only to a conveyance of the beneficial interest, and not to the conveyance of a dry title loaded with a trust. But is not presumptive evidence of acceptances afforded, in this instance, by the circumstances and nature of the case? The deed to the original.trustees was executed in 1795, and Mr. Barclay, being requested, in 1808, to join in a conveyance to new trustees designated in an amendment of the original articles, does what? Denies that he had accepted the trust? No such matter. He refuses to convey without assigning any reason for it that w\u00e9 perceive; and had he not accepted, the trust before, every principle of duty would have called on him to disclaim it then. That he had left the company thirteen years, under a belief that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>one of its trustees, is evident from its call on him to discharge himself of the imputed trust; and the existence of such a belief, undisturbed by one who could have been no stranger to it, is evidence to charge him. From the very course of such matters, a presumption arises that the deed was presented to him, as it was to Mr. Nixon and Mr. Willing, in order to complete the execution of it by delivery ; and as he expressly accepted it, or expressly rejected it then, the company could have been under no misapprehension of the state of the fact; and if it knew that he had rejected it, why call on him for a conveyance in 1807, or why this bill? There is, then,at least a spark of evidence that Mr. Barclay took on himself the burthen of the trust; and to raise a doubt on the subject, is to make out-the complainant\u2019s case. What harm can befall the respondent, or what responsibility can he incur from conveying without a covenant against any thing but acts done, or incumbrances suffered by himself? By the amendment adverted to, it was agreed \u201cthat the said John Nixon and John Barclay, on making such competent conveyances or transfers, forever after be held harmless and blameless for any, and all, neglects or pretended neglects, and for any and all doings, which may have happened or accrued while they were considered the trustees of the company.\u201d Now if the trust descended on the respondent\u2019s shoulders, this conventional aegis necessarily descended on them along with it. But even without protection from that, or from the direction of a court of chancery, to whom could he become answerable for the execution of such a conveyance ? Not to the company who instigated him to do the act; nor yet to the company\u2019s equitable grantee who could not be prejudiced by it. The complainants, therefore, seek to impose on him no heavy or unconscionable burthen. This company, like many <em>others </em>formed about the same time, was a partnership for the purpose of dealing in land; and a suspicion of the soundness of its title would be as ruinous to its business, as would a suspicion of insolvency be to the credit of a mercantile firm. Without the relief sought by the bill, the title to its land would appear to be imperfect on the face of it; and as this blemish can be removed without detriment or inconvenience to any one, we are bound to consider the respondent\u2019s ancestor to have been an original trustee; and that point being established, a decree to convey is of course.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Decreed accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
