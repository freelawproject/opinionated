S.\u201d (the defendant). In point of fact the building was situate on the west side of 13th street between <em>Callowhill </em>and <em>James </em>\u25a0streets. Callowhill street intervenes between Vine and James streets. <em>Held, </em>that the description was sufficiently certain; the defendant having no other house in that street.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-8\">Error to the District Court for the City and County of \u2022 Philadelphia.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-9\">. In the court below a claim was filed by Keyser &amp; Longstreth, under the Mechanics-Lien law, on the 15th of July, 1834, against Charles Springer, for lumber and hauling, alleged to have been obtained for, and delivered upon the credit of a building, described as follows: \u201c A certain two-story brick building, situate on the west side of 13th street, between <em>Vine </em>and <em>James </em>streets, in the county of Philadelphia, belonging, or said to belong to Charles Springer.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-10\">Annexed to the claim was the following bill.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-11\">\u201cPhiladelphia, July 15th, 1834.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A_0\">Mr. Charles Springer to Keyser &amp; Longstreth, Dr. To amount of sundry lumber, as per bill rendered, up to April 25th,' 1834, $292 83.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-14\">Upon this claim a <em>scire facias </em>was issued against Charles Springer and terre-tenants. Upon the trial it was proved by the plaintiffs below, that the building in question was situate on the west side of 13th street, between <em>Callowhill </em>and <em>James </em>streets, and not between <em>Vine </em>and <em>James </em>streets, as stated in the claim!

In <em>Harker </em>v. <em>Thorn, </em>also, there was an intervening street ealled Quince street, (though that appears not in the report;) and the description was held to be certain enough. It is sufficient that the owner appears not to have had any other house in the particular street; for the claim could be applied to no other; and the law requires no more than that the property be described with convenient certainty. <em>The </em>other points have not been seriously pressed; nor were they even made below,</p>\n<p id=\"b188-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
