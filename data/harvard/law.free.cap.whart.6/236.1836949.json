We claim for both plaintiffs on the ground of intestacy, and as heirs at law. The real estate is in back lands and city lots, to a large extent unproductive, The inconvenience would be great, if locked up. The will is inartificially drawn. The first objection is, that the will does not pass the real estate. No case shows, that by the words <em>worldly goods </em>real estate passes: and nothing in the will extends their interpretation. The only word that looks so is <em>rents: </em>but personalty will produce rents. There are no words of devise applicable to real estate. They are to be a <em>general </em>fund, which is not applicable to realty. Johnson defines it a bank or stock of money, contrasted with substantial acres. It means public money invested\u2014 public funds. It is to be kept by the executors, whose province is the personalty, \u2018 I make my wife executor of my goods and lands,\u2019 held not to pass real estate. So the codicil calls the share a sum\u2014 a legacy. At the end of the 100 years, when to be divided, no term is used, denoting real estate; nor by any exceptions, does he imply he means real estate. <em>Ram on Wills, </em>257, the heir at law has the elder and better title till supplanted by express words or necessary implication. This rule is stronger in Pennsylvania, as the effects are equally divided: and here by the will, two branches are cut off. This rule is recognised in <em>2 Binn. </em>20. 3 <em>Binn. </em>480, if the intention is doubtful, the heir takes. 2 <em>Sir. </em>909, necessary implication must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>from words showing the plain intent of the testator. Here we say, there is none such. <em>Co. Lit. </em>118, <em>b. </em>no estate of freehold or inheritance is comprehended under the words <em>bona </em>or <em>catalla. Brown </em>v. <em>Dysinger, </em>(1 <em>Rawle, </em>409,) \u201c respecting any earthly property,\u201d at p. 413, 415, held not to be intended to include lands, being no words of limitation or perpetuity. <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>(3 <em>East, </em>516,) words \u201cpersonal effects.\u201d <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>(3 <em>Bos. &amp; Pul. </em>375.) 1 <em>Wils. </em>333. Coods and chattels will carry lands, if explained by the testator. 2 <em>W. </em>65. <em>Goods, </em>not so extensive as chattels or effects, which by themselves, have been held not to carry real estate. 1 <em>Lev. </em>130. \u201cI give all to my mother,\u201d lands won\u2019t pass. <em>Finch. Pr. Ch. </em>491. Testator makes one executor of all his goods, lands and chattels; held not to pass lands. 6 <em>Term Rep. </em>610, all the rest of his estate and effects of what nature, &amp;c. to A. and B.,. their executors, &amp;c. to accumulate, lands held not to pass, in consequence of the channel it was put into. So here it is to executors to be elected by the heirs. <em>Ram on Wills, </em>31. 1 <em>Swanst. </em>201. 1 <em>Ves. dp B. </em>466. Lord Eldon says, conjecture is not to be taken for implication : the latter can be only from necessity, necessary implication. 5 <em>Term Rep. </em>558. 2 <em>Prest. Est. </em>178; <em>lb. </em>129, shows that the word <em>estate </em>used in the codicil, is not an operative word. <em>Portion </em>would do as well. It cannot add to the strength of the will. There is no devise to the executors ; it is only to be put under their care. The legal estate descends to the heirs, no words being used to pass a title to the realty. The trust is only as to what comes into their hands. He does not say the executors are to divide the rents and profits. If personalty, it would of course come to them. Till the act of 1792, a power of sale to executors did not pass them the title. 3 <em>W. </em>291. Here is no power of sale\u2014only a power to take care of the lands, which does not pass the title; and the act of assembly does not apply. 1 <em>Pow. Dev. </em>233, shows, that the common law was, that there was only a naked authority. In <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Hammond, (Comyn\u2019s Rep. </em>232,) it was held a mere recital did not amount to a \u25a0devise. So here there is as to the executors a mere recital. Therefore I say, the heirs take the real estate and are to divide the rents and profits; the executors take the personalty, and are to divide its rents and profits.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-6\">2. If the will is operative as real estate, then it vests in the testator\u2019s children for life, with remainders over in fee to their children. So that the plaintiffs, Bradfords, (their father having died in the lifetime of the testator and before the-will,). have an immediate right. 3 <em>Rep. </em>459, a devise of rents and profits gives the fee. By the act of 8th April, 1833, sec. 9, <em>(Purd. </em>1033,) a fee passes without words of perpetuity, unless the contrary intention appears. By the devise to the children after a parent\u2019s death, (the devise for 100 years <em>being </em>void,) they take a fee. The restriction is to those of the name of Bradford, lineally descended from him, which is to. a fewer set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>as purchasers. Till then all claim that are descended from him. <em>Roney </em>v. <em>Stiltz, (5 Wharton\u2019s Rep. </em>381.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-6\">3. The limitation over to the lineal descendants of the name of Bradford, is a perpetuity and void, and therefore the grandchildren, if entitled in fee, come in now. 2 <em>Pow. Dev. </em>230. Objects of substituted bequest must come <em>in esse, </em>in order to divest prior estate, where they are to take on a contingency. An executory devise must vest within a life or lives in being or twenty-one years after. 1 <em>Cox\u2019s Rep. </em>324. 7 <em>Bligh\u2019s New Rep. </em>202, 239. Supposing this a term of 100 years to the executors, yet there is no limitation that the devisees are to take within the legal term of twenty-one years, &amp;c. but may go beyond it. 2 <em>Mer. </em>363, 3'88, Lord Chancellor. <em>Garret </em>v. <em>Rex, </em>(6 <em>Watts, </em>14,) bequest of income is bequest of fund. 2 <em>Pow.

The main question is, whether lands passed by the will. All the clauses and words of the will and codicil are to be considered, and the intent of the testator arrived at, which is the polar star. 2 <em>W. Bl. </em>444. 450. 2 <em>Prest.

If the will passes real estate, then they have a term of 100 years. It is not now important who takes after them. In any event the trust would not fail for want of a trustee. Is the estate conveyed a perpetuity? The length of the term in trustees does not create this, when to subserve trusts. Perpetuity is as to <em>cestui que trusts. </em>If not, 100 years is not <em>ex vi termini, </em>a perpetuity. <em>Gore </em>v. <em>Gore, </em>(2 <em>P. W. </em>28.) 1 <em>P. W. </em>332, good so far as within the time, bad beyond. 2 <em>Bro. Ch. Cas, </em>51. 2 <em>Prest. Ab. </em>168, to the unborn child of a person in being, is good. This would take not only chil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>dren of the four living at the testator\u2019s death, but those born after. And this was what .the chancellor was speaking of, in 2. <em>Mer. </em>363, cited by Mr. Price. The devise was inseparable. There is no executory devise here except the limitation over after the 100 years. 3 <em>Term Rep. </em>86. <em>Cowp. </em>656. 2 <em>Prest.

If, .as is said, the object of the testator was to gratify his pride and ambition, by making his lineal descendants, of his name, rich one hundred years hence,- that would only be gratified by the advance of his back lands. His personal estate would be worn out or lost by this time. \u201c Rents \u201d is the peculiar term applicable to the income and profits of real estate. By a devise of rents the land passes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-10\">2. No particular language is necessary to create a trust. ' <em>Lewin Trust. </em>44. The direction here that the property should be put under the care of the executors, and kept as a general fund, and they should distribute and liquidate debts, creates them trustees, and gives such an estate in them as gives them a title to present possession, which is sufficient now. <em>Fletch. Trust, 2. </em>Where the intention is clear, an estate in the trustees will be implied, to effect the desire of the testator. 1 <em>Pr. Wms. </em>505. <em>Fletch. </em>23. 1 <em>Eden's Ch\u2022 </em>119. 3 <em>Bos, Sp Pul. </em>178. 1 <em>Eden's Rep. </em>36, and note, containing a collection of the cases. Then as to the extent of the estate of the trustees, the doctrine is, that they must be construed to take an estate as large as is necessary for the purposes of the trust, and commensurate with the duties imposed upon them. <em>Fletch. </em>23, and cases. 3 <em>Barn. &amp;p Aid. </em>537. By the act of 24th February, 1834, \u00a7 12, all powers not given by will to any one, are to be deemed to be given to executors. Sect. 13 gives title to executors to remedy by action, &amp;c. Sect. 14 gives surviving executors power. Sect. 67 extended to administrators with will annexed. The children of Samuel, by the act of 1833, are placed in the same situation as the father. <em>Newbold </em>v. <em>Pritchett, </em>(2 <em>Wharton, </em>49,) decides that the father is still a <em>propositus </em>from whom the children are to claim: so that the children of Samuel would stand as he did. Theil there is a devise to the children, with a remainder to the grandchildren. So far, it is unquestionably good.' Supposing, as perhaps is the case, Samuel dying in testator\u2019s life, his life estate expired, then his children took in their own right. 2 <em>Cruise, </em>260, tit. xvi. <em>Rem. </em>ib. 269, 270, that a remainder for life expectant on an estate for life, is a vested remainder. The grand-children <em>in esse, </em>at the testator\u2019.s death, took a vested remainder for life. As to those not <em>in esse, </em>it would be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>good contingent remainder, there being a freehold to support it. If the legal estate is in trustees, there need not be a freehold to support it; if is then an executory devise. So that whether there is an executory devise or contingent remainder, the grandchildren take; they must be in existence within a life or lives in being, and twenty-one years after. This is sufficient for the parties claiming \u25a0now under the will. 1 <em>Eden's Rep. </em>124, 125, limitation in trust has the same construction as an estate executed. Then as to the future limitations one hundred years hence, we need not inquire; they may be bad, yet the present one is good. Even if the term in trust is bad, yet the rights of the <em>cestui que trusts </em>are not destroyed. <em>Will. Trust. </em>82, that the legal estate remains in the trustees, though some of the trusts are void, if- some are valid. For the former he holds for the heir at law. 1 <em>Pr. Wms. </em>332, conveyance shall be <em>cy pres </em>to the first for life, and the next in tail <em>2 Eden\u2019s Rep. 330, </em>1 ib. 404. 5 <em>Barn, Aid. </em>801, two first estates held good, and subsequent limitations void. 3 <em>Mer. 363, </em>cited by Mr, Price, is a case where the parties waited till the first good estate had expired.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-7\">Mr. <em>Meredith </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-8\">1. 10 <em>Ves. </em>466. 1 <em>Ball. Sf Beatty, </em>542. 6 <em>Term Rep. </em>610, show that the .state of the testator\u2019s property forms no ground for deciding on a will. But this is not important here, because the situation of the testator\u2019s property is not before us. No words will pass property in a will which would not in a deed. 12 <em>Serg. Rawle-, 270,2 Watts, 65. </em>The difference between them is as <em>to limitations, bat </em>not as to the description of the property. There is no case in Pennsylvania in which the mere term <em>goods </em>has been <em>held to </em>pass real estate-; something else has existed to give it such a construction. What else is there here 1 If rents and profits carry real estate, then it is devised immediately to the children, to be divided among them, and the executors have nothing to do with it; and the income of the personal must accumulate. It is a separate devise. But this would be a strained construction; the whole must be read together, and the words rent and profits mean merely the income of what he- had previously bequeathed, and do not extend it. Rent popularly may proceed from personal estate. Testators may have chattels real. Personalty might be invested by executors in real estate. The word estate, used in the codicil includes any kind of property. In the intestate act of February 3d, 1834, \u00a7 2, the word estate is applied to personal property, and all through the act, and in legal proceedings, means either real or personal. If you strike it out, it don\u2019t vary the phrase or effect of it; and this is the test laid down by Mr. Preston, 2 <em>Prest. Est. </em>129; against this term we have to set off expressions and directions wholly irreconcileable with it. In <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Buckner, </em>(6 <em>Term Rep. </em>613,) the court relied on the direction that <em>interest, </em>&amp;c, was to be consolidated to make one sum. There the same word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>sum is used, and they are to be kept as a general fond, which real estate can\u2019t be. It is also to be under the care of executors, which brings the case within that in Finch, there being no words of inheritance. The exceptions mentioned in the will to be provided for, are all of personal estate. Again, at the end of the one hundred years, the whole is to be equally divided, meaning paid. The term, \u201cas it becomes due,\u201d don\u2019t apply to real, estate. There is no power to the executors to rent or sell the real estate, or do any thing with it. It all applies to personalty in respect to which the executorship is to be continued by administrators <em>de bonis non, </em>chosen in a way somewhat different from the law. This case is not like those cited, in which introductory words were used, or express disinheritance of some of the children. No intention is expressed to disinherit the Flin-. thams and Darrachs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-6\">2. If the wall embraces lands, what is the interest in S. F. Bradford\u2019s children <em>1 </em>There is no estate given to the executors. The case in 3 <em>Burr. </em>1684, is where there is an express direction that the trustees and his heirs should annually pay the legacies, should repair, &amp;c. Here are no words of inheritance, nor directions to repair, unless it be implied from first implying they were trustees, which I deny can Be done. The case in 3 <em>Bos. Pul. </em>cited, lay? down the rule that trust is implied when something is to be done by executors. The same rule, 1 <em>Eden, </em>36, 3 <em>Barn. </em>&lt;$\u2022 <em>Rid, </em>537, (5 <em>Eng. Com. Law </em>Rep. 358.) But here if the devise is of the real estate, there is nothing to be done; it.is to be divided. 1 say the trust estate is void, because the beneficial estates are illegal as a perpetuity, and the heirs at law have the immediate right as a trust executed. The estates devised are life estates to the children, with remainders in fee simple to the grandchildren. Therefore, S. F. Bradford\u2019s children are entitled to recover. <em>Davy </em>v. <em>Stephens, (Doug. </em>320,) oil a devise to one and his ,children, he takes an estate tail. But under an act of assembly, all devises (no contrary intention being expressed,) carry a fee simple. That contrary intention must be a legal intention. <em>Dunn </em>v. Taylor, (18 <em>Eng. Com. Law Rep. </em>457.) Under <em>Stehman </em>v. <em>Stehman, </em>(1 <em>Watts, </em>466,) this.would be a vested remainder;, that is, the estate would open to let in after-born children. S. P. 2 <em>Pow. Dev. </em>304. Therefore the learning.of contingent remainders and executory devises is unnecessary, and no trust is necessary to support contingent remainders. The worst that could happen would be to make it an estate tail; and if so, it is a matter of no consequence. The objection to their immediate right is, that the testator has declared it shall be inalienable, in order to create a perpetuity; which the law forbids. No duty is imposed on the trustees; it is simply that the rents and profits shall be divided among the children. If the children have only an estate for life, it is sufficient to enable them to recover.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b244-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b244-6\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkT0\">Though any expressions in a.will may perform the office of technical terms, the intention must be manifest, and rest on something more certain than conjecture. This is the sum of the matter, as it is stated by Lord Kenyon, in <em>Hay </em>v. <em>Coventry, </em>(3 <em>Term Rep. </em>85,) and <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Mulgrave, </em>(5 <em>Term Rep. </em>323.) Guesses may be formed, said Lord Mansfield, in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Sheppard, </em>(1 <em>Doug. </em>78,) but that is not enough: perhaps <em>quod voluit non dixit; </em>conjectures may be made both ways. Lord Northington declared, in <em>Stephenson </em>v. <em>Heathcote, </em>(1 <em>Eden Rep. </em>43,) that the court must proceed on known principles and established'rules; not on loose conjectural interpretations, or by considering what a man may be imagined to do in the testator\u2019s circumstances. The principle is applicable in all its force to a case like the present, in which the question goes to the birthright (of those who, standing in the place of the common law heir, are not to be disinherited, except by express devise, or, as it is said in 1 <em>Powell on Devises, </em>199, by implication so inevitable, that \u201c an intention to the contrary cannot be supposed.\u201d It is doubtless improbable in this instance that the testator designed to leave the disposal of his real estate to the intestate laws, while he bound up his personal for a hundred years; yet I feel entirely assured that he actually intended to dispose of, not the title to his land, but at the most, the profits of it. This however is no more than \u25a0 confident conjecture; and we. must come at last to an analysis of his language to ascertain the legal meaning of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The words <em>\u201c </em>worldly goods of all sorts and kinds,\u201d though very general, are properly applicable only to personal estate; and when they stand alone in a will, they signify no more than an intention to dispose of it. In Doe v. <em>Tofield, </em>(11 <em>East, </em>246,) <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Lainchbury, (Id. </em>290,) <em>Doe </em>v. <em>White, </em>(3 <em>East, </em>33,) <em>Den </em>v. <em>Trout, </em>(15 <em>East, </em>393,) and some more recent cases, the word \u2018 effects,\u2019 the synonyme of \u2018 goods,\u2019 has been allowed, when associated with words of a broader meaning, to carry land; hut in each of these cases it was used as the equivalent of something else with which it was explicitly connected. Standing alone, it was restrained to personal estate in <em>Camfield </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>(3 <em>East, </em>516;) and in <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Cubitt, </em>(1 <em>Doug. </em>40,) Lord Mansfield said that the word legacy, in its ordinary signification, is applied to money, but that it may signify a devise of land; and so indeed it did in <em>Hardacre </em>v. <em>Nash, </em>(5 <em>Term. Rep. </em>716.) The word property being usually applied in common parlance indifferently to chattels and land, has a larger signification, and may pass real estate without assistance; as it was allowed to do in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Langland, </em>(14 <em>East, </em>370.) But it may safely be affirmed, that however extensive its effect in respect to things <em>ejusdem generis, </em>the phrase, \u2018 worldly goods of all sorts and kinds,\u2019 when not enlarged by the context, has regard exclusively to the personal.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>What, then, is there in the context of this will to enlarge it? Having ordered his worldly goods to be put under the care of his executors, and kept by them and their successors, for a hundred years, as a general fund, he directs the \u201c <em>rents </em>and profits\u201d to be equally divided among his four children or their offspring. Now this word rents, is the only, one in the will which is exclusively applicable to real estate; and though it might extend the meaning of the word goods, its correlative, were it not itself subsequently restrained, yet the testator speaks of the shares of his sons Samuel and William, as legacies, and of portions of his estate, as- sums annually to become due. It is perfectly clear therefore, that he did not intend to give them an interest in any thing but the moneys annually arising from the fund, of whatsoever constituted. Land will doubtless pass by the word \u201c rent,\u201d as it did in <em>South </em>v. <em>Aliene, </em>(1 <em>Salk </em>228,) and <em>Kerry </em>v. <em>Derrick, (Cro. Jac. </em>104); but the devisees, in those cases, became the absolute owners of the soil; and. there certainly was no design that they should become so in this. But though the terms I have mention\u00e9d might not alone control the signification of the word rent, they are certainly introductive of limitations which are impracticable in their application to real estate. In <em>Spearing </em>v. <em>Buckland, </em>(6 <em>Term Rep. </em>610,) a testator gave certain pecuniary legacies, after having, in the usual introductory clause, professed to give his estate, both real and personal; and proceeded thus: \u201c all the rest, residue and remainder, of my estate and effects, of \u00e1ny, and what nature and kind soever, or wheresoever, I give and bequeath the same unto C. B. and J. R., their <em>executors and administrators, </em>in trust that they shall, from time to time, add the <em>interest </em>thereof to the <em>principal, </em>so as to <em>accumulate the </em>same, as it is my will that the said residue shall not be <em>paid or payable, </em>but at the time, and in the manner,.and to the several persons, as the said principal sum of four thousand pounds (one of the legacies before given) is before directed to be paid;\u201d and it was held, notwithstanding the introductory clause, and the sweeping bequest of the residue, that the real . estate did not pass. The same construction was made of clauses almost as strong in <em>Murrell </em>v. <em>Hurrell, </em>(5 <em>Barn. &amp; Ald. </em>18; S. C. 7 <em>Eng. Com. Law Rep. </em>8.) It must.be admitted, however, that in <em>Burket </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>(1 <em>H. B. </em>223,) equally strong expressions, exclu-, sively applicable to personal estate, such as \u201c having and receiving,\u201d and \u201c payment to guardians,\u201d were not allowed to restrain the generality of the words, \u201c all the rest and residue of my estate, of what nature or kind soever.\u201d And in <em>Newland </em>v. <em>Majoribanks, </em>(5 <em>Taunt. </em>238; S. C. 1 <em>Eng. Com. Law Rep. </em>104,) Sir James Mansfield and Mr. Justice Heath, divided in opinion, whether a devise of. all the rest, residue and remainder of the estate, was restricted to the personal, 'by a direction to put the subject of it out at interest, with power to change the securities. To the infinite variety of circumstances and expressions perpetually occurring in cases of the sort, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>no rule of interpretation can be uniformly applied, and the, soundest minds will come to opposite conclusions in respect to them; but a decisive majority of the profession will probably concur with Sir James, that the testator, notwithstanding the generality of his words, supposed himself to be dealing with only part of his estate. In <em>Dunnage </em>v. <em>White, </em>(1 <em>Jac. </em>&amp; <em>Walk. </em>533,) a devise to trustees of \u201call the rest, residue and remainder of my estate or effects whatsoever and wheresoever, of what nature or kind soever,\u201d was held to pass the legal title to real estate; but because the trust, as expressed, was confined to specific items of personal estate, a resulting trust of the messuage in contest, was decreed to the heir. It is truly remarked in 1 <em>Pow. on Dev. </em>179, that this case is merely an instance of the exclusion of real estate from trusts which manifestly did not extend to it; but had they purported to extend to all that had been given, and had the whole been subjected to limitations inapplicable to real estate, the material parts of the case would have been much nearer to those of <em>Spearing </em>v. <em>Buckland, </em>and have brought the decisions in the two cases more decisively in conflict. ' But no more was decided in <em>Dunnage </em>v. <em>White, </em>than that general words of devise to trustees, will not be restrained merely because the declaration of trust is not so broad as the legal estate. That case, however, is a pregnant proof of the lightness of general expressions as evidence of intention, when weighed with those by which it is carried out in detail; for the testator certainly never intended to pass the legal title of his real estate, merely to create a resulting trust for his heir. Y'et no more positive and general terms could well have been <em>used; </em>and the case therefore furnishes a reason for not paying too much respect to sweeping expressions in any case. I take it, then, that notwithstanding an admitted discrepance of decision, the authority of <em>Spearing </em>v. <em>Buckland </em>is unshaken; and how does it affect our case I There the property was devised to trustees and their <em>executors; </em>here the trust is committed to the executors and their successors\u2014a limitation equally, if not more inapplicable to land than the former; -for though title to chattels might pass to a chosen successor through the instrumentality of letters of administration <em>de bonis non </em>with the will annexed, the title to land could not. .Again, the terms, sums and legacies, annually payable, and annually falling due, savour as strongly of the personal as do directions to put out for accumulation, add interest to principal, and pay only at specified times. Another provision savours of it still more strongly. The devise in <em>Spearing </em>v. <em>Buckland </em>was to trustees; in this instance it is to the executors; and though comparatively little effect has been given, in the later decisions, to collocation of the subject-matter with the executorship, it is still not destitute of force. By associating the property of the trust with the duties of his personal representatives, the testator may, in a doubtful case, be supposed to have contemplated nothing but what appropriately belongs to the office. That, however, would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>itself be sufficient to exclude the real estate from words which obviously-include it; but in a balancing case it might turn the scale. In conclusion, it must be admitted that every part of this will is debateable ground; yet, though the case is not entirely a clear one, we are' on the whole, of- opinion, that the real estate did not pass: and this determination supersedes the other points made at the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Judgment for the plaintiffs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
