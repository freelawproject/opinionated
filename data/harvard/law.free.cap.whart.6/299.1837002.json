Defendant refused to give it on account of the machinery built for him by Garside &amp; Mecutcheon; as it was overrated, Mecutcheon then said it would be a great accommodation to him if defendant would loan him his note; he would take it up when due. I took a receipt at the bottom of the bill, in which this agreement was stated.\u201d [The bill referred to by the witness was produced by the defendant, at the call of the plaintiff, and was annexed to the bill of exceptions.] Being cross-examined, the witness said: \u201c The plaintiff was not present, at the time ; Mecutcheon was.\u201d And being re-examined, he said: \u201c I was at that time the defendant\u2019s foreman; I took charge of the books; Garside &amp; Mecutcheon had been making drums for driving curled hair machinery for- the defendant, The defendant has subsequently used the machinery for various purposes. It was frequently out of order, and often broke.\u201d Being again cross-examined\u2014\u201c I recollect calling oh the plaintiff about lifting this note, I had received a notice, in Mr. Cumming\u2019s absence, about the note. I \u25a0 called on the plaintiff about taking it up, according to the receipt at the bottom of the bill.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-7\">James Wray being then called, deposed that he had not seen the machinery <em>made; </em>that he worked in Mr. Cumming\u2019s <em>factory, </em>renting the part in which he worked since April, 1838; there might be half a dozen drums; there might be more in the factory. He had an attachment to four of these drums.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-8\">John Bullqck being called again, said: \u201cThe drums were put there in the latter part of 1836. The drums to which Wray alludes must be the same made by Garside &amp; Mecutcheon- I know it, because I worked there the whole time. Garside &amp; Mecutcheon made the drums, repaired a picker, and put up a governor.\u201d Cross-examined: \u201c I left there in April, 1839. I know that when Wray first came there the drums he attached to were those made by Gar-side <em>&amp;\u00f3 </em>Mecutcheon, Tire governor was faulty,\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-9\">James Wray then continued: \u201cSoon after I came there, the drums gave way. They had wooden screws instead of iron bolts. I had to take them and get two inch thick bolts through them to make them sufficient. It was about twice a week, for six weeks, in that way. I think Mr. Cumming sustained loss. I paid him five dollars a day, and I lost fifteen .or twenty days,\u201d Cross-examined. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number><em>\u201c </em>Mr. Cumming could have seen the defects, if he had examined them, and been a judge.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-6\">Arundius Tiers being again called by the plaintiff, said: \u201cThis note was given in renewal of another note. I won\u2019t say it was protested ; there was a hundred dollars paid at the time, and Mr. Cumming promised to pay the note at maturity. Cumming said the note had been given to Garside &amp; Mecutcheon. He made some apologies for failing to take up the former note, and promised that if the new note was given, he would take it up.\u201d Cross-examined. \u201c This conversation was at our counting-house. I know Cumming was the man. The conversation arose from his not taking the note up. The conversations were such as to imply that Garside &amp; Mecutcheon had been at work for Mr, Cumming. John Bullock was not there at that time. I can\u2019t say who paid the money, or by whom it was received. I did not see the money paid. I recollect the note was to be renewed, and the difference was to be paid, but I did not see it paid. I remember that Cumming promised to pay this note at maturity, if Garside would take it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-7\">John Gilbert, being called by the plaintiff, testified that he was employed by Garside &amp; Mecutcheon to put up the shafting for the defendant, and that it was done in a workmanlike manner. Whether wood screws were used or not, depended upon the power applied to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-8\">The court, after stating the case, and commenting on the evidenc\u00e9, charged the jury, that if they should think the note was given for the work (and not merely as an accommodation) they would then consider whether the work was good and sufficient, or whether it was defective; and proceeded thus: \u201c If you should find that the work was defective, then you will consider how far it was defective, and decide from the evidence, as nearly as you can, what expense and trouble it would cost to make the work good and substantial as it ought to be. This is the utmost the defendant can require, because it appears he kept the machinery. It would not be lawful to allow damages for lost time in the use of the machinery, or for the loss of Wray\u2019s rent. That would not be a proper measure of damages; because a few dollars expended might have made the drums and the other work good and sufficient.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-9\">To this direction, as to the measure of damages which the defendant might set off, the defendant excepted, and the judge sealed a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-10\">The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, for the principal and interest of the note, upon which this writ of error was taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-11\">The following error wa\u00e1 assigned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>\u201c The judge below erred in charging the jury that \u2018it would not be lawful to allow damages for lost time in the use of the machinery, or for the loss of Wray\u2019s rent; and that would not be a proper measure of damage, because a few dollars expended might have made the drums and the other work good and sufficient.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b302-5\">Mr. <em>Markland </em>for the plaintiff in error cited</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASi\"><em>Wilt </em>v. <em>Vickers, </em>(8 <em>Watts, </em>227.) <em>Dewint </em>v. <em>Wiltse, </em>(9 <em>Wend. </em>325.) <em>Sayre Dam. </em>52. <em>Ld.

Piad the defendant procured the machinery to be made good, the time necessarily lost in the process, unless so small as to fall within the maxim <em>de minimis, </em>would have been a legitimate subject of compensation; though time lost by working on with it in a defective condition, w'ould not. _ The inaccuracy, however, was not only trivial in itself, but unproductive of the smallest injury. The jury gave the plaintiff his whole demand; and they \u25a0 \u2022consequently allowed the defendant no damages at all. The misdirection, if so it may be called, in regard to the measure of compensation, was therefore without consequences; and that we never reverse for an error clearly unattended with actual prejudice, was determined in Campbell v. <em>Calhoun, </em>(1 <em>Penn. Rep. </em>140,) and <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>Brackbill, (Id. </em>370.)</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
