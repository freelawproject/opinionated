This balance, now amounting to the sum of $155 03, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel contends, forms a part of the lien of said mortgage on said premises, and is to be added to the amount of the other two bonds, in ascertaining the amount of the judgment in this case.

The mortgage and the bonds which it was given to secure, constitute but different parts of the same instrument, upon which the mortgagee has three remedies in case of default in payment at the stipulated time, 1. lie may bring ejectment and recover possession of the land, and hold it until his debt, interest, and costs are paid. 2. He may obtain judgment on his bond, and, by execution, sell the land mortgaged, or other estate of the obligor. 3. A year and a day after the last payment on the mortgage is due, he may sue out a <em>scire facias; </em>and, after judgment, he may sell the mortgaged premises by <em>lev, </em>fa.; in which case no condemnation is necessary. In either case the lien has relation to the time when the land was specifically pledged for the payment of this <em>debt, so far, at least, </em>as <em>to </em>cut out all liens subsequent to that of the mortgage. <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Ammon, [1 Binn. </em>175.) <em>Bantleon </em>v. <em>Smith, (2 Binn. </em>146.) <em>Gordon v. Correy, </em>(5 <em>Binn. </em>552.) The very questions in this case appear to have been decided in <em>M\u2018Call </em>v. <em>Lenox, </em>(9 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>302.) Although the mortgagor may pursue either and all of these several remedies, he cannot sell the land twice for the same debt. If he sells it by execution issued upon the judgment obtained upon his bond, he cannot again sell it by <em>lev. fa. </em>on his mortgage; any more than he could again sell it on the same judgment on the bond. They are for the same debt; and a sale under either draws with it the equity of the other, and passes the whole right. These are principles which would not be disputed but for the act of assembly of the 16th of March, 1830, (5 ed. <em>Purd. </em>386,) which provides that, \u201cfrom and after the passage of this act, where the lien of a mortgage upon real estate is or shall be prior to all other liens upon the same property, except other mortgages, ground-rents, and the purchase money due to the commonwealth, the lien of such mortgage shall not be destroyed, or in any w.ay affected by any sale made by virtue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>or authority of any writ of <em>venditioni exponas.\u201d </em>Does this act of assembly change the law as applicable to the case under consideration ? This law was intended for the protection of third persons. It was not intended to prevent a person from destroying the lien of his own mortgage by selling the property under the bond which the mortgage was given to secure. Will it be contended that since this act of assembly a man cannot proceed by judgment upon his bonds and sell the mortgaged premises, except subject to his mortgage ? If this were so, would the plaintiff be entitled to the proceeds of sale <em>1 </em>Would it not go to the judgment-creditors next subsequent to the mortgage'? or, if no judgment, then to the defendant himself 1 The effect of such a construction would be to say that, in the case of a mortgage payable by instalments, the mortgagee can have no remedy against the mortgaged premises, except to take possession by ejectment, until one year after the last payment is due. Suppose there were no bonds, but that the mortgage itself contained a covenant for the payment of the instalments; in an action of covenant on the mortgage for recovery of the instalments as they become due, the judgment would take precedence from the lien of the mortgage. The circumstance of the covenants for payment of the money being in separate writings can make no difference. The lien of the mortgage is not prior to the lien of the judgment for the debt which it was given to secure. They are one and the same. If several mortgages are entered at one and the same time, a sale under any one will divest the lien of the others, whether they are due or not; for they are not prior within the meaning of that act. of assembly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-6\">2. The mortgaged premises have been taken in execution, and sold under a judgment entered upon one of the bonds. The proceeds of sale were applied towards the extinguishment of. the debt secured by this bond. The plaintiff now contends that he is entitled to recover the balance of said bond by again selling the land, under process issued upon the mortgage. The bond is the principal evidence of the debt; the mortgage is only collateral. He certainly cannot sell it again on the judgment on the bond. According to the principles established in <em>M\u2018Call </em>v. <em>Lenox, </em>he cannot sell it a second time on the mortgage. The plaintiff cannot soli the land twice for the same debt.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b213-7\">Mr. <em>Muloany </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-8\">The act of 1830 is express and in point. It makes no distinction between the case of a sale under a younger lien held by the mortgagee and any other person. This is an attempt to obtain land at a public sale at one-third its value. In <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>(10 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>481,) a case exactly like the present, it was held that the sale under the judgment upon a bond was only of the equity of redemption, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number><em>Riclcert </em>v. <em>Madeira, </em>(1 <em>Rawle, </em>328.) <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Shuler, </em>(12 <em>Serg. &lt;Sf Rawle, </em>240.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b214-7\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ay5\">That a sale on a judgment for a debt, secured by a mortgage, discharges the lien of the mortgage notwithstanding the act of 1830, was asserted in <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>(7 <em>Watts, </em>477,) and put on what we think tenable ground. That case was not exactly like the present, nor was a decision of the point absolutely necessary in it; still it is one of the buttresses of the judgment, and what is of decisive importance is, that at least one title, we are told, has been advisedly paid for on the authority of it. I may add to the reasons of the judge who delivered the opinion, that, though such a sale is within the letter of the act, it is not without its spirit, because it is not within the mischief which was intended to be remedied by it. We well remember how that act was procured, and what it was designed to meet. It was the offspring of a panic among a very numerous class of creditors, who supposed that their debts would be jeoparded if the lien of a mortgage might be discharged without the mortgagee\u2019s consent. It is bootless now to say, what is shown by daily experience, that their fears were groundless, and that the fruit of their influence with the legislature bears heavily on debtors and younger lien creditors; but the disastrous consequences of the supposed remedy is a legitimate reason why it should not be pushed beyond the supposed mischief. That its consequences have been disastrous, has been perceived whenever we have had occasion to observe them; of which <em>Garro </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>(7 <em>Watts, </em>416,) and <em>Colwill </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>to be reported in Mr. Watts\u2019s forthcoming volume, are pregnant instances; nor would the present one be less so, did we make the purchaser pay the price of the land twice told, by giving to the words of the enactment, the widest sweep of which they are susceptible. The act is redundantly worded, and the meaning is consequently ill expressed; but the purport of it is, perhaps, to declare that no mortgage or judgment shall bind more than the equity of redemption springing from a prior mortgage; and that no more shall be sold on a <em>liberari </em>or <em>fieri facias by </em>a subsequent incumbrancer. The object was professedly to do no more than guard the security of the prior mortgage creditor from disturbance by those who should come after him, and be entitled only to what should be left when he should have been satisfied; but what need could there be to guard his security against another security under his own control <em>1 </em>In the present case, the securities are cumulative; but that is immaterial, for, I take it, the consequence would be the same were they securities for debts arising out of different transactions. The design was to protect the mortgage from the intermeddling of subsequent creditors; but can a judgment creditor, who is himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>the prior mortgagee, be deemed a subsequent creditor within the purview of the statute, or, in his capacity of mortgagee, an object of protection against himself1 When he appears in a double character, it is obvious that a case has occurred which was not contemplated, nor consequently provided for. It is a maxim that any one may renounce the benefit of a privilege provided for himself; and when a mortgagee desires to sell the land on his judgment before a year and' a day has elapsed from the time when the debt became due, what is to prevent him. The letter of the statute! We all know what that is, and how worthless are accidental and sweeping expressions. There may be no intermediate creditor; and where there is one, it is not his interest, nor that of the debtor, to object to a sale of the entire estate. That the mortgagee may sell it thus on his judgment alone, cannot be disputed on any principle of legitimate interpretation. But what if he choose to sell only the equity of redemption! He may certainly do so, since the statute, as he might, according to <em>Stackpole </em>v. <em>Glassford, </em>(16 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>163,) have done before it. Suppose, however, that he does not propose the estate expressly subject to the mortgage. Let him, then, be taken to sell the fee as he would have been taken to do in like circumstances before the statute. Pie did not propose the property specially in this instance; and the purchaser consequently took it discharged of the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Judgment of the Common Pleas reversed; and judgment rendered on the case stated, for the defendant below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
