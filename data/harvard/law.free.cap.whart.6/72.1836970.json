The said Christian Fisher, the executor, is now dead; and the said Henry Scheetz, Jr. was by a decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Montgomery county, on the 23d day of May, a. d. 1839, dismissed from his trust; and on the 1st day of July, a. d. 1839, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Israel Gilbert was appointed by the register of wills of said county, administrator, &amp;c. with the will annexed, of the said Christian Fisher the testator.

Elizabeth Fisher, the widow of the said test\u00e1tor, died, leaving a will, dated pn the 22d day of July, a. d. 1838, which was duly proven and recorded in the office of the register of wills of the city and county pf IPhiladelphia, wherein she appointed Joseph Campbell, sple executor thereof, who took upon himself the burden of the execution of the trust. George Lindenberger made his last will and testament on the 23d day of April, 1836, which was duly proven on the 21st day of November, in the same year, whereby he appointed his wife Ann, and Dr. George Martin, and Charles P. Fenton his executors, who also took upon themselves the execution of the will. The said George Lindenberger in his lifetime gave to the said Christian Fisher a bond dated the 13th day of March, a. d. 1813, in the penalty of fifteen hundred and eleven dollars and twelve cents, the condition of which is as follows, to wit: \u201c That if the above bounden George Lindenberger, his heirs, executors, administrators, or any of them, shall and do well and truly pay or cause to be paid unto the above named Christian Fisher, or to his certain attorney, executors, administrators, or assigns, the just sum of forty-five dollars and thirty-three cents, lawful money as aforesaid, yearly and every year, on the first day of April, from and after the first day of-April next, for and during the natural life of his present wife Elizabeth Fisher, the first annual or yearly payments thereof, to begin and be made on the first day of April, in the year one thousand eight hundred and fourteen, and at her decease the further sum of seven hundred and fifty-five dollars, and fifty-six cents, lawful money as aforesaid, and that without any fraud or further delay, then,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-6\">The said Israel Gilbert, administrator with the will annexed of the said Christian Fisher, claims to be paid by the executors of the said George Lindenberger, the amount of the said bond, to wit, the sum of seven hundred and fifty-five dollars and fifty-six cents; and the said Joseph Campbell, executor, &amp;c., of the said Elizabeth Fisher, also claims to be paid by the same executors the amount of the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>bond. Now, in order to determine the whole difficulty, and to re- \u25a0 lieve the executors of the said George Lindenberger, the question for the decision of the court is, whether under the circumstances, the said Elizabeth Fisher was entitled to the said sum of seven hundred and fifty-five dollars and fifty-si?: cents <em>absolutely, </em>or only to the <em>interest </em>thereof during her natural life.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-6\">If the court should be of opinion that she was entitled to it absolutely, then judgment to be entered for the plaintiffs; but if not, then judgment to be for the defendant.

It may be inferred that she refused to sign the deed, and that is the reason why he calls it \u201c dower.\u201d The bond throws light on the meaning of the testator. Though the first clause \u25a0Seems to give the principal, yet the last clearly shows that it was not his meaning to give more than the interest for life. The word \u201c dower \u201d used in the first bequest is explained in the latter part. The injunction on the executors to take other money to make up the annuity is strong to show it. <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>(1 <em>Yeates, </em>343.) <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>(2 <em>Yeates, </em>527.) 1 <em>Roberts on Wills, </em>202. <em>2 Bl.

The testator gives nothing more than a life-estate to his wife and children. Plis object was to keep the personal estate whole for the grandchildren. <em>Plinth am\u2019s Jlppeal, </em>(11 <em>Serg. &lt;$f Rawle, </em>16.) 2 <em>Roper\u2019s Leg. </em>313, 327.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b76-10\">Mr. <em>Fox </em>and Mr. <em>Mattery </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1K\">Though it be true that if \u2022there 'are repugnant clauses in a will the last must prevail, yet if they can be'reconciled, it must be done. The reason of the provision appears in the case. The testator had sold Lindenberger a farm,- and taken a bond for paying her the interest. The word \u201c dower \u201d in common parlance, means the principal sum. That the testator so used the word is plain from his language. The first bequest standing alone would carry the principal. 1 <em>Roper\u2019s Leg. </em>173. <em>Garret </em>v. <em>Rex, </em>(6 <em>Watts, </em>14.) The last bequest requires the executors to take so much not already disposed of. Was not this principal sum disposed of? This sum was a specific bequest to her. She might dispose Of the bond.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b76-11\">Mr. <em>Tilghman </em>replied.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b76-12\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b76-13\">Kennedy, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-y\">It is too plain to admit of a question, that the seven hundred arid fifty-five dollars and fifty-six cents is given by the first clause of the will, in which it is mentioned, to the wife of the testator absolutely. Bht it is contended by the counsel for the plaintiff in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>error, that the testator, by a subsequent clause, has manifested very clearly his intention that she should only receive the interest thereof during her natural life. The subsequent clause is in these words; \u201c my executor, hereinafter named, shall take so much money out of my estate, that I have not disposed of, and loan it on interest; take sufficient security for the same, so that the interest accruing from from said money, and <em>the interest of my wife Elizabeths dower, </em>will make the yearly <em>income </em>of one hundred dollars, which my executor, hereinafter named, shall pay unto my wife Elizabeth in two equal half-yearly payments.\u201d In the first clause, containing the bequest of the seven hundred and fifty-five dollars and fifty-six cents, which, as it seems, was the one-third of the -purchase-money of a plantation sold by the testator to a George Lindenberger, which the testator calls his wife\u2019s dower in the plantation, he expressly wills that Lindenberger shall pay that amount of money to his wife Elizabeth. Now it must be observed, that although the. testator, by the subsequent clause, directs that she shall receive the interest of the seven hundred and fifty-five dollars and fifty-six cents half-yearly from his executor, yet the testator has placed no limitation whatever upon it as to its extent or duration. If the testator had, -in the latter clause, directed the one hundred dollars to be paid to his wife annually, in half-yearly payments, during her life, or any other limited period, then there would have been some ground, perhaps, for saying that he merely intended she should have the interest that should accrue upon the debt owing by Lindenberger, and not the debt itself. But the debt itself was not to be paid by Lindenberger until after the death of the wife of the testator; Lindenberger, however,' was to pay the interest upon it annually until the principal became payable; and this circumstance may have induced the testator to declare it to be his will that the principal should be paid by Lindenberger to his wife, in'order to show the more clearly that he intended she should have the principal as well as the interest; which latter he expressly directs, in the subsequent clause of his will, to be paid to her generally without any limitation as to the continuance of such payment. This subsequent clause, therefore, instead of reducing the amount of the bequest contained in the prior clause, would of itself, under the principle laid down and recognised in the cases of <em>Hellman </em>v. <em>Hellman, </em>(4 <em>Rawle, </em>450,) <em>Schriver </em>v. <em>Cobeau, </em>(4 <em>Watts, </em>130,) and <em>Garret </em>v. <em>Rex, </em>(6 <em>Watts, </em>14,) be sufficient to vest an absolute right in the wife to the debt as well as the interest. The rule laid down in those cases is, that where the <em>interest </em>or <em>produce </em>of a legacy is given to, or <em>in trust </em>for a legatee, <em>without limitation </em>as to its <em>continuance, </em>the <em>principal </em>will be considered as bequeathed also. The case of <em>Adamson </em>v. <em>Armitage, </em>(10 <em>Ves. </em>416,) is in all its most prominent features, very much like the present. There, the testator, by a codicil to his will, made the following bequest; \u201c I give to my very trusty and valuable servant, Lydia Adamson, the <em>balance </em>of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>my account in Mr. Downing\u2019s hands* with the <em>interest </em>thereon, to be vested by my executors in the hands of trustees whom they shall choose and name, the <em>income arising therefrom, </em>to be for her sole use and benefit.\u201d Sir Wm. Grant, Master of the Rolls, held that the legatee was entitled to the absolute interest in the fund; stating that \u201c in the case of a devise of realty, words of limitation must be added to give more than an estate for life; but in the case of personalty, words of qualification are required to restrain the extent and duration of the interest. <em>Prima facie </em>a gift of the produce of a fund, is a gift of that produce in <em>perpetuity; </em>and is consequently a gift of <em>the fund itself, </em>unless there be something on the face of the will to show that such was not the intention. It is, however, not necessary in this case to call that in aid to entitle the plaintiff <em>to </em>a decree, as here is an express bequest in the first part of <em>the </em>codicil of the entire fund; and the only question is, whether there are after-wards any expressions, reducing to an interest for life, what was once in terms an absolute interest. In the first sentence, there is the substance of the gift; then follows a direction, that the income shall be for her sole use and benefit. Admitting a gift of the produce of a fund merely to create a life interest, it does not follow, that when there is in the first instance a gift of the fund itself, this subsequent direction will reduce it to a life interest merely, as this direction does not extend beyond the income. The testator directs that the fund shall not be immediately handed over; but shall be vested in trustees, \u2018 the income arising therefrom to be for her sole use and benefit.\u2019 But there is in that nothing inconsistent with her enjoyment of the absolute property. These subsequent words appear to me to be directory, not restrictive, meaning enjoyment in that mode, not that she is not to have the absolute property.\u201d Every thing advanced here by Sir William Grant, is directly applicable to the case under consideration, and goes to show that the wife of the testator became entitled, under the will, to the absolute property in the fund itself, and that the subsequent clause did not divest her of it, but directed merely the manner in which it should be enjoyed by her. This is also corroborated by the circumstance that no other disposition is made of this fund by the will, than that which is in favour of the wife; while in other cases the testator has not only been particular in giving the interest of certain funds, to restrain it expressly to the life of the legatee in each case, but after the death of the same to give the absolute property in the fund over to others. For instance; he gives and bequeaths the interest of four hundred dollars to his daughter Mary, <em>during her natural life, </em>and after her death, the said four hundred dollars to be equally divided among his grandchildren; and in like manner the interest of six hundred dollars to his daughter Ann <em>during her natural life; </em>and after her death, the said six hundred dollars to be equally divided among his grandchildren. There is therefore strong reason to conclude, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>if he had intended to give his wife only a life interest, he would have done it in the same form that he has observed in regard to his daughters Mary and Ann. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
