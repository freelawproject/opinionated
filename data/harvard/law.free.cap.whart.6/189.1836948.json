A witness was also produced, who testified that he made some of the entries by copying them from the plaintiff\u2019s slate on the evening of the day on which they were made, or in the course of the next day. <em>Held, </em>that the book was admissible in evidence.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-8\">Error to the Common Pleas of Philadelphia County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-9\">This was an action by Brookes to recover the sum of fifty-three dollars twenty-four cents for work and labour done as a blacksmith, and goods sold and delivered by him to Hartley.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-10\">At the trial the plaintiff\u2019s counsel having opened that he would show that Vansant to whom the goods and work were charged, was only the agent of Hartley, produced a book which the plaintiff stated upon oath was his book of original entries. The plaintiff testified as follows: \u201cpart of the entries were made by myself: some were made the first, and some the second day after I had done the work; not later than the second day in the evening\u2014and on cross-examination by the defendant\u2019s counsel, he said, \u201c These entries were part taken from my head, and part from a slate ; I can\u2019t tell which from my head and which from the slate: I made the entries on the slate myself, and in the book too.\u201d The defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the entries being read to the jury, but the Court admitted them ; and they were read as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-11\">\u201cJohn Vansant,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-12\">1833, October 26th, Laying broad axe, - - 00 87i</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-13\">1834, March 29th, Ironing York Wagon, - - - 2'8 00.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>To the admission of these entries by the judge, Hartley\u2019s counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-6\">The counsel of Brookes then offered one Joseph Tillotson, a witness, to prove that he, (the witness,) made certain entries in another book alleged to be the plaintiff\u2019s book of original entries, of work alleged to have been done, and goods sold and delivered by Brookes for and to <em>Hartley; </em>and Tillotson being sworn, testified as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-7\">\u201c I know the bpok: these entries are in my handwriting, copied off Mr. Brookes\u2019s slate, on the evening of the day they were made, or the next day, or in the course of the next day, sometimes the same night.\u201d Being cross-examined by the defendant\u2019s counsel, he said, \u201cI was boarding with him at the time, and did it to help him along with his work; the slate he kept in his shop was my voucher; I copied it from the slate as near as I could; I got my information from the slate.\u201d Being re-examined, he said, \u201c I am sure it was his (Brookes\u2019s) handwriting; he was not always by when I made the .entries.\u201d The counsel for the defendant' thereupon -objected to the entries so made by the witness being read to the jury, the judge admitted them ; and they were read to the jury; and the defendant\u2019s counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-8\">The errors assigned were:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-9\">\u201c 1.

Entries transferred from a card to the book on the following day, were admitted in <em>Patton </em>v. <em>Ryan; </em>and the like, in substance, was done in <em>Ingraham </em>v. <em>Bockius. </em>In <em>Kessler </em>v. <em>M\u2018Conachy, </em>no more was ruled than that the transfer was too late at the expiration of nearly two weeks. The objection that it was made in this instance by a third person, has no greater force. The entries might have been made originally by a clerk; and whether by the verbal instructions or written memo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>randa of the principal, can surely make no difference\u2014they would .be as much the entries of the principal in the one case as in the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
