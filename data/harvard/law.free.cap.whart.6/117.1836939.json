It was all done at the same time.\u201d On his cross-examination he testified: \u201c Jesse Sharpe is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>tavern-keeper in Wilmington: was in 1836; kept the La Fayette Hotel; deals pretty largely in stock, through Mr. Benson. The note was paid when it became due; I believe on the very day it became due. I received the money for it on the very day it was due from Jesse Sharpe, at Wilmington. The note was not put in bank. He paid me in bankable paper, at my office, I suppose; no one that I recollect was present when the note was paid. I don\u2019t know whether I deposited the money in bank, or not; I kept no bank account myself, my brother kept.it. I am a clerk in the store of my brother. The note was not mine; I was doing business for my brother; it was his. I don\u2019t recollect making an affidavit that this stock was mine. This stock ought to have gone into my brother\u2019s name. I bought this stock in the city of Philadelphia, of S. &amp; M. Allen, brokers. I gave about one hundred and fifteen or one hundred and sixteen dollars per share for it. Mr. Sharpe don\u2019t drive stage, he carries the mail. I can\u2019t say that I ever sold stock to Sharpe before this time. I never agreed to save Sharpe harmless. Sharpe and Parker signed the bond to the sheriff, I don\u2019t think I did. Sharpe gave Parker the stock as collateral security; he is safe enough. Mr. Parker took it for that. I came up with Sharpe. I called on Mr. Parker with him; I knew him, and Sharpe did not. I introduced him to Mr. Parker to go security to the sheriff. I told him Sharpe was safe enough. I told Mr. Parker I would go Sharpe\u2019s security for him, and that if Sharpe did not make up the stock to him I would; I would go security for him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-6\">The counsel for the plaintiffs thereupon asked the court to strike out all of the testimony of the witness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-7\">The counsel for the defendant then proposed to ask the witness as to the sale of stock by Parker, and as to the amount Parker got for the stock; to which question the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel objected; but the court overruled .the objection, and admitted the testimony, to which the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-8\">The witness then stated in answer to questions by defendant\u2019s counsel:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-9\">\u201c Mr. Parker sold the stock for about $ 123 or $ 124 per share, or something in that neighbourhood.

My father or brother gave me the money for those notes, and I gave it to Sharpe. There were one or two notes; I am not certain which. I don\u2019t recollect in whose favour the notes were drawn, nor whether I put my name on them or not. The note was not over thirty or sixty days. I took the notes directly to my father or brother and got the money. I did not take the notes to Sharpe. Sharpe never saw the notes till I handed him the money. If they were to my order, I endorsed them. My brother is two years younger than myself. -He was born in 1805; is in the flour business. 1 knew of this judgment against me when- I transferred this stock to Sharpe. I don\u2019t know that he knew of it. I never - paid the expenses of his coming up. In April, <em>1833, I went </em>into business for my brother in Wilmington. The store belongs to my father. I get a salary. I have a power of attorney to sign checks for my brother. I can\u2019t say whether I drew the money for Parker\u2019s note on this power of attorney or not. I sign his checks. I deposit all money to the credit of my brother. The proceeds of Sharpe\u2019s note I deposited to the credit of my brother. I kept but one bank account; it was in the bank of Wilmington and Brandywine; my father is president of it. Sometimes my father discounts paper for me and gives me the money, and \u25a0 sometimes he gives me a check. I di-ew the money out of the same bank to discount Parker\u2019s notes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>with. My brother first came into the store in 1836. He lived in Philadelphia till that year; went down in September, 1836. The store is carried on by me up to this day under that power of attorney. The sale to Mr. Sharpe was a <em>bona fide </em>sale\u2014no cover of any kind whatever.

Seal, at the time of the levy, that then and. in that case it was liable to this execution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-8\">4. That the sheriff was bound to proceed and sell this stock standing in the name of Joshua T. Seal, especially as an indemnity was offered to him by the plaintiffs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-9\">The learned judge charged the jury, in substance, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-10\">\u201c The plaintiff alleges that there was property of J. T. Seal sufficient to make the money, on which the sheriff actually levied, and that by his subsequent return of <em>nulla bona, </em>he made himself and his sureties liable for the debt. It is conceded that if there was such property, the defendants are liable ; and the question is, was there such property or not 1 The defendants say, that after the levy and before the return, the sheriff was satisfied that the property levied on, did not belong to J. T. Seal. On the 18th of April, 1830, fifteen shares of the United States bank stock were transferred on the books of the bank to Joshua T. Seal. At that time the present plaintiffs had the judgment against Seal. The second section of the act of the 29th of March, 1819, relative to taking stock in execution, authorised a levy on the stock in the name of J. T. Seal, if it were <em>owned </em>by him. The distinction between <em>ownership </em>and <em>holding for another, </em>is plainly and unequivocally recognised in the preamble to the third section of the act, and in the third section, and provision is made to enable a creditor of a person owning stock held in another\u2019s name, to reach it for the debt of the real owner. On the 6th of May, execution being issued, a levy on this stock was made, it still standing on the books in the name of J. T. Seal. So far the plaintiff has a <em>prima facie </em>case. Until explained the name of J. T. Seal on the books' of the bank might be deemed sufficient evidence of his ownership. The defendants, however, make a two-fold' defence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-11\">1. They allege that though the stock was in the name of Joshua T, Seal, yet in fact it was <em>owned </em>by his brother Joseph; that Joshua never had any interest in it. If this be made out in point of fact, it finishes the controversy. The sheriff was <em>then, </em>right in returning <em>nulla bona, </em>and any judgment creditor of Joseph Seal, if such ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>isted, could have made it liable to execution, for debts' due -by him. The defendants rely on the testimony of Joshua T. Seal, who certainly swears unequivocally to the fact that he had no interest; that the stock' was bought with his <em>brother\u2019s money, </em>and was owned entirely by <em>him. </em>The defendants say that Joshua was a man of no property, merely an agent for his brother, and that the brother'was a man of substance. All this depends on the evidence of Joshua himself. The plaintiffs ask you to reject the testimony as that of a man unworthy of belief. The plaintiffs produce no witnesses to contradict, but argue on the facts and papers in evidence, that there is enough to show him not entitled' to be believed.' The plaintiffs say that the story is improbable in itself, that no adequate reason is given for using the witness\u2019sname for his brother, but the reverse, and thatthe manner in which the witness testified, shows his disregard of truth. The defendants deny these inferences, and contend that as an unimpeached witness he is entitled to full credit; that there is nothing, in his statement improbable or inconsistent, but on the contrary every thing is natural and obvious, and that there is nothing in his manner to bring discredit on him. The jury will judge. If the jury are with the defendants on this part of the case, there is nothing left. But the defendants say further; that even if Joshua was the owner, yet there was such a divesting of his ownership before the levy, as to prevent the execution from attaching, A certain paper is produced. The defendants allege that on the <em>22d </em>day of April, 1836, some days before the levy or before the execution was handed to the sheriff, J. T. Seal sold the stock to JeSse Sharpe, took full value for it in Mr. Sharpe\u2019s note at sixty days, (which was paid at maturity) and handed him over the certificate, with a power of attorney irrevocable to transfer the stock on the books of the bank. All this he did, it is said, for his brother, though his name was necessarily used. If Mr. Sharpe had immediately made the transfer, (supposing the <em>22d </em>of April, 1836, to be the date of the transaction,) it would have prevented all dispute; but he*retained the certificate' and power of attorney until the levy was actually made, and then, for the first time, informed the bank of his claim. In the case of goods and chattels, the rule is clear, that where there is a judgment against any one, a transfer of the property, unaccompanied by actual possession, is void against the creditor; and even where possession does accompany the transfer, the party is required to show, as against a creditor, beyond doubt, that there was a sufficient consideration, The peculiar character of <em>bank stock, </em>however, renders it necessary to guard against being mislead by this general rule of law. In reference to a transfer of interest, it is more analogous perhaps to a chose in action than to'goods and chattels. The discrimination is marked in the very section of the act of 1819, on which the plaintiff relies, to sustain his levy. That section declares that \u2022\u201c Stock, &amp;c, shall be liable to be taken into execution,\" and sold in the same man- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>' ner that goods and chattels are liable in law to be so taken and sold,\u201d not in the same manner that <em>other </em>goods and chattels are liable, &amp;c. but goods and chattels. The subject was considered by the Supreme Court, in the case of the <em>United States v. Vaughan, </em>(3 <em>Binney, </em>S94,) \u00bbin reference to stock situated at this is. There by the charter of the bank, as here by an act of assembly, transfers are directed to be made in the presence of an officer of the bank. It was held that stock, assigned <em>hona fide, </em>for full value, on the certificate, and handed over with a power of attorney to transfer, conveyed such an int\u00e9rest that the stock was not liable afterwards to attachment as the property of the vendor, although the transfer was not made on the books of the bank at the time of attachment. Judge Breckenridge intimates that the principle must go the whole length of protecting the stock from levy under an execution against the vendor. In the <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cutts, </em>(1 <em>Sumner, </em>133,) the principle of the above decision is approved and enforced by Mr. Justice Story. Whether in case of a second sale of the same stock to an innocent purchaser, for full consideration, and an actual transfer on the books of the bank, the first vendee would not be made to suffer for his own omission to consummate his title, is not the question here. As he left it in the power of the vendor to commit such a fraud upon him, he would hardly be allowed to complain, except against the vendor. I hold it then to be the law, that if on the 22d of April, 1836, Mr. Sharpe actually gave value for the stock, in good faith, and took an assignment and power to transfer, it authorises him to make defence in this suit. The handing over the certificate with an irrevocable power of attorney to transfer, was a sufficient assignment to pass all Mr. Joshua T. Seal\u2019s interest in the stock. This being the law, the plaintiffs again meet the case in point of fact. They say, the transaction did not occur on the 22d of. April, 1836, but after the levy, and that the whole of it was a fraudulent effort to convey stock really owned by J. T. Seal. To make good their position, they must here'also, deny that Mr. Seal speaks the truth, and indeed must charge him with a series of unequivocal falsehoods. The plaintiffs give their reasons for the allegations. The defendants deny that there is the slightest ground for <em>these </em>accusations. The jury must determine. Both grounds of defence are made out if J. T. Seal speaks the truth. If he is false in regard to the one ground, it is not unlikely that he is in regard to the other. So that the whole case seems to be resolved into a question, whether the jury believe him to have spoken the truth, or to have uttered gross and palpable falsehoods.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-6\">' The jury found for the defendants; and the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel having excepted to the charge, a writ of error was taken, and the following-errors assigned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>\u201c 1.

Seal, the vendor, was offered to support the title to the stock, in Sharpe, his vendee. If Sharpe, the vendee of Seal, lost the stock from defect of title in Seai, he would have a right of action against Seal, his vendor. In such action the verdict in this case would be evidence. <em>Witmer et al. </em>v. <em>Schlatter, </em>(2 <em>Rawle, </em>365-6.) <em>Leather </em>v. <em>Poultney, </em>(4 <em>Binn. </em>356.) <em>Clarke\u2019s Executors </em>v. <em>Carrington, </em>(7 <em>Cranch, </em>322.) <em>Waldo </em>v. <em>Long, </em>(7 <em>Johns. 173.)Blasdale </em>v. <em>Babcock, </em>(1 <em>Johns. </em>517,) was an a.ction on the case on an implied warranty of title in the sale of a horse, which the plaintiff had purchased of the defendant, and which one Snow had recovered from him in an action of trover ; and the record of the recovery by Snow was held to be evidence. <em>Bar</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number><em>ney </em>v. <em>Dervey, </em>(13 <em>Johns. </em>224.) In an action by Sharpe against Seal the averment that Seal was examined as a witness in this case would be tantamount to an averment that he had notice: and all the cases, show, that if Seal had notice, the verdict and judgment in this case would be conclusive against him, in an action by Sharpe, on an implied warranty of title to the stock. <em>Kip </em>v. <em>Brigham, </em>(6 <em>Johns. </em>158.) <em>Pinney </em>v. <em>Gleason, </em>(5 <em>Wend. </em>535.) <em>Tarlton </em>v. <em>Tarlton, </em>(4 <em>Maule &amp; Sel. </em>20.) A vendor of goods is not a competent witness for the vendee in an action by a third person for the goods. <em>Heermance </em>v. <em>Vernoy, </em>(6 <em>Johns. </em>5.) <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>(3 <em>Wend. </em>240.) <em>Baxter </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>(5 <em>Watts, </em>418.) If this verdict could be given in evidence in an action by Sharpe against Seal, the witness, he was .incompetent. <em>Conrad et al. </em>v. <em>Keyser, </em>(5 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>371.) <em>Hilhouse </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>(5 <em>Day, </em>432.) <em>Benjamin </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>(12 <em>Wend. </em>404. 406, 7.) It is not even necessary, in order to render a witness incompetent, that the record in the pending cause should be evidence, for or against him in a subsequent suit. It is enough that a decision of the cause in favour of the party calling him, will prevent the witness\u2019s liability to a subsequent suit ; 6 <em>Page\u2019s Ch. Rep. </em>81, and cases there cited. By the verdict and judgment in this case Sharpe keeps the stock; and this judgment prevents a suit by him against Seal, the witness, on an implied warranty of title. The release by Parker to Seal did not restore his competency. He was liable to Sharpe, not to Parker; and Sharpe never released. The delivery of the certificate of the stock by Seal to Sharpe, accompanied with an irrevocable power of attorney, did not exempt it from being levied on and sold as Seal\u2019s property, if Sharpe suffered it to stand in Seal\u2019s name, on the books of the bank. The law is well settled in Pennsylvania, that possession must accompany the sale of personal property. <em>Clow </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>(5 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>275.) <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Neville, </em>(10 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>201.) <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>(17 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>99.) <em>Pritchett </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>(4 <em>Rawle, </em>260.) <em>Jenkins v. Eichelberger, </em>(4 <em>Watts, </em>121.) In this pase the stock had been standing on the books of the bank, in the name of Joshua T. Seal, from the 18th of April, 1836. It was levied on as his property on the 6th of May, 1836; and was not transferred on the books of the bank till the 1st of June, 1836; and the'n, not to Sharpe, <em>the </em>alleged purchaser, but to Mr. Parker. The stock never was in the name of Jesse Sharpe, the claimant. Is there any thing in the character of bank stock that should exempt it from the wholesome rule established in regard to other personal property 1 It is as susceptible of delivery, and much more, than many descriptions of property to which this rule has been held to apply. The act of assembly treats it as personal property. <em>Purd. Dig. </em>edit. 1830, p. 167. sec. 2. Act. 29th, March, 1819. And the Act of 18th June, 1836. sec. 22, <em>(Purd.

Seal as a witness for the defendants. If the competency of the evidence, or any portion thereof, was intended to be excepted to, I think it was not made a question of, and pressed on the argument of the cause here; nor can I perceive any tenable ground upon which such an exception could have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">The objection to the competency of Joshua T. Seal, as a witness \u2022 for the defendants, is made upon two <em>grounds; </em>First, that of interest in the event of the suit; and second, that of the verdict in this case, if it had been in favour of the plaintiff, being evidence in an action brought hereafter by Jesse Sharpe against Seal, to recover back the price of the stock, upon a breach of the implied warranty of title, on the part of Seal, that attended the sale thereof by him to Sharpe. Sharpe, it would seem, must be considered the real defendant in this suit, though Seal undoubtedly was interested in it, according to his own statement, until he was released by Parker, which was on the trial of the cause: because he induced Parker to go into a bond with Sharpe to the sheriff, engaging to save the latter harmless, if he would forbear to proceed on the execution which he had in his hands at the suit of the plaintiffs against Seal, to sell the stock. But Seal could only be looked on as interested in the event of the suit, on account of his undertaking to Parker, to be back security to him, for the sufficiency of Sharpe to keep him indemnified, for becoming Sharpe\u2019s security in the bond given by them to the sheriff. But it is alleged that Seal, in selling the stock, as the owner thereof, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Sharpe, impliedly warranted the title of it; that a recovery by the plaintiffs in this action, would be evidence, at least, of a breach of such warranty; and Seal by means thereof might be rendered liable to return the price of the stock to Sharpe: hence it is contended that he was interested in preventing a recovery by the plaintiffs, and therefore not competent to give testimony against them; which was in effect giving evidence in his own 'favour. Now admitting that Seal, by selling the stock to Sharpe, thereby agreed to warrant and support the title to the stock, it by no' means follows that a recovery by the plaintiffs in this action would be any evidence whatever of the breach of such warranty: on the contrary, I think it very clear that it would not. For the plaintiffs, by claiming to recover in this actfon, do not dispute or deny the right of Seal to the stock, so far from this, they assert that he was the owner of it, at the time that Sharp alleges he bought it of Seal, and even afterwards as late as the 8th of May, 1836, w'hen the execution of the plaintiffs was first put into the hands of the sheriff. But Sharpe claims to have purchased the stock from Seal on the 22d of April, 1836, several days before the execution against Seal was issued; so that the recovery by the plaintiffs in this action could not possibly affect the implied warranty of title to the stock, by Seal to Sharpe. Consequently, in this point of view, Seal could not be considered as being called to support his own interest by his testimony. But it is further contended by the counsel for the plaintiffs, that a verdict of recovery, by the plaintiffs in this action, would be evidence in an action brought afterwards by Sharpe against Seal, to recover an indemnity or compensation for the loss occasioned thereby to him by means of his having bound himself to indemnify and save harmless the sheriff. It has not been shown, I think, that such a verdict could be made evidence in such case upon any correct principle. From any thing that was disclosed on the trial, it has not been shown that any such action could be maintained by Sharpe against Seal. The only ground alleged for it is, that in the event of a recovery here by the plaintiffs, there would be a breach of the implied warranty of title to the stock given by Seal to Sharpe? But the incorrectness of this proposition has been shown already above. It might, however, be further illustrated by supposing a recovery had by the plaintiffs in this action, and a suit brought in consequence of such recovery by Sharpe against Seal. Sharpe, in order to maintain-his action, would, on the trial of it, have to prove his purchase of the stock from Seal. This would have to be his first step; and this he could only do by giving in evidence either the admissions of Seal, or by showing the fact otherwise, in connexion with the letter of attorney from Seal to him, showing that he effected the purchase as early as the 22d of April, 1836. Then, after having thus shown his purchase to be at least as early as that date, how could a recovery against the sheriff for not having taken the stock in execution afterwards, on the 6th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>of May, 1830, as the property of Seal, be made evidence upon any principle to support his claim <em>1 </em>Most clearly, it could not; because it is perfectly obvious, if Sharpe bought the stock of Seal on the 22d of April, 1836, that the sheriff could not have been made liable for not taking it in execution afterwards, on the 6th of the following month, as the property of Seal, unless during the interim Seal had repurchased, or by some means become the owner of it again; or that the sale between Seal and Sharpe was collusive and fraudulent; in either of which cases Sharpe would not be entitled to recover; and therefore the recovery in this action by the plaintiffs would be unavailing to him; and upon that ground alone, if upon no other, would be inadmissible as evidence. But if Seal had any real interest in the event of this suit, it would rather seem to have been such as might have inclined him in favour of a recovery by the plaintiffs; because they by such a recovery would have had their -judgment against Seal satisfied; and thus Seal, perhaps, might become relieved-from all further proceeding upon it against him. But since the plaintiff\u2019s have failed to recover, he of course still remains liable, and may expect <em>to be compelled, </em>if ever able, to pay it. We therefore think that the release from Parker to Seal, removed all objection to his competency as a witness for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The three remaining errors are exceptions to the charge of the court to the jury. On the trial of the cause the counsel for the plaintiffs asserted, that the legal title to the stock being vested in the name of Joshua T. Seal, though in reality purchased for the use of his brother Joseph, with the funds of the latter, made it properly liable to be taken in execution, and sold for the debts of Joshua. The court, however, in answer to this proposition, instructed the jury, that unless the stock was <em>oioned </em>by Joshua, it could not be taken in execution and sold for his debts: that if in point of fact it was made out, that his brother Joseph was the <em>owner </em>of it, that finished the controversy. The fourth error is an exception to this instruction of the court. It is proper to premise first, that at common law such stock could not have been taken in execution; and that in this case, when the sheriff had the execution put into his hands against Joshua T. Seal, it was only authorised by the act of the 29th of March, 1819; <em>Pard. Dig. </em>99, (1831,) 7 <em>Smith\u2019s L. </em>217. But by the provisions of tins act, it is plain that such stock is only made liable to be taken in execution for the debts of the <em>real, </em>owners thereof. Where the stock stands on the books of the corporation, in the name of the <em>real 'owner, </em>it may be taken in execution and sold, upon a judgment had against him, in- the same manner that goods and chattels are liable to be so taken and sold: but, when held in the name of <em>another, </em>process in the nature of a foreign attachment is required to be first issued against the stock, and the person in whose name it shall be so held, be summoned as a garnishee, after which the like proceeding thereon is directed to be had as in the case of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>foreign attachment. That such stock should be liable for the payment of the debts of its real owner, is perfectly just and equitable; but that it should be held liable to the payment of the debts also of the person in whose name it is holden would certainly be very unjust; and what, I apprehend, the legislature never intended. We therefore think that the instruction of the court to the jury on this point was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The counsel for the plaintiffs, on the trial, further claimed, that if the stock was suffered to remain on the books of the bank, in the name of Joshua T. Seal until after the execution came into the hands of the sherifF, it was liable to, and ought to have been taken in execution by him as the property of Joshua' T. Seal, notwithstanding the latter might have actually sold it previously thereto. The court, as to this, after stating that in the <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vaughan, </em>(3 <em>Binn. </em>394,) it was held that <em>stock, </em>assigned <em>bona fide, </em>for full value, on the certificate, and handed over with a power to transfer, conveyed such an interest that the stock was not liable afterwards to attachment as the property of the vendo:', although the transfer was not made on the books of the bank at the time of the attachment, then told the jury, \u201c that if on the 22d of April, 183G, Mr. Sharpe actually gave value for the stock, in good faith, and <em>took an </em>assignment and power to transfer, it authorised him to make defence to this suit.\u201d The counsel for the plaintiffs alleges that in this direction to the jury the court erred. And in order to support this allegation, it is argued that the same rule, which is requisite to make a transfer of ordinary goods and chattels valid against execution-creditors, ought to be observed and applied so far as practicable, in the transfer of stock: that to render a transfer of goods valid against the -claims -of the creditors of the vendor, a transmutation of the possession must accompany the transfer; but as this is not altogether practicable in the case of bank stock, on account of its not being susceptible of manual occupation or possession, yet if it will admit of any thing being done, which can fairly be considered equivalent to an actual change in possession of goods, it ought to be done, otherwise the sale ought to be held invalid, at least, as against the creditors of the vendor: that a transfer of the stock, on the books of the bank, would seem to be the only <em>thing </em>that can <em>be </em>deemed in such a case an equivalent to the vendee\u2019s taking the actual possession in the case of goods, and, therefore, unless done, the transfer ought not to avail against creditors. Though this reasoning may be ingenious, and not -without plausibility, yet it is believed that it would be contrary to the universal understanding, as also the practice of mankind, on <em>the </em>subject, to adopt it. Besides, although the legislature has made such stock the subject of execution, yet it cannot be said that the nature of it has been thereby changed, so as to have become in every respect the same or even similar to goods and chattels. For the debts of the <em>real </em>owner it is made liable to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>taken in execution; but as to what constitutes the <em>ownership </em>of it, or the nature of the evidence, by which it may be established, they are in nowise changed. The law in that respect remains the same as it was before the passage of the act subjecting it to execution. The actual possession and use of goods is a matter which is open and visible to all the world, and being also considered <em>prima facie </em>evidence of ownership, it has therefore not only in law, but likewise in the common estimation of mankind, been supposed to be sufficient to give such possessor a credit in his dealings and intercourse with the world equal to the value of the goods so held and used; and for this reason it has been held that a private purchaser of goods, even for a valuable consideration, who leaves them in the possession of the vendor, no matter from what motive, whether innocent or fraudulent, shall not be permitted afterwards to withdraw them from the execution-creditor of the vendor. But as to the stock, it, from its very nature, is incapable of such possession so as to make it known or notorious who has the use or benefit of it, and thus raise a general belief in regard to the ownership thereof: even its .existence may be unknown, excepting comparatively to but few persons. The only evidence of it that can be safely trusted as to this, is the books of the bank or the corporation; but they being of a private nature are not open to public inspection. Hence it is, that the ownership of such stock though held by the owner in his own name on the books of the corporation, is not supposed to have given him a general credit with the world. And for the same reason, if held by another in trust for him, the trustee is never supposed, by reason of its standing in his name on the books of the corporation, to have obtained a genera] credit on account of it. It is not, therefore, to apprise the world and prevent it from giving a false, credit to the apparent owner of stock that the transfer thereof is required to.be made on the books of the bank in the presence of one of its officers. The great object of requiring transfers to be made in this manner, is, to prevent all difficulty that otherwise might arise with those who have the direction and management of the bank, in ascertaining the persons who are to be regarded and treated by them as the owners of the stock and as corporators. No persons, therefore, are to be regarded by them as such, excepting those in whose names the stock is entered and holden. It is, therefore, only by means of an assignment . made of the stock on the books of the bank, in the presence of a proper officer thereof, that the assignee can claim to exercise the rights of a corporator, and to be recognised by the bank as such. But the act of assembly, under which the bank was incorporated, does not, nor yet does any other act, make void or invalidate assignments of the stock made in a different manner. Although they may not invest the assignee with the legal title to it, yet he will be considered in equity as the real owner thereof, and must be treated as such, when known, by all the world, excepting the bank, which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>for certain purposes, may refuse to do so. We, therefore, consider the instruction given by the court, on this point, to the jury, correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">A third proposition was advanced by the counsel for the plaintiffs on the trial; \u201c that as they offered to indemnify the sheriff, he was bound to proceed and sell the stock, whether Joshua T. Seal was the owner of it or not.\u201d The court, however, denied the correctness of this proposition, and instructed the jury that if Joshua T. Seal was not the owner of the stock at the time the execution came into the hands of the sheriff, the sheriff was not bound to proceed and sell it; This instruction of the court is made the subject of the last error assigned. It would certainly have been a most palpable error in the court, if it had affirmed the proposition advanced by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel on this point. It would, in effect, have been declaring, that it was the duty of the sheriff to do an illegal act, because the plaintiffs had offered to indemnify him if he did so. For surely it cannot be seriously alleged that it would not be an illegal act, and a most glaring violation of law, in a sheriff to seize and sell, knowingly, the property of a stranger or third person, under an execution, who was nowise liable for the payment of the debt or money thereby directed to be levied : yet it is evident that the sheriff would have done this very thing if he had proceeded and sold the stock in question, when it, in fact, belonged to Jesse Sharpe and not to Joshua T. Seal, the defendant in the execution. The sheriff, it is true, is bound to take property, when pointed out to him by the plaintiff in the execution as belonging to the defendant, if it be his in fact, though it may be doubtful at the time whether it is so or not; if the plaintiff offers to indemnify him. And if he should refuse in such case, after an indemnity offered, to proceed against the property under an execution, and the plaintiff, in a suit brought against the sheriff for not having so proceeded, should show clearly that the defendant in the execution was the owner of it at the time, the plaintiff would be entitled to recover; but not otherwise. So that the sheriff, if he refuses to take and sell the property, after being offered an indemnity by the plaintiff, takes the risk and responsibility upon himself of showing, if sued afterwards by the plaintiff, that the property did not belong to the defendant named in the execution; and this is the most that can be claimed of him. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
