Bonds had also been given for the same debt. Suit has been brought on the bonds and judgment obtained. Execution was issued on this -judgment; a levy was made on personal property which has been sold, and also on land; and the inquest found that the rents would pay tfie debt in seven years. No further proceedings were had on this judgment and execution. After all these proceedings were had, this <em>scire facias </em>was issued on the mortgage. The defendant contends that the former proceedings are a defence to a recovery in this action. I do not think so. Part of the debt is still unpaid. The plaintiff did not take out a <em>liberari facias. </em>If he had, and the officer had put him in possession, then it might be a question whether there could be a recovery in this case. As it is, the former proceedings are not sufficient to prevent the plaintiff\u2019s recovery in this action.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-11\">The defendant\u2019s counsel excepted to this charge, and took a writ \u25a0of error to this court. The only error assigned was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-12\">\u201c The court erred in charging the jury, that the judgment for the same debt on the 27th of-November, 1837, and the subsequent,proceedings thereupon, were insufficient to bar the plaintiff\u2019s recovery in this action,\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b164-13\">Mr. <em>Ihrie, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-14\">The plaintiff below ought to have moved to set aside the inquisition. \u2022 It appears from the record that he has had satisfaction. The remedies are not concurrent. An extent is a satisfaction. A plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>cannot discontinue a <em>ji. fa. </em>and take a new one after the return of the inquest. In support of these positions were cited <em>2 Tidd\u2019s Practice, </em>951.1043. Act of 1836, \u00a748. <em>M\u2018Cullough v. Guetner, </em>(1 <em>Binn. </em>214.) <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>M\u2018Clure, </em>(2 <em>Yeates, </em>387.) <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>(2 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>38.) 1 <em>Chitty Pl. </em>214.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b165-6\">Mr. <em>Hepburn, </em>contra, was stopped.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b165-7\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"Au1G\">An inquisition finding the land levied upon to. be sufficient to pay in seven years, has never been thought equivalent to satisfaction. The practice has been either to discontinue the <em>deri facias </em>by leave of the court, and sue out an alias against other property, or to wait till the property should be turned into cash by a sale on a -subsequent execution; in which case the creditor has always been let in on the proceeds. Even where there has been part satisfaction by enjoyment under an actual extent, the tenant having been deprived of his term by such a sale, is entitled to be let in as a lien creditor for the residue. Here the creditor had an independent security which nothing could prevent him from applying but an extinguishment of the debt; and as the levy and inquisition alone worked no such consequence, he was properly permitted to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
