There was a judgment for the plaintiff for $800 and costs. The case, except as to the amount involved, is like the case of <em>Norfolk and Western Railroad Company </em>v. Pendleton, 86 Va. 1004, in which case a judgment in favor of the same plaintiff was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">It is needless to repeat what was there said.
