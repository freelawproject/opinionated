But the said secretary of the commonwealth refused to receive the said charter of incorporation for the purpose of being lodged in his said office and recorded, and refused to receive such fees, upon the ground alleged that it was not proper for him so to do unless a fee of $200 should be paid into the state treasury, and the fact of such payment be certified to him by the auditor of public accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-3\">The relators say and allege that they are entitled, by law, to have the said certified charter of incorporation lodged in the office of the secretary of the commonwealth and recorded therein, without the payment of such fee of $200, and without the certification thereof, as claimed and required by the said secretary of the commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-4\">They make known to this court that they are without remedy in the premises without the interposition of the writ of <em>mandamus, </em>which they pray may issue out of this court, directed to the said ITenry \"YV. Flournoy,' Secretary of the Commonwealth of Virginia, commanding him to receive the said certified charter of incorporation of \u201c The Combined Saw and Planer Company \u201d in the office of the secretary of the commonwealth of Virginia, to be lodged therein, and that he cause the same to be recorded therein upon the same being presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>to him for such purpose by any person authorized to present the same and payment to him of the lawful fees for recording the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">A copy of the said petition of the relators was duly executed by delivery to Henry <em>W. </em>Flournoy, Secretary of the Commonwealth of Virginia, summoning him to appear and answer the same on the 5th day of March, 1891.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">By act of February 10th, 1890 (Acts of Assembly, chap. 54, p. 43) it was enacted : \u201c Section 1. That every charter of incorporation hereafter (granted under the provisions of section 1145 of the Code of Virginia, and every act of incorporation hereafter) passed by the general assembly, shall be and continue to be wholly inoperative and ineffectual for any and all purposes whatever until the payment of a fee to be ascertained and fixed as follows : For a company whose maximum capital stock is five thousand dollars, and not \u25a0 to exceed ten thousand dollars, ten dollars,\u201d &amp;c., closing up with \u201c over one million dollars, two hundred dollars.\u201d By act of February 28th, 1890 (Acts of Assembly, chap. 126, p. 98) it was enacted that section 1 of the act of February 10th, 1890, be amended and re-enacted so as to read as follows-: \u201c Section 1. That every charter of incorporation hereafter passed by the general assembly shall be and continue to be wholly inoperative and ineffectual for any and all purposes whatsoever until the payment of a fee to be ascertained and fixed as follows : For a company, &amp;c., after the words \u201c one million dollars, two hundred dollars \u201d are inserted \u201cFor the purposes of this act, the amount to which the company is authorized by the terms of its charter to increase its capital stock, shall be considered as its maximum capital stock, but the fee ta be paid under this section shall in no case exceed the \u25a0 sum of two hundred dollars.\u201d In the act of February 28th, the following words, \u25a0which were iu the act of February 10th, 1890, were omitted: \u201c granted under the provisions of section 1145 of the Code of Virginia, and every act of incorporation hereafter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>The act of February 28th, 1890, expressly refers to the statute of February 10th, 1890, and amends and re-enacts it so as to repeal the requirement of the payment of the fee required by the act of February 10th, 1890, of companies who obtained charters under section 1145 of the Code \u2014 that is, from the courts. There is now no law in force that a charter granted under the provisions of section 1145 shall be inoperative and ineffectual until the payment of the fees which are required of companies chartered by the general assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-3\">The respondent secretary of the commonwealth in his answer to the petition of the relators, says : \u201c Respondent verily believes, is advised and charges that the omission aforesaid was the result of misadventure and accident and not intended by the legislature. Hon. R. Walton Moore, senator from the fourteenth district, was the draftsman and patron of the bill in the senate where it, originated. He also prepared the amendment, and therefore \u2022 knows its purpose, true meaning and intent. In a written statement, sworn to and made in October past, at the request of the attorney-general filed herewith, marked exhibit <em>\u2018 C </em>\u2019 and prayed to be read as part hereof, Senator Moore says : \u2018 The omission of the words every charter of incorporation hereafter granted under the provisions of section 1145 Code of Virginia, in the printed act, is the result of a clerical error at some stage of the bill\u2019s progress, and not of the intention of the legislature to exempt court charters from the payment of the tax; because, as above-stated, there was never the faintest intimation of an intention to make such an exemption.\u2019 \u201d Thus, it is assumed, by a mere ministerial officer of the executive department of the government, to refuse to receive for lodgment and recordation in the office of the secretary of the .commonwealth of Virginia, a charter of incorporation granted by the corporation court of the .city of Alexandria, according to the provisions of section 1145 of the Code of Virginia, and duly certified to him by the clerk of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>said court, because <em>he \u201c </em>verily believes, is advised and charges <em>,T </em>that the deliberate repeal and positive exclusion from the act of 28th February, 1890, of the requirement as to charters granted by the courts according to law, contained in the act of February 10th, 1890, \u201c was the result of misadventure and accident and not intended by the legislature; \u201d and because the draftsman and patron of the bill in the legislature certifies, at the request of the attorney-general, that \u201c the omission of those words \u2018 every charter of incorporation hereafter granted under the provisions of section 1145 of the Code of Virginia, in the printed,\u2019 solemnly attested and promulgated act of February 28th, 1890, \u2018 is the result of a clerical error <em>at some stage of the bill\u2019s jrrogress l \u2019 \u201d </em>This cannot be allowed. It is forbidden by law, reason and public policy. See <em>Wise </em>v. <em>Bigger, </em>79 Va. (4 Hansbrough), 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">\u201c It is a well settled rule, that, when any statute is revised, or one act framed from another, some parts being omitted, the parts omitted are not revived by construction, but are to-be considered as annulled. To hold otherwise, would be to impute to the legislature gross carelessness, or ignorance, which is altogether inadmissible.\u201d <em>Ellis v. Paige, </em>9 Pickering, 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">\u201c When a statute is revised, and a provision contained in it is omitted in the new statute, the inference to be drawn from such a course of legislation, would be that a change in the law was intended to be made. If the omission was by accident, it belongs to the legislature to supply it.\u201d <em>Buck </em>v. Spofford, 31 Maine, 36; see, also, <em>Bedell </em>v. <em>Janney, </em>4 Gilman, 200. \u201c Statutes which impose restrictions upon trade or common occupation, or which levy an excise or tax upon them, must be construed strictly.\u201d <em>Sewell </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>9 Pickering, 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-6\">\u201c Statutes levying duties or taxes .upon subjects or citizens are to be construed most strongly against the government, and in favor of their subjects or citizens, and their provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>are not to be extended, by implication, beyond the clear.import of the language used. Revenue laws are neither remedial statutes nor laws founded upon any permanent public policy, and are not therefore to be liberally construed. Hence, whenever there is a just doubt, that doubt should absolve the taxpayer from his burden.\u201d <em>Mayor of Savannah </em>v. <em>Hartridge, </em>8 Georgia, 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-3\"><em>\u201c </em>I do not think that a strained construction is allowable of an act which levies money from the citizen. The amount of the levy, the subject of it, and the method of raising it ought to be so plainly pointed out, as to avoid all danger of oppression by an erroneous interpretation; and where there is a fair doubt, the citizen should have the advantage of it.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bank of Newburn, </em>1 Devereux &amp; Battles, 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-4\">\u201c It is a well settled rule of law that every charge upon the subject must be imposed by clear and unambiguous language. Acts of Parliament which impose a duty upon the public, will be critically construed with reference to the particular language in which they are expressed. 'When there is any <em>ambiguity </em>found, the construction must be in favor of the public, because it is a general rule that when the public are to be charged with a burden, the intention of the legislature to impose that burden must be explicitly and distinctly shown.\u201d Dwarris on Statutes, 255 \u2014 789, Ed. 1885. \u201c In the revenue laws where clauses inflicting pains and penalties are ambiguously or obscurely worded, the interpretation is ever in favor of the subject, for the plain reason that the legislature is ever at hand and explains its own meaning, and to express more clearly what has been obscurely expressed.\u201d Dwarris on Statutes, 251, Ed. 1885.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-6\">The act of February 28th, 1890, has no effect whatever as to charters obtained through the courts; and, according to the law, section 1145, Code of Virginia, two duties are required of the secretary of the commonwealth, viz: lodgment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>recordation in his office, upon the certificate of the clerk of the court which has granted the charter, and the presentation of the charter and the payment of the proper and lawful fee. The respondent has refused to perform a mere ministerial function and duty imposed by law; and our judgment is that the writ of <em>mandamus </em>shall issue according to. the petition of the relators. <em>Let the writ go.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">Mandamus awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
