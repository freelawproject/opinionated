The defendant was prosecuted for an assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-15\">\u201c An assault,\u201d says Mr. Davis, \u201c is an <em>attempt or offer, </em>with force and violence, to do some bodily hurt to another, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>from wantonness or malice, by means calculated to produce the end if carried into execution \u2014 as by striking at him with a stick or other weapon, or without a weapon, though he be not struck, or even by raising up the arm or a cane in a menacing manner, * * * * or any similar act accompanied with circumstances denoting an intention, coupled with a present ability, of using actual violence against the person of another.\u201d Davis\u2019 Cr. L., pp. 353-4. And Mr. Russell, speaking upon the same point, at page 563 of the first volume of his book on Grimes, says : \u201c Although to constitute an assault there must be present ability to inflict an injury, yet, if a man is advancing in a threatening attitude to strike another, so that the blow would almost immediately reach him if he were not stopped, this has been held an assault.\u201d And to the same effect are all the authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-6\">In this case the evidence shows, indeed, that the defendant was approaching the prosecutor, and gesticulating; but the evidence is equally clear that he was not approaching him for the purpose of offering violence to him; for the testimony of the prosecutor, with whom the other witnesses agree, is express that the defendant <em>\u201c </em>did not strike,\u201d and did \u201c not attempt to strike,\u201d him. It follows, therefore, that the charge is not made out by the evidence. The j udgment of the circuit court is therefore erroneous, and must be reversed, and the prosecution dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
