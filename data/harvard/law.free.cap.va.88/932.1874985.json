An injunction was awarded, according to the prayer of the bill, to restrain the defendant telegraph company, its agents and attorneys, from further proceedings in the county of Sussex for the condemnation of a right of way upon the road-way of the railroad company until the telegraph company should produce the books and papers called for, by Hon. W. S. Barton, judge of the tenth judicial circuit, which was directed to the clerk of the chancery court of Richmond on the 8th day of June, 1889. The said injunction was dissolved on the 5th day of July, 1889, upon the answer and pleas of the defendant company, whereupon an amended bill was filed, seeking the said injunction; but the chancery court refused the injunction prayed for in the amended bill, when the plaintiff, as is provided by statute, applied to one of the judges of this court, who awarded the said injunction as prayed for, and cei'tified the same to the clerk of the chancery court of the city of Richmond on the 12th day of August, 1889. On the 19th day of the month of August, 1889, the said injunction vras dissolved by the chancery court of the city of Richmond,.whereupon the [Norfolk and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>Western Railroad Company applied for and obtained an-appeal to this court, which was granted on the 4th day of November, 1889, by one of the judges of this court. The decrees appealed from dissolving the injunction on the original bill and the amended bill are plainly right.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">1. The bill calls for a discovery for what does not appertain to and is not necessary for the title of the plaintiff, but appertains to the title of the defendant, into which he cannot pry in this way. Hence, the defendant has the right to resist by demurrer any inquiries which call upon him to disclose the nature and character of his own title to the subject-matter of the controversy.\u201d \u201c The doctrine may be well summed up in two propositions (Wig. Disc., 2d Ed., \u00a7\u00a7 26, 27, and note) : (1) It is a right as a general rule, of the plaintiff in equity to exact from the defendant a discovery upon oath as to all matters of fact which are well pleaded in the bill and material to \u25a0 the proof of the plaintiff\u2019s case about to come on for trial, and which the defendant does not, by his form of pleading, admit. (2) The right of the plaintiff in equity to the benefit of the defendant\u2019s oath is limited to a discovery of such material facts as relate to the plaintiff\u2019s case, and does not extend to discovery of the manner in which the defendant\u2019s case is to be exclusively established, or to evidence which relates exclusively to his [the defendant\u2019s] case.\u201d Story, Eq. Pl., \u00a7 572, p. 584, and authorities cited. And the injunction should have been dissolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">2. For another reason : The bill seeks to enjoin the acts and proceedings of the defendant alleged to be in progress in the county of Sussex, and not in the city of Richmond; and our statute (Code Va., \u00a7 3436) requires an injunction to be brought in the county where the act done or proceedings enjoined take place. Section 3436 is as follows : \u201c Jurisdiction of a bill for an injunction to any judgment, act, or proceeding shall be in the circuit court of the county, or the circuit or corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>court of the corporation, in which the judgment is rendered or in which the act or proceeding is to be done, or is doing or apprehended.\u201d For these reasons, conclusive of the questions raised here, we are of opinion to affirm the decrees appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-3\">Decree aeeirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
