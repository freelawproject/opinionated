To this the witness assented, and as they Avere on their AAniy, she says, they met Lyles, who inquired: \u201cIs the d \u2014 d son of a b\u2014 dead ? \u201d To which the prisoner replied: \u201c Yes, and gone to hell.\u201d Continuing on their Avay, the prisoner remarked that Lyles had killed her husband, and that she had gotten him to do it; that she loved him better than her husband, aaIio had been \u201c as mean as hell\u201d to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty, upon Avhich the prisoner aaus sentenced to be hanged. We think the e\\ddenee Avai\u2019ranted the verdict. At all events, there is nothing in the record to justify this court in setting it aside, and awarding a nerv trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
