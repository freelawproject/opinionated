Reg. at 2923. Accordingly, HHS promulgated regulations forbidding Title X grantees from providing counseling or referrals for, or otherwise encouraging, promoting, or advocating abortion as a method of family planning.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2945. To prevent grantees from evading these restrictions, the regulations placed limitations on the list of medical providers that a program must offer patients as part of a required referral for prenatal care.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Such a list was required to exclude providers whose principal business is the provision of abortions, had to include providers who do not provide abortions, and could not weigh in favor of providers who perform abortions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2945. The regulations also required grantees to keep their Title X funded projects \"physically and financially separate\" from all abortion-related services that the grantee might also provide (the \"physical-separation\" requirement).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In 1991, the Supreme Court upheld the 1988 regulations against a challenge in\n   <em>\n    Rust v.

If a program promotes, encourages, or advocates abortion as a method of family planning, or if the program refers patients to abortion providers for family planning purposes, then that program is logically one \"where abortion is a method of family planning.\" Accordingly, the Final Rule's prohibitions on advocating, encouraging, or promoting abortion, as well as on referring patients for abortions, are reasonable and in accord with \u00a7 1008.

And we discern no \"clear and manifest\" intent by Congress to amend or repeal \u00a7 1008 via either of these laws-indeed, neither law even refers to \u00a7 1008. The appropriations rider mentions abortion only to prohibit appropriated funds from being expended for abortions; and \u00a7 1554 of the ACA does not even\n   <em>\n    mention\n   </em>\n   abortion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As neither statute impliedly amended or repealed \u00a7 1008, the question is therefore whether the Final Rule is nonetheless \"not in accordance with law\" because its provisions are incompatible with the appropriations rider or \u00a7 1554 of the ACA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A). We think that HHS is likely to succeed on its challenge to the district\n   courts' preliminary injunctions because the Final Rule is not contrary to either provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The appropriations rider conditions HHS funding on a requirement that no Title X funds be expended on abortion, and that \"all pregnancy counseling shall be nondirective.\" Pub. L. No. 115-245, div. B, tit. II, 132 Stat 2981, 3070-71 (2018). (The plain text of the rider actually seems to\n   <em>\n    reinforce\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1008's restrictions on funding abortion-related activities.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The district courts held that the Final Rule's counseling and referral requirements directly conflicted with the appropriations rider's \"nondirective\" mandate. But its mandate is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   that nondirective counseling be given in every case. It is that such counseling as is given shall be nondirective. The Final Rule similarly does not require that any pregnancy counseling be given, only that if given, such counseling shall be nondirective (and may include neutrally-presented information about abortion).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%207716\">\n    84 Fed. Reg. 7716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Under the [F]inal [R]ule, the Title X regulations no longer require pregnancy counseling, but permits the use of Title X funds in programs that provide pregnancy counseling, so long as it is nondirective.\"). The Final Rule is therefore not in conflict with the appropriations rider's nondirective pregnancy counseling mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Although the Final Rule\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   require the provision of referrals to non-abortion providers,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%207716\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%207716\">\n    at 7788-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , such referrals do not constitute \"pregnancy counseling.\" First, providing a referral is not \"counseling.\" HHS has defined \"nondirective counseling\" as \"the meaningful presentation of options where the [medical professional] is not suggesting or advising one option over another,\" 84 Fed. Reg. at 7716, whereas a \"referral\" involves linking a patient to another provider who can give further counseling or treatment,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7748. The Final Rule treats referral and counseling as distinct terms, as has Congress and HHS under previous administrations.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300z-10 ; 53 Fed. Reg. at 2923 ; 2928-38 (1988);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20Fed.%20Reg.%2041272\">\n    65 Fed. Reg. 41272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -75 (2000). We therefore conclude that the Final Rule's referral requirement is not contrary to the appropriations rider's nondirective pregnancy counseling mandate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   But even if referrals are included under the rubric of \"pregnancy counseling,\" it is not clear that referring a patient to a non-abortion doctor is necessarily \"directive.\" Nondirective counseling does not require equal treatment of all pregnancy options-rather, it just requires that a provider not affirmatively endorse one option over another. 84 Fed. Reg. at 7716. When Congress wants specific pregnancy options to be given equal treatment, it knows how to say so\n   <em>\n    explicitly\n   </em>\n   . For example, Congress has mandated that \"adoption information and referrals\" shall be provided \"on an equal basis with all other courses of action included in nondirective counseling.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 254c-6(a)(1) (emphasis added). If \"nondirective\" already meant that all pregnancy options (including adoption) shall be given equal treatment, it would render meaningless Congress's explicit instruction that adoption be treated on an\n   <em>\n    equal basis\n   </em>\n   with other pregnancy options. \"[C]ourts avoid a reading that renders\n   some words altogether redundant.\" Scalia, Antonin, and Garner, Bryan A., Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts (2012) 176. Congress has enacted no such statutory provision explicitly requiring the equal treatment of abortion in pregnancy counseling and referrals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   We next consider \u00a7 1554 of the ACA. As a threshold matter, it seems likely that any challenge to the Final Rule relying on \u00a7 1554 is waived because Plaintiffs concede that HHS was not put on notice of this specific challenge during the public comment period, such that HHS did not have an \"opportunity to consider the issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Portland Gen.

Although some commenters stated that the proposed Final Rule was contrary to the ACA\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   , and still others used generic language similar to that contained in \u00a7 1554, preservation of a challenge requires that the \"specific argument\" must \"be raised before the agency, not merely the same general legal issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Koretoff v.

We think that is precisely what the district courts did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   To find that the Final Rule's enactment was arbitrary and capricious, the district courts generally ignored HHS's explanations, reasoning, and predictions whenever they disagreed with the policy conclusions that flowed therefrom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   For example, with respect to the physical separation requirement, the district courts ignored HHS's reasoning for its re-imposition of that requirement (which was approved by\n   <em>\n    Rust\n   </em>\n   ): that physical separation would ensure that Title X funds are not used to subsidize abortions via co-location of Title X programs in abortion clinics.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   84 Fed. Reg. at 7763-68. HHS's reasoning included citation to data suggesting \"that abortions are increasingly performed at sites that focus primarily on contraceptive and family planning services-sites that could be recipients of Title X funds.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7765. Similarly, the district courts ignored HHS's primary reasoning for prohibiting abortion counseling and referrals: that such restrictions are required by HHS's reasonable reading of \u00a7 1008 (again, approved by\n   <em>\n    Rust\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7746-47. Further, the district courts ignored HHS's consideration of the effects that the Final Rule would likely have on the number of Title X providers, and credited Plaintiffs' speculation that the Final Rule would \"decimate\" the Title X provider network, rather than HHS's prediction-based on evidence cited in the administrative record-\"that honoring statutory protections of conscience in Title X may increase the number of providers in the program,\" by attracting new providers who were previously deterred from participating in the program\n   by the former requirement to provide abortion referrals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7780.

With respect to the Final Rule's definition of \"advanced practice provider,\" and its provision on whether family planning methods must be \"medically approved,\" HHS reasoned that these provisions would clarify subjects that had caused confusion in the past. 84 Fed. Reg. at 7727-28, 32. Although the district courts insist that HHS failed to consider that the Final Rule requires providers to violate medical ethics, HHS did consider and respond to comments arguing just that.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7724, 7748.

As the Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Rust\n   </em>\n   , \"the government may make a value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion, and ... implement that judgment by the allocation of public funds,\" and by \"declining to 'promote or encourage abortion.' \"\n   <em>\n    Rust\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6220676\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/173/\">\n    500 U.S. at 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6220676\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/173/\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, forcing HHS to wait until the conclusion of a potentially lengthy appeals process to implement the Final Rule will necessarily result in predictable administrative costs, and will beget significant uncertainty in the Title X program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The harms that Plaintiffs would likely suffer if a stay is granted are comparatively minor. The main potential harms that Plaintiffs identify are based on their prediction that implementation of the Final Rule will cause an immediate and steep decline in the number of Title X providers. But these potential harms obviously rely on crediting Plaintiffs' predictions about the effect of implementing the Final Rule, over HHS's predictions that implementation of the final rule will have the\n   <em>\n    opposite\n   </em>\n   effect. As described above, we think that HHS's predictions-supported by reasoning and evidence in the record ( 84 Fed. Reg. at 7780 )-is entitled to more deference than Plaintiffs' contrary predictions. While some Title X grantees will certainly incur financial costs associated with complying with the Final Rule if the preliminary injunctions are stayed, we think that harm is minor relative to the harms to the Government described above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Because HHS and the public interest would be irreparably harmed absent a\n   stay, harms to Plaintiffs from a stay will be comparatively minor, and HHS is likely to prevail in its challenge of the preliminary injunction orders before a merits panel of this court (which is set to hear the cases on an expedited basis), we conclude that a stay of the district courts' preliminary injunction orders pending appeal is proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The motion for a stay pending appeal is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Under the 2000 regulations, \"nondirective\" counseling meant the provision of \"factual, neutral information about any option, including abortion, as [medical providers] consider warranted by the circumstances, ...
