The district court dismissed Sissom's complaint for lack of jurisdiction as to all defendants, holding that they are entitled to sovereign immunity. We AFFIRM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 1998, the Texas State Board of Education approved the University of Texas at Austin to establish UT High School, an online high school program authorized to award high school credits and diplomas. UT High School is governed by the University of Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Sissom enrolled in UT High School in 2014 and attended for the next two and a half years until he seemingly graduated from the school. Sissom, proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , filed suit against the University of Texas at Austin, UT High School, Beth Cooper (UT High School's principal), Steve Rosen (Associate Vice President for Legal Affairs for the University of Texas), and Steve Walls (UT High School's superintendent) in their official capacities, alleging claims of \"gaslighting\" as well as violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Sissom bases his claims on the events that allegedly occurred while he was a student at UT High School. At bottom, Sissom alleges that UT High School's various policies and practices regarding grading and ranking \"knocked [him] out of the running\" for various scholarships and admissions into prestigious colleges. Sissom also alleges that UT High School's officials conspired to do so in order to gaslight-or cause psychological harm to-him. The district court dismissed Sissom's complaint for lack of jurisdiction, holding that all of the defendants enjoy sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment. Sissom appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We review a district court's dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Meyers ex rel.

Although neither\n   party points us to a Texas statute or court case directly relevant to UT High School, Sissom's complaint and documents appended thereto show that UT High School is considered a department within, and governed by, the University of Texas at Austin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The University is an entity within the University of Texas System and governed by the Board of Regents of the System.

King v. Univ. of Tex. Health Sci. Ctr.-Houston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3896739\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/544/490/#p495\">\n    544 F.

In filing his complaint, Sissom attached a copy of the receipt for his payment of course fees. The receipt shows that Sissom paid his fees not to UT High School, but to the University of Texas at Austin, which in turn issued the receipt. The fact that Sissom's payment went to the University supports UT High School's argument that, unlike an ordinary school board, it is dependent on the University, a state agency, for its funding. Although the Texas Board of Education meeting minutes show that UT High School was approved under the condition that \"[n]o state funds shall be used to support the program,\" UT High School contends that this means that UT High School cannot receive any\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   funding from the state except through the University. We conclude that UT High School's argument is consistent with the record evidence that Sissom himself provided: Students pay the University for attending UT High School. Thus, we hold that the second\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   factor favors treating UT High School, which is dependent on the University for funding, as an arm of the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The third\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   factor-autonomy-also favors UT High School. The available record evidence provided by Sissom shows that UT High School is governed by the University. The fourth\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   factor-scope of the problem-further favors UT High School. We previously noted that \"[e]ducation and research are statewide concerns.\"\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3896739\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/544/490/#p495\">\n    544 F. App'x at 498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But more importantly, UT High School is an online program available to all residents in the State of Texas and not confined to a specific locality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Whom the fifth\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   factor-ability to sue and be sued in its own name-favors is unclear. Neither party has pointed us to a case in which UT High School was a party, or was named a party, in a suit. However, Sissom's documents show that the University's associate vice president for legal affairs corresponded with Sissom to address his concerns, which tends to support the proposition that UT High School may not have the ability to sue and be sued on its own. Ultimately, however, we cannot make a conclusion as to which party this factor favors. The last\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   factor-ability to hold property-favors UT High School. The Board of Regents of the University of Texas System controls the management of the University's property, including UT High School's.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Educ. Code \u00a7 65.39. Furthermore, Sissom's payment of fees to the University demonstrates that the University-not UT High School-controls UT High School's funds and property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We conclude that UT High School is an instrumentality of the State of Texas that enjoys sovereign immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed Sissom's complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the Eleventh Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Although Sissom claims to appeal the district court's dismissal of his complaint as to the University of Texas, Cooper, Rosen, and Walls in the table of contents of his opening brief, the argument section of his brief does not provide or develop any argument on why the district court's dismissal was erroneous as to these defendants. \"Although [this court] liberally construe[s] the briefs of pro se appellants, [this court] also require[s] that arguments must be briefed to be preserved.\"\n   <em>\n    Yohey v.
