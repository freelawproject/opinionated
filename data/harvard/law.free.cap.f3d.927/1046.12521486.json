The case concerns a Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") request Rojas submitted to the FAA after the FAA notified him that he was ineligible for an Air Traffic Control Specialist position based on his performance on a screening test called the Biographical Assessment (\"BA\"). The district court held that (1) the FAA fulfilled its FOIA obligations by conducting a reasonable search for the requested information and (2) the FAA properly withheld nine pages of summary documents pursuant to Exemption 5 as inter-agency memoranda subject to the attorney work-product doctrine. We have jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Biographical Assessment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In November 2012, the FAA hired Applied Psychological Techniques, Inc. (\"APTMetrics\"), a human resources consulting firm, to review and recommend improvements to the FAA's hiring process for Air Traffic Control Specialists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2013, APTMetrics developed the BA test to replace the FAA's existing Air Traffic Selection and Training Test. The BA is an initial screening test that determines whether an applicant possesses certain characteristics empirically shown to predict success in an Air Traffic Control Specialist position. These characteristics include flexibility, risk-tolerance, self-confidence,\n   dependability, resilience, stress tolerance, cooperation, teamwork, and rules application. The FAA implemented the BA for the first time during the 2014 hiring cycle for Air Traffic Control Specialist applicants. In Summer and Fall 2014, the FAA revised the BA, and APTMetrics performed validation work related to the revised BA (the \"2015 BA\"). The 2015 BA was subsequently incorporated in the 2015 Air Traffic Control Specialist hiring process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In November 2014, the FAA Office of the Chief Counsel asked John Scott (\"Scott\"), then Chief Operating Officer of APTMetrics, to create \"summaries and explanations\" of its validation work on the 2015 BA in anticipation of litigation on the FAA's hiring practices. Scott provided the Office of the Chief Counsel with an initial summary in December 2014 and a supplement in January 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Rojas's Application and FOIA Request\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In early 2015, Rojas applied for an Air Traffic Control Specialist position with the FAA. During the application process, he completed the 2015 BA. On May 21, 2015, the FAA notified Rojas that he was ineligible for a position based on his responses to the BA. Rojas's rejection notification briefly described the BA and stated that the test was \"independently validated by outside experts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 24, 2015, Rojas emailed the FAA a FOIA request seeking \"information regarding the empirical validation of the biographical assessment noted in [his] rejection notification [from the FAA]. This includes any report created by, given to, or regarding APTMetrics' evaluation and creation and scoring of the assessment.\" On June 18, 2015, the FAA, through the Office of the Chief Counsel, denied Rojas's FOIA request for documents on the empirical validation of the 2015 BA. The FAA reasoned that these records were, in part, protected as attorney work-product and therefore subject to Exemption 5 of FOIA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5). On June 24, 2015, Rojas filed an administrative appeal contesting the FAA's denial of his FOIA request. On October 7, 2015, the FAA remanded Rojas's case to the Office of the Chief Counsel because the agency incorrectly searched for documents on the empirical validation of the 2014 BA, instead of the 2015 BA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Pursuant to the remand, attorneys at the Office of the Chief Counsel reviewed records on the empirical validation of the 2015 BA. They located the following three documents: (1) a summary of the Air Traffic Control Specialist hiring process, dated December 2, 2014; (2) a summary of the 2015 BA, dated January 29, 2015; and (3) a summary of the validation process and results of the 2015 BA, dated September 2, 2015. All of these records were created by APTMetrics and are identified in the FAA's Vaughn Index.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The FAA denied\n   Rojas's FOIA request for the second time on December 10, 2015, once again invoking Exemption 5 and the attorney work-product doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On July 31, 2015, Rojas filed a complaint in district court, alleging that the FAA withheld information on the empirical validation of the 2015 BA in violation of FOIA. On September 21, 2016, the district court ordered the FAA to disclose the three documents identified in its Vaughn Index for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the FAA on November 10, 2016, holding that the three responsive records were properly withheld under Exemption 5 as attorney work-product. The court also concluded that there was no genuine dispute of material fact that the FAA adequately searched for relevant documents. Rojas timely appeals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R.

The declaration of Yvette Armstead, the FAA's Assistant Chief Counsel, states that the agency \"conducted a search for documents responsive to [Rojas]'s FOIA request\" on two occasions-both initially and on remand from Rojas's administrative appeal. Armstead further explains that the search was \"reasonably calculated to obtain responsive records\" because attorneys at the Office of the Chief Counsel who provided legal advice on revisions to the Air Traffic Control Specialist hiring process \"were asked to review their records.\" Attorneys located \"[t]hree responsive documents\" comprised of nine pages in total that \"discuss[ ] the validation of the 2015 BA.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Armstead's declaration is conclusory. It omits relevant details, such as names of the attorneys who searched the relevant documents and the amount of time the Office of the Chief Counsel devoted to the search.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Citizens Comm'n\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    on Human Rights\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7415720\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/45/1325/#p1328\">\n    45 F.3d at 1328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that agency's search was adequate where its declaration stated that the agency spent over 140 hours reviewing documents in response to the plaintiff's FOIA request). The documents the FAA located included summaries of the Air Traffic Control Specialist hiring process, the 2015 BA, and the validation process and results of the 2015 BA. But summaries by necessity summarize something else; there is no indication that there was any search conducted for underlying documents. Thus, though Armstead's declaration establishes that appropriate employees were contacted and briefly describes the files that were discovered, it does not demonstrate that the FAA's search could reasonably be expected to produce the information requested-here, \"information regarding the empirical validation of the biographical assessment\n   noted in Rojas's rejection notification.\" Construing the facts in the light most favorable to Rojas, the FAA has not shown \"that it undertook an adequate search,\"\n   <em>\n    Lane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3783392\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/523/1128/#p1137\">\n    523 F.3d at 1139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

By its plain terms, Exemption 5 applies only to records that the government creates and retains. However, a number of our sister circuits have adopted a functional interpretation of Exemption 5 that treats documents produced by an agency's third-party consultant as \"intra-agency\" memorandums. This functional interpretation, called the consultant corollary, recognizes that a third-party consultant may perform certain functions on behalf of a government agency. The consultant corollary treats communications from third-party consultants as \"intra-agency\" memorandums under Exemption 5, as if those communications came from the agency itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The district court seems to have relied on the consultant corollary in determining that the FAA properly invoked Exemption 5 in this case. It reasoned that \"courts have upheld the application of FOIA Exemption 5 to materials composed and supplied by outside contractors.\" At the same time, the court concluded that the records \"constitute\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   -agency memoranda created by a government agency.\" The description of the documents as \"\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   -agency memoranda\" is incorrect.

Therefore, the exchange of records between it and the FAA cannot be an inter-agency exchange.\n   <em>\n    See Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th Ed. 2014) (defining the preposition \"inter\" as \"among\"). Under the consultant corollary, to which the district court's reasoning alludes, the documents would be classified as \"\n   <em>\n    intra\n   </em>\n   -agency.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We have yet to adopt the consultant corollary in this Circuit, though we have previously acknowledged it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here,\n   the role of APTMetrics as a consultant to the FAA is undisputed. Therefore, we must now decide whether to adopt the consultant corollary to Exemption 5.

The dissent also construes \"intra-agency\" to mean records held within an agency, even though they may have originated with a third-party consultant. But that renders superfluous the term \"\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   -agency\" as used alongside \"intra-agency\" in Exemption 5.

While the dissent is critical of the Sixth Circuit decision,\n   <em>\n    Lucaj\n   </em>\n   provides a reasoned discussion of the interplay between the consultant corollary, the language of Exemption 5, and the purpose of FOIA.

We are not convinced that the potential harm to the government warrants adopting the consultant corollary's broad reading of Exemption 5. While today's holding means some privileged documents from third-party consultants will be subject to disclosure under FOIA, the dissent's suggestion that it will open the floodgates is speculative. And, absent the consultant corollary, agencies can still avoid disclosure under Exemption 5 by keeping potentially privileged material within the government. If this proves unworkable, as the dissent argues, the proper remedy lies with Congress, not the courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Because we reject the consultant corollary, the records at issue can no longer be considered \"intra-agency\" documents, and Exemption 5 does not apply.

Circuits, all of which adopted the consultant corollary to shield work product generated by the government's outside consultants in anticipation of litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the majority's decision rejects the corollary, upends basic discovery rules, and disregards the careful balance Congress struck when it enacted the FOIA, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The circumstances in which the present dispute arose provide critical context for its resolution. In 2012, the FAA undertook a comprehensive review of the Air Traffic Control Specialist selection and hiring process and hired APTMetrics, a human resource consulting firm, to assist in that effort. APTMetrics modified a biographical assessment tool the FAA used to test job-related characteristics. In 2014, the FAA implemented a refined process for selecting air traffic controllers, incorporating APTMetrics's recommendations. Following the implementation of the FAA's new process, an unsuccessful applicant filed an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) complaint, seeking to represent a class of unsuccessful air traffic controller applicants. That putative class is represented by Mr. Rojas's counsel. The FAA then revised the biographical assessment for use in 2015, and APTMetrics worked on those revisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Meanwhile, in anticipation of the pending EEOC litigation, the FAA asked the Chief Operating Officer of APTMetrics to prepare a summary of its validation work. APTMetrics delivered an initial summary in December of 2014 and supplemented it the following month. By August of 2015, a second group of unsuccessful applicants\n   filed a complaint and petition for class certification, this time challenging the 2015 biographical assessment. The second putative class is also represented by Mr. Rojas's lawyer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Mr. Rojas applied, but was not hired, to be an air traffic control specialist in 2015. He later filed a FOIA request seeking information about the biological assessment's empirical validation and its \"evaluation and creation and scoring.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The FAA conducted a search and found three documents that APTMetrics created at the FAA's request and in anticipation of litigating the EEOC complaints. The FAA withheld the three documents pursuant to FOIA's Exemption 5, which exempts from disclosure \"inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party ... in litigation with the agency.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5). The FAA claimed the withheld documents were protected attorney-client communications and work product, and that they were pre-decisional and deliberative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Mr. Rojas filed an administrative appeal and, eventually, a complaint in district court challenging the denial of his FOIA request. The district court conducted an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review, ruled that the FAA's search for records was reasonable, and granted summary judgment in favor of the government. The court described the withheld documents as \"summaries of [1] the [air traffic control] hiring process, [2] the 2015 biographic assessment, and [3] the validation process and results.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Our review of the district court's order granting summary judgment is governed by several well-established principles that the majority does not dispute. First, we know that materials prepared in anticipation of litigation and at the request of an attorney are protected work product and need not be produced in litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hickman v.

R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4) (exempting draft expert reports, communications with expert witnesses, and consulting experts materials from discovery). Third, the Supreme Court has explained that FOIA's Exemption 5 precludes the disclosure of information that would be privileged in litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Weber Aircraft Corp\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337576\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/792/#p801\">\n    465 U.S. 792\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 799-802,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337576\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/792/#p801\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337576\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/792/#p801\">\n    79 L.Ed.2d 814\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984) (explaining that certain air crash safety investigation materials could be withheld pursuant to FOIA's Exemption 5 because courts had previously recognized that those materials were privileged in discovery). These principles alone dictate the appropriate resolution in this case: because the validation summaries would not be available to Mr. Rojas in discovery, he cannot acquire them through a FOIA request.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The majority concludes that Exemption 5 only shields materials generated by federal agencies in-house, not those created\n   by the government's retained consultants. Seven other circuits have considered this argument and rejected it. These circuits all adopted the \"consultant corollary,\" agreeing that Exemption 5 reflects Congress's determination that the government is entitled to the same litigation privileges afforded to other parties. Indeed, the propriety of the consultant corollary was foreshadowed by well-recognized precedent defining the scope and proper application of litigation privileges and protections. The Supreme Court has \"consistently rejected\" the suggestion that parties in litigation with the government \"can obtain through the FOIA material that is normally privileged\" or use FOIA requests \"to supplement civil discovery.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 801-02,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337576\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/792/#p801\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We do not think that Congress could have intended that the weighty policies underlying discovery privileges could be so easily circumvented.\").

But long before Congress passed the FOIA, courts and legislatures recognized that parties to litigation are entitled to shield certain materials from discovery and disclosure.

The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Lucaj\n   </em>\n   was arrested in Montenegro, and the FBI believed that he was connected to terrorist attacks.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 543. Because Lucaj believed the United States played a role in his arrest, he sent a FOIA request to the FBI.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 543-44. The FBI produced some responsive documents, but it withheld two that the Department of Justice had\n   <em>\n    sent to foreign law enforcement agencies\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 544-45.

In the process of issuing this ruling, the Sixth Circuit purported to reject the consultant corollary,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 546-47, but because no consultants or consultant-created materials were at issue in\n   <em>\n    Lucaj\n   </em>\n   , its brief rejection of the consultant corollary can only be regarded as dictum.

The Court rejected the Department's claim that it could withhold the Tribe's settlement proposal under Exemption 5-but not because it rejected the consultant corollary. On the contrary, the Court acknowledged that in the cases where courts have applied the consultant corollary, \"the records submitted by outside consultants played essentially the same part in an agency's process of deliberation as documents prepared by agency personnel might have done.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9300487\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/1/#p12\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But\n    <em>\n     Weber\n    </em>\n    is hardly supportive of the majority's analysis. Indeed, contrary to the majority's holding here,\n    <em>\n     Weber\n    </em>\n    explained that the plain language of Exemption 5 incorporated discovery privileges and allowed agencies to shield privileged materials.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337576\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/792/#p801\">\n     465 U.S. at 799-801\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337576\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/792/#p801\">\n     104 S.Ct. 1488\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    The fact that consultant-prepared materials may constitute \"intra-agency memorandums\" for purposes of Exemption 5 does not mean that agencies are obligated to search for responsive FOIA materials held only by consultants. As the majority explains, the Supreme Court's decision in\n    <em>\n     Forsham v. Harris\n    </em>\n    forecloses Rojas's challenge to the FAA's failure to search APTMetrics's files in response to his FOIA request. I share the majority's concern about the possibility that the FOIA could be circumvented by storing materials offsite with agency contractors. But I agree with the majority that we are bound by\n    <em>\n     Forsham\n    </em>\n    , and it dictates that Rojas cannot access APTMetrics's offsite documents through a FOIA request.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    I also agree with the majority's conclusion that the FAA has failed to show that it undertook an adequate in-house search.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 1052-54. However, the proper scope of a FOIA search is distinct from whether materials falling within that scope may be exempted from disclosure.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
