We also VACATE the judgment of the district court and REMAND.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This is a dispute between two creditors, each of which attached the same pig iron owned by America Metals Trading L.L.P. (\"AMT\"). Plaintiff-Appellant Daewoo International Corp. (\"Daewoo\") is a South Korean trading company. In May 2012, Daewoo entered into a series of contracts with AMT for the purchase of pig iron, to be delivered in New Orleans. The sale contracts contained arbitration clauses. Although Daewoo made payments under the contracts, AMT never shipped the pig iron. Thyssenkrupp Mannex GMBH (\"TKM\") is a German company. Between June 2010 and February 2011, TKM entered into six contracts to purchase pig iron from AMT. AMT never delivered. In response to the breach of contract, TKM and AMT negotiated a settlement, which required AMT to make quarterly payments to TKM. AMT did not pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Daewoo sued AMT in the Eastern District of Louisiana, seeking an order compelling arbitration and an attachment of the pig iron on board a ship then-anchored in New Orleans. Daewoo invoked both maritime attachment and the Louisiana non-resident attachment statute, which allows attachments in aid of any \"action for a money judgment.\" La. Code Civ. Proc. art. 3542. Citing both types of attachment, the district court granted Daewoo its attachment. Intervenor-Appellee TKM later attached the same pig iron in Louisiana state court and intervened in Daewoo's federal action arguing that maritime jurisdiction was improper and Louisiana's non-resident attachment statute was inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The district court agreed with TKM and vacated Daewoo's attachment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stemcor USA, Inc. v. Am. Metals Trading, LLP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177520\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/199/1102/\">\n    199 F. Supp. 3d 1102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. La. 2016). Specifically, the district court found that because Daewoo's underlying suit sought to compel arbitration, it was not an \"action for a money judgment.\" Thus, the district court found that Daewoo could not receive a nonresident attachment writ. After Daewoo's writ was dissolved, TKM's state court attachment became first in time and the district court transferred proceeds from the parties' agreed sale of the pig iron to state court. Daewoo appealed the district court's conclusion that its Louisiana non-resident attachment writ was invalid. This court heard oral arguments, rendered a decision and reconsidered this matter on rehearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stemcor USA Inc. v.

May 8, 2019).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The district court found federal subject matter jurisdiction under the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (the \"Convention\"). We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   For a federal court to have jurisdiction under the Convention, two requirements must be met: (1) there must be an arbitration agreement or award that falls under the Convention, and (2) the dispute must relate to that arbitration agreement. These requirements flow from the text of two sections of the Convention. The explicit jurisdictional provision is Section 203, which gives federal courts jurisdiction over all \"action[s] or proceeding[s] falling under the Convention.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"An arbitration agreement or arbitral award arising out of a legal relationship, whether contractual or not, which is considered as commercial, including a transaction, contract, or agreement described in section 2 of this title, falls under the Convention.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20202\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the first step for determining jurisdiction is deciding whether the \"arbitration agreement or award ... falls under the Convention.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20202\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The next step, derived from Section 203, is to ask whether the \"action or proceeding\"-as opposed to the arbitration agreement or award-falls under the Convention. The Convention's removal statute offers guidance on what \"falling under\" means because \"[g]enerally, the removal jurisdiction of the federal district courts extends to cases over which they have original jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Francisco v. Stolt Achievement MT\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9414738\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/293/270/#p272\">\n    293 F.3d 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 272 (5th Cir. 2002). Section 205 of the Convention allows for removal whenever \"the subject matter of an action or proceeding pending in a State court relates to an arbitration agreement or award falling under the Convention.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20205\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And reading \"falling under\" to mean \"relates to\" makes sense grammatically. \"Fall\" means \"to come within the limits, scope, or jurisdiction of something.\" Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 418 (10th ed. 2002). Accordingly, the second step of the jurisdictional question is asking whether the \"action or proceeding\" \"relates to\" a covered arbitration agreement or award.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fred Parks, Inc. v.
