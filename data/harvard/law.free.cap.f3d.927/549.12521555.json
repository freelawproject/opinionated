Because there are no exceptional circumstances here, we reverse the grant of the stay. We explain our decision in some detail in order to ensure that\n   <em>\n    Colorado River\n   </em>\n   is confined to its banks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts underlying this appeal concern the efforts of Edge Investment, LLC -- a\n   real estate development company -- to construct a three-story building on an undeveloped parcel of land in Washington, D.C. Edge alleges that, by 2013, it had nearly completed construction of the building after having obtained various zoning and construction clearances from District of Columbia authorities. Those included the D.C. Water and Sewer Authority (\"D.C. Water\") and the D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 41, 57-58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As it turned out, Edge's building sat atop the Northeast Boundary Tunnel Sewer, a large storm sewer that forms an important piece of the District of Columbia's sewer infrastructure. When Edge learned this in December 2013, it hired an engineering firm, which concluded that the building did not present any danger to the Tunnel Sewer. According to D.C. Water, however, subsequent inspections in 2014 revealed a crack in the Tunnel Sewer requiring demolition of the building to prevent further damage.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 77, 98, 109-11. In April 2015, DCRA issued an order to raze the building pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%206-801\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 6-801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which empowers the Mayor to remove \"unsafe\" structures posing a threat to public safety. Compl. Ex. N (J.A. 115). And in May 2015, a contractor for D.C. Water, Celtic Demolition, Inc., razed the building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 8, 2016, D.C. Water sued Edge, the District of Columbia, and seven other defendants for negligence in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, seeking to recover the $ 3.6 million it spent to raze Edge's building and repair the Tunnel Sewer. On October 24, 2016, Edge filed counterclaims against D.C. Water, alleging that it had violated Edge's due process rights under the U.S. Constitution, engaged in a taking without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment, trespassed, and negligently failed to timely notify Edge of the location of the Tunnel Sewer as required by the D.C. Code. On November 7, Edge filed a third-party complaint in Superior Court, leveling similar allegations against the District of Columbia. Edge's third-party complaint also sought to quiet title as against the District and anyone acting on its behalf, including D.C. Water. In December 2016, the District removed the Superior Court case to federal district court. Several months later, the case was remanded back to Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 6, 2017, Edge commenced the instant federal case in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Edge's complaint named the District, D.C. Water, and several additional defendants, including Celtic Demolition and D.C. Water's then general manager, George S. Hawkins. The federal complaint asserted that the individual defendants had engaged in an unlawful conspiracy under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), and that the District and D.C. Water had acted without properly delegated authority under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%206-801\">\n    D.C.

Water and Hawkins moved to stay or dismiss the federal case in favor of the Superior Court proceedings. The motion was based on the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Colorado River Water Conservation District v.

Instead, it is a garden-variety example of two lawsuits proceeding concurrently in two courts. As the Eleventh Circuit noted when confronted with an analogous claim of \"piecemeal litigation,\" if that\n   <em>\n    Colorado River\n   </em>\n   factor supports deferral in this case, then it \"would seemingly support abstention in every federal case that has a parallel state case.\"\n   <em>\n    Ambrosia Coal &amp; Constr.

In issuing its stay on March 30, 2018, the court explained this consideration as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   The Superior Court Action was filed first. D.C.

Here, not only was the Superior Court Action filed first, it is significantly ahead of this case. On November 17, 2017, [Superior Court] Judge Mott issued a decision on D.C. Water's motion to dismiss Edge's amended counterclaims, denying it as to six of the seven counterclaims. And on January 12, 2018, [Superior Court] Judge Cordero issued a revised Scheduling Order that established deadlines over the next year for expert disclosure,\n   the end of discovery, dispositive motions, and mediation. Expert reports, to take one example, are due in little over a month from now.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524743\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/305/22/#p28\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal citations omitted). But as with the risk of piecemeal litigation, there is nothing exceptional about the relative progress of the two cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   To begin, there is room to dispute the length and significance of what transpired in each court, and Edge does. Edge Br. 26-28. It points out that it filed its third-party complaint in Superior Court just six months before it filed its federal case, and thus the Superior Court had only a six-month head start on those claims. In addition, Edge's federal case included some claims that had never been considered by the Superior Court (e.g., the RICO claims, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 293-328), so there was no head start as to those at all. Edge further notes that the fifteen-month and even the six-month figures are overstated because they do not take account of five months of dormancy between the time the District of Columbia removed the Superior Court case to federal court and the time the case was remanded and reassigned to a different Superior Court judge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Edge Br. 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Edge also disputes the significance of what transpired in state court. It notes that the Superior Court did not rule on D.C. Water's motion to dismiss until seven months after Edge filed its federal case. And the Superior Court issued its revised scheduling order just two months before the district court granted the stay. Moreover, there is no reason to think that any expert report or other kind of discovery produced in Superior Court could not also be of use in federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   But the bottom line, under any calculation, is that D.C. Water filed its Superior Court complaint just fifteen months before Edge filed its federal case, that Edge filed its third-party Superior Court complaint just six months before Edge filed its federal case, and that when the latter was filed, it included some claims that had never been considered by the Superior Court at all. Those relatively brief periods are readily distinguishable from the head start at issue in\n   <em>\n    Tyrer v.
