He became eligible for parole in 2000. At his parole hearings in 2000, 2005, and 2008, the U.S. Parole Commission denied him parole. Each time, the Commission applied parole guidelines promulgated in 2000 rather than the 1987 guidelines in effect at the time of his offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Johnson brought an action claiming that the retroactive application of the 2000 guidelines in his parole hearings violated the Ex Post Facto Clause and Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause.

Metropolitan Police Department, and\n   charged with armed rape. The alleged victim of the rape was Johnson's then-girlfriend. She had identified Johnson as the perpetrator and described the episode in detail, after which the police contacted him for an interview. Johnson provided a handwritten statement in which he said that he and his girlfriend had spent time together on the day in question and engaged in consensual intercourse. He described an altercation over accusations of infidelity that culminated with his girlfriend grabbing a knife to prevent him from leaving the apartment. He was eventually able to wrest the knife from her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Detective Burke described the victim's allegations in an affidavit supporting his application for an arrest warrant, in which he stated that Johnson had \"admitted to arming himself with a knife and to engaging the Complainant in sexual intercourse.\" Johnson Compl. \u00b6 22, App. 18. Burke obtained an arrest warrant for Johnson based on the affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On March 17, 1990, Johnson was released on bond. While on release, he raped a different woman. Johnson eventually pleaded guilty to the second rape, and prosecutors dropped the first charge as part of the plea deal. Under the District of Columbia's indeterminate sentencing scheme, Johnson received a sentence of 15 years to life imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act vests responsibility for parole determinations for D.C.

Despite Johnson's denial of the underlying conduct, the Commission found him guilty of the 1989 rape for the purposes of parole, based solely on the contemporaneous police report. The Commission applied the 2000 guidelines, determined that Johnson was presumptively unsuitable for parole, and calculated a recommended guideline range of twelve to eighteen months. Had the Commission applied the 1987 guidelines, Johnson would have been presumptively suitable for parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Commission departed upward from the twelve-to-eighteen-month range, citing its assessment of the risk Johnson posed. The Commission gave him a sixty-month reconsideration date, which made him eligible for rehearing in 2005. In each of his next two hearings, in 2005 and 2008, the Commission again departed upward from the guidelines for similar reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In 2010, following litigation challenging the application of the 2000 guidelines to parole applicants who, like Johnson, were convicted before promulgation of the 2000 guidelines, Johnson received a parole hearing under the 1987 guidelines for the first\n   time. The Commission determined that he was presumptively suitable for parole but opted to depart from the guidelines to deny him parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Johnson later filed the present action. The action includes a claim against Parole Commission members alleging that the application of the 2000 guidelines in his first three parole hearings violated his rights under the Ex Post Facto Clause and Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause. His action also includes a claim against Detective Burke and the District of Columbia contending that his original arrest for rape violated the Fourth Amendment. The complaint seeks damages as well as declaratory and injunctive relief, including expungement of his arrest record and parole file.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The district court rejected Johnson's claims and dismissed his complaint. The Commission subsequently granted Johnson parole, and he was released from prison in 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Johnson now appeals. We appointed an amicus to present arguments in support of his position, and we consider both the amicus's arguments and Johnson's own arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We first address the argument of Johnson and his amicus that the Parole Commission's retroactive application of the 2000 guidelines at his first three hearings violated the Ex Post Facto Clause and Johnson's argument that it violated the Due Process Clause. While Johnson sought various forms of relief in connection with that argument in the district court, the only remaining claim before us is his claim against members of the Parole Commission for damages. He does not dispute that his claim for a new parole hearing has become moot now that he has received a parole hearing under the 1987 guidelines and been released from custody. And while he initially sought expungement of the references to his first alleged rape from his parole file, the district court held that his sole avenue for expungement is the Privacy Act, and his briefing in our court contains no challenge to that holding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The district court dismissed Johnson's Ex Post Facto damages claim because it was barred by qualified immunity and dismissed the Due Process claim on the merits. We affirm the district court's dismissal of those claims for substantially similar reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We initially consider the argument of Johnson and amicus that the application of the 2000 guidelines at his first three hearings violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. \"[P]arole authorities violate the Ex Post Facto Clause when (i) they apply parole guidelines promulgated after an offender was convicted, and (ii) that retroactive application ... creates a significant risk of prolonging [the offender's] incarceration as compared to application of the prior guidelines.\"\n   <em>\n    Ford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518432\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/902/309/#p321\">\n    902 F.3d at 320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alterations in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, there is no dispute that the first condition is satisfied: the 2000 guidelines were promulgated after Johnson's conviction. The sole issue is whether the retroactive application of those guidelines created a \"significant risk\" of prolonging his incarceration as compared to application of the 1987 guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   A party can establish a \"significant risk\" by identifying \"facial distinctions between the old and new\" regulations that demonstrate the requisite risk or by \"introducing evidence drawn from the rule's practical implementation by the agency\n   charged with exercising discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Fletcher v.

Namely, the Commission departed upward based on the dismissed rape charge; Johnson's failure to obtain psychological or behavioral treatment for sex offenders; and \"offense accountability,\" meaning the severity of the underlying crime. Consideration of each of those factors is explicitly permitted under the 2000 guidelines but not the 1987 guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   That difference does not create a \"significant risk\" per our decision in\n   <em>\n    Ford v.

But our decision in\n   <em>\n    Ford\n   </em>\n   establishes that, under the 1987 guidelines, the enumerated factors are merely illustrative and have no privileged position relative to unenumerated factors. All are potential bases for a departure, and whether enumerated or unenumerated, their invocation requires no more than a written explanation. Indeed, in a letter to the court submitted after we decided\n   <em>\n    Ford\n   </em>\n   , amicus acknowledged that the decision governed this issue. Consequently, the facial differences in departure factors cannot support Johnson's Ex Post Facto challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Johnson and his amicus next contend that the Parole Commission, by applying the 2000 guidelines, deprived Johnson of a presumption of parole suitability to which he would have been entitled under the 1987 guidelines. In particular, although Johnson would have received a score qualifying him for a presumption of suitability at each of his parole hearings under the 1987 guidelines, his total guideline range under the 2000 guidelines mandated that he serve an additional twelve to eighteen months above his minimum court-imposed sentence before he could be considered presumptively suitable for parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   That argument finds support in our decisions. Considering the relationship between the 2000 guidelines and an earlier iteration, the 1972 guidelines, we wrote that it was \"reasonable to infer that the presumption of extended unsuitability contained in the 2000 Guidelines would prolong a prisoner's period of incarceration as compared to the [earlier] guidelines-in which no such presumption existed-even if the same factors could have been considered under the earlier regime.\"\n   <em>\n    Daniel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4201129,4110081\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/766/57/\">\n    766 F.3d at 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   That \"focus on the effect of a presumption\" of suitability is consistent with decisions assessing the Ex Post Facto implications of revised sentencing guidelines.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4201129,4110081\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/766/57/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4201129,4110081\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/766/57/\">\n    at 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The guidelines do not oblige the Commission to hew to the presumption, but they do require the Commission to begin with it. The presumption of suitability, when it applies, is thus the kind of facial difference that could support a plausible Ex Post Facto claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Nonetheless, Johnson's claim for damages fails for a different reason: the parole officials named as defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.
