In this appeal, we consider whether Heraeus' suit against Esschem, Inc.-a company that works as a chemical manufacturer for Heraeus' main competitor-is barred by the statute of limitations under the Pennsylvania Uniform Trade Secrets Act. At summary judgment, the District Court held that all of Heraeus' claims, including those for Esschem's alleged continuing misappropriation during the three-year limitations period, are time-barred and entered judgment for Esschem. We agree that alleged misappropriations that occurred more than three years before Heraeus filed suit are time-barred, but because we hold that Pennsylvania applies the rule of separate accrual to continuing trade secret misappropriations, Heraeus may sue for misappropriations that occurred within the three-year period before filing. We thus will reverse in part and affirm in part the District Court's grant of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Heraeus is a German company that develops and produces Palacos, a bone cement used to anchor artificial joints in joint replacement surgeries. To make Palacos, Heraeus developed its own particular process to manufacture two key components: copolymers known as R262 and R263 (the \"copolymers\"). Biomet also sells bone cement and is one of Heraeus' major competitors in this market. To make its bone cement, Biomet uses the same copolymers, which it buys from Esschem, a Pennsylvania company that manufactures acrylic polymers and monomers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Heraeus holds trade secrets related to the \"overall specifications for the ... bone cement,\" including \"specifications for [the] copolymers.\" App. 81. These trade secrets changed hands several times over the years before allegedly falling into Esschem's possession. In 1972, thirteen years after Palacos first came on the market, Heraeus entered into a distribution agreement with Merck, pursuant to which Heraeus disclosed its trade secrets so that Merck could \"obtain and maintain regulatory approval\" to distribute Palacos. App. 84. Merck was also obligated under the agreement to protect Heraeus' trade secrets from disclosure to third parties without first obtaining Heraeus' consent. This arrangement was in place until 1997, when Merck and Biomet entered into a joint venture that took over the distribution of Palacos. At that point, Heraeus agreed to supply the joint venture, and only Merck, pursuant to its confidentiality agreement with Heraeus, had access to the trade secrets covering the copolymers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2004, however, Biomet acquired Merck's shares in the joint venture, taking over the distribution agreement and, unbeknownst to Heraeus, also gaining access to Heraeus' trade secrets. Upon learning of the joint venture's sale to its competitor, Heraeus announced it would terminate the distribution agreement in August 2005, but by the time Heraeus severed its ties with Biomet, Biomet had already launched its own competing bone cement-a feat that Heraeus alleges its \"competitors had failed to do for decades\" and that it contends has since cost it 50 percent of its market share. App. 88. Suspecting that Biomet's bone cement was created using its trade secrets, Heraeus acquired and analyzed samples of Biomet's bone cement in 2005 and discovered that, except for \"[m]inor discrepancies,\" it \"w[as] virtually identical to\" Heraeus' bone cement and that Esschem was manufacturing the copolymer components for Biomet. App. 89.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Over the next few years, Heraeus took legal action to protect its trade secrets. It filed suit for trade secret misappropriation against Biomet in Germany in December 2008, and shortly thereafter, in aid of that litigation, brought discovery suits in the United States against both Esschem and Biomet.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In its discovery suit against Esschem, Heraeus sought \"documents relating to communications between Esschem and ... Biomet ... regarding the development\" of the copolymers.\n   <em>\n    In re Heraeus Kulzer GmbH\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%202981921\">\n    2009 WL 2981921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. At the time, Heraeus' theory was that Biomet had \"instruct[ed Esschem] to manufacture [the copolymers] using Heraeus' highly confidential information and trade secrets.\" App. 651. After an appeal, this Court ordered expedited discovery from Esschem in July 2010.\n   <em>\n    Heraeus Kulzer GmbH\n   </em>\n   , 390 F. App'x at 93. Esschem then produced several e-mail chains between employees of Biomet and Esschem in which they discussed the development of the copolymers. In those chains, all of which had been produced to Heraeus by March 2011, Biomet employees Dan Smith and Rainer Specht specifically \"discuss[ed] the specifications for R262 and R263\" with Esschem employees. Appellee's Br. 37-38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Discovery against Esschem ended sometime between August and December 2011, but discovery and litigation against Biomet continued for several more years. In the course of the proceedings against Biomet-specifically, in a December 2011 deposition-Dan Smith corroborated what the e-mail chains had indicated: that Biomet employees were \"direct participants,\" Appellant's Br. 11 (quoting Sealed App. 1703) in the development of the copolymers and that \"their work with Esschem ... ultimately led to the copolymers manufactured by Esschem for use in Biomet's bone cement,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . Heraeus contends it was not until \"that time,\" i.e., December 2011, that it had \"sufficient information to believe that Esschem had actively participated in the misappropriation of [its] trade secrets.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Just short of three years later, on September 8, 2014, Heraeus sued Esschem for trade secret misappropriation in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The complaint included one count for misappropriation of trade secrets under the Pennsylvania Uniform Trade Secrets Act (PUTSA) and five counts for common law claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following discovery, Esschem moved for summary judgment, arguing that all of Heraeus' claims were time-barred. Under the PUTSA, a plaintiff has three years from when \"the misappropriation was discovered or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have been discovered\" to bring suit.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%205307\">\n    12 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 5307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Esschem argued that Heraeus discovered or should have discovered the alleged misappropriations as early as 2005, making its PUTSA claims untimely. And because the common law claims were based on the same facts as the PUTSA claims and were subject to statutes of limitations of no more than four years, they were also untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In its opposition motion, Heraeus countered that it did not discover the necessary facts to sue for trade secret misappropriation until \"the end of 2011,\" and that any dispute over when it discovered those facts was an issue of triable fact that precluded summary judgment. App. 663. Heraeus also urged that continuing misappropriations were subject to the separate accrual rule, so that, under the PUTSA, each additional use of Heraeus' trade secrets within three years of the filing of the complaint\n   gave rise to a separate and timely cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The District Court rejected both of Heraeus' arguments and ruled that the statutes of limitations had run on its PUTSA and common law claims. At the very latest, the Court found, Heraeus was aware of \"the facts supporting its misappropriation claims\" against Esschem by January 2009.\n   <em>\n    Heraeus Med. GmbH v. Esschem, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522970\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/855/#p861\">\n    285 F. Supp. 3d 855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 861 (E.D. Pa. 2018). It also held that Esschem's additional uses of the trade secrets between September 2011 and the filing of the complaint in September 2014 were part of a single and time-barred cause of action under the PUTSA because Esschem's continued use of the trade secrets was \"nothing more than a continuation of the original alleged misappropriation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522970\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/855/#p861\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522970\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/855/#p861\">\n    at 863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Interpreting the PUTSA to adopt the separate accrual rule, it reasoned, would \"eliminate the statute of limitations altogether\" by allowing Heraeus to \"sit by for nearly a decade\" after learning all facts necessary to bring a claim and to obtain damages for the entire period so long as one misappropriation took place within the statute of limitations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . On that basis, the Court granted summary judgment for Esschem, and Heraeus now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The District Court had diversity jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and we have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On appeal, Heraeus raises the same two arguments it did below. First, it contends that it did not discover sufficient facts to state a claim against Esschem until December 2011, and therefore its September 2014 suit fell within the three-year limitations period. And to the extent there is a dispute over\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   Heraeus discovered sufficient facts to state a claim, Heraeus argues, this is a factual dispute for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Second, Heraeus posits that even if the limitations period began to run before September 2011, Esschem would still be liable for each time it used the trade secrets to manufacture the copolymers between September 2011 and September 2014 because continuing misappropriations under the PUTSA are subject to the separate accrual rule. We address these issues in turn.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

In Pennsylvania, there are several \"exception[s]\" to this \"general rule.\"\n   <em>\n    Pocono Intern. Raceway, Inc. v.

One is the discovery rule, which evolved from the notion that a limitations period should not \"run[ ] against\" a plaintiff who is \"ignorant of his loss.\"\n   <em>\n    Lewey v. H.C. Frick Coke Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"864207\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/166/536/\">\n    166 Pa. 536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20A.%20261\">\n    31 A. 261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 264 (1895).

In other words, the limitations period would only begin to run once Heraeus discovered sufficient facts to make it reasonably aware not only that Esschem used Heraeus' trade secrets without Heraeus' consent, but also that Esschem knew or had reason to know that Biomet owed a duty to Heraeus to maintain their secrecy.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Merck &amp; Co. v.

Specifically, Heraeus directs us to two pieces of information that it asserts gave it notice of Esschem's state of mind: Smith's testimony (1) that he and another Biomet employee were \"direct participants\" in work with Esschem; and (2) that this work with Esschem \"ultimately led to the copolymers ... for use in Biomet's bone cements.\" Appellant's Br. 11-12. Heraeus contends those concessions finally revealed that \"Esschem knew that Biomet was using stolen trade secrets.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   But the argument proves too much, for if that information was sufficient to put Heraeus on notice of Esschem's scienter, then Heraeus was necessarily on notice nine months earlier when it came into possession of essentially the same information. In a March 2011 discovery production, Heraeus received, among other things, a 2004 e-mail exchange between Smith and Esschem in which Smith attempted to troubleshoot Esschem's manufacturing difficulties, and, in declining to provide more detailed copolymer specifications, noted that doing so would disclose non-public information. But follow-up e-mails to Esschem from the other Biomet employee, Rainer Specht, which Heraeus also received in discovery by March 2011, did provide Esschem with those supposedly non-public details. And soon thereafter, as Heraeus was well aware, Biomet released its competing bone cement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This sequence and the face of these detailed exchanges about the copolymer specifications reveal that the very facts that Heraeus claims it first learned in the December 2011 deposition were in its possession by March 2011: (1) \"direct participat[ion]\" by Biomet employees in Esschem's development of the copolymers; and (2) that this participation is what \"ultimately led\" to Esschem's successful production of the copolymers. Appellant's Br. 11. Moreover, the March 2011 discovery revealed the additional fact that Esschem had reason to believe Specht's subsequent disclosure of the copolymer specifications constituted non-public information, i.e., information that was \"derived from or through a person who owed a duty to the person seeking relief to maintain its secrecy.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%205302\">\n    12 Pa.

Stat. \u00a7 5302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the information that Heraeus learned through Smith's testimony was duplicative and, if anything, less revealing than the discovery it received in March 2011. So, it was March 2011 when the limitations period began to run and March 2014, three years later, when it expired.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Heraeus, however, did not file suit until September 2014-three and a half years later. Thus, any misappropriations prior to March 2011 and any that occurred between March and September 2011 (which would have been discovered as they occurred) are indeed time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The question remains whether Esschem's alleged continued use of Heraeus' trade secrets between September 2011 and September 2014 is properly viewed as part of one violation that is time-barred in its entirety, as the District Court held, or instead as a series of separate misappropriations that accrued individually and thus were timely asserted. As we explain next, the PUTSA provides the answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Timeliness of Claims for Misappropriation After September 2011\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Pennsylvania General Assembly based the PUTSA on the provisions of the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA). But while it adopted most of those provisions, it opted to diverge from them in certain instances. One such instance is in the treatment of a \"continuing misappropriation.\" The UTSA provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   An action for misappropriation must be brought within 3 years after the misappropriation is discovered or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have been discovered. For the purposes of this section, a continuing misappropriation constitutes a single claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Unif. Trade Secrets Act \u00a7 6 (Unif. Law Comm'n 1985). In the PUTSA, the Pennsylvania General Assembly tracked this language nearly verbatim, except that it omitted the final sentence, so that Pennsylvania's statute states simply:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   An action under this chapter for misappropriation must be brought within three years after the misappropriation was discovered or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have been discovered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%205307\">\n    12 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 5307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The parties view the omission of the final sentence very differently. Heraeus argues that the Pennsylvania legislature intended \"each wrongful use of misappropriated trade secrets [to] trigger a distinct limitations period\" and that, under this separate accrual rule, its claims for misappropriations between September 2011 and September 2014 are timely. Appellant's Br. 14. Esschem, on the other hand, defends the District Court's rejection of the separate accrual rule as a rule that would nullify the PUTSA's statute of limitations, and it urges that we affirm the denial of Heraeus' PUTSA claims as a single, time-barred cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As explained below, Heraeus has the better of the argument. The District Court erred in treating Esschem's continued use of Heraeus' trade secrets as a single misappropriation for three reasons: (1) the text of the PUTSA; (2) Pennsylvania's common law rule of separate accrual, which provided the backdrop against which the PUTSA was drafted; and (3) Pennsylvania's adoption of the Restatement of Torts, which also endorses the separate accrual rule for continuing misappropriations. We address these in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    1.

Under the \"separate-accrual rule,\" which we have defined as \"[a] corollary of the standard rule\" for accrual of federal causes of action, a continuing misappropriation gives rise to multiple discrete claims corresponding to each act of misappropriation, and \"[b]ecause each act violates the law on its own, each act separately triggers its own limitations period.\"\n   <em>\n    Blake v.

June 19, 2019). The Uniform Law Commission expressly rejected this separate accrual rule in the second sentence of UTSA \u00a7 6 by providing that \"a continuing misappropriation constitutes a\n   <em>\n    single\n   </em>\n   claim,\" i.e.,\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a series of claims. Unif. Trade Secrets Act \u00a7 6 (emphasis added). But the Pennsylvania General Assembly rejected that second sentence and retained only the first when it enacted PUTSA \u00a7 5307, indicating that it intended to retain the separate accrual rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fletcher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4196633,7292436\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/985/678/\">\n    985 A.2d at 684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Esschem, however, asks us to ignore the significance of the second sentence's omission and to imply the General Assembly's rejection of the separate accrual rule into the first sentence. But in interpreting a statute, \"language should not be implied where excluded,\" and we will not contravene legislative intent by reading into PUTSA \u00a7 5307 the very language that the General Assembly chose to omit.\n   <em>\n    Fonner v.

Nor does the text of the first sentence support Esschem's reading. That sentence, which the General Assembly retained, simply specifies\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   the limitations period begins-which is when \"the misappropriation is discovered\" or \"should have been discovered.\" Unif. Trade Secrets Act \u00a7 6. It has no bearing on whether continuing misappropriations are treated as a single claim or multiple claims. That is a separate question that is addressed by the UTSA's second sentence, independent of the first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The comments to the UTSA reinforce this reading of PUTSA \u00a7 5307.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The UTSA drafters made explicit that they sought in \u00a7 6 to achieve two distinct results: (1) to \"reject[ ] the continuing wrong approach,\" under which \"the limitation period with respect to a specific act of misappropriation begins at the time that the act of misappropriation occurs\"-that is, to reject the separate accrual rule; and (2) to start the limitations period upon \"discover[y of] the existence of misappropriation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Unif. Trade Secrets Act \u00a7 6 cmt. Esschem's argument that the first sentence alone is sufficient to achieve both of these results is thus not only atextual, but it also renders the second sentence mere surplusage, contrary to Pennsylvania's canons of construction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matter of Emps. of Student Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1770703\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/495/42/\">\n    495 Pa. 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1770703\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/495/42/\">\n    432 A.2d 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 195 (1981).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   We decline to adopt Esschem's reading. Instead, we glean from the text of the statutes that the UTSA adopted the discovery rule and single-claim treatment for continuing misappropriations, and the PUTSA embraced the UTSA's discovery rule but declined its single-claim treatment in favor of the separate accrual rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   b. Pennsylvania's Common Law Rule of Separate Accrual\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   That the Pennsylvania legislature intended to follow the separate accrual rule is all the more apparent when we consider the omission of the UTSA's second sentence against the backdrop of Pennsylvania common law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As explained by our former Chief Judge Edward Becker when he sat on the District Court in\n   <em>\n    Anaconda Company v. Metric Tool &amp; Die Company\n   </em>\n   , Pennsylvania courts have adopted the \"property\" view of trade secrets, under which the basis of a claim for trade secret misappropriation is the violation of a property right, in contrast to the \"confidential relationship\" view, under which a misappropriation is based on a violation of a duty of confidentiality.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1462100\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/485/410/#p425\">\n    485 F.

Pa. 1980).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the property view provides the theoretical underpinnings for the separate accrual rule: While a breach of confidentiality only occurs upon the initial misappropriation, and the \"fabric of the [confidential] relationship once rent is not torn anew with each added use or disclosure,\" under the property view, a trade secret \"is in the nature of property[ ] [and] is damaged or destroyed by the adverse use,\" such that \"each use is a new wrong.\"\n   <em>\n    Monolith Portland Midwest Co. v.

It is for that reason, as Judge Becker held in applying Pennsylvania's common law of trade secrets, that \"the statute of limitations for the tort of wrongful use begins to run at the time of the wrongful use, and not at the time of the initial misappropriation.\"\n   <em>\n    Anaconda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1462100\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/485/410/#p425\">\n    485 F.

But\n   <em>\n    Anaconda\n   </em>\n   's reasoning is sound, and although no Pennsylvania court has explicitly discussed this reasoning, other courts have, confirming the separate accrual rule's roots in the property view and its\n   incompatibility with the confidential relationship view.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Underwater Storage, Inc. v.

The PUTSA \"expressly declare[s]\" only that trade secret misappropriation claims are subject to the discovery rule. So by omitting the UTSA's second sentence, the General Assembly in effect codified Pennsylvania common law, foregoing the single-claim approach in favor of the separate accrual rule and harmonizing the PUTSA with Pennsylvania's property view of trade secrets.

The Restatement recognizes a cause of action not only for the initial disclosure of a trade secret-the confidential relationship view-but also for the wrongful use of a trade secret, explaining that a trade secret holder \"may be harmed merely by the disclosure of his secret to others as well as by the use of his secret in competition with him.\" Restatement (First) of Torts \u00a7 757 cmt. c (1939). As we just discussed, harm arising from wrongful use is the hallmark feature of the property view, and the Restatement embraces this theory by providing a cause of action for both disclosure\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   use of a trade secret.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 757.

Adopting Esschem's reading of the PUTSA, and finding that it eliminated the separate accrual rule, requires us to ignore legislative intent along with several unambiguous directives from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.
