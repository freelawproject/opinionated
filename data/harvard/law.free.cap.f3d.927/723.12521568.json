We will affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Greene and his girlfriend, Jennifer Manley, were traveling in a white van without its lights on when they were stopped by Officer Mark Stefanowicz of the Hanover Township Police. Manley was driving, but she was unable to produce a driver's license, vehicle registration, or proof of insurance. Instead, she gave Stefanowicz a New York state benefits card and a rental car agreement in the name of Kevin Hurtudo-Moreno that listed no other authorized drivers. Greene told Stefanowicz that Hurtudo-Moreno was his brother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   While speaking with Manley and Greene, Stefanowicz smelled unburnt marijuana emanating from the vehicle. Greene then began acting suspiciously by \"repeatedly seeking to leave, and attempting to leave, the scene of the traffic stop ... initially standing up and then sitting back down in the passenger seat when ordered out of the vehicle; and standing up and reaching for his waistband, as though trying to conceal something on his person.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

May 18, 2017). Stefanowicz responded to Greene's suspicious behavior by patting him down as permitted by\n   <em>\n    Terry v. Ohio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    392 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    20 L.Ed.2d 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1968). In doing so, Stefanowicz felt a bulge, the seal of a plastic baggie, and the texture of its contents. Based on his extensive experience, Stefanowicz immediately recognized the bag as marijuana, so he had no need to manipulate it. After removing the baggie, Stefanowicz placed Greene under arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Incident to Greene's arrest, Stefanowicz searched the van and found .40 caliber bullets in the glove box and in Manley's\n   purse. Stefanowicz then escorted Greene to the police car, but while doing so, he noticed Greene bending over and walking in unusual ways, as if to conceal something. Another officer who had arrived on scene searched Greene further and located a loaded, stolen handgun in his groin area. The police arrested Manley and transported her to the stationhouse apart from Greene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During booking at the stationhouse, Greene asked Stefanowicz whether Manley would get in trouble. Stefanowicz replied that she would, for \"headlight violations, no license, marijuana.\" App. 160. Greene then volunteered that he would \"take the hit\" for the gun and bullets.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As relevant to this appeal, Greene moved to suppress both his inculpatory statement and the gun and bullets seized after he was arrested for possession of marijuana.

Officer Stefanowicz responded curtly (and accurately) that Manley was facing charges for automobile and drug violations. Although Stefanowicz said nothing about firearm or ammunition charges, Greene volunteered that he would \"take the hit\" for the gun and bullets. App. 160.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Greene argues that his inculpatory statement should have been suppressed because it was procured in violation of his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself.

Neither case helps Greene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Calisto\n   </em>\n   , we found an officer's remark about the possible arrest of the suspect's daughter did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   create a reasonable expectation that the suspect would make an inculpatory statement.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1310582\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/838/711/#p717\">\n    838 F.2d at 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that case, in front of the suspect, one officer informed another that both men's and women's clothing had been found in the bedroom where methamphetamine was found, and the second officer responded, \"[w]ell, then we'll have to get an arrest warrant for the daughter.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1310582\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/838/711/#p717\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1310582\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/838/711/#p717\">\n    at 713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We reasoned that the officers need not have expected the father's inculpatory response because the officer's comment was not directed at the father; it was the kind of remark officers normally make in the course of their duties; and it was not provocative.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1310582\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/838/711/#p717\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1310582\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/838/711/#p717\">\n    at 713, 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The officer \"did nothing more than tell [the suspect] why he was being arrested,\" and the suspect's response that no one saw him throw the gun away was unforeseeable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514080\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/996/642/#p644\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514080\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/996/642/#p644\">\n    at 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nevertheless, in dicta, we suggested that telling a suspect that other members of his family would be implicated in the crime, \"thus encouraging him to speak to accept sole responsibility,\" might make the suspect feel \"compelled to respond\" and render his response excludable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514080\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/996/642/#p644\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Greene mainly relies on this counterexample, and facts distinguishing his case from\n   <em>\n    Calisto\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Benton\n   </em>\n   , to argue that his statement resulted from the functional equivalent of interrogation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Coercion is the touchstone for identifying circumstances that make an inculpatory statement excludable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Innis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182222\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/291/\">\n    446 U.S. at 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182222\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/291/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Greene asked for the information he now claims coerced him into confessing. Stefanowicz's answer to Greene's question was a brief and accurate description of what his girlfriend was facing.
