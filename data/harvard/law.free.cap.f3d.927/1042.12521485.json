In the presentence investigation report, the probation officer concluded that Pryor was an Armed Career Criminal (ACC) based on the existence of at least three prior convictions for a violent felony or serious drug offense, or both, and thus suggested that the district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   enhance Pryor's Guidelines sentence accordingly. Pryor argued that although our circuit law dictates otherwise, certain of his prior convictions should not qualify as \"violent felonies\" under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), and the legal matter should be revisited by the en banc court. The district court, applying circuit precedent, sentenced Pryor as an ACC (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1) ) to the statutory minimum term of 180 months imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   When a defendant has three prior convictions \"for a violent felony or a serious drug offense,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1) imposes a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years. Relevant here, a violent felony is a crime punishable by imprisonment for at least one year and \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i).

However, even with the factual scenarios he posits (including, for example, the mental state required, and to whom or at what the exhibiting must be directed), Pryor has not identified any pertinent developments in Missouri law after 2009 that undermine this court's conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Pulliam\n   </em>\n   . Although Pryor believes our court's cases on the matter were wrongly decided, we are bound by them absent en banc review.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

He argues this particular matter was not adequately addressed in\n   <em>\n    Winston\n   </em>\n   and remains ripe for review en banc.
