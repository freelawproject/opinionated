Consider the claim in\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   . If that claim had recited just the single step of administering a synthetic drug to a patient, that single-step claim would be patent-eligible, but lack novelty under \u00a7 102. And if that claim added a second step for determining the subsequent level of a non-naturally occurring metabolite in a patient, that claim also would pass muster under \u00a7 101, but lack novelty. But when the claim further recites a relationship between a metabolite level and its efficacy in a patient, that claim suddenly would be invalid under \u00a7 101 for violating the law of nature exception. In other words, steps 1 and 2 now get pushed aside and declared insignificant, and the last step is designated as the \"focus\" of the claim,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the heart of the invention. The notion that\n   adding claim language can convert an otherwise patent-eligible claim into a patent-ineligible claim is counterintuitive and a very difficult thing to explain to 8,000 patent examiners.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the process of determining what the claim is \"really about\" when the claim is viewed in pieces, rather than as a whole, can be highly subjective and impressionistic. This approach puts courts and examiners in the position of assigning value judgments to individual limitations, designating some as \"significant\" and others as \"insignificant,\" and hoping everyone else reaches the same conclusion as to whether the claim contains a truly meritorious inventive contribution as opposed to a judicial exception embellished with insignificant window dressing. And all this just to resolve the threshold question of whether an invention is eligible for the patent system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   As written,\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   requires a patent claim to have an inventive concept apart from the recitation of a natural law. That requirement has consequences that go beyond the facts of\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   and is certainly clear enough that we are obliged to follow it. But, as explained above,\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   's framework is in tension on its face with\n   <em>\n    Diehr\n   </em>\n   , which was equally clear in requiring that a patent claim be considered as a whole, without putting aside any natural law or otherwise dissecting a claim into new versus old elements. Moreover, nothing in\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   suggests that it sought to repudiate anything in\n   <em>\n    Diehr\n   </em>\n   ; it instead suggests that it sought to maintain continuity with the Court's prior cases in this area. As for\n   <em>\n    Flook\n   </em>\n   , the Court in\n   <em>\n    Bilski\n   </em>\n   acknowledged that\n   <em>\n    Diehr\n   </em>\n   had \"established a limitation\" on\n   <em>\n    Flook\n   </em>\n   by \"emphasiz[ing] the need to consider the invention as a whole, rather than 'dissect[ing] the claims into old and new elements ... in the analysis.' \"\n   <em>\n    Bilski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644410,12455287\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/593/\">\n    561 U.S. at 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644410,12455287\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/593/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 3218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Diehr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6183273\" index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/175/#p191\">\n    450 U.S. at 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6183273\" index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/175/#p191\">\n    101 S.Ct. 1048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

Relying on the\n   <em>\n    Diehr\n   </em>\n   framework, the Patent Office examined and granted many patents for medical diagnostic methods, establishing settled expectations in those granted property rights, and prompted companies and research institutions to organize their conduct and choices accordingly.

As an analogy, we would not find that a claim directed to an abstract idea of communicating information through a device passes muster under \u00a7 101 simply because it limits the claimed device to, say, a Samsung Galaxy\u00ae smartphone. Nor would the\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   claim be considered to possess an inventive concept if it had recited that the initial step of \"administering a drug\" be performed in a conventional way, such as orally or intravenously.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   One amicus brief points out that \u00a7 101 provides that \"[w]hoever invents or discovers\" a new or useful process, manufacture, machine or composition of matter may be entitled to a patent, and that \u00a7 100(a) defines \"invention\" to mean \"invention or discovery.\" Brief of Freenome Holdings Inc. and Achillion Pharm., Inc. as\n   <em>\n    Amici Curiae\n   </em>\n   in Support of Neither Party,\n   <em>\n    Athena Diagnostics, Inc. v.

Section 100 also defines \"process\" to include \"a new use of a known process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or material.\" \u00a7 100(b). Arguably, Athena's invention is a claim for a new use (diagnosing\n   <em>\n    myasthenia gravis\n   </em>\n   ) of a known composition of matter (MuSK autoantibodies). Moreover, given that the dual \"invention or discovery\" structure consistently has been part of every Patent Act since 1790, this statutory provision suggests that at least some discoveries, including Athena's \"discovery\" of how to diagnose\n   <em>\n    myasthenia gravis\n   </em>\n   , have always been contemplated as patentable subject matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lefstin and Menell Br. at 4-14. However, I am not aware of the Supreme Court ever addressing the meaning of \"discovers\" in \u00a7 101 separately from \"invents,\" and it must be the Supreme Court, and not this court, that speaks to that statutory question, because the Court already proclaimed that \"[g]roundbreaking, innovative, or even brilliant discovery does not by itself satisfy the section 101 inquiry.\"\n   <em>\n    Myriad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697061\" index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/576/\">\n    569 U.S. at 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697061\" index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/576/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In sum, I do not think the claims here can withstand\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   's scrutiny.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   But perhaps when read \"as a whole\" under\n   <em>\n    Diehr\n   </em>\n   , claims such as claims 7 and 9 in this case could be viewed as methods of testing for a specific medical condition, employing a sequence of steps that physically transform materials. By no means do the claims cover a natural principle in the abstract. Rather, this sounds like a contribution to the \"useful arts\" stated in Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 of the U.S. Constitution. That those physical, transformative steps may apply conventional techniques for locating\n   an antibody in a sample would not be disregarded in the threshold inquiry of whether the claimed invention qualifies as subject matter eligible for the patent system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   New methods for diagnosing medical conditions, as a general matter, intuitively seem to be the kind of subject matter the patent system is designed for: to encourage the risky, expensive, unpredictable technical research and development that people would not otherwise pursue in the hope that\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   they discover something of great medical value, then they will be protected and rewarded for that successful effort with a patent. This category of invention, after all, is not the same as methods of entering into contracts, or horse whispering, or speed dating or other methods that animated many of the concerns underlying\n   <em>\n    Bilski\n   </em>\n   . The kind of lab work undertaken in discovering new diagnostics and performing the steps of such claimed inventions can only be described as being technical in nature. For several decades before\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   , this has been the basis for why the Patent Office granted patents for many medical diagnostics-not just for the law of nature in the abstract, but as applied in the real-world medical context to diagnose patient health conditions. In any meaningful sense, this represents a practical application of the discovered law of nature, that is, it is applied science in every sense of that term. And it should be patentable subject matter in a well-functioning patent system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The most recent Supreme Court opinions are clear in my view on how to address claims like Athena's. Even though Athena's claims likely would be found patent-eligible under\n   <em>\n    Diehr\n   </em>\n   's framework, it is not an inferior court's role to dodge the clear, recent direction of the Supreme Court. Accordingly, I concur with denial of the petition for rehearing\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Moore, Circuit Judge, with whom O'Malley, Wallach, and Stoll, Circuit Judges, join, dissenting from the denial of the petition for rehearing en banc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   This is not a case in which the judges of this court disagree over whether diagnostic claims, like those at issue in\n   <em>\n    Athena\n   </em>\n   , should be eligible for patent protection. They should. None of my colleagues defend the conclusion that claims to diagnostic kits and diagnostic techniques, like those at issue, should be ineligible. The only difference among us is whether the Supreme Court's\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   decision requires this outcome. The majority of my colleagues believe that our hands are tied and that\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   requires this outcome. I believe\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   does not. The Patent Act renders eligible the invention or discovery of any new and useful process.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Diagnostic medicine saves lives and money through early detection and reduces the need for high cost pharmaceuticals or curative procedures, but developing diagnostic kits and techniques is expensive and time consuming.

We are hard-pressed to identify facets of modern medicine that do not employ or rely on diagnostics. Diagnostics are \"crucial in mitigating the effect of disease out-breaks.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, had diagnostic techniques been developed\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the 2015 Ebola outbreak, and applied to patients early enough, the population-attack rate of Ebola could have been reduced from 80% to 0%.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058115,4058188\" index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/1282/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ebola is only one example. \"Poor diagnostic preparedness has [also] contributed to significant delays in the identification of ... Lassa Fever, yellow fever, and Zika.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Disease epidemics are not the only life-threatening conditions to which diagnostics provide a meaningful response. Diagnostics are pivotal to addressing the advent and increase in drug-resistant infections. Current estimates project that by 2050, drug-resistant infections will \"lead to 10 million people dying every year and ... would cost the world up to 100 trillion\" dollars.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Diagnostic tests are a\n   critical component of the answer to this problem. Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (\"MRSA\") is an example of an antibiotic-resistant infection that burdens American hospitals in terms of morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Its treatment, and the outcome of that treatment, depends on appropriate diagnosis and antibiotic administration.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058115,4058188\" index=\"294\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/1282/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And the effects of diagnostics in improving the detection and treatment of cancer, human immunodeficiency virus, as well as\n   <em>\n    in vitro\n   </em>\n   care should not be overlooked.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rohr,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   note 6.

The diagnostic industry drives medical costs down, not up. People suffering from illness or disease will do whatever they can to find a cure. Proper diagnoses allow for earlier detection of illness and targeted treatment. But without proper diagnosis, patients have to endure numerous unsuccessful and costly treatments. Both the financial burden of continued testing and treatment and the emotional and physical tolls associated with suffering from symptoms, but not knowing the cause, can be reduced or even prevented thanks to diagnostics. And when there are specific advances, discoveries, or inventions in the diagnostics industry, they must be eligible for patent protection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Unless one opposes the notion of patent protection entirely, it cannot be reasonably disputed that claims to diagnostic kits and techniques, like pharmaceuticals, which require enormous initial investments in terms of both time and money, are the reason we suffer the promise of a monopoly. As many have explained, without patent protection, there will be little incentive for companies to invest the monumental amount of time and money necessary to develop diagnostic kits, tools and techniques. A recent article, co-written by Paul Michel, former Chief Judge of the Federal Circuit, and David Kappos, former Director of the PTO, states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   This uncertain patent climate has a chilling effect on innovation in biosciences to the detriment of public health. ...

New and useful discoveries, such as the before unknown relationship between anti-MuSK autoantibodies and MG, when applied in a \"process,\" should pass muster as eligible under the statutory text of \u00a7 101. Our decision to entirely disregard the discovery incorporated in the claims is a misapplication of the statute. This is not to say that a claim on the discovery of a law of nature itself or a natural phenomenon should be eligible. I agree it should not. But to wholly ignore the inventiveness of the discovery when assessing patent eligibility closes our eyes to the statute enacted by Congress. Athena discovered that 20% of people suffering from MG generate autoantibodies that bind to a MuSK protein. Its claims recite concrete steps to detect the presence of autoantibodies to MuSK to diagnose MG. These antibody/MuSK complexes had never been used by prior art MG diagnostic tests. In contrast, the claims in\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   recited a generic \"determining\" step, with no laboratory test at all specified by the claims, and the specification itself stated that the methods were \"well-understood, routine, and conventional activity already engaged in by the scientific community.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188353\" index=\"363\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/66/#p74\">\n    566 U.S. at 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188353\" index=\"364\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/66/#p74\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because my colleagues have declined to do so, there are no more options at this court for diagnostic patents. My colleagues' refusal deflates the Amici's hopeful suggestion that our precedent leaves the eligibility of a diagnostic claim in front of the Federal Circuit \"uncertain.\" It is no longer uncertain. Since\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   , every diagnostic claim to come before this court has been held ineligible. While we believe that such claims should be eligible for patent protection, the majority of this court has definitively concluded that the Supreme Court prevents us from so holding. No need to waste resources with additional en banc requests. Your only hope lies with the Supreme Court or Congress. I hope that they recognize the importance of these technologies, the benefits to society, and the market incentives for American business.

This rule as applied to the facts of this case dictated that the majority panel find the claimed invention ineligible. But, because this court's bright-line rule is based on an over-reaching and flawed test for eligibility, a test that undermines the constitutional rationale for having a patent system-promoting the progress of science and useful arts-the court should take this opportunity to correct its erroneous rule. So, while I stand by the panel decision in this case, I write separately to dissent from the denial of en banc rehearing because the question of the eligibility of diagnostic inventions is exactly the type of exceptionally important issue that warrants full consideration by this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 35 directs us to order rehearing en banc when \"the proceeding involves a question of exceptional importance.\" Fed. R. App. P. 35(a)(2). A question is of exceptional importance if it creates \"important systemic consequences for the development of the law and the administration of justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Watson v. Geren\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5680379\" index=\"455\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/587/156/#p160\">\n    587 F.3d 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 160 (2d Cir. 2009). As Judge Newman and Judge Moore aptly describe, a wholesale bar on patent eligibility for diagnostic claims has far-reaching and long-ranging implications for the development of life-saving diagnostic methods. The eligibility of life-saving inventions is not only one of the most important issues of patent law, but of human health. Thus, the importance of the issue here mandates that we consider it en banc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   Interpreting\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   , our prior opinions seem to take for granted that the Supreme Court has foreclosed all avenues of patent protection for diagnostic claims. As Judge Moore points out, we have held every diagnostic claim in every case before us ineligible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Dissent Op. at 1352-53 (Moore, J.). Our inflexible following of\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   has created flawed decisions that are inconsistent with the precepts of\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   and our patent system as a whole. The\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   test was guided by broad-sweeping principles that are not applicable to every individual diagnostic claim. For example,\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   emphasizes that patent eligibility cannot apply to \"processes that too broadly preempt the use of a natural law.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188353\" index=\"456\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/66/#p74\">\n    566 U.S. at 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188353\" index=\"457\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/66/#p74\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Certain diagnostic claims, such as the ones at issue in this case, are so narrowly tailored that preemption is not a reasonable concern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   Given the importance of this question, I would urge the en banc court to take the opportunity to entertain the thoughtful argument and fully developed record that such review would provide, and reconsider this critically important issue. As Congress's recent interest in \u00a7 101 legislation has demonstrated, there are a variety of stakeholders that consider this issue to be vitally important. En banc rehearing would not only permit us to have a more extensive view of the various considerations underlying\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   , but it would also allow us to create judicial doctrine geared toward the practical application of\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   's principles. At the very least, en banc review would help the court develop an articulable standard for its \u00a7 101 jurisprudence moving forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   In my view, by consistently bypassing en banc review of a critical issue that goes to the heart of this court's jurisdiction, we are abdicating our responsibility.

I write separately, however, because I believe that confusion and disagreements over patent eligibility have been engendered by the fact that the Supreme Court has ignored Congress's direction to the courts to apply 35 U.S.C. sections 101,\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   (\"Patent Act\") as written. Specifically, the Supreme Court has instructed federal courts to read into Section 101 an \"inventive concept\" requirement-a baffling standard that Congress removed when it amended the Patent Act in 1952. I encourage Congress to amend the Patent Act once more to clarify that it meant what it said in 1952.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   I begin with some historical perspective. After World War II, federal courts were invalidating patents at break-neck speed. Lawrence Baum,\n   <em>\n    The Federal Courts and Patent Validity: An Analysis of the Record\n   </em>\n   , 56 J. Patent Office Soc'y 758, 760 tbl. 1 (1974) (showing that federal appellate courts, on average, invalidated patents at a rate of 77% between 1941-1945), 777 tbl. 5 (showing that the Supreme Court invalidated patents at a rate higher than 81% from 1921-1973, except during 1953-1964 when the Court did not issue any decisions on patent validity). As Justice Jackson wrote, it seemed the only valid patent was \"one which [the Supreme Court] ha[d] not been able to get its hands on.\"\n   <em>\n    Jungersen v. Ostby &amp; Barton Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6160419\" index=\"461\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/335/560/#p572\">\n    335 U.S. 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 572,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6160419\" index=\"462\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/335/560/#p572\">\n    69 S.Ct. 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"463\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20L.%20Ed.%20235\">\n    93 L.Ed. 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1949) (Jackson, J., dissenting). This was due, in large part, to what became known as the \"invention requirement\"-itself \"invented\" by the Supreme Court rather than Congress or the Constitution. Applying this requirement meant asking whether a patent evidenced \"invention.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   Prominent jurists of that time remarked that the requirement was unworkable. Judge Learned Hand opined that, under this requirement, \" 'invention' became perhaps the most baffling concept in the whole catalogue of judicial efforts to provide postulates for indefinitely varying occasions.\"\n   <em>\n    Lyon v. Bausch &amp; Lomb Optical Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"56152\" index=\"464\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/224/530/#p536\">\n    224 F.2d 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 536 (2d Cir. 1955). According to Judge Giles Rich, because inventiveness \"is an unmeasurable quantity having different meanings for different persons,\" the invention requirement \"left every judge practically scott-free to decide this often controlling factor according to his personal philosophy of what inventions\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   be patented.\" Giles S.

If the invention requirement and its criticisms sound familiar, that is because they are.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Congress attempted to address these criticisms by amending the Patent Act to replace the ill-defined and judicially-created invention requirement with the more workable anticipation and obviousness tests codified in Sections 102 and 103.

Against this back-drop, the search for an inventive concept-now enshrined in the \u00a7 101 inquiry via\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   -calls back to the invention requirement that Congress quite deliberately abrogated through the Patent Act of 1952.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   In fact, the disagreement here centers on whether the additional limitations in the claims, either individually or as an ordered combination, satisfy the inventive concept requirement.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Lourie Op. at 1336 (\"Under Supreme Court precedent, I do not believe that specific yet purely conventional detection steps impart eligibility to a claim that otherwise only sets forth what the Court has held is a natural law.\" (internal quotations omitted)),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Moore Op. at 1362 (\"These [additional] steps are not set out at the 'high level of generality' that concerned the Court in\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   , and they specifically confine their reach to a specific application of the relationship between anti-MuSK antibodies and MG.\"). Had the Supreme Court not disregarded Congress's wishes for a second time, perhaps the outcome in this case would be different.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lourie Op. at 1335 (\"If I could write on a clean slate, ... I would not exclude uses or detection of natural laws.\"). Indeed, claims directed to uses of natural laws rather than the natural laws themselves would be eligible under \u00a7 101 as written. Because the Supreme Court judicially revived the invention requirement and continues to apply it despite express abrogation, I dissent to encourage Congress to clarify that there should be no such requirement read into \u00a7 101 ; to clarify that concepts of novelty and \"invention\" are to be assessed via application of other provisions of the Patent Act Congress designed for that purpose.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-221\">\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Trading Techs.
