JONES, Circuit Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   These appeals challenge the district court's approval of a global settlement between Ralph Janvey, the Receiver for Stanford International Bank and related entities, and various insurance company\n   Underwriters, who issued policies providing coverage for fidelity breaches, professional indemnity, directors and officers protection, and excess losses. The settlement yielded $ 65 million for the Receiver's claims against the insurance policy proceeds, but it wipes out, through \"bar orders,\" claims by coinsureds to the policy proceeds and their extracontractual claims against the Underwriters even if such claims would not reduce or affect the policies' coverage limits. Among the parties whose claims were barred are Appellants comprising (a) two groups of former Stanford managers and employees; (b) Cordell Haymon, a Stanford entity director who settled with the Receiver for $ 2 million; and (c) a group of Louisiana retiree-investors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A constellation of issues surrounding the global settlement is encapsulated in the question whether the district court abused its discretion in approving the settlement and bar orders. Based on the nature of\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction and the limitations on the court's and Receiver's equitable power, we conclude the district court lacked authority to approve the Receiver's settlement to the extent it (a) nullified the coinsureds' claims to the policy proceeds without an alternative compensation scheme; (b) released claims the Estate did not possess; and (c) barred suits that could not result in judgments against proceeds of the Underwriters' policies or other receivership assets. Accordingly, we VACATE the district court's order approving the settlement and bar orders and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The massive Stanford Financial Ponzi scheme defrauded more than 18,000 investors who collectively lost over $ 5 billion. As part of a securities fraud lawsuit brought by the SEC, the district court appointed the Receiver \"to immediately take and have complete and exclusive control\" of the receivership estate and \"any assets traceable\" to it. The court granted the Receiver \"the full power of an equity receiver under common law,\" including the right to assert claims against third parties and \"persons or entities who received assets or records traceable to the Receivership Estate.\"\n   <em>\n    SEC v. Stanford Int'l Bank, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3832535\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/776/323/#p326\">\n    776 F. Supp. 2d 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 326 (N.D. Tex. 2011). The district court also held that the court possessed exclusive jurisdiction over a group of insurance policies and their proceeds, at issue in this case, and ruled that, other than a lawsuit involving the Stanford criminal defendants, \"[n]o persons or entities may bring further claims related to the [Proceeds] in any forum other than\" the district court. Neither of these latter two orders was timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The policies issued to the Stanford entities covered, in different arrangements, losses and defense costs for the entities and their officers, directors and certain employees. At issue are the following policies: a Directors' and Officers' Liability and Company Indemnity Policy (\"D&amp;O\"); a Financial Institutions Crime and Professional Indemnity Policy, including (a) first-party fidelity coverage for employee theft (\"Fidelity Bond\") and \"[l]oss resulting directly from dishonest, malicious or fraudulent acts committed by an Employee,\" and (b) third-party coverage for professional indemnity (\"PI Policy\"); and an Excess Blended \"Wrap\" Policy (\"Excess Policy\"). The policy limits are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-24\"><strong>Stanford Bank Entities</strong> <strong>Stanford Brokerage Entities</strong> <strong>D&amp;O Policy</strong> $5 million $5 million <strong>PI Policy</strong> $5 million per Claim $5 million per Claim $10 million aggregate $10 million aggregate <strong>Fidelity</strong> $5 million per Loss $5 million per Loss <strong>Bond</strong> $10 million aggregate $10 million aggregate <strong>Excess</strong> $45 million each Claim or Loss/$90 million aggregate <strong>Policy</strong></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The maximum amount of remaining coverage is disputed. According to the district court, the Underwriters have paid some $ 30 million in claims under the policies for insureds' defense costs. Underwriters contend that only $ 46 million remains available because the losses resulted from a single event-the Ponzi scheme. The Receiver argues that the conduct implicates the aggregate loss limits up to $ 101 million of remaining coverage. The questions of coverage ultimately depend on the identity of the insureds under each policy and the nature of the claims, and these issues are hotly contested. The Stanford corporate entities are insured under all of the policies, but Stanford directors, officers, and employees are coinsureds only under the D&amp;O, PI, and Excess policies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Each policy is subject to multiple definitions and exclusions. After the Receiver made numerous claims for coverage under the policies (the \"Direct Claims\") that were met with Underwriters' denial based on policy exclusions, several lawsuits ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Receiver also pursued the policy proceeds indirectly by filing lawsuits (the \"Indirect Claims\") against hundreds of former Stanford directors, officers, and employees, alleging fraudulent transfers and unjust enrichment and/or breach of fiduciary duty. The Receiver obtained a $ 2 billion judgment against one former Stanford International Bank director and a $ 57 million judgment against a former Bank treasurer, both of whom were potentially covered under the policies. The Receiver continues to litigate similar claims against the coinsured Appellants who were Stanford managers and employees.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Stanford International Bank, Ltd., et al., v. James R. Alguire, et al.\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:09-CV-0724-N (N.D. Tex., filed Dec. 18, 2019).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After eight years of sparring, the Receiver and Underwriters, together with the court-appointed Examiner on behalf of Stanford investors, mediated their disputes for several months in 2015. Mediation initially resulted in a Settlement Proposal under which the Underwriters agreed to pay the Receiver $ 65 million, and in return the Receiver would \"fully release any and all insureds under the relevant policies.\" The purpose of the complete release was to shield the Underwriters from any policy obligations to defend or indemnify former Stanford personnel, including the employee Appellants, in the Receiver's Indirect Claim lawsuits. The parties almost immediately disagreed about the content of the settlement, however,\n   and the Underwriters filed an Expedited Motion to Enforce the Settlement Agreement. The district court denied the motion and instructed the parties to continue negotiating. On June 27, 2016, the Receiver and Underwriters notified the court that they had entered into a new settlement agreement, which the Examiner supported.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Under this new settlement, the Underwriters again agreed to pay $ 65 million into the receivership estate, but the settlement required orders barring all actions against Underwriters relating to the policies or the Stanford Entities. Paragraph 35 of the settlement provides Underwriters the unqualified right to withdraw from the settlement if the court refuses to issue the bar orders. The bar orders were necessary because, unlike the terms of the first proposed settlement, the Receiver is required to release only the Estate's claims against 16 directors and officers (rather than all insureds), as well as the judgments already obtained against certain directors and officers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   All other former Stanford employees, officers and directors, including Appellants, remain subject to ongoing or potential litigation by the Receiver once the litigation stay against them is lifted. Some Appellants assert that their individual costs of defending the Receiver's ongoing actions already exceed $ 10,000. But the bar orders prevent them from suing the Underwriters for their costs of defense and indemnity under the insurance policies, even though they are coinsured, or for extra-contractual or statutory claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Receiver moved for approval of the settlement and entry of the bar orders. The district court directed notice to all interested parties, and received objections from several third parties, including Appellants. The court heard arguments of counsel regarding the settlement, but it refused to allow parties to offer evidence or live testimony or engage in cross-examination. After the hearing, parties were permitted to file additional declarations or affidavits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The district court approved the settlement and bar orders, denied all objections, and approved the payment of $ 14 million of attorney fees to Receiver's counsel. Separate Final Judgments and Bar Orders were entered in each action pending before it relating to the Stanford Entities and in Appellant Haymon's and Appellant Alvarado's separate lawsuits against the Underwriters. The district court rejected all post-trial motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A more complete discussion of the court's findings will follow, but in general, the court found that the settlement resulted from \"vigorous, good faith, arm's-length, mediated negotiations\" and concluded that the settlement was \"in all respects, fair, reasonable, and adequate, and in the best interests of all Persons claiming an interest in, having authority over, or asserting a claim against Underwriters, Underwriters' Insureds, the Stanford Entities, the Receiver, or the Receivership Estate.\" The court further found that the settlement and bar orders were \"fair, just, and equitable,\" and it rejected the Appellants' due process claims based on their exclusion from settlement talks and the lack of an evidentiary hearing. While the\n   court recognized that the bar orders discriminate between a few Stanford officers and the Appellants, it reasoned that \"on balance the unfairness alleged by the Objectors is either mitigated by other circumstances or simply outweighed by the benefit of the settlement in terms of fairness, equity, reasonableness, and the best interests of the receivership.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Appellants fall into three categories. The McDaniel Appellants and \"Alvarado\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellants are former Stanford managers or employees from offices around the country (\"Employees\") who seek contractual coverage under the insurance policies and press extra-contractual claims against the Underwriters, including for bad faith and statutory violations of the Texas Insurance Code. Appellant Cordell Haymon (\"Haymon\") was a member of Stanford Trust Company's Board of Directors who settled the Receiver's claims against him for $ 2 million before the instant global settlement was reached, and in return received the express right to pursue Underwriters for policy coverage and extra-contractual claims. Finally, the Louisiana Retirees/Becker Appellants (\"Retirees\") are former Stanford investors who sued Stanford brokers covered by the insurance policies and seek to recover from the Underwriters directly pursuant to the Louisiana Direct Action Statute, La. Rev. Stat. 22:1269.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Each group of Appellants raises different challenges to the court's approval of the settlement and bar orders. They appeal from the district court's order denying their objections to the proposed settlement, the Final Bar Order, and the Order Approving Attorneys' Fees\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   for the Receiver's counsel. The Stanford Employees additionally appeal the Order denying their new trial motion, and Haymon appeals from the Order denying his motion for reconsideration. After explaining the principles that govern the court's management of the Receivership, we will analyze each set of Appellants' objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A district court's entry of a bar order, like other actions in supervising an equity receivership, is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    SEC v.

Importantly,\n   <em>\n    Kaleta\n   </em>\n   is an unpublished, non-precedential decision of this court. Not only that, but reading it as the district court and Appellees here advocate would mean investing the Receiver with unbridled discretion to terminate the third-party claims against a settling party that are unconnected to the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   establishing jurisdiction. That is unprecedented. But\n   <em>\n    Kaleta\n   </em>\n   is in any event distinguishable and not inconsistent with the above-stated principles. In\n   <em>\n    Kaleta\n   </em>\n   , the bar order prevented defrauded investors from suing parties closely affiliated with the entity in receivership after the parties had agreed to make good on their guarantees to the receiver. Moreover, the settling parties would have been codefendants with receivership entities, leading to the possibility of their asserting indemnity or contribution from the estate. The court was forestalling a race to judgment that would have diminished the recovery of all creditors against receivership assets. That bar order protected the assets of the receivership estate, whereas the bar orders before us extend beyond receivership assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Receiver also contends that the district court may permanently enjoin the claims of non-consenting third parties based on general statements about ancillary powers found in SEC cases such as\n   <em>\n    Wencke\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Safety\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Financial Services\n   </em>\n   .

In fact, the court in\n   <em>\n    Wencke\n   </em>\n   recognized that its holding was limited to the propriety of staying third-party \"proceedings\n   <em>\n    against a court-imposed receivership\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Wencke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"478916\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/622/1363/#p1369\">\n    622 F.2d at 1371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

The court approved a bar order preventing three defrauded IRA Account holders (out of over 5,500 victims) from pursuing claims against the depository bank in which the accounts had been illegally commingled. Notably, however, the court demonstrated that (1) the claims\n   of the barred investors precisely mirrored claims that had been asserted and settled by the receiver; (2) averted a duplicative lawsuit whereby the bank could have asserted its contract right to indemnity from the receivership assets; and (3) provided the account holders with a claim against the receivership estate. The court simply channeled redundant claims into the receivership while preventing diminution of receivership assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Returning to the broad issue in this case, whether the district court abused its discretion in approving the settlement and bar orders, there are two subparts to the question. The first is whether the district court's equitable power to fashion ancillary relief could be used to bar claims by insureds to proceeds of the Underwriters' policies, which are property within the receivership estate. The second is whether the court's equitable power may be used to bar third-party claims, like tort or statutory claims, against the Underwriters but unconnected to the property of the Receivership. The answers to these questions vary according to the Appellants' claims. Texas law, unless otherwise noted, applies by virtue of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20959\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Party Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Appellants Alvarado and McDaniel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The McDaniel and Alvarado Appellants are all former Stanford managers or employees who are being sued by the Receiver for clawbacks of their compensation via the Receiver's Indirect Claims on the Underwriters' policies. Appellants seek coverage under the insurance policies, which Underwriters have denied, to defend against these lawsuits and indemnify their losses. Appellants object to the settlement and bar orders on numerous grounds. From a practical standpoint, the settlement will exhaust the Underwriters' policy proceeds, leaving these Appellants wholly uninsured against the Receiver's lawsuits. The bar orders, moreover, prevent them from pursuing against the Underwriters not only breach of contract claims for violating the duties to defend and indemnify, but also statutory and tort claims that, if successful, would not be paid from policy proceeds and would not reduce Receivership assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The district court's rejection of Appellants' objections rested generally on its conclusion that the settlement and bar orders are fair, equitable, reasonable and in the best interests of the receivership estate. As has been noted, the court cited only the\n   <em>\n    Kaleta\n   </em>\n   case, affirmed by a non-precedential decision of this court, in support of its conclusions. The court's reasoning invoked the perceived necessity of a settlement, together with the bar orders, to resolve fairly and efficiently the competing claims of the Receiver and Underwriters about policy coverage and assure the maximum recovery for Stanford's defrauded investors. Without the bar orders, the court stated, Underwriters would not settle. The court pointedly refused to decide whether policy exclusions apply to the Appellants' coverage claims. Even if such exclusions barred coverage, the court added, then the Receiver might also be barred by the same exclusions and all potential benefit of the settlement would be lost. In sum, the Appellants would lose out no matter what: their claims could be barred by exclusions, held uninsurable, or the Receiver, having the right to settle, would exhaust the proceeds first.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The balance of benefits\n   to the receivership estate against Appellants' admitted losses weighed in favor of the court's approving the settlement and bar orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In the course of explaining its decision, however, the court made some errors. First, its broad statement that the settlement would fail without the bar orders did not account for the fact that the parties had mediated a prior settlement that required no bar orders against these Appellants because the Receiver had agreed to release all of its claims against them. \"Global peace\" there was achieved not by bar orders, but by the Receiver's agreeing to drop the Indirect Claim suits. The final settlement required the broad bar orders only because the Receiver, for whatever reason, insisted that it must continue to pursue hundreds of clawback actions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court's broad statement also neglected to note that, despite the Receiver's overall insistence to the contrary, the Receiver nonetheless released its claims against sixteen former Stanford officers and employees in the final settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Second, the court, perhaps inadvertently, did not address the fact that Appellants were foreclosed from sharing in the assets recovered by the Receiver by filing claims against the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Third, the court failed to distinguish between the Appellants' two separate types of claims-contractual claims for defense and indemnity payable (if successful) from policy proceeds in competition with investors' claims to the Receivership assets; and independent, non-derivative, third-party claims for tort and statutory violations, which would be satisfied (if successful) out of Underwriters' assets. In this connection, the court also undervalued the Appellants' claims for indemnity by disregarding\n   <em>\n    Pendergest-Holt\n   </em>\n   . In that case, this court held that the D&amp;O policies should provide up-front reimbursement of defense costs in Stanford insureds' criminal cases pending a separate judicial proceeding to resolve the coverage question.\n   <em>\n    Pendergest-Holt v. Certain Und. at Lloyd's of London,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4224100\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/600/562/#p572\">\n    600 F.3d 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 572-74 (5th Cir. 2010). Although carefully hedged, this decision offered Appellants the prospect of possible, temporary relief for their mounting defense costs and was not \"wholly inapplicable\" to the decision concerning the settlement and bar orders. But in any event, the court did not analyze the ramifications of Appellants' distinct claims against Receivership assets and claims wholly independent of receivership assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    i. Contractual Claims for Defense and Indemnity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Reviewing first the settlement and bar of Appellants' contractual claims against the policy proceeds that are property of the receivership estate, we find that the court abused its discretion by extinguishing Appellants' claims to the policy proceeds, while making no provision for them to access the proceeds through the Receiver's claims process. This undermines the fairness of the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As the district court observed, some settlement with the Underwriters was prudent because of the sheer magnitude\n   of claims far beyond the policies' coverage, and because the scope of coverage, dependent on multiple, insured-specific factual and legal questions, is unclear.

Unlike the Stanford investors and the Receiver's attorneys, who can pursue restitution through the Receiver's claims process, Appellants have no access to the claims process. The Settlement Agreement specifically restricts payment of the Proceeds to the Receivers' attorneys and the Stanford investors and specifically excludes Stanford employees and management, including Appellants. For these Appellants, should the Receiver continue to pursue them, their claims against the Underwriters offer the only avenue of recovery. This alone serves to distinguish this case from\n   <em>\n    Kaleta\n   </em>\n   , which approved the settlement because, inter alia, the settlement agreement \"expressly permits\" those affected by the bar order \"to pursue their claims by 'participat[ing] in the claims process for the Receiver's ultimate plan of distribution for the Receivership Estate.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kaleta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4168424\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/530/360/\">\n    530 F.

Given the numerous exclusions to policy coverage,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Appellants' entitlement to proceeds may appear weak, but the court disclaimed deciding coverage issues, and the Appellants have identified several reasons, in addition to\n   <em>\n    Pendergest-Holt,\n   </em>\n   why their contractual claims might prevail on final adjudication.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Rather than extinguish the Appellants' contractual claims, the court could have\n   authorized them to be filed against the Receivership in tandem with the Stanford investors' claims. Such \"channeling orders\" are often employed to afford alternative satisfaction to competing claimants to receivership assets while limiting their rights of legal recourse against the assets.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DeYoung,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277870\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/850/1172/\">\n    850 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1182 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kaleta,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4168424\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/530/360/\">\n    530 F.

Of course, the Receiver and Underwriters were, as Appellants' counsel colorfully described, all too happy to compromise at the expense of Appellants' rights. The court purported to justify this result by claiming that \"the bar orders are not settling claims, they are enjoining them.\" No matter the euphemism, a permanent bar order is a death knell intended to extinguish the claims, which are a property interest, however valued, of the Appellants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Moreover, in approving the settlement and bar orders against these Appellants, the district court overlooked problems inherent in the settling parties' positions. The Underwriters' position was in conflict with the Appellants: by means of the bar orders, the Underwriters limited their exposure to further costly and time-consuming litigation over Appellants' non-derivative extracontractual claims against them. The Receiver was enabled by the settlement and bar orders to place Appellants in a vise: preserving his ability to sue Appellants for clawbacks even as the agreement stripped Appellants' access to any recompense from the Underwriters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   These problems cast grave doubt on the fairness and equity of the settlement and bar orders reached without Appellants' participation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In sum, although we sympathize with the impetus to settle difficult and atomized issues of insurance coverage rather than dissipate receivership assets in litigation, the settlement and bar orders violated fundamental limits on the authority of the court and Receiver. The court and Receiver could not abrogate contractual claims of these Appellants to proceeds of Underwriters' policies without affording them an alternative compensation scheme similar, if not identical, to the claims process for Stanford investors. The court could not authorize the Receiver and Underwriters to compromise their differences while extinguishing the Appellants' extracontractual claims against Underwriters. Equity must follow the law, which here constrains the court's and Receiver's authority to protecting the assets of the receivership and claims directly affecting those assets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Appellant Cordell Haymon\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Like the Alvarado and McDaniel Appellants, Appellant Cordell Haymon, a member of Stanford Trust Company's board of Directors, was targeted by the Receiver and sought coverage of his defense costs under the insurance policies. After the Underwriters denied his claim for coverage, he settled the Receiver's fiduciary duty breach suit for $ 2 million. Haymon asserts that he relied on the language of his settlement agreement, which specifically authorized the continuation of his suit against the Underwriters. Only a few months later, however, the final proposed settlement undid his expectations of recovery from the Underwriters. Haymon requested to intervene in the initial coverage dispute between Underwriters and the Receiver, and he filed objections to the proposed settlement. He argues now that the district court erred in barring all of his contractual and extracontractual tort and statutory claims against the Underwriters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   To the extent that Haymon's claims mirror those of Alvarado and McDaniel, the same results follow. The district court acted within its authority to bar Haymon's claim for contractual defense and indemnity under the insurance policies, but some alternate compensation mode from the receivership estate is required, and the court could not bar his extracontractual claims against the Underwriters. However, the ultimate evaluation of Haymon's claims may differ from that of the other Appellants for two reasons, which the district court should assess on remand. First, because his insurance coverage claim was liquidated before the final settlement ($ 2 million potential indemnity and $ 1.5 million defense costs) it was ripe for judicial determination under\n   <em>\n    Pendergest-Holt\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, Haymon received a bar order, perhaps valuable to him, against any further litigation concerning his involvement with Stanford entities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Appellant Louisiana Retirees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Unlike the foregoing Appellants, the Louisiana Retirees are not coinsureds under the insurance policies, and they are not being pursued in Indirect Claim actions by the Receiver. Retirees have assiduously pursued securities law claims against certain Stanford brokers and the Underwriters, as insurers for those brokers, under the Louisiana Direct Action Statute, La. R.S. 22:1269.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   First, the parties dispute the meaning of the bar order and the extent to which it bars the Retirees' claims. The Receiver argues that the bar order applies only to claims against the Underwriters and the Underwriters'\n   <em>\n    Released Parties\n   </em>\n   , defined as the officers, agents, etc. of Underwriters, and expressly excluding the officers, directors, or employees of Stanford Entities. Retirees argue that it enjoins them from pursuing the Stanford Claims, defined as \"any action, lawsuit or claims brought by any Stanford Investor against Underwriters [or] ...\n   <em>\n    Underwriter's Insureds\n   </em>\n   .\" In turn, Underwriters' Insureds are defined as \"any person that shall be an officer and director of any Stanford Entities ... [or] any employee of any Stanford Entities.\" On remand, it would be appropriate for the district court to determine and clarify the meaning of the bar order as to the Retirees, keeping in mind that the district court may not enjoin any claims by Retirees against the brokers that do not implicate the policy proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Second, the Retirees' claims under the Louisiana direct action statute unequivocally implicate the policy proceeds and therefore assets of the receivership. The statute specifies that an action can be brought \"within the terms and limits of the policy by the injured person.\" La. Rev. Stat. 22:1269(A), (C), (D). It \"does not create an independent cause of action against the insurer[;] it merely grants a procedural right of action against an insurer where the plaintiff has a substantive cause of action against the insured.\"\n   <em>\n    Soileau v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith True Value &amp; Rental\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6926307\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/144/771/#p780\">\n    144 So. 3d 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 780 (La. 2013). As such, the Receiver could settle with the Underwriters notwithstanding the direct action claim just as he could settle regardless of the Employee Appellants' contractual claims to policy proceeds. Further, as former investors in the Stanford entities, the Retirees were afforded a means of filing claims apart from the direct action suit, and many have availed themselves of that opportunity. Consequently, the Retirees' direct action suit against the Underwriters amounts to a redundant claim on receivership assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Nevertheless, the Retirees assert several arguments that have no bearing on the permissibility of the settlement and bar order as to them. They contend first that the settlement and bar order conflict with the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Chadbourne &amp; Parke LLP v. Troice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12701997\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/377/\">\n    571 U.S. 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12578243,12701997\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1058/\">\n    134 S.

The Court's ruling did not bear on the merits of or procedure for the Retirees' state law case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Second, they contend that\n   <em>\n    DSCC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556295\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/712/185/#p190\">\n    712 F.3d at 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , forbids giving the receiver the right to \"control the settlement of a claim it does not own.\" That is certainly correct according to our previous discussion, but here, the Receiver had standing to pursue\n   <em>\n    its own\n   </em>\n   claims as coinsured under the Underwriters' policies, such claims perfected the Receiver's interest in a valuable asset, and Texas law provided the right to settle them even at the expense of the Retirees' direct action claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Retirees argue that the district court should have first determined the disputed legal questions about the magnitude of, and legal rights to, the policy proceeds before approving the settlement and bar orders under\n   <em>\n    In re Louisiana World Exposition, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6545757,10551518,10551471\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/832/1391/\">\n    832 F.2d 1391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 1987). This argument simply misreads that case. The court in\n   <em>\n    Louisiana World\n   </em>\n   explicitly distinguished the facts before it from cases involving coinsureds with equal claims to the policy proceeds. Moreover, at least one disputed policy-the Fidelity Bond-covers only the Receivership entities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   It was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to hold that equity favored avoiding costly litigation and dissipation of receivership assets by allowing the Receiver, a coinsured with equal claim to the policy proceeds, to settle with the Underwriters. Avoiding protracted legal examination of the policy exclusions, which could just as easily bar Retirees and others from the policy proceeds, was precisely the point of the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Fourth, Retirees assert that the Anti-Injunction Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202283\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"AIA\"), prevented the court from issuing its bar orders. This argument has no merit.
