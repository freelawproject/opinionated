This appears to be an issue of first impression in this Circuit or any other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant James Hill, III (\"Defendant\") boastfully admitted to physically and violently assaulting a coworker preparing packages for interstate sale and shipment because of the coworker's sexual orientation. But after a jury convicted Defendant for violating the Hate Crimes Act, the district court granted Defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal on grounds that the Hate Crimes Act, as applied to Defendant's conduct, exceeded Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause. Because we conclude that as applied to Defendant's conduct, the Hate Crimes Act easily falls under Congress's broad authority to regulate interstate commerce, we reverse and remand to the district court to reinstate the jury's guilty verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the time of the assault, Defendant and Curtis Tibbs (\"Tibbs\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   were coworkers at an Amazon fulfillment center in Chester, Virginia. Defendant worked as a \"re-binner\" at the facility, moving items from conveyor belts and placing them into bins in a wall. Tibbs worked as a \"packer,\" loading these items from the bins into boxes for packaging, scanning them, packaging them in a box, and then placing the boxes on a conveyor belt to move to the next department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Video shows that shortly after the beginning of Tibbs's shift on May 22, 2015, as Tibbs carried items to load into a box, Defendant approached Tibbs from behind and-without provocation or warning-repeatedly punched him in the face. As a\n   result of the assault and battery, Tibbs suffered significant bruising, cuts to his face, and a bloody nose. After the incident, Tibbs went to Amazon's in-house medical clinic and then to the nearest hospital for treatment. Tibbs did not return to work on the production line for the remaining several hours of his ten-hour shift. Amazon shut down the area of the incident for approximately 30-45 minutes to clean blood off the floor, but Amazon did not miss any \"critical pull times,\" or packaging deadlines, as a result of the incident because other areas of the facility absorbed the work. J.A. 24. An expert witness testified that, notwithstanding Tibbs' absence and the temporary closure of his workspace, the performance of the fulfillment center as a whole during the shift in which the incident occurred was in-line with its performance during other shifts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant told an Amazon investigator and a local police officer that he assaulted Tibbs solely because Tibbs was gay. In particular, Defendant stated that \"his personal belief is he didn't like [homosexuals],\" that Tibbs \"disrespected him because he is a homosexual,\" and that Defendant \"does not like homosexuals, so he punched [Tibbs].\" J.A. 353, 383. Defendant offered no other explanation for the assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Commonwealth of Virginia initially charged Defendant with misdemeanor assault and battery in state court, but the state prosecutor subsequently requested that the United States \"assume prosecution of this case as a hate crime\" under the Hate Crimes Act, in part because Virginia's hate crime statute does not cover crimes based on sexual orientation. J.A. 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On July 24, 2015, the United States Attorney General certified that Defendant's prosecution under the Hate Crimes Act \"is in the public interest and is necessary to secure substantial justice.\" J.A. 25. Thereafter, the Commonwealth of Virginia dropped the misdemeanor assault charge, and on January 19, 2016, a federal grand jury indicted Defendant under the Hate Crimes Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20249\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). The indictment stated that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   On or about May 22, 2015 ... [Defendant] did willfully cause bodily injury to [Tibbs] by assaulting [Tibbs], including by punching [Tibbs], because of [Tibbs's] actual and perceived sexual orientation, namely that he is gay; and that, in connection with the offense, [Defendant] [1] interfered with commercial and other economic activity in which [Tibbs] was engaged at the time of the conduct, and which offense [2] otherwise affected interstate and foreign commerce.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   J.A. 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing in relevant part that Section 249(a)(2) of the Hate Crimes Act, on its face and as applied to him, exceeded Congress's power under the Commerce Clause.

However, because the case presented\n   an as-applied challenge, the majority opinion further concluded that it was \"premature to determine the constitutional issues\" because \"whether [Defendant's] conduct sufficiently affects interstate commerce as to satisfy the constitutional limitations placed on Congress' Commerce Clause power may well depend on a consideration of facts, and because the facts proffered here may or may not be developed at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 237.

The district court instructed the jury that the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) Defendant caused bodily injury to Tibbs; (2) Defendant did so willfully; (3) Defendant did so because of Tibbs's actual or perceived sexual orientation; and (4) Defendant's conduct \"interfered with the commercial or economic activity in which Tibbs was engaged at the time of the conduct.\" J.A. 541. The jury found Defendant guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Thereafter, pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29, Defendant moved for judgment of acquittal, arguing that the Hate Crimes Act is unconstitutional as applied to his assault of Tibbs. The district court granted Defendant's motion, concluding that the Hate Crimes Act as applied exceeds Congress's Commerce Clause authority. Specifically, the district court held that the Hate Crimes Act as applied does not regulate activity that substantially affects interstate commerce. The Government timely appealed the district court's judgment of acquittal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On appeal, the Government argues that the district court erred in granting Defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal on grounds that the Hate Crimes Act, as applied to Defendant's conduct, exceeds Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause.

What renders the Hobbs Act, the arson statute, and the firearm possession statutes-and, therefore, Defendant's prosecution of the Hate Crimes Act-constitutional is not the economic nature of the act proscribed, but rather Congress's express requirement that the act at issue, violent or otherwise, interfered with or affected interstate commerce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The distinction Defendant would have us draw between \"inherently economic\" and non-economic acts also would lead to any number of anomalous results. For example, under Defendant's reasoning, the Commerce Clause would not permit federal authorities to prosecute an individual who-like Defendant-attacked a coworker engaged in the packing and shipment of a product across state lines. However, if that shipped product was a firearm and the recipient sat on a park bench within 1,000 feet of a public school while in possession of that firearm-be it the following day or seventeen years later-the recipient's conduct would have a sufficient effect on interstate commerce to support the recipient's conviction under the Commerce Clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

It can hardly be gainsaid that the possession of a firearm outside a school bears any more obvious a relationship to interstate commerce than interfering with the\n   <em>\n    actual shipment\n   </em>\n   of the same firearm across state lines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Third, Defendant argues that Defendant's prosecution under the Hate Crimes Act differs from the Supreme Court's Hobbs Act and arson cases because Defendant did not assault Tibbs \"in order to further an economic interest.\" Appellee Br. at 19. But the Supreme Court has recognized that the economic or non-economic nature of proscribed conduct turns on whether the conduct can be shown to\n   <em>\n    interfere with\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    affect\n   </em>\n   economic activity subject to congressional regulation-and therefore interstate commerce-and not whether the perpetrator of the conduct was\n   <em>\n    motivated\n   </em>\n   by economic interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   , 529 U.S. at 854,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9509211\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/848/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring courts to consider the commercial function, if any, of destroyed property to determine whether its destruction may be prosecuted under the federal arson statute).

Yet there is no constitutional or logical basis to conclude that the Commerce Clause authorizes Congress to regulate interference with one factor of production (capital, in the form of real property), but not another (labor). On the contrary, the Supreme Court's longstanding recognition that Congress may pervasively regulate the labor market and the terms and conditions of employment indicates that Congress may proscribe conduct that interferes with labor as well as capital.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    NLRB v.

This is incorrect.

To that end, the Hate Crimes Act, as applied, permits the prosecution of an\n    <em>\n     intrastate\n    </em>\n    hate crime only when it interferes with the victim's ongoing commercial and economic activities-here, the preparation of packages for interstate sale and shipment. Contrary to the dissenting opinion's assertion,\n    <em>\n     post\n    </em>\n    at 216-17, in drafting the Hate Crime Act's interstate commerce jurisdictional elements, Congress invoked the \"full scope of [its] Commerce Clause power\" and drew the legislation to comport with\n    <em>\n     Lopez\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Morrison\n    </em>\n    , which \"set[ ] forth outer reaches of [Congress's] commerce power.\" H.R. Rep. No. 111-86, at 15. That power extends to intrastate violent conduct that interferes with commercial or economic activity over which Congress has regulatory power-here the interstate markets for labor and retail goods. Defendant's prosecution, therefore, falls squarely within Congress's authority to regulate intrastate activities when they interfere with interstate commerce that Congress may permissibly regulate. Accordingly, the dissenting opinion errs in concluding that the jury failed to convict Defendant of a crime with a \"stated interstate or foreign commerce jurisdictional basis.\"\n    <em>\n     Post\n    </em>\n    at 216.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-182\">\n    We also note that in \"assessing the scope of Congress' Commerce Clause authority\" under the Hate Crimes Act, we \"need not determine whether [the regulated conduct], taken in the aggregate, substantially affect[s] interstate commerce in fact, but only whether a 'rational basis' exists for so concluding.\"\n    <em>\n     Raich\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208788\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/1/\">\n     545 U.S. at 22\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208788\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/1/\">\n     125 S.Ct. 2195\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Unlike the majority, I conclude that Congress' power under the Commerce Clause does not permit Hill's prosecution under that statute. This is so for two principal reasons. First, unlike the other provisions of \u00a7 249(a)(2)(B) -and, indeed, unlike \"jurisdictional elements\" in other statutes- \u00a7 249(a)(2)(B)(iv)(I) does not limit the class of activities being regulated to acts that fall under Congress' Commerce Clause power. Second, the root activity \u00a7 249(a)(2) regulated in this case-a bias-motivated punch-is not an inherently economic activity and therefore not within the scope of Congress' Commerce Clause authority. For the reasons expounded below, I would affirm the district court's decision to vacate Hill's conviction and respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The district court held that \u00a7 249(a)(2) was unconstitutional as applied to Hill in this case. I agree. And while my analysis of \u00a7 249(a)(2)(B)(iv)(I) would likely implicate other prosecutions brought under this particular provision, it is sufficient in this case to determine that the statute operated in a way that was unconstitutional as applied to Hill.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Seling v.
