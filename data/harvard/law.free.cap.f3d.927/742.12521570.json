Treating Baloga's speech and association claims together, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the District and Serino, concluding that Baloga's activity was not constitutionally protected because it did not implicate a matter of public concern. As we recently emphasized in\n   <em>\n    Palardy v. Township of Millburn\n   </em>\n   , however, where a public employee\n   asserts retaliation in violation of the First Amendment as a free speech claim and a pure union association claim, those claims must be analyzed separately, and consistent with longstanding Supreme Court precedent, there is no need to make a separate showing of public concern for a pure union association claim because membership in a public union is \"always a matter of public concern.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518949\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/906/76/#p80\">\n    906 F.3d 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 80-81, 83 (3d Cir. 2018),\n   <em>\n    cert. denied\n   </em>\n   , No. 18-830, --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620270,12620271,12620272,12620273,12620274,12620275\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/2011/\">\n    139 S.Ct. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=204%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20215\">\n    204 L.Ed.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%202078114\">\n    2019 WL 2078114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (May 13, 2019). Because Baloga has raised a triable issue about whether he was retaliated against based solely on his union association, we will affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Baloga became a full-time custodian for the District in 1999. Between 2008 and 2016, he worked most of the year at the primary center,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   where his duties related to field maintenance and outdoor work. Given the seasonal nature of that work, however, the District would transfer Baloga to the high school each year from December through late February or March of the following year, with the specific rotation dates depending on the District's needs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In addition to these job responsibilities, Baloga began serving as the vice president of the custodial union in 2010. In this role, he was regularly approached by fellow custodians about problems they were having with the District, and Baloga made efforts to solve them internally, often acting as the union's \"mouthpiece\" in relaying concerns to the District. JA 63. However, the decision whether to escalate an issue to an official grievance was decided by Thomas Rome, the union president, in consultation with Baloga.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   According to Baloga and Rome, the relationship between the union and the District-and, in particular, its maintenance director, Jim Serino-was strained. Over the years, Baloga testified, Serino repeatedly threatened that the school board would eliminate union members' days off if the union continued to file grievances. And according to Rome, \"[t]here was never a good atmosphere\" between the union and Serino, and it appeared that Serino did not \"ha[ve] respect for the bargaining unit.\" JA 64. Rome also testified that he thought Serino \"wanted [Baloga] out of the mix\" because Baloga, \"being [at the high school] ... , being pro union, [and] being pro contract,\" might \"interfere\" with Serino's directives. JA 64. School board members and others employed by the District likewise perceived Serino to have a negative attitude toward the union.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the 2015-2016 school year, Baloga rotated from the primary center to the high school in early January, a little later than usual. Within a couple of weeks, Baloga learned that the District intended to\n   require custodians to work on Martin Luther King Jr. Day even though they had received that day as a holiday for the past twenty-six years. Teachers and students continued to have the day off. On January 15, 2016, after consulting with Baloga, Rome filed a grievance on behalf of the union, challenging the District's decision as a violation of a past practice. The same day, Baloga sent a text message to Serino, and the following exchange ensued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Baloga: I have plans on Monday. Why are they making us work. We never worked a [Martin Luther King Jr.] day ever. In my 26 years. Do I have to take a day off?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Serino: Unfortunately there is [sic] multiple events and lots of work that needs to be completed. A day will have to be used if you are not present.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Baloga: You can't do anything as boss. You['re] the director. You have a lot of influence. Why can't you talk to [superintendent] Kevin [Booth].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Serino: Already did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Baloga: In the past [former maintenance director] Clarence always got us the day off. It really hurts us with families.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   JA 25. Shortly after the union filed the grievance, Baloga also exchanged words with his direct supervisor, Ken Bangs, who told him that \"because you filed a grievance on Martin Luther ... King Day, the board now says you have to work full days on snow days.\" JA 212.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On the following Friday, January 22, 2016, Baloga and Serino spoke in person about the grievance. According to Baloga, Serino was \"very, very angry,\" accused him of \"complaining,\" and said that if Baloga was \"not happy [at the high school],\" Serino \"could transfer [him] today.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   JA 215. Baloga demurred, telling Serino that he was happy in his position but that \"people are coming to me as the vice president [of the union] wondering why they're getting a day taken off them,\" JA 40, to which Serino responded: \"You should have never filed that grievance until you talked to me,\" JA 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Later that day, less than three weeks into Baloga's rotation, Bangs notified him that he was being transferred back to the primary center, effective the next business day-that is, more than a month before his usual transfer date. Serino did not explain the transfer decision to Baloga, but he asserted in subsequent deposition testimony that there were two reasons: (1) Baloga's colleagues said he was \"bringing the morale\" of the group down by \"whining,\" JA 102; and (2) the District had hired new employees, so Baloga's continued assistance at the high school was no longer necessary. Notwithstanding the District's prior practice of annual rotations, Baloga has not been assigned to work at the high school again since the transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Although the early (and, effectively, permanent) transfer did not change his pay or benefits, Baloga testified that it negatively affected him in other ways. For example, he could no longer go home during lunchtime to help his wife, who homeschools their eight children, because the primary center is twice as far as the high school from his home. He also could no longer work the 6:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. shift-a benefit only available to workers at the high school-which had allowed him to go home early at least once a month. Finally,\n   he described the transfer as effectively a demotion in job responsibilities, with attendant reputational and emotional costs, as his tasks at the primary center during the winter months were menial relative to those at the high school, reducing him to \"a mop and a broom.\" JA 38. Fearful of further retribution, however, Baloga did not file a grievance to contest his transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Baloga eventually filed the underlying complaint in this action, asserting two First Amendment retaliation claims against the District and Serino (the \"Defendants\")-one for a violation of his freedom of speech and one for a violation of his right to associate with the union. The parties then filed cross-motions for summary judgment, with the Defendants arguing that Baloga's activity was not constitutionally protected, but that, even if it were, he failed to establish the other elements of a retaliation claim. Defendants further argued that there was no municipal policy or custom as required to support liability against the District under\n   <em>\n    Monell v. Department of Social Services of City of New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/#p690\">\n    436 U.S. 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 690,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/#p690\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/#p690\">\n    56 L.Ed.2d 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978), and that Serino was entitled to qualified immunity because any constitutional right at issue was not \"clearly established\" at the relevant time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The District Court denied Baloga's motion and-reaching only the question whether Baloga's activity was constitutionally protected-granted the Defendants'.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the Defendants sought summary judgment on both Baloga's speech and association claims, the District Court explicitly discussed only Baloga's speech, concluding that it was not constitutionally protected because it did not address a matter of public concern under\n   <em>\n    Connick v. Myers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298262\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/138/\">\n    461 U.S. 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298262\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/138/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298262\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/138/\">\n    75 L.Ed.2d 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983). Rather, the Court reasoned, his speech implicated only \"his personal preference to have a paid holiday\" and, at most, a concern for employee morale. JA 12. Even if Baloga's speech did touch on a matter of public concern, the Court continued, Baloga's \"interest in speaking out\" was subordinate to the interest of the District in assigning its personnel in a manner that \"promotes harmony in the workplace and efficient performance of its mission.\" JA 15. Without separately analyzing Baloga's association claim, the District Court then granted summary judgment to the Defendants on both counts of the complaint. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In addition to the evidence of Serino's general animus toward the union and its leadership, Baloga testified that after he told Serino that union members were approaching him \"as the [union] vice president\" to complain about losing the holiday, JA 40, Serino responded angrily, \"\n   <em>\n    you\n   </em>\n   should have never filed that grievance until you talked to me,\" JA 215 (emphasis added), and Ken Bangs said that because \"\n   <em>\n    you\n   </em>\n   filed a grievance on Martin Luther ... King Day ...\n   <em>\n    you\n   </em>\n   have to work full days on snow days,\" JA 212 (emphasis added). But, of course, Baloga was not the person who actually filed the grievance for the union-union president Thomas Rome did. Thus, \"you\" in this context could only mean \"you, as representative of the union.\" In other words, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Baloga, Baloga was transferred because his union filed a grievance and-\n   <em>\n    based on his status as a union leader\n   </em>\n   -management attributed responsibility for that filing to him. Under\n   <em>\n    Palardy\n   </em>\n   , that is enough to make out a viable association claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518949\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/906/76/#p80\">\n    906 F.3d at 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \"evidence suggesting [Township administrator] harbored animosity toward [Palardy] because of his union affiliation\" as \"a union member and leader\" was sufficient to survive summary judgment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendants take a different view. They contend that, as in\n   <em>\n    Sanguigni\n   </em>\n   , Baloga's association claim \"implicate[s] associational rights in essentially the same way and to the same degree,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515430\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/968/393/#p395\">\n    968 F.2d at 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that his speech claim does, so that the public concern requirement is not per se satisfied and should be found wanting here. But, as we explained in\n   <em>\n    Palardy\n   </em>\n   , that view is misplaced in the context of a retaliation claim based on union membership. Baloga, like Palardy, is arguing not merely-or even principally-that he was punished for his speech specific to the subject of the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday but, rather, that he was penalized for his \"affiliation\" as \"a union member and leader,\"\n   <em>\n    Palardy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518949\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/906/76/#p80\">\n    906 F.3d at 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , of the union that had filed this and other grievances. The substance of that latest grievance is simply irrelevant to his claim.

In view of the standard at summary judgment, that means that an employer, to prevail on causation, \"must present evidence of such quality that no reasonable juror could conclude that the protected activity was the but-for cause of the termination.\"\n   <em>\n    Hill v.

That the Defendants intended to transfer Baloga\n   <em>\n    at some point in the future\n   </em>\n   does not logically rebut Baloga's point that his union activity was the cause of his\n   <em>\n    accelerated\n   </em>\n   and apparently permanent transfer, which is the adverse action at issue. Nor is the fact that the District had hired more employees dispositive of whether it otherwise would have transferred Baloga at that time. To the contrary, the record reflects that, although one new hire was slated to begin work the Monday that Baloga was transferred, some, if not all, of the new employees were hired in March or April of 2015,\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   i.e., well before Baloga was even assigned to the high school, let alone transferred away from it. And at no point before this transfer was Baloga advised that his rotation to the high school would be any shorter than usual or that his job duties there were being assumed by others. Viewed in the light most favorable to Baloga, this sequence supports an inference that, notwithstanding the new hires, the District assigned Baloga to the high school in January 2016 with the expectation that he would complete his normal two-to-three month rotation, and that retaliation, not a new hire, accounted for its sudden change of heart just three weeks into that assignment and on the very day of Baloga's conversation with Serino.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Other evidence also arguably supports that inference. As the District Court itself recognized, the \"temporal proximity\" between the union's filing of the Martin Luther King Jr. Day grievance and Baloga's transfer was \"somewhat suggestive of a retaliatory motive.\" JA 8. And, likewise, the temporal proximity-mere hours-between Baloga's exchange with Serino in which Serino expressed anger over Baloga's\n   \"complaining\" and threatened to \"transfer [him] today,\" JA 215, and Baloga's being notified of his transfer effective the next business day raises questions about the credibility of Defendants' explanation for their actions,\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Farrell v.

Also potentially probative to a jury are Serino's and Bang's alleged threats of reprisal for the union's activities, the testimony about Serino's general anti-union animus, and the myriad conflicting accounts about Appellees' motivation for Baloga's transfer in Serino's testimony, Rome's testimony, and Bangs' testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   While the District Court concluded that factors such as the transitory nature of Baloga's transfers and the fact of new hires precluded summary judgment in Baloga's favor, it also recognized that the motivation for Baloga's transfer (were it to reach the question of causation) was \"far from clear,\" JA 8, and, in view of the countervailing evidence, we must agree.
