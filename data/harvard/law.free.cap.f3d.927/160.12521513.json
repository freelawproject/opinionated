The district court adopted the factual findings and advisory guidelines in the Presentence Report (\"PSR\"). After finding that he had three prior qualifying convictions, the court concluded that Battle was an armed career criminal under the ACCA. Specifically, the PSR referenced a 1991 Maryland conviction for AWIM as a violent felony and two Maryland convictions from 1998 and 2006 for possession with intent to distribute cocaine which qualified as serious drug offenses under \u00a7 924(e)(1). Accordingly, the court sentenced Battle on November 8, 2011, to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of fifteen years under the ACCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Battle directly appealed to this Court on November 9, 2011, challenging his designation as an armed career criminal and specifically arguing that his prior conviction for Maryland AWIM failed to qualify as a violent felony under the ACCA. This Court affirmed the sentence in an unpublished per curiam opinion dated October 4, 2012, concluding that the offense was a violent felony under the ACCA's residual clause. Battle filed his first\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   petition on November 25, 2013, which the district court denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , which invalidated the ACCA's residual clause as vague, and\n   <em>\n    Welch v.

This Court granted that motion on June 1, 2016, finding that Battle made the prima facie showing required for successive \u00a7 2255 petitions. In the petition before the district court, Battle argued that he no longer has the requisite number of prior convictions to qualify as an armed career criminal post-\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   because the 1991 AWIM conviction no longer qualifies under the ACCA's residual clause. The district court denied his petition, finding AWIM involves violent force sufficient to satisfy the ACCA force clause, regardless of the ruling about the ACCA's residual clause. Despite the court's finding, it granted a certificate of appealability. This Court has jurisdiction over the appeal based on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202253\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The central issue for us on appeal is whether Maryland's AWIM offense qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The ACCA requires a mandatory fifteen-year statutory minimum sentence for a defendant convicted of possession of a firearm after three prior convictions \"for a violent felony or a serious drug offense or both.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1). To frame the issue, we initially review several pertinent definitions. In defining the term \"violent felony,\" the ACCA provides a list of offenses, as well as what is known as the \"force clause,\" to define the scope of a predicate violent felony. Applicable here, under the force clause, \"violent felony\" means any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B)(i).

To determine whether Battle's AWIM conviction qualifies under the ACCA as a violent predicate felony, we apply the categorical approach originally set forth in the Supreme Court's decision of\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

We find the district court's analysis thorough and its conclusion correct. In affirming, we first address the Maryland AWIM statute and the definition of that crime. We then examine\n   <em>\n    Castleman\n   </em>\n   and this Court's decisions following it that bear heavily on the outcome of this case. Next, we evaluate the Maryland cases Battle argues indicate that AWIM can be committed in Maryland without the exercise of force.

As acknowledged by Battle himself,\n   <em>\n    Simpkins\n   </em>\n   involves a depraved heart murder conviction meaning the defendant acted with extreme indifference as opposed to an intent to kill or do grievous bodily harm. Therefore, the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Simpkins\n   </em>\n   could not be convicted of AWIM because they lacked AWIM's required \"intent to murder.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hardy v.

In that case, the defendant dragged an intoxicated, unconscious teenaged girl into the woods behind his house and left her to die of hypothermia in sub-zero temperatures.\n   <em>\n    In re Eric F\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"294737\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/116/509/\">\n    116 Md.App. 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"294737\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/116/509/\">\n    698 A.2d 1121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997).

It does not reference an assault crime and the conduct in that case clearly involves an act of commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Without support from those two cases, Battle points to\n   <em>\n    Lamb v. State,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2344987\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/93/422/\">\n    93 Md.App. 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2344987\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/93/422/\">\n    613 A.2d 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992), which offers a scholarly exploration of the crime of assault and attempted battery. However, the only citation for the general proposition that a \"battery may be perpetrated by an act of omission\" is a criminal law hornbook.\n   <em>\n    Lamb v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2344987\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/93/422/\">\n    93 Md.App. 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2344987\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/93/422/\">\n    613 A.2d 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 415 (1992). Further, although\n   <em>\n    Lamb\n   </em>\n   makes clear that a common-law assault could be committed in a number of ways, it does not refer to a Maryland assault or AWIM conviction based on an omission. Citing to a hornbook to support dicta does not equate to an exemplary prosecution under Maryland law. In fact, the primary issue in\n   <em>\n    Lamb\n   </em>\n   was whether a conviction for assault should have merged into a conviction for false imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pair v.

Therefore,\n   <em>\n    Lamb\n   </em>\n   does not support Battle's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In concluding that Maryland AWIM qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA's force clause, we find several other interpretations of Maryland law instructive. First, we note that Maryland sentencing statutes in effect at the time of Battle's conviction defined AWIM as a \"crime of violence\" for Maryland sentencing enhancement purposes, imposing mandatory sentences for such crimes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md. Code Ann., Art. 27, \u00a7 643B(a) (1957, 1987 Repl. Vol., 1991 Supp.) (defining \"crime of violence\" to include \"assault with intent to murder,\" but not including simple assault, and imposing a further imprisonment for a person who had been convicted on two separate occasions of a crime of violence, and had served at least one term of confinement as a result of a conviction of a crime of violence). Like the district court, we find this strong evidence that Maryland AWIM has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against a person of another. Therefore, it qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Similarly, our conclusion that Maryland AWIM is a violent felony is consistent with\n   <em>\n    United States v. Redd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5764021\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/372/413/\">\n    372 F. App'x 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 2010), where this Court determined that Maryland first-degree assault in violation of Maryland Criminal Code \u00a7 3-202, a re-codification of the previous AWIM, is a violent felony. Finally, it is consistent with the D.C. Circuit's conclusion in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Haight\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517197\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/1271/#p1281\">\n    892 F.3d 1271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1281 (D.C. Cir. 2018) which found that Maryland first degree assault is a violent felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We conclude that a conviction of Maryland AWIM, which constitutes a statutory aggravated form of assault, coupled with a specific intent to murder, falls within ACCA's definition of a violent felony and, therefore, serves as a predicate offense for purposes of the ACCA. Battle has three prior convictions that qualify as ACCA predicate offenses. Consequently, the district\n   court's denial of habeas relief was proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The district court's judgment is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    To prevail on a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, the moving party must show that his sentence is unlawful on one of the grounds specified in \u00a7 2255(b).\n    <em>\n     United States v.
