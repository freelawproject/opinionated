Three months later, Appellant pled guilty to conspiracy\n   to distribute cocaine, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and 846.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Following his arrest, and throughout the plea negotiation process, Appellant's purported primary concern was the impact a criminal conviction could have on his status as a lawful permanent resident of the United States. His attorney advised him that, if he pled guilty to the lesser included offense, deportation was a mere possibility that he could fight in immigration court. But Appellant's attorney was wrong: conspiracy to distribute cocaine is an \"aggravated felony\" under the Immigration and Nationality Act,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43)(B), and a noncitizen convicted of such a crime is subject to\n   <em>\n    mandatory\n   </em>\n   deportation,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 7, 2017, Appellant moved under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to vacate his conviction on the ground that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment. The district court denied his motion, and Appellant appealed. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the decision of the district court and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 1995, when Appellant was seven years old, he and his family moved from Mexico to the United States. Appellant has lived in the United States ever since. Today, Appellant is a lawful permanent resident. He no longer has family in Mexico, and he is engaged to be married to an American citizen. As such, \"[s]taying in the United States with [his] family has always been [his] number one priority.\" J.A. 65.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Twenty-one years after he came to the United States, Appellant got into some legal trouble. On February 10, 2016, Appellant traveled with another man from New Mexico to Virginia to sell a kilogram of cocaine. Unknowingly, the pair sold the drugs to a confidential informant. The confidential informant recorded the transaction while law enforcement officers observed it. After the exchange, Appellant was arrested. On March 24, 2016, a grand jury indicted Appellant on two counts of cocaine-related offenses: (1) conspiracy to distribute in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and 846 ; and (2) possession with intent to distribute in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Shortly after his arrest, Appellant retained attorney Katherine Martell (\"Martell\") to represent him. Given his circumstances, Appellant wanted an attorney with immigration law experience, and he had heard Martell touting her knowledge of immigration law on Spanish radio.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On Appellant's behalf, Martell negotiated a plea agreement with the Government. The Government offered to drop the possession with intent to distribute charge if Appellant would plead guilty to the conspiracy charge. That deal allowed Appellant to avoid a mandatory minimum sentence\n   of five years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B)(ii). After discussing a draft of the plea agreement with Appellant, Martell noted in the margin of the draft, \"Ask to omit immigration waivers.\" J.A. 109. Specifically, Martell sought to omit five immigration-related clauses from the draft:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 (1) \"Consent Given for Removal from the United States\" (which would have required Appellant not to contest removal proceedings brought against him);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 (2) \"Waiver of Rights Related to Removal from the United States\" (which would have required Appellant to waive his rights to apply for all forms of relief or protection from removal or deportation);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 (3) \"Exception for Changed Circumstances Arising After Plea\" (which would have allowed Appellant to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture based\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   on circumstances arising after the entry of his plea);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 (4) \"Abandonment of Pending Applications for Relief from Removal\" (which would have required Appellant to abandon any existing immigration benefit he holds or any pending application for relief from removal or deportation); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 (5) \"The Defendant's Cooperation in the Defendant's Removal\" (which would have required Appellant to agree to assist the Department of Homeland Security in any future removal proceedings).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    at 108-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Indeed, Martell successfully negotiated with the Government to omit from the final plea agreement those five clauses and one more: \"Plea Agreement Binding for Purposes of Removal Proceedings\" (requiring Appellant to acknowledge that his waiver of immigration-related rights is binding in any future removal proceedings).\n   <em>\n    Compare\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    at 108-110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (draft plea agreement),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Supp. J.A. Vol. I at 1-13 (final plea agreement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   However, although it did not include an explicit waiver of rights related to removal from the United States, the final plea agreement did mention potential immigration consequences. Specifically, the plea agreement acknowledged that deportation was a\n   <em>\n    possibility\n   </em>\n   and provided that Appellant wanted to plead guilty regardless:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [Appellant] recognizes that pleading guilty may have consequences with respect to [Appellant's] immigration status if [Appellant] is not a citizen of the United States. Under federal law, a broad range of crimes are removable offenses, including the offenses to which [Appellant] is pleading guilty. Because removal and other immigration consequences are the subjects of a separate proceeding, [Appellant] understands that no one, including [Appellant's] attorney or the District Court, can predict to a certainty the effect of [Appellant's] conviction on [Appellant's] immigration status. [Appellant] nevertheless affirms that [Appellant] wants to plead guilty regardless of any immigration consequences that [Appellant's] plea may entail, even if the consequence is [Appellant's] automatic removal from the United States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Supp. J.A. Vol. I at 10-11. Crucially, throughout her discussions with Appellant regarding the plea agreement, Martell assured Appellant that he would be able to fight deportation in immigration court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On June 21, 2016, Appellant pled guilty to the conspiracy charge. At Appellant's plea hearing, both Martell and the district court characterized the likelihood of deportation flowing from Appellant's plea as a\n   <em>\n    possibility\n   </em>\n   : First, after Martell informed\n   the district court that Appellant was a lawful permanent resident, the district court asked, \"Possibility of deportation then?\" Martell responded, \"Possibility.\" J.A. 16. Second, the district court informed Appellant that he \"\n   <em>\n    may be\n   </em>\n   deported\" as a result of his plea.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis supplied).

He also acknowledged that he reviewed and understood his plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After finding that Murillo was competent to enter his plea and that his plea was knowing, voluntary, and supported by facts, the district court accepted it. Appellant then pled guilty to an \"aggravated felony\" under the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43)(B) (defining \"aggravated felony\" as \"illicit trafficking in a controlled substance (as defined in section 802 of Title 21), including a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of Title 18)\").

Approximately six months later, while Appellant was incarcerated, he learned from an immigration officer that, upon completion of his sentence, he would be deported.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On September 7, 2017, Appellant filed a motion under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to vacate his conviction, asserting that his attorney had provided him constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel. Appellant filed several affidavits in support of his motion. In his affidavit, Appellant stated that at no time did Martell inform him that he would be deported if he pled guilty. To the contrary, in her affidavit, Appellant's fianc\u00e9e stated that when she asked Martell if Appellant's sentence of 24 months would affect his residency, Martell responded, \"[N]o because [Appellant] had been a resident for over twenty years that would help him stay here.\" J.A. 68. Similarly, Appellant's fianc\u00e9e's mother stated in her affidavit that Martell asserted, \"because [Appellant] had already been here for over twenty years, he would not be deported.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    at 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Likewise, Appellant's mother stated in her affidavit that, when asked whether Appellant's sentence would affect his residency in the United States, Martell assured her that \"it would not.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    at 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Notably, in his affidavit, Appellant explained the significance of Martell's advice:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   If I had known that by pleading guilty I would be deported from this country, I would have asked for a jury trial and tried to win my case even if the chances of winning might be small and I might get more prison time. At least I would have a chance, even if small. I would have also asked Ms. Martell to try to get a different plea bargain that would not get me deported. At least she could try! I had never been in trouble like this before.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   J.A. 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On April 16, 2018, the district court ordered Martell to file a declaration responding to Appellant's claims. In her declaration, Martell acknowledged that Appellant \"wanted to try and fight his immigration case\" and that she advised him \"that he would have to [do so] in immigration court,\" and claimed that she advised Appellant\n   to hire an immigration attorney. J.A. 98.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Martell also acknowledged that Appellant \"expressed his desire to fight his immigration case\" but stated that \"[Appellant's] focus was reducing prison time\" and \"there was no plea offer available to [Appellant] that could have avoided immigration consequences.\" J.A. 98.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On June 26, 2018, without holding an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied Appellant's motion to vacate his conviction. Without addressing Martell's performance, the district court concluded that Appellant failed to present \"any evidence that it would have been rational under the circumstances to reject the plea offer that did not subject to him a mandatory five-year sentence.\" J.A. 183. In reaching that conclusion, the district court highlighted that Appellant \"could not avoid the mandatory immigration consequences were he convicted of any of the charges brought against him\" and that Appellant's plea agreement indicated that Appellant \"want[ed] to plead guilty regardless of any immigration consequences.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On July 3, 2018, Appellant filed a Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration. A week later, the district court denied that motion too. In doing so, the district court doubled down on its reasoning:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Dispositive for the Court ... is that [Appellant's] contention - - that he would not have ple[d] guilty had he known the immigration consequences -- is fundamentally inconsistent with his acknowledgement in his Plea Agreement that \"[Appellant] wants to plead guilty regardless of any immigration consequences that [Appellant]'s plea may entail, even if the consequences is the [Appellant]'s automatic removal from the United States.\" Because of this acknowledgement, the Court concluded that [Appellant] had failed to establish the prejudice prong of the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    v.

But plea agreement language and sworn statements must be considered in their context: When a defendant has been told -- multiple times -- that immigration consequences are not mandated but merely a \"possibility,\" a willingness \"to plead guilty regardless of any immigration consequences\" does not mean that the defendant was willing to plead guilty if doing so meant\n   <em>\n    mandatory\n   </em>\n   deportation.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Appellant retained Martell because he believed she had immigration experience: Indeed, Martell held herself out as being uniquely experienced in matters of immigration. Appellant told Martell that he was determined to fight deportation: Martell acknowledged that she and Appellant discussed immigration extensively, that Appellant \"expressed his desire to fight his immigration case,\" and that she informed Appellant that he had to \"fight his case\" in immigration court. J.A. 98. Appellant also endeavored to retain his immigration-related rights: Drafts of the plea agreement demonstrate that Appellant and Martell were focused on immigration consequences during the negotiation process. Toward that end, Martell wrote herself a note to \"[a]sk to omit immigration waivers\" and negotiated to omit sections such as \"Consent Given for Removal from the United States\" and \"Waiver of Rights Related to Removal from the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 108-109. Had Appellant truly intended to plead guilty to an offense even if it triggered mandatory deportation, he would have had little reason to pursue these negotiations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Moreover, Appellant's mother, fianc\u00e9e, and fianc\u00e9e's mother asked Martell about the immigration consequences of his conviction and sentence. When Appellant's fianc\u00e9e asked Martell if Appellant's sentence of 24 months would affect his residency, Martell responded, \"[N]o because [Appellant] had been a resident for over twenty years that would help him stay here.\" J.A. 68. Consistent with this statement, Appellant's fianc\u00e9e's mother averred that Martell said, \"because [Appellant] had already been here for over twenty years, he would not be deported.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Most significantly, Appellant has lived in the United States since he was seven years old. His family and his life are here in the United States. And according to Appellant, \"[i]f [he] had known that by pleading guilty [he] would be deported from this country, [he] would have asked for a jury trial and tried to win [his] case even if the chances of winning might be small and [he] might get more prison time.\" J.A. 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Appellant's affirmations that he understood that he might be deported do not outweigh the evidence that avoiding deportation was more important to Appellant than any jail sentence. The district court understood the sentence \"defendant wants to plead guilty regardless of any immigration consequences that defendant's plea may entail, even if the consequence is the defendant's automatic removal from the United States,\" to directly contradict Appellant's position that, had he known his plea carried a mandatory-deportation consequence, he would not have taken it. J.A. 199. But the sentence is not that definitive. The sentence includes the equivocal phrases \"may entail\" and \"even if.\" Moreover, the line before this sentence underscores the qualifying language: \"[t]he defendant recognizes that pleading guilty\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   have consequences with respect to defendant's\n   immigration status if defendant is not a citizen of the United States.\" Supp. J.A. Vol. I at 10 (emphasis added). These statements simply do not suggest that\n   <em>\n    mandatory\n   </em>\n   deportation would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   have changed Appellant's mind. This is even more clear when considered in conjunction with the advice Appellant was receiving. Of course Appellant was willing to sign a plea agreement that said he \"wants to plead guilty regardless of any immigration consequences\" when he had been told -- multiple times -- that immigration consequences were merely a \"possibility.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Nor, for that matter, did the district court's general warning cure any ineffective assistance.

Vol. I 11. When faced with that very consequence, however, Carrillo had a change of heart and sought to vacate his conspiracy conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Carrillo initiated\n   these postconviction proceedings in late 2017, by a\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   motion, maintaining that he did not mean what he said to the court in his plea proceedings, and that his then-lawyer was constitutionally deficient. That is, Carrillo now contends that - when he pleaded guilty to a drug conspiracy offense - he did not know that his plea could result in his removal from this country. He thus argues that his Sixth Amendment rights were contravened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In my view, the district court properly rejected Carrillo's \u00a7 2255 motion, and correctly ruled that Carrillo could not prove his Sixth Amendment claim by assertions that directly conflict with his plea agreement and his guilty plea colloquy. Because the majority has endorsed Carrillo's effort to undermine his plea proceedings, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   After driving across the country to purchase a kilogram of cocaine in California and then transport his load of contraband to Virginia, Carrillo was caught red-handed by the federal authorities as he was selling the cocaine for $40,000 to an informant in the Eastern District of Virginia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result of this drug trafficking, Carrillo was indicted for two federal offenses and faced up to eighty years in prison. In exchange for the dismissal of one of the charges - and to avoid the near certainty of a five-year mandatory minimum sentence for his illegal activities - Carrillo agreed to plead guilty to a single drug conspiracy offense that obviated the mandatory minimum sentence. He therefore entered into a written plea agreement with the United States Attorney. As pertinent here, Paragraph 19 of the plea agreement provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   [Carrillo] recognizes that pleading guilty may have consequences with respect to [his] immigration status if [he] is not a citizen of the United States. Under federal law, a broad range of crimes are removable offenses, including the offenses to which [Carrillo] is pleading guilty. Because removal and other immigration consequences are the subjects of a separate proceeding, [Carrillo] understands that no one, including [his] attorney or the District Court, can predict to a certainty the effect of [this] conviction on [his] immigration status.\n   <em>\n    [Carrillo] nevertheless affirms that [he] wants to plead guilty regardless of any immigration consequences that [his] plea may entail, even if the consequence is [his] automatic removal from the United States\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supp. J.A. Vol. I 10-11 (emphasis added). Carrillo and his lawyer each signed the plea agreement, acknowledging and attesting thereby: (1) that they had \"carefully reviewed\" the entire plea agreement together, and (2) that Carrillo understood and voluntarily agreed to its terms.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   During the guilty plea proceedings conducted in Alexandria on June 21, 2016, the district court placed Carrillo under oath. Carrillo then advised the court that he had reviewed the plea agreement and understood it. He also asserted that he was satisfied with his lawyer's representation. Importantly, Carrillo affirmed to the court that he wanted to plead guilty, notwithstanding that he \"may be deported as a result of [his guilty] plea.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 21. After finding that Carrillo was competent\n   to plead guilty and that his plea was knowing, voluntary, and supported by a sufficient factual basis, the court accepted the guilty plea and the plea agreement. And Carrillo received significant benefits from his plea bargain: he was sentenced to only 24 months in prison on the single conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   About two months shy of his scheduled release date, Carrillo moved in September 2017 to vacate his conspiracy conviction and sentence, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel in the plea proceedings. In his \u00a7 2255 motion, Carrillo alleges that he only learned several months earlier that he would be deported as a result of his conspiracy conviction. He faults his lawyer for failing to advise him that he could be deported as a result of his guilty plea. Contrary to his statements in the plea agreement and at the plea hearing, Carrillo contends in his \u00a7 2255 papers that he did not know when he pleaded guilty that a possible consequence of his plea was removal from this country. He also asserts that - if his lawyer had advised him of that consequence - he would not have pleaded guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   By its order of June 26, 2018, the district court rejected Carrillo's ineffective assistance claim, concluding that he had not shown prejudice from the alleged deficient performance of his lawyer. That is, the court assumed that the lawyer had erred but was satisfied that Carrillo had failed to show \"a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's error, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 181-82 (internal quotation marks omitted). In so ruling, the court emphasized that Carrillo had explicitly agreed - quoting from Paragraph 19 - that he wanted \"to plead guilty ... even if the consequence is [his] automatic removal from the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    at 183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   I begin with a significant issue that neither the district court nor the panel majority has resolved: whether Carrillo's lawyer performed in a constitutionally deficient manner.

Indeed, Carrillo affirmed - under oath - in his guilty plea colloquy that he was pleased with his lawyer's services. And he had good reason to say so - his lawyer negotiated an extraordinary bargain on his behalf. More importantly, there is simply no dispute that Carrillo's lawyer informed him that his guilty plea would make him removable from the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Padilla v.

And Carrillo confirmed that he understood as much at his guilty plea hearing when he made the solemn declarations that he comprehended the plea agreement and the immigration consequences of his guilty plea.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

That is, our controlling decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Relatedly, the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Lee v.

And that contemporaneous evidence proves that Carrillo wanted to plead guilty regardless of any immigration consequences, including removal.

Because Carrillo's prejudice contention rests almost exclusively on a postconviction assertion that is \"palpably incredible and patently frivolous or false,\" I would affirm\n   the district court's denial of \u00a7 2255 relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lemaster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9014531\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/403/216/#p221\">\n    403 F.3d at 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   My friends in the majority, however, do not accept the binding nature of our\n   <em>\n    Lemaster\n   </em>\n   decision.

This contemporaneous evidence proves beyond peradventure that Carrillo wanted to plead guilty, even if the plea and conviction resulted in his \"automatic removal\" from this country.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supp. J.A. Vol. I 11. The majority, however, abandons that evidence and instead relies on Carrillo's\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   assertions - the precise type of evidence that the Supreme Court warned us about and rejected in\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   . Contrary to\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   (and our\n   <em>\n    Lemaster\n   </em>\n   precedent), the majority primarily predicates its ruling on the postconviction statements of Carrillo and his supporters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   818. But those\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   assertions directly conflict with the \"contemporaneous evidence\" of Carrillo's \"expressed preferences\" to plead guilty regardless of any immigration consequences, including removal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605079\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1958/#p1963\">\n    137 S.

Consequently, Carrillo's\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   evidence has no role to play in the analysis of his ineffective assistance claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Finally, I disagree with the proposition that our more recent decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Vol. I 11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   817-18. Although my good colleagues observe that the\n   <em>\n    Swaby\n   </em>\n   plea agreement contained a provision similar to Paragraph 19, they fail to recognize that the\n   <em>\n    Swaby\n   </em>\n   analysis did not acknowledge that provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swaby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276766\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/233/#p240\">\n    855 F.3d at 240-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    Swaby\n   </em>\n   provides no guidance concerning the importance of Paragraph 19 to the proper assessment of this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Of additional importance,\n   <em>\n    Swaby\n   </em>\n   did not mention\n   <em>\n    Lemaster\n   </em>\n   .
