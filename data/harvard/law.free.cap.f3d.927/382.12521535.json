But Congress has placed careful limits on the way the Commission exercises that power. Jeffery Havis argues that the Commission stepped beyond those limits here and, as a result, he deserves to be resentenced. We agree and\n   <strong>\n    REVERSE\n   </strong>\n   the decision of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 2017, Havis pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). Under the Sentencing Guidelines, a person convicted under\n   \u00a7 922(g)(1) starts with a base offense level of 14; but that level increases to 20 if the defendant has a prior conviction for a \"controlled substance offense.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USSG \u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4), (a)(6). At sentencing, the district court decided that Havis's 17-year-old Tennessee conviction for selling and/or delivering cocaine was a controlled substance offense under the Guidelines. Havis objected because the Tennessee statute at issue criminalizes both the \"sale\" and \"delivery\" of cocaine, and his charging documents did not specify whether his conviction was for sale, delivery, or both.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2039-17-417\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-17-417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)-(3). Under Tennessee law, \"delivery\" of drugs means \"the actual, constructive,\n   <em>\n    or attempted\n   </em>\n   transfer from one person to another of a controlled substance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2039-17-417\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 39-17-402(6) (emphasis added). Havis therefore argued that his Tennessee conviction was not a controlled substance offense because it encompassed the mere\n   <em>\n    attempt\n   </em>\n   to sell cocaine, and the Guidelines' definition of \"controlled substance offense\" does not include attempt crimes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court overruled Havis's objection because an unpublished case of this circuit,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Alexander\n   </em>\n   , held that any violation of \u00a7 39-17-417 is a controlled substance offense.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12399948\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/686/326/#p327\">\n    686 F. App'x 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 327-28 (6th Cir. 2017) (per curiam). In combination with other adjustments, that left Havis with a Guidelines range of 46 to 57 months. The district court sentenced him to 46 months, and he appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A panel of this court affirmed Havis's sentence for one reason: our decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Evans\n   </em>\n   held that the definition of \"controlled substance offense\" in \u00a7 4B1.2(b) includes attempt crimes.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Havis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519035\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/907/439/#p442\">\n    907 F.3d 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 442 (6th Cir. 2018) (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v. Evans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3632039\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/699/858/#p866\">\n    699 F.3d 858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 866-67 (6th Cir. 2012) ). The\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   court relied on the Sentencing Commission's commentary to \u00a7 4B1.2(b), which states that a controlled substance offense \"includes 'the offenses of aiding and abetting, conspiring, and attempting to commit such offenses.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3632039\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/699/858/#p866\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3632039\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/699/858/#p866\">\n    at 866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(b) comment (n.1)). But Havis objects to this commentary on a ground never raised by the parties in\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   : he argues that the Guidelines' text says nothing about attempt, and the Sentencing Commission has no power to add attempt crimes to the list of offenses in \u00a7 4B1.2(b) through commentary. We granted en banc review to address that narrow claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Legal Framework\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Whether a prior conviction counts as a predicate offense under the Guidelines is a question of law subject to de novo review.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Wynn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4052956\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/579/567/#p570\">\n    579 F.3d 567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 570 (6th Cir. 2009). Employing the categorical approach, we do not consider the\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   conduct that led to Havis's conviction under the Tennessee statute at issue; instead, we look to the\n   <em>\n    least of the acts criminalized\n   </em>\n   by the elements of that statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Moncrieffe v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697041\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/184/#p190\">\n    569 U.S. 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 190-91,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697041\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/184/#p190\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697041\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/184/#p190\">\n    185 L.Ed.2d 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). If the least culpable conduct falls within the Guidelines' definition of \"controlled substance offense,\" then the statute categorically qualifies as a controlled substance offense. But if the least culpable conduct falls outside that definition, then the statute is too broad to qualify, and the district court erred by increasing Havis's offense level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The parties agree that the least culpable conduct covered by \u00a7 39-17-417 is the attempted delivery of a controlled substance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2039-17-402\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-17-402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6). The question before the court, then, is whether the definition of \"controlled substance offense\" in \u00a7 4B1.2(b) includes attempt crimes. The Sentencing Commission said it does in the commentary to \u00a7 4B1.2(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(b) comment (n.1). But the plain language of \u00a7 4B1.2(b) says nothing about attempt crimes. On appeal, Havis maintains that we must look to the actual text of Guideline \u00a7 4B1.2(b). The Government asks us to defer to the Commission's commentary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Role of the Sentencing Commission\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   To decide which construction of \u00a7 4B1.2(b) prevails, we begin with the Sentencing Commission and its role in our constitutional system. Congress created the Commission as an independent body \"charged [ ] with the task of establish[ing] sentencing policies and practices for the Federal criminal justice system.\"\n   <em>\n    Stinson v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11850\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/36/#p40\">\n    508 U.S. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 40-41,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11850\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/36/#p40\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11850\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/36/#p40\">\n    123 L.Ed.2d 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The Commission fulfills its purpose by issuing the Guidelines, which provide direction to judges about the type and length of sentences to impose in a given case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11850\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/36/#p40\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11850\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/36/#p40\">\n    at 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11850\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/36/#p40\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And the Commission knows how to include attempt crimes when it wants to-in subsection (a) of the same guideline, for example, the Commission defines \"crime of violence\" as including offenses that have \"as an element the use,\n   <em>\n    attempted\n   </em>\n   use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\" USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(a) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   To make attempt crimes a part of \u00a7 4B1.2(b), the Commission did not interpret a term in the guideline itself-no term in \u00a7 4B1.2(b) would bear that construction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, the Commission used Application Note 1 to\n   <em>\n    add\n   </em>\n   an offense not listed in the guideline.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Guidelines' definition of \"controlled substance offense\" does not include attempt crimes. Because the least culpable conduct covered by \u00a7 39-17-417 is attempted delivery of a controlled substance, the district court erred by using Havis's Tennessee conviction as a basis for increasing his offense level. We therefore\n   <strong>\n    REVERSE\n   </strong>\n   the district court's decision and\n   <strong>\n    REMAND\n   </strong>\n   for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    A \"controlled substance offense\" under \u00a7 4B1.2(b) means:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n    an offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    The panel decision addressed (and rejected) a number of alternative grounds for finding that Havis's Tennessee conviction did not qualify as a controlled substance offense.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Havis\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519035\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/907/439/#p442\">\n     907 F.3d at 444-47\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Havis does not revisit those claims in his en banc petition.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    The Government argues in the alternative that the real commentary at issue is Application Note 1 to \u00a7 2K2.1, which cross-references the definition of \"controlled substance offense\" in Application Note 1 to \u00a7 4B1.2. The Government never made that argument in the district court or before the initial panel on appeal and arguably has forfeited its right to do so now. At any rate, it makes no difference whether we begin with \u00a7 2K2.1 to determine the meaning of \"controlled substance offense.\" The commentary to \u00a7 2K2.1 directs us to apply \"the meaning given that term in \u00a7 4B1.2(b) and Application Note 1 of the Commentary to \u00a7 4B1.2.\" If anything, the Government's proposed definition-which would require us to defer to commentary\n    <em>\n     on\n    </em>\n    other commentary-would carry an even more tenuous connection to the guideline's text.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    The Government also suggests that the use of the term \"prohibits\" in \u00a7 4B1.2(b) expands the scope of the guideline to cover attempt crimes. Once again, the Government never made this argument in the district court or before the initial panel on appeal. Regardless, the guideline's boilerplate use of the term \"prohibits\" simply states the obvious: criminal statutes proscribe conduct.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Connally v. Gen. Constr. Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"186255\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/269/385/#p393\">\n     269 U.S. 385\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 393,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"186255\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/269/385/#p393\">\n     46 S.Ct. 126\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"186255\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/269/385/#p393\">\n     70 L.Ed. 322\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1926) (\"Penal statutes prohibit[ ] the doing of certain things, and provid[e] a punishment for their violation ....\"). That does not help the Government.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
