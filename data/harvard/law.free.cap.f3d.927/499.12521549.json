The Rule prohibits a placement agent from accepting compensation for soliciting government business from certain candidates and elected officials within two years of having contributed to such an official's electoral campaign or to the transition or inaugural expenses of a successful candidate. The New York Republican State Committee (NYGOP) and the Tennessee Republican Party petition for review of the SEC's order approving Rule 2030, on the grounds that: (1) the SEC did not have authority to enact the Rule; (2) the order adopting the Rule is arbitrary and capricious because there was insufficient evidence it was needed; and (3) the Rule violates the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The SEC challenges the petitioners' standing to bring the case and defends the Rule against these arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We hold the NYGOP has standing and deny its petition on the merits.

Similarly, the FECA and the Exchange Act, as instantiated by the SEC's pay-to-play rules, can peacefully coexist: Although both regimes touch upon political contributions, the FECA is meant to protect elections from the perceived untoward effects of over-limit campaign contributions by whomever made, whilst the Exchange Act, as implemented by Rule 2030, is meant to protect the financial markets from the perceived untoward effects of over-limit contributions made by placement agents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blount\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11319504,5709499\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/61/938/\">\n    61 F.3d at 944\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[I]n\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Austin\n   </em>\n   the legislature was interested in clean elections, whereas here the SEC is interested in clean bond markets\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In so holding, we reject the petitioners' argument that the FECA is incompatible with the Exchange Act because the general $ 2,700 contribution limit set by the FECA serves as a \"safe haven.\" Pet'rs' Reply Br. 18;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Galliano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10549884,4332558\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/836/1362/\">\n    836 F.2d at 1370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Petitioners have failed to meet the first and most basic step of this three-part constitutional minimum, as well as the second. First, they have established no injury-in-fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The majority opinion sets forth the facts underlying this litigation.

As the majority acknowledges, neither petitioner's conduct is regulated by the respondent's action, Rule 2030, and therefore they do not claim the near-automatic standing of a regulated entity. Petitioners assert instead that NYGOP has established standing on the theory that an organization is \"harmed if its contributors cease giving it money.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taxation with Representation of Washington v.

While this may be a valid theory, it simply does not apply to this case. Neither of petitioners has shown that any contributor has stopped contributing because of the action of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   For a harm to meet the standard for the first requirement of standing, it must be an actual or at least \"certainly impending\" injury.\n   <em>\n    Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/\">\n    568 U.S. 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 401,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/\">\n    185 L.Ed.2d 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). The Supreme Court has, as the majority notes, given a slightly relaxed construction to the effect of the \"certainly impending\" standard by recognizing that a petitioner may cross the bar of the first standing requirement by establishing a \"substantial risk\" that the anticipated harm will occur.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Susan B. Anthony\n   </em>\n   , 573 U.S. at 158,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581581\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2334/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nonetheless, the very language of the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Susan B. Anthony\n   </em>\n   establishes that for the risk of an anticipated harm to substitute for actual injury at the first step of the standing analysis, that risk must not only exist but be substantial. Petitioners have not carried the burden of establishing a substantial risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In an attempt to meet its weighty burden, NYGOP has submitted the affidavit of Francis Calcagno, a placement agent covered by Rule 2030. Calcagno cannot attest to any injury-in-fact that has occurred to the petitioners, but only swears that if it were not for the SEC's rule he would solicit contributions for the NYGOP from his friends, family, and other contacts. As the majority recognizes, he cannot attest with certainty that any of his contacts would contribute to petitioners in the absence of the rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Petitioners argue that the affidavit brings them within the precedent of\n   <em>\n    Taxation with Representation\n   </em>\n   . However, that case only held that standing is established for an organization \"if its contributors cease giving it money.\" Calcagno's affidavit establishes no such facts. At most, it establishes that he believes that if it were not for the rule he would speak to unnamed contacts, friends, and relatives on behalf of the petitioners, and that some of those unnamed contacts, friends, or relatives could contribute. This is not the establishment of a substantial risk. This is at most speculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Many cases hold that speculation is not the same as establishing injury-in-fact for purposes of standing. \"Although imminence is concededly a somewhat elastic concept, it cannot be stretched beyond its purpose, which is to ensure that the alleged injury is not too speculative for Article III purposes-that the injury is\n   <em>\n    certainly\n   </em>\n   impending.\"\n   <em>\n    Clapper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/\">\n    568 U.S. at 409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   565 n.2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

Both this court and the Supreme Court have held that\n   when the establishment of injury depends on the volitional act of a third party, the claimant has not established standing as against the respondent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Again, I would follow the teachings of the Supreme Court.
