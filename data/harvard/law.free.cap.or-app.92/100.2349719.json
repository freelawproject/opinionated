We affirm in both.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Petitioner is serving a life sentence on convictions for murder, arson and theft. He was sentenced in 1975. The legislature adopted the so-called matrix system in 1977. He had the option under OAR 255-30-002 to have the Board consider his parole under the discretionary criteria in <em>former </em>ORS 144.175<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <em>former </em>ORS 144.180<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or under the matrix system. In 1981, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>he chose to remain under the discretionary system. <em>See Addicks v. Board of Parole, </em>63 Or App 409, 411, 663 P2d 1310 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">On February 27, 1986, the Board met to consider petitioner\u2019s parole, but the hearing was continued for lack of a quorum. The order noted that petitioner had chosen to remain under the discretionary system. On September 29, 1986, the Board reconvened with four of the five members present and set a parole release date of March 16, 1987, which suggests that it intended to act under the matrix. The Board, however, made none of the necessary findings required for applying the matrix. Later, the Board\u2019s fifth member reviewed the record and voted against setting apar\u00f3le date, recommending instead that the hearing be continued, because the \u201c[i]nmate [is] still under the discretionary system and can only have a parole hearing date on 3/16/87.\u201d Nonetheless, the Board issued an order on November 26, 1986, setting a release date of March 16, 1987. On February 19, 1987, the Board rescinded that release date, having concluded that it had erred by \u201capplying the wrong legal standard in setting the parole release date because the inmate is a discretionary case and should have been considered under the provisions of <em>[former] </em>ORS 144.175.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">At the subsequent hearing, the Board again asked petitioner to choose between the discretionary and the matrix systems. He first chose the matrix system, because he thought that the Board could not rescind its 1986 order setting the parole release date. The Board then told him that, if he chose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>the matrix system, the hearing would have to be reset and that the matrix choice would be irrevocable. He then chose to remain under the discretionary system and to continue with the hearing. The Board set a parole hearing date for April 21, 1989. Petitioner argues that the Board erred in rescinding his 1987 parole release date, because the fact that he was given a parole date means that he was under the matrix system. He contends that his acceptance of that release date order demonstrated his intent to be considered under the matrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Before it can set a matrix release date, the Board must make findings regarding an inmate\u2019s crime severity rating, history/risk score, guideline range and aggravation/mitigation factors. OAR 255-35-013. The Board made no findings in its November 26, 1986, order. Thus, even if it intended to evaluate petitioner under the matrix system, it did not follow the proper procedure. It had the duty to do its work properly, and that included an obligation to apply the discretionary criteria, unless petitioner had expressly exercised the other choice. The Board correctly rescinded its 1986 order. OAR 255-35-013; OAR 255-80-010(1) and (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Petitioner contends next that, even if he was evaluated under the discretionary system, the Board should have set a firm release date. He is wrong. <em>See Addicks v. Board of Parole, supra, </em>63 Or App at 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">In his third assignment of error, petitioner contends that the February 19,1987, rescission order is invalid, because only four members of the Board voted. The term \u201cfull membership of the Board\u201d means \u201call voting members of the Board holding office and not disqualified from voting.\u201d <em>Larson v. State Board of Parole, </em>91 Or App 642, 756 P2d 674 (1988). Four members of the Board were present; one position was vacant. All the voting members holding office at the time voted to rescind the order; accordingly, the order is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">The last assignment is without merit, and we decline to discuss it.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b136-6\"> <em>Former </em>ORS 144.175, <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 1977, ch 372, \u00a7 18, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-7\">\u201cWhenever the State Board of Parole considers the release of a prisoner who, by its rules or order, is eligible for release on parole, it shall be the policy of the board to order his release, unless the board is of the opinion that his release should be deferred or denied because:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-8\">\u201c(1) There is a reasonable probability that the inmate will not, after parole, remain outside the institution without violating the law and that his release is incompatible with the welfare of society;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-9\">\u201c(2) There is substantial risk that he will not conform to the conditions of parole;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-10\">\u201c(3) His release at that time would depreciate the seriousness of his crime or promote disrespect for law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-11\">\u201c(4) His release would have a substantially adverse effect on institutional discipline; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-12\">\u201c(5) His continued correctional treatment, medical care or vocational or other training in the institution will substantially enhance his capacity to lead a law-abiding life when released at a later date.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b136-13\"> <em>Former </em>ORS 144.180, <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 1977, ch 372, \u00a7 18, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-14\">\u201cIn making its determination regarding a prisoner\u2019s release on parole, the State Board of Parole may take into account each of the following factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-15\">\u201c(1) The prisoner\u2019s personality, including his maturity, stability, sense of responsibility and any apparent development in his personality which may promote or hinder his conformity to law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-16\">\u201c(2) The adequacy of the prisoner\u2019s parole plan;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-17\">\u201c(3) The prisoner\u2019s ability and readiness to assume obligations and undertake responsibilities;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-18\">\u201c(4) The prisoner\u2019s intelligence and training;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-19\">\u201c(5) The prisoner\u2019s family status and whether he has relatives who display an interest in him, or whether he has other close and constructive associations in the community;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-20\">\u201c(6) The prisoner\u2019s employment history, his occupational skills, and the stability of his past employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-21\">\u201c(7) The type of residence, neighborhood or community in which the prisoner plans to live;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-22\">\u201c(8) The prisoner\u2019s past use of narcotics or dangerous drugs, or past <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>habitual and excessive use of alcoholic liquor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">\u201c(9) The prisoner\u2019s mental or physical makeup, including any disability or handicap which may affect his conformity to law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">\u201c(10) The prisoner\u2019s prior criminal record, including the nature and circumstances, recency, frequency and type of previous offenses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-9\">\u201c(11) The prisoner\u2019s attitude toward law and authority;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-10\">\u201c(12) The prisoner\u2019s conduct in the institution, including particularly whether he has taken advantage of the opportunities for self-improvement afforded by the institutional program, whether he has been disciplined for misconduct prior to his hearing or reconsideration for parole release, whether he has forfeited any reductions of term during his period of imprisonment, and whether the reductions have been restored at the time of hearing or reconsideration; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-11\">\u201c(13) The prisoner\u2019s conduct and attitude during any previous experience of probation or parole and when the experience occurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
