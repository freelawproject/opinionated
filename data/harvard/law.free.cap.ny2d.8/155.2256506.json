Murray </em>and <em>Gerald W. O\u2019Connor </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMR\">I. The court\u2019s ruling denying defendant\u2019s attorney an opportunity to examine the police report constitutes reversible error. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gezzo, </em>307 N. Y. 385.) II. Inasmuch as defendant had no attorney or access to the record on his appeal to the Appellate Division, Fourth Department, he did not receive the \u201cadequate appellate review \u201d guaranteed him by the Constitution of the State of New York and the Constitution of the United States of America. <em>(Griffin </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>351 U. S. 12; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kalan, </em>2 N Y 2d 278; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pride, </em>3 N Y 2d 545; <em>People </em>v. <em>Breslin, </em>4 N Y 2d 73; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pitts, </em>6 N Y 2d 288; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>7 N Y 2d 568.) III. Appellant\u2019s intoxication was such that he could not form the intent to commit the crimes alleged to have been committed in the indictment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b194-6\"><em>Carman F. Ball, District Attorney (Leonard F. Walentynowicz </em>of counsel), for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqd\">I. The guilt of defendant was proved beyond a reasonable doubt, as required by law. Aside from the question of intoxication, there was overwhelming proof to indicate that defendant did, in fact, commit the crimes with which he was charged. II. The question of intoxication was properly resolved against defendant. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Leonardi, </em>143 N. Y. 360.) III. No reversible error was committed by the trial court in refusing trial counsel\u2019s request to examine a police report. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gezzo, </em>307 N. Y. 385.) IV. This court is without power to modify the sentence imposed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Speiser, 277 </em>N. Y. 342.) V. Defendant was afforded full and complete adequate appellate review. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kalan, </em>2 N Y 2d 278; <em>People </em>v. <em>Breslin, </em>4 N Y 2d 73; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pitts, </em>6 N Y 2d 288; <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>351 U.
