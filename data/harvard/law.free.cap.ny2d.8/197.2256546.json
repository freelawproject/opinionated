Since the question involved is of important public interest and one likely to arise again, we deem it appropriate to entertain the appeal on the merits <em>(Matter of United Press Assns. </em>v. <em>Valente, </em>308 N. Y. 71, 76).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Drafted by State agencies and interested professional groups, and widely approved by the psychological fraternity (see Governor\u2019s Message, Public Papers of Governor Iiarriman, 1956, pp. 416-417; Memoranda of Education Department, N. Y. Legis. Ann., 1956, pp. 214-215, and Mental Hygiene Department, McKinney\u2019s 1956 Session Laws, pp. 1928-1929), article 153 is a certification rather than a licensing law, i.e., it does not prohibit anyone from rendering psychological services, but proscribes the professional use by noncertificants of the title <em>\u201c </em>psychologist \u201d and its derivatives, for remuneration. Section 7602 prohibits noncertified individuals from representing themselves as psychologists, and section 7601 defines a person who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>\u201c represents himself to be a \u2018 psychologist \u2019\u201d as one who \u201c holds himself out to the public by any title or description of services incorporating the words <em>' </em>psychological \u2019, ' psychologist \u2019 or ' psychology \u2019, <em>and under such title or description offers to render or renders services to individuals, corporations, or the public for remuneration.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">Section 7605 empowers the Department of Education to issue \u201ca certificate as psychologist \u201d to a citizen (or one who has declared his intention), of good moral character, at least 21 years of age, who pays a $40 fee, ' ' passes a satisfactory examination in psychology \u2019 \u2019, has ' ' received the doctoral degree based on a program of studies whose content was primarily psychological from an educational institution having a graduate program registered by the department, <em>or its substantial equivalent in both subject matter and extent of training \u201d </em>(emphasis supplied), and has had \" at least two years of satisfactory supervised experience in rendering psychological services \u2019 \u2019. For a specified period, the board is empowered to waive examination for those meeting prescribed standards of academic achievement and professional experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The statute further provides for biennial registration of certified psychologists (\u00a7 7606); nondisclosure of privileged communications (\u00a7 7611); and revocation or suspension of certificates, after notice and hearing before the Commissioner of Education, with the right of judicial review by way of an article 78 proceeding of the suspension, revocation,\" or refusing to issue or renew a certificate \u201d (\u00a7 7607). Employees of governmental agencies and chartered educational institutions are exempt from the operation of the statute (\u00a7 7609); the practice of medicine is not authorized (\u00a7 7610); and violation of the statute is made a misdemeanor (\u00a7 7608).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Article 153 was designed to accomplish a two-fold purpose. On the one hand, it \" recognizes and gives status to the profession of psychology\u201d (Governor\u2019s Message, <em>supra) </em>by \u201cgiving qualified psychologists official recognition\u201d (Memo., Mental Hygiene Dept., <em>supra), </em>and by placing the \u201c confidential relations and communications \u201d between a registered psychologist and his client \u201c on the same basis as those provided by law between attorney and client \u201d (\u00a7 7611). In this aspect, its sponsors felt that the statute would encourage bona fide psy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>ehologists with university training and professionally supervised experience to offer their needed professional services to the public in increasing numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">On the other hand, it was \u201c apparent to all who are concerned with the field of public health that the public [was] entitled to protection in the form of state supervision \u201d over the increasingly important field of psychology (Memo., Education Dept., <em>supra). </em>By prohibiting the use of the word \u201cpsychologist\u201d and its variants in connection with the rendition of professional services for pay, it was felt that the statute would \u2018 \u2018 make it possible to eliminate unqualified persons who are presently able to hold themselves out to the public as psychologists ' \u2019 (Memo,, Education Dept,, <em>supra), </em>and help to protect the public against charlatans and quacks who, despite inadequate training and professional experience, guarantee easy solutions to psychological problems.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Aside from the presumption of constitutionality which must be accorded a legislative enactment <em>(Lincoln </em>Bldg, <em>Associates </em>v. <em>Barr, </em>1 N Y 2d 413, 415), it cannot be gainsaid that the statute is reasonably related to the public health and welfare, and thus constitutes a proper exercise of the State\u2019s police power under the due process clause of the State and Federal Constitutions. Through the medium of official certification of qualifications, it helps the public to identify those who have appropriate training and background in the profession of psychology. At the same time, it affords protection against the incompetent practitioner by providing a yardstick by which the public can judge the competence of persons offering psychological services.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">We have upheld the certification as opposed to the complete licensing approach in the fields of accountancy <em>(Berkowitz </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>307 N. Y. 851) , and plumbing <em>(People ex rel, Nechamcus </em>v. <em>Warden of City Prison, </em>144 N. Y. 529), and, as stated in the latter case (pp, 538-539), \u201c if the act is a step in the direction of something which will enure to the public health and comfort, that it does not go as far as it might, is not a reason for invali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>dating it\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>. Since \u201cwe may not, of course, substitute our judgment for that of the Legislature as to the wisdom or expediency of the legislation \u201d <em>(Thompson </em>v. <em>Wallin </em>[and two companion cases], 301 N. Y. 476, 488, affd. 342 U. S. 485, 801, 951), the strong convictions expressed by plaintiffs against the soundness and efficacy of the statute have no bearing on its constitutionality (see <em>Beauharnais </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>343 U. S. 250, 262; <em>People </em>v. <em>Schweinler Press, </em>214 N. Y. 395, 406-407, appeal dismissed 242 U. S. 618).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">The constitutional arguments pressed on this appeal revolve around the fact that the statute does not contain a formal definition of \u201cpsychologist\u201d or its proscribed derivatives. Plaintiffs contend that the absence of such a definition renders the statute violative of due process in two respects: (1) it arbitrarily restricts the carrying on of a lawful occupation in that it prohibits a noncertified psychologist from truthfully describing his professional services, and (2) the statute\u2019s qualifying standards are meaningless without a definition to which they can attach, and hence the statute unlawfully delegates legislative power without accompanying standards to guide the exercise of administrative discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The omission of a formal definition of \u201c psychology \u201d or its variants was no legislative oversight. Attempts to draft a definition that would sufficiently delineate the nature and scope of psychology had failed (Memos., Mental Hygiene and Education Depts., <em>supra), </em>and, as noted by Special Term, \u201c the law was enacted in a form that was acceptable to interested groups and that requires no interpretation of that term for its enforcement \u201d. The standards of fitness established by the Legislature imbue the title \u201cpsychologist\u201d with meaningful content, and a person with a bona fide claim to that title will meet those qualifications and be accorded official recognition, as were the individual plaintiffs herein. To \u201c assure adequate representation of the diverse fields of psychology \u201d on the State Board of Examiners, the Legislature specifically provided that \u201c the board shall at all times, except for vacancies, have two members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>representing the training institutions in psychology, three members who engage in rendering service in psychology and two members who devote a majority of their time to rendering service in psychology\u201d (\u00a7 7603). The membership of the Advisory Council established by the Legislature to \u201c aid in the formulation of policy \u2019 \u2019 was likewise apportioned among professional practitioners and <em>\u201c </em>representatives of the professional training centers \u2019 \u2019 to insure that it would be <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>broadly representative of psychology \u201d (\u00a7 7604).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">That the Legislature assigned to respondent the task of implementing the statute\u2014by recognizing accredited psychology courses in the graduate curr\u00edculums of chartered institutions, by determining the scope of the qualifying examination, by fixing the <em>\u201c </em>substantial equivalent\u201d of a doctoral degree, and by deciding what constitutes <em>\u2018 </em>\u2018 satisfactory supervised experience \u201d \u2014 does not constitute an invalid delegation of legislative power <em>(Matter of Marburg </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>286 N. Y. 202, 211-212; <em>Matter of City of Utica </em>v. <em>Water Pollution Control Bd., </em>5 N Y 2d 164). The statute prescribes clearly discernible standards to govern the exercise of the power of certification, and it was \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>proper and fitting for the Legislature to assign broad functions to the Board, particularly when it was contemplated and understood that its members were to bring to their work a familiarity with conditions which the individual legislators could not be expected to possess.\u201d <em>(Matter of City of Utica </em>v. <em>Water Pollution Control Bd., supra, </em>p. 170.) <em>f </em>While plaintiffs maintain, \u2022 on the one hand, that there is as / yet \u201c no unified concept of what psychology is \u201d, nor a \u201c gen-<em>I </em>erally accepted' definition of psychology, psychologists or psy\u00cd chological services \u201d, they nonetheless contend, on the other s hand, that the constitutional infirmity in the statute lies in its \u2019 failure to define those very terms. They recognize that the ^ profession of psychology is affected with a public interest, and ' hence subject to regulation under the police power. Yet the end result of their argument is that the Legislature may not constitutionally regulate psychologists, since the title and the field are incapable of precise definition, and a statute without such definition is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">- The short answer to this thoroughly untenable argument is that section 7605, in practical effect, defines a psychologist as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>an individual who meets prescribed standards of fitness, and since the statute merely proscribes <em>the use of specific words </em>to <em>describe </em>the rendition of services, without making it criminal for noncertificants to render such services, no further definition of that term is constitutionally required or necessary (see <em>Pitts </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Examiners of Psychologists, </em>222 Md. 224, 227). The statute is easily complied with by the non-use of particular words, and hence it completely \u201c satisfies the requirement that a criminal statute must be sufficiently definite, \u2018 clear and positive \u2019 to give \u2018 unequivocal warning \u2019 to citizens of the rule which is to be obeyed \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Firth, </em>3 N T 2d 472, 474).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 real quarrel with the statute is not that it lacks a formal definition of \u201cpsychologist\u201d, but that the definition adopted\u2014byway of qualifying standards \u2014 does not meet with their approval. NPAP conducts a training program for members in training, and respondent has refused to accept that program as satisfying the academic requirements of the statute, contrary to NPAP\u2019s expectation at the time it supported the statute. The major portion of plaintiffs\u2019 affidavits, as well as their complaint, is devoted to the merits of NPAP\u2019s training program, and why it should qualify as a \u201c substantial equivalent \u201d of \u201c the specialized advanced courses in psychological theory and professional skills in a typical graduate psychology program given by degree-granting institutions leading to a degree of Doctor of Philosophy in psychology \u2019 \u2019. However, a disagreement with the judgment of the Legislature as to the proper standards of fitness for persons wishing to be certified in their craft cannot rise to the level of a constitutional argument by couching that disagreement in the language of due process or equal protection of the laws. If certification is denied to one of NPAP\u2019s members, and he can establish that respondent\u2019s refusal to accept his training as a \u201c substantial equivalent\u201d of formal university training was an arbitrary abuse of administrative discretion, then he may obtain the necessary relief in the courts by way of an article 78 proceeding (\u00a7 7607, subd. 3; see <em>Matter of Marburg </em>v. <em>Cole, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">As to plaintiffs\u2019 contention that \u201c the issue of constitutionality cannot be determined without a trial \u201d\u2014which is inconsistent with their motion for summary judgment \u2014 the issues of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>which assertedly exist all go to the wisdom and efficacy of the statute, and have no bearing on its constitutionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Chief Judge Desmond and Judges Dye, Fuld, Burke and Foster concur with Judge Froessel ; Judge Van Voorhis concurs on the assumption that this statute affects the use of the title \u201c psychologist \u201d only in conjunction with services rendered to individuals in the solution of personal problems or treatment of illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-8\">,.
