The evidence is insufficient to establish defendant Brinkman\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Trimarchi, </em>231 N. Y. 263; <em>Poole </em>v. <em>People, </em>80 N. Y. 645; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>275 N. Y. 33; <em>People </em>v. <em>Razezicz, </em>206 N. Y. 249; <em>People </em>v. <em>Flack, </em>125 N. Y. 324; <em>People ex rel. Hegeman </em>v. <em>Corrigan, </em>195 N. Y. 1; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Shurtleff, </em>43 F. 2d 944; <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>154 Misc. 667, 245 App. Div. 838; <em>People </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>206 N. Y. 373.) II. The Trial Judge erred in permitting evidence of a change in the system of reporting the work and preparing the payment vouchers a year before the alleged conspiracy, as proof from which criminal intent may be inferred. III. The prolixity of the charge and the rapidity with which it was read rendered it improbable or impossible that the jury could comprehend, absorb and retain the instructions, and constituted a denial of the constitutional and statutory rights of defendants. The error was aggravated by the giving of erroneous instructions. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wallens, </em>297 N. Y. 57; <em>People </em>v. <em>Murch, </em>263 N. Y. 285; <em>People ex rel. Battista </em>v. <em>Christian, </em>249 N. Y. 314.) IV. It was error to refuse proper requests to charge. The error was not cured by adding \u201c except as already charged.\u201d The refusal of a request to charge concerning reasonable doubt and burden of proof was especially prejudicial because the Trial Judge had erred in his main charge. <em>(Nicola </em>v. <em>United States, </em>72 F. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>2d 780; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>65 Hun 420; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bonifacio, </em>190 N. Y. 150.) V. Bullis \u2019 prior testimony before the Grand Jury and the Commissioner of Investigation having been utilized by the District Attorney, it was substantial and prejudicial error to refuse a request by his codefendants for an inspection thereof. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>257 N. Y. 54; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>253 App. Div. 430; <em>People </em>v. <em>Dales, </em>309 N. Y. 97; <em>People </em>v. <em>Boniello, </em>303 N. Y. 619; <em>People </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>262 N. Y. 140.) VI. It was substantial and prejudicial error to deny a request to examine the Grand Jury testimony of Nelson which contained inconsistencies with and contradictions of his testimony at the trial. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dales, </em>309 N. Y. 97; <em>People </em>v. <em>Boniello, </em>303 N. Y. 619; <em>People </em>v. <em>Schainuck, </em>286 N. Y. 161; <em>People </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>262 N. Y. 140.) VII. Substantial and prejudicial error was committed in receiving in evidence prior statements of Brinkman which were not admissions and which were offered by the District Attorney as such but used for an improper and illegal purpose. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bretagna, </em>298 N. Y. 323; <em>Reed </em>v. <em>McCord, </em>160 N. Y. 330; <em>Ferris </em>v. <em>Sterling, </em>214 N. Y. 249; <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>226 N. Y. 180; <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>People, </em>55 N. Y. 81; <em>People </em>v. <em>Zackowitz, </em>254 N. Y. 192.) VIII. The use by the District Attorney of prior incompetent testimony of codefendants for the purpose of incriminating Brinkman, and the denial of a motion for a mistrial after the harm had been done, were prejudicial and substantial error. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bretagna, </em>298 N. Y. 323; <em>People ex rel. Perkins </em>v. <em>Moss, </em>187 N. Y. 410; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mleczko, </em>298 N. Y. 153 ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Zackowitz, </em>254 N. Y. 192; <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>People, </em>55 N. Y. 81; <em>People </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>306 N. Y. 223.) IX. The prejudicial manner in which the Assistant District Attorney read the prior testimony of defendants to the jury, the denial by the Trial Judge of the request that it be read by a disinterested person, and his insistence that it be read by the Assistant District Attorney deprived defendants of a fair trial. <em>(Barry </em>v. <em>Mutual Life Ins. Co. of N. Y., </em>53 N. Y. 536; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fielding, </em>158 N. Y. 542; <em>Berger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>295 U. S. 78; <em>People </em>v. <em>Carborano, </em>301 N. Y. 39; <em>People </em>v. <em>Tassiello, </em>300 N. Y. 425.) X. The length of the trial, the complexity and prolixity of the indictment, the conduct of the Trial Judge and prosecutor, the frequent delays, the unbearable conditions of the courtroom, the illness of jurors, and other prejudicial conditions and circumstances, deprived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>defendants of a fair trial. The denial of a motion for a mistrial was reversible error. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Buchanan, </em>145 N. Y. 1; <em>Shushan </em>v. <em>United States, </em>117 F. 2d 110, 313 U. S. 574; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jelke, </em>308 N. Y. 56; <em>People </em>v. <em>Prosser, </em>309 N. Y. 353; <em>People </em>v. <em>Chirieleison, </em>3 N Y 2d 170.) XI. Defendants were erroneously precluded from proving that the deviations from the contract and the procedures with respect to the vouchers were customary and common practice. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Molineux, </em>168 N. Y. 264; <em>Altman </em>v. <em>Ozdoba, </em>237 N. Y. 218; <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>164 N. Y. 234; <em>People </em>v. <em>Duffy, </em>212 N.

The guilt of defendant was established beyond reasonable doubt. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dunbar Contr. Co., </em>165 App. Div. 59; <em>People </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>253 N. Y. 330; <em>People </em>v. <em>Crossman, </em>241 N. Y. 138; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sweeney, </em>213 N. Y. 37; <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>People, </em>55 N.

Evidence of the change made in the system of reporting work done and materials supplied and in preparing the payment vouchers was properly admitted. <em>(Baker </em>v. <em>United States, </em>276 F. 283; <em>Beeson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>90 F. 2d 720; <em>Hodgskin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>279 F. 85; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>78 Cal. App. 395; <em>People </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>296 Ill. 599; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benesch, </em>290 Mass. 125; <em>State </em>v. <em>Simon, </em>113 N. J.

Y. 330; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gaffey, </em>98 App. Div. 461,182 N. Y. 257.) III. The charge was full, clear and explicit and in conformance with the Code of Criminal Procedure and was comprehended by the jury. The length of the charge and the manner of the delivery thereof was not the subject of objection or exception or request to modify and is not subject to review by this court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fish, </em>125 N. Y. 136; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>113 N. Y. 647; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cignarale, </em>110 N. Y. 23; <em>People </em>v. <em>Feld, </em>305 N. Y. 322; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bester, </em>297 N. Y. 408; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>289 N. Y. 482.) IV. The refusal of the court to charge in the language requested was not erroneous and defendants were not prejudiced thereby. <em>(People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number><em>Dyle, </em>21 N. Y. 578; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>97 F. 2d 913; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rubin, </em>284 N. Y. 392; <em>People </em>v. <em>Trombino, </em>238 App. Div. 61, 262 N. Y. 689; <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>114 App. Div. 513,187 N. Y. 557; <em>People ex rel. Woronoff </em>v. <em>Mallon, </em>222 N. Y. 456; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lay, </em>167 Misc. 431, 254 App. Div. 372, 279 N. Y. 737; <em>Kreiner </em>v. <em>United States, </em>11 F. 2d 722, 271 U. S. 688.) V. The rulings with respect to the inspection of the Grand Jury testimony given and statements made by the codefendant Bull\u00eds were correct, and, in any event, appellant was not prejudiced thereby. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>257 N. Y. 54; <em>People ex rel. Lemon </em>v. <em>Supreme Court, </em>245 N. Y. 24; <em>People </em>v. <em>Martines, </em>15 Misc 2d 821; <em>People </em>v. <em>Skoyec, </em>183 Misc. 764; <em>People </em>v. <em>Boniello, </em>303 N. Y. 619; <em>People </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>262 N. Y. 140; <em>People </em>v. <em>Schainuck, </em>286 N. Y. 161.) VI. The court\u2019s rulings denying to appellant examination of all of the Grand Jury testimony of the witness Nelson and granting excerpts thereof did not constitute prejudicial error. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dales, </em>309 N. Y. 97; <em>People </em>v. <em>Boniello, </em>303 N. Y. 619; <em>People </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>262 N. Y. 140; <em>People </em>v. <em>Schainuck, </em>286 N. Y. 161; <em>People </em>v. <em>Nicoll, </em>3 A D 2d 64.) VII. The testimony of Brinkman before the Grand Jury was properly received in evidence. <em>(Gangi </em>v. <em>Fradus, </em>227 N. Y. 452; <em>Koester </em>v. <em>Rochester Candy Works, </em>194 N. Y. 92; <em>Reed </em>v. <em>McCord, </em>160 N. Y. 330; <em>Ferris </em>v. <em>Sterling, </em>214 N. Y. 249.) VIII. The testimony and prior statements of defendants were properly received in evidence. Appellant was not prejudiced thereby. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Feolo, </em>282 N. Y. 276; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>249 N. Y. 419; <em>People </em>v. <em>Doran, </em>246 N.

Supp. 195.) IX. The reading by an Assistant District Attorney of the portions of prior testimony and statements admitted into evidence was within the exercise of the trial court\u2019s sound discretion and in conformity with customary court procedure and pertinent statutes and was not prejudicial to appellant. X. Appellant was afforded a fair trial. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dunbar Contr. Co., </em>82 Misc. 174; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mussenden, </em>284 App. Div. 479, 284 App. Div. 958, 308 N.

The reversal of the conviction should be affirmed, apart from the insufficiency of the proof, by reason of substantial and prejudicial errors committed at the trial.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b45-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Fuld, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ab\">On these appeals taken by both the defendants Brinkman and Clemente and by the People, our study of the record and of the many points raised leads us to the same conclusion as that reached by the Appellate Division: the appealing defendants were proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on all counts of which they were convicted except count 22 \u2014 as to which the Appellate Division has reversed \u2014 and the trial was free of prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">We are, however, constrained to comment briefly on the extraordinary fact that the trial lasted for 14 months. Strongly as one must deprecate a jury trial which lasted so long, it is not to be condemned, as urged by the defendants, as a denial of due process solely because of that. The test to be applied here, as in many other due process cases, is whether under all of the circumstances the defendants were accorded a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Although the proceedings were long drawn out, and not infrequently interrupted, the record discloses that the testimony adduced by the People, though diffuse and repetitive, was overwhelming and unambiguous; the jurors could not have experienced untoward difficulty in following the evidence, intelligently assessing it and coming to a reasoned conclusion. Moreover, the defense itself must share the responsibility for the length of the trial. The prosecution\u2019s case, it is true, was in large part cumulative, but time after time when an objection might well have stopped further introduction of such evidence, the defense remained silent and, indeed, actually added to the massiveness of the record by unduly extended cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">In short, then, there was no violation of the requirements of due process; the defendants had a fair trial and no prejudicial error was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">The Appellate Division judgments should in all respects be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">Chief Judge Desmond and Judges Froessel, Burke and Foster concur with Judge Fuld ; Judges Dye and Van Voorhis concur in the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">In <em>People </em>v. Clemente: Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-11\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Brinkman: </em>On appeal by defendant: Judgment affirmed.
