Y. 541.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b223-6\">Froessel, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASl\">After a joint trial, defendants were convicted of the crimes of burglary in the third degree (Penal Law, \u00a7 404) and possession of burglars\u2019 instruments after prior conviction (Penal Law, \u00a7 408). We are satisfied that the evidence amply supports the jury\u2019s finding that defendants were guilty of the crimes charged, and that the curtailment by the trial court of the line of inquiry pursued by defense counsel on cross-examination of the medical student, Bernard Shagan, was not prejudical error.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">We turn now to defendants\u2019 claim that error was committed by the trial court in permitting a stipulation as to defendants\u2019 prior convictions to be read to the jury in connection with the count charging defendants with possession of burglars\u2019 instruments. Defendants maintained that this was in violation of section 275-b of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which then provided: \u201c The indictment shall not allege that the defendant has previously been convicted of any crime nor shall it set forth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>any record thereof, unless such prior conviction affects the degree of the crime charged in the indictment. Although in consequence of that provision the admission in evidence of a prior conviction is generally prohibited, it is to be noted that an exception has been reserved for cases where the prior convicti<em>on </em>affects the degree of the crime charged in the indictment \u201d. It is our opinion that the prior conviction of each of the defendants clearly \u201caffected\u201d the \u201c degree of the crime charged within the meaning of the exception to section 275-b.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Section 408 of the Penal Law provides that possession of burglars\u2019 instruments is a misdemeanor, but further provides that, \u201c if \u201d the person charged \u201c has \u00a1been previously convicted of any crime, he is guilty of a felony \u201d (for \u00a1kindred statutes see Penal Law, \u00a7\u00a7 483-b, 782, 1897, subds. 4, 5, 6). It follows that the degree of the crime is raised from misdemeanor to felony by virtue of the prior conviction, and the substantive nature of the crime is thus altered (see 43 Cornell L. Q. 684, 688-689).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The Legislature in enacting section 275-b intended to remedy a situation such as existed in <em>People </em>v. <em>De Santis </em>(305 N. Y. 44). There, a prior felony conviction affected only the <em>pumshment, </em>upon conviction for a subsequent felony, as prescribed in sections 1941-1942 of the Penal Law (\u00a1N\". Y. Legis. Ann., 1957, pp. 51-52). We have here a different situation where, by reason of a prior conviction, an act otherwise denominated a misdemeanor becomes a felony, which latter grade or degree of crime carries with it, aside from punishment, other serious consequences. The crimes for which the term \u201c degree \u201d is most commonly used, such as burglary (Penal Law, \u00a7\u00a7 400-407), assault (Penal Law, \u00a7\u00a7 240-245) and robbery (Penal Law, \u00a7\u00a7 2120-2129), for example, cannot be \u201c affected \u201d in any manner by a prior conviction, except with respect to <em>punishment </em>in felony cases; hence those crimes fall within the general rule of section 275-b.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">We note that the procedure followed below in this case, which has been preserved by the exception to section 275-b, is that which prevailed at common law. A prior conviction, as here, which affects the degree, or substantive nature, of the crime charged, <em>must </em>be alleged in the indictment, and proof thereof <em>must </em>be adduced at the trial before the jury (see <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>People, </em>55 N. Y. 512; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sickles, </em>156 N. Y. 541, 543-547; <em>People </em>v. <em>Marendi, </em>213 N. Y. 600, 618; <em>People </em>v. <em>De Santis, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>p, 46; 43 Cornell L. Q\u201e <em>supra, </em>p, 685). Subdivision 2 of section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure does not dictate otherwise. It merely prescribes a \u201c procedure \u201d for bringing to tbe sentencing Judge\u2019s attention, after judgment of conviction is bad, any \u201c previous convictions \u201d for crimes committed by the particular defendant which <em>\u201c </em>may not he alleged in the indictment \u201d and would have material bearing upon the severity of the <em>\u201c </em>punishment \u201d to he administered (see N, Y. Legis. Doe., 1959, No. 65[M]),</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">Accordingly, the judgments appealed from should he affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Chief Judge Desmond and Judges Dye, Fuld, Van Voorhis, Burke and Foster concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Judgments affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
