There is serious danger that prejudice resulted from the erroneous reception of this evidence. The jury may well have regarded the fact that the confession was sworn to before the magistrate in the courtroom as a virtual guarantee of its trustworthiness, as overwhelming proof that the statement contained a true account of what had happened and, indeed, the fact that it had been sworn to before a judicial officer was heavily relied upon at the trial to overcome the defendant\u2019s repudiation of it and his claim that he had \u201c blacked out \u201d and was not aware of what he was doing when he committed the homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Chief Judge Desmond and Judges Dye, Fuld, Froessel, Van Voorhis, Burke and Foster concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Judgment of conviction reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
