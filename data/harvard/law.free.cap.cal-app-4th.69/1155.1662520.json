Jerry Lee Summers was driving his pickup track and became involved in an accident with a track pulling two trailers filled with com. Based on a series of events, the two trailers became detached and one tipped over onto Jerry\u2019s track, burying it in corn. In a few short moments, a husband and father of two children was gone forever.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-10\">A wrongful death action was filed against multiple defendants alleging theories of liability based on nondelegable duty, negligent hiring and retention of an incompetent contractor, and under the doctrine of respondeat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>superior. By the time of trial, two of the three remaining defendants included Cotton, owner of the track and trailers, and Gilbert, owner of the corn.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">On January 22, 1996, a legal tragedy occurred which, unfortunately, will also alter the lives of the Summers family. The Summerses\u2019 counsel called as an expert witness Ellis Anderson, a lawyer who specializes in the field of transportation and practices primarily before the Public Utilities Commission. Anderson had an opinion on almost every imaginable subject related to the case. And he was allowed to testify to these opinions to the jury over one entire trial day. Anderson opined that Gilbert had a nondelegable duty; Cotton was hauling illegally; Gilbert\u2019s contracts with Cotton were illegal; Gilbert was legally required to be registered as a contract carrier rather than a private carrier; and Gilbert was <em>liable </em>for Cotton\u2019s acts under the doctrine of nondelegable duty, respondeat superior and negligent hiring of an incompetent contractor. Anderson even pulled out his proverbial crystal ball and predicted what future Courts of Appeal would do with respect to the current regulation of transportation in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">So why is this a problem? Simply put, Anderson, under the direction of the Summerses\u2019 counsel, completely overstepped his legal bounds. He was a <em>witness, </em>not the judge. Both state and federal courts have held that expert testimony on issues of law is not admissible since it the judge\u2019s responsibility to instruct the jurors on the law\u2014not that of the witness. The reason is that the lawyer-expert who expounds on the law usurps the role of the trial court. This is a particular problem when, as in this case, the trial court\u2019s instructions fell far short of the opinions expressed by Anderson.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">We are left asking ourselves: If the law on nondelegable duty is clear, and there was ample evidence to support a finding of negligent hiring, why go after a gnat with a sledgehammer by having a lawyer testify on the law as an expert witness? We have no answer. The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b994-8\">Karen Gayle Summers brought suit for the wrongful death of her husband, Jerry Lee Summers (decedent), on behalf of herself and as guardian ad litem for her two children, Jeffrey and Kristy Summers (plaintiffs). Prior to trial, all the defendants settled, with the exception of Maurice Cotton, Sr., doing business as Cotton Tracking (Cotton), A. L. Gilbert Company, a California corporation, A. L. Gilbert Company, doing business as Berry Seed and Feed Company, Berry Seed and Feed Company (referred to collectively as Gilbert), and Manuel Dutra, an employee of Gilbert.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-9\">At the conclusion of the trial, the court granted a motion for nonsuit against Dutra. The jury found Cotton\u2019s negligence was a legal cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>damage to plaintiffs. The jury also found Gilbert failed to exercise reasonable care to hire and retain a competent contractor, Cotton, and that the work performed by Cotton involved an unreasonable risk of physical harm to others unless performed with care and skill. The jury further found Gilbert\u2019s hiring and retention of an incompetent contractor, Cotton, was a legal cause of damage to the plaintiffs and the activity for which Gilbert hired Cotton involved an unreasonable risk of physical harm to others unless performed with care and ski\u00edl. Finally, the jury found Cotton was an independent contractor. The jury awarded plaintiffs economic damages in the amount of $482,468, and noneconomic damages in the amount of $2,625,000. The jury apportioned 50 percent of the negligence and wrongful conduct to Cotton and 50 percent to other persons. The jury also assessed $60,000 in punitive damages against Cotton.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">After a setoff for $430,000 in settlements received from other parties, and reduction of the noneconomic damages by 50 percent, a net judgment of $1,728,189 was entered against Cotton and Gilbert. In addition, interest and costs were awarded to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">Gilbert filed a timely appeal, raising eight contentions: (1) the trial court erred in admitting expert testimony regarding conclusions of law; (2) the trial court erred in admitting evidence of sorrow, grief and emotional distress in an action based on wrongful death; (3) the trial court erred in admitting speculative evidence concerning the decedent\u2019s prospective earnings; (4) the damages were excessive as a matter of law; (5) the special verdict form used was inadequate to establish Gilbert\u2019s liability for negligent hiring; (6) the trial' court erred in several instructions given to the jury; (7) as a private carrier, Gilbert was not liable as a matter of law for Cotton\u2019s actions under the doctrine of nondelegable duty; and (8) the trial court erred in admitting evidence of Cotton\u2019s financial irresponsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">Factual History</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">On the morning of March 12, 1993, decedent was driving his pickup truck southbound on Faith Home Road, in a rural part of Stanislaus County. That same morning Oswaldo Comacho was also on Faith Home Road, driving north in a truck owned by Cotton. The truck was pulling two trailers loaded with com for delivery to Gilbert\u2019s milling facility, Berry Seed and Feed Company. The speed limit on Faith Home Road was 55 miles per hour. Decedent and Comacho approached an intersection where Monte Vista Avenue meets Faith Home Road at approximately the same time. Monte Vista Avenue ended at Faith Home Road. There was a stop sign at the intersection which controlled traffic on Monte Vista, but no stop sign on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>Faith Home Road. As decedent and Comacho approached the intersection of Faith Home Road and Monte Vista Avenue, Barney Migliori was driving eastbound on Monte Vista Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">When Migliori came to the stop sign at Faith Home Road, he stopped and looked to his left (north) and saw a pickup truck approximately 500 to 600 feet away coming toward him with its left turn signal on. This truck was driven by Manuel Dutra, an employee of Gilbert. Migliori then looked to his right, but his vision was obscured by a tree in an orchard immediately to his right (south), so he pulled forward a little more. Migliori claimed he did not see any traffic to his right, so he pulled forward another 15 feet, and looked to his left again. At this point, Migliori stated Dutra\u2019s vehicle was approximately 200 feet away from the intersection and had its right turn signal on. Migliori testified he then looked to his right and could see approximately 350 feet down Faith Home Road. He did not see any vehicles approaching from the right, so he began a left turn onto Faith Home Road. After he completed his turn, Migliori heard an air horn, looked in his rearview mirror and saw a large truck bearing down on him. Migliori attempted to accelerate and steer to his right to avoid a collision, but was unable to do so. Migliori\u2019s vehicle was struck by the truck driven by Comacho and spun around.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">Dutra testified he was driving south on Faith Home Road approaching Monte Vista Avenue with a pickup truck driven by decedent approximately 300 to 400 feet behind him. Dutra estimated decedent was driving at approximately 30 miles per hour at the time. As he approached Monte Vista Avenue, Dutra turned on his right turn signal and saw Migliori\u2019s vehicle stopped at the stop sign. Dutra stated he never turned on his left turn signal. As he approached Monte Vista Avenue, Dutra could see Migliori\u2019s face looking at him the entire time, and never saw him look to the right. Dutra testified the truck driven by Comacho was very close to the intersection of Faith Home Road and Monte Vista Avenue when Migliori pulled out in front of it. Dutra recalled the sound of the truck\u2019s air horn, and the impact of the truck hitting Migliori\u2019s vehicle occurred almost simultaneously. Dutra opined there was nothing the truck could have done to avoid the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">William Jackson owned a home on the east side of Faith Home Road, set back approximately 360 feet from the road and approximately 477 feet from the intersection of Faith Home Road and Monte Vista Avenue. On the morning of March 12, 1993, he had just stepped out onto the back porch of his home when he saw Migliori\u2019s vehicle stopped at the intersection. Jackson also saw the truck driven by Comacho approaching the intersection at what he estimated to be 50 miles per hour. Jackson testified Comacho\u2019s truck was only a short distance (approximately 50 feet) from the intersection when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>Migliori pulled out into its path. He stated the truck began blowing its horn before Migliori began his turn and that the collision occurred less than a second after the horn blast stopped. Jackson stated Migliori\u2019s vehicle was struck by the truck before it had completed the turn onto Faith Hope Road and there was no way the truck could have avoided the collision. Officer James Pang of the California Highway Patrol conducted an investigation of the scene of the accident and also opined that Migliori\u2019s vehicle may not have completed its turn onto Faith Home Road when it was struck by the truck driven by Comacho.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">After striking Migliori\u2019s vehicle, Comacho\u2019s truck went across the center-line of the road and struck decedent\u2019s pickup truck which was on the shoulder of the road, causing it to overturn. The two trailers became detached from Comacho\u2019s tractor as a result of the impact and one of them tipped over on decedent\u2019s pickup truck, burying it in com. It was stipulated that decedent\u2019s death was the result of positional asphyxiation and that he survived the collision a sufficient period to satisfy the requirements for a survivorship action.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">Officer Lewis White, a mobile road enforcement officer for the California Highway Patrol, responded to the scene of the accident on March 12, 1993. White testified the two trailers were still connected when he arrived. He conducted a visual inspection of the track driven by Comacho and found the \u201cfifth wheel\u201d plate which attaches the trailer to the tractor had pulled completely away from the first trailer, causing it to separate from the tractor. White also found a tear in the fifth wheel plate approximately seven inches long, which he opined had been present for some time prior to the accident because there was evidence of rust along the tear. White observed the safety cable between the first and second trailer was rusted with numerous broken strands. He stated this defect was obvious from approximately 10 to 15 feet away. Finally, White observed that one of the air lines for the brakes running from the tractor to the trailer was ruptured and repaired with duct tape. White stated this tape was also visible at a distance of 10 to 15 feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">In addition to his visual inspection of the track driven by Comacho, White inspected the track\u2019s brakes after it had been towed from the scene. As a result of this inspection, White determined that both front brakes on the tractor were so far out of adjustment as to require it to be placed \u201cout of service.\u201d Additionally, he found the brakes on the third axle and the right brake on the fourth axle to be inoperative. White also found there was an air leak in the left brake on the fourth axle. Finally, White determined the right brake on the fifth axle was out of adjustment, which decreased its efficiency. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>White noted a tire on one of the trailers had less than two thirty-seconds of an inch of tread on it. White testified he did not note any damage to the brakes which appeared to be the result of the collision, and that in his opinion, the defects he detected were preexisting at the time of the accident. Based on his inspection, White concluded the truck driven by Comacho was unsafe at any speed.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">White testified he had stopped trucks owned by Cotton prior to March 12, 1993, at least six times. On each occasion there was something wrong with the truck which required it to be put out of service. White stated he had previously cited trucks owned by Cotton seven times for having brake violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">Michael Allison, a traffic accident reconstructionist, testified for plaintiffs. Based on the results of White\u2019s inspection, Allison estimated the truck driven by Comacho had only 50 percent of its total braking capacity available on the date of the accident. Based on consideration of the photographs of the accident scene, Allison calculated Migliori\u2019s vehicle was approximately 60 feet north of the intersection of Monte Vista Avenue and Faith Home Road traveling at a speed of 16 miles per hour when it was struck by Comacho\u2019s truck. Allison estimated Comacho was driving between 50 and 55 miles per hour as he approached the intersection and was approximately 400 feet from the point where he struck Migliori\u2019s truck when Migliori began his turn onto Faith Home Road. However, based on his analysis of the photographs of the scene of the accident, Allison was of the opinion that Comacho did not begin to apply his brakes until he was 15 feet away from Migliori\u2019s vehicle. Based on his calculations, Allison concluded that if the truck driven by Comacho had adequate brakes and Comacho applied them in time, he would have avoided striking Migliori\u2019s vehicle altogether. Additionally, Allison concluded that even with brakes that were only 50 percent efficient, if Comacho had .reacted properly and applied his brakes when he first realized Migliori was pulling in front of him, he would have struck Migliori\u2019s vehicle, but not decedent\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">At the time of decedent\u2019s death, Gilbert was in the business of milling dairy feed. Gilbert would purchase com and other grains as well as other ingredients which it then milled at its facilities and distributed to its customers. One of these facilities is Berry Seed and Feed Company. Gilbert maintained a fleet of tracks and trailers used primarily for delivering the final milled feed to its customers. However, on occasion Gilbert would hire independent contractors to perform this task. Gilbert usually employed independent trackers only to haul the com and other grains to its facilities for milling. Occasionally, Gilbert would also use one of its tracks to haul <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>corn or grain to its facility for milling. Some of the com Gilbert purchased was received by rail at Foster Commodities. On the morning he was involved in the accident, Comacho was hauling com from Foster Commodities to Berry Seed and Feed Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">In order to maintain its fleet of tractors and trailers, Gilbert maintained a maintenance facility at Berry Seed and Feed Company, employing seven mechanics. Gilbert was registered as a \u201cprivate carrier\u201d by the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and complied with all the safety requirements for operating tracks in California. It was Gilbert\u2019s policy not to do any maintenance work on the trucks driven by the independent contractors it hired. When it hired an independent contractor to haul its products for the first time, Gilbert reviewed the contractor\u2019s PUC licenses. However, Gilbert never did any follow-up checks to determine if the contractor maintained the appropriate license. Neither did Gilbert ever request a copy of the Management Information System of Terminal Evaluation Records (MISTER) Report maintained by the California Highway Patrol (CHP) on any of the independent contractors it hired. This report was available to the general public and provided a detailed history of a carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">Cotton was one of many independent contractors which Gilbert hired to haul com and other products to its milling facilities. As of the date of the accident, Cotton had been hauling products for Gilbert approximately 10 years. Although Cotton hauled goods for other customers, most of its \u2022 business prior to the date of the accident involved hauling for Gilbert. Maurice Cotton, who founded Cotton Tracking, had one of the oldest PUC licenses in the state of California. On the date of the accident, Maurice Cotton was in his 70\u2019s and had turned the day-to-day operation of the family business over to one of his sons, Marvin Cotton. Maurice stated he never heard of the Biennial Inspection of Terminals (BIT) Program, and no one from the CHP had ever inspected his facility. Maurice testified that if asked by anyone for whom he hauled goods, he would have stated Cotton was properly licensed to carry agricultural products, and complied with all safety and maintenance programs required by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">Marvin Cotton testified he was responsible for maintaining and servicing Cotton\u2019s tracks. He did much of the maintenance himself, and if he had a problem which he could not handle he would refer it to one of the mechanics he used. Marvin stated if anyone had asked him prior to the date of the accident, he would have said Cotton maintained the proper licenses and complied with all required safety and maintenance programs for its tracks. Marvin claimed he instructed all Cotton\u2019s drivers to inspect their vehicles each morning before they left. Marvin testified this safety inspection included checking and adjusting the brakes on the tracks. Marvin stated he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>present the morning of March 12, 1993, and assisted Comacho in inspecting his truck. Marvin claimed this inspection included checking the brakes on the truck, and they were operating correctly. He also claimed there was no duct tape on any air lines on Comacho\u2019s truck when it left the Cotton facility that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">In 1991, Cotton had a highway contract carrier permit and an agricultural carrier permit. However, in September 1991, the PUC revoked both permits, and Cotton only applied for reinstatement of the agricultural carrier permit. Cotton\u2019s agricultural carrier permit was reinstated, but either revoked or suspended at least five times before the date of the accident. It was last reinstated on March 1, 1993, after having been suspended on January 19, 1993. All the suspensions and revocations related to Cotton\u2019s failure to provide the PUC information concerning its financial responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">In 1989, the State of California implemented the BIT program, which required every motor carrier to submit an application for a BIT inspection. This program required the inspection of any truck terminal every two years. It was stipulated that at the time of the accident, Cotton had not complied with the requirements of the BIT program. Also, California law mandates a 90-day maintenance program for all trucks operating in the state, and requires a daily inspection of every truck prior to operation to ensure it is in a safe condition and in good working order. Cotton did not have such a program prior to the date of the accident. Additionally, the California Vehicle Code prescribes a preventative maintenance program for trucks, which includes a requirement that the carrier maintain records of the maintenance performed for at least 30 days. Cotton was unaware of the requirement to maintain the maintenance records on its trucks and did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">When a truck delivered com or other products to Berry Seed and Feed Company, it would drive onto the scales which were about 10 feet from one of the windows in the office building. When the truck was on the scales, all that could be seen from the window was the trailer. Once the truck was weighed, it would be directed to another portion of the facility where it would be unloaded under the supervision of an employee of Berry Seed and Feed Company. It would normally take approximately 30 minutes for a truck to off-load the grain it was carrying in this manner. Tracks may stay at the facility longer, depending on the number of trucks in line to deliver products.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">In the six months prior to the date of the accident, Cotton trucks made close to one thousand deliveries to Berry Seed and Feed Company. However, no employee or officer of Gilbert testified they had ever seen or heard of any problem with Cotton\u2019s trucks or ever seen or heard of them breaking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>down at Berry Seed and Feed Company. Neither did anyone from Gilbert testify they were aware Cotton had had its PUC license as an agricultural carrier suspended or revoked. Marvin Cotton claimed that prior to the date of the accident, he never had a truck break down while it was at Berry Seed and Feed Company; never complained to Gilbert personnel there that he had a maintenance problem or requested their assistance; and no one at Berry Seed and Feed Company ever assisted him in the maintenance of one of Cotton\u2019s trucks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">Kevious Keller, Marvin Cotton\u2019s cousin, testified he worked as a driver for Cotton in 1993. He was the primary driver of the truck driven by Comacho on March 12, 1993, and had never experienced any maintenance problems with it. He stated he checked the brakes regularly and they worked efficiently when he had to make an emergency stop. Keller had taken a day off work on the day of the accident, but went to Cotton\u2019s facility because he discovered he had left his wallet in the truck. When Keller found the truck was not at Cotton\u2019s facility he went to Berry Seed and Feed Company, where he found the truck in line waiting to deliver its cargo. Comacho told Keller he had a leak in one of the air hoses for the brakes and Keller repaired it with some duct tape. Keller testified he told Comacho to park the truck because it was unsafe, and to contact Marvin Cotton.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">Keller also stated he never broke down at Berry Seed and Feed Company while driving this truck, but that on occasion com would leak from cracks in the trailers, and someone at Berry Seed and Feed Company would tell him to fix the problem. On one occasion Keller wished to adjust his brakes and asked if he could borrow a wrench from Berry Seed and Feed Company\u2019s maintenance facility. However, no one would give him one because of the company policy against working on independent contractor\u2019s tracks. Keller claimed Cotton was complying with the BIT program and the CHP inspected Cotton\u2019s facility once before the date of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">Parish Piggee worked for Cotton for a period of time prior to the date of the accident. Piggee testified he broke down on the scales at Gilbert\u2019s facilities a \u201ccouple of times\u201d while driving Cotton\u2019s trucks. This occurred at least once at Berry Seed and Feed Company when the gearshift lever in his truck broke. He claimed on another occasion when his track broke down while waiting in line at Berry Seed and Feed Company, he had to be towed by Marvin Cotton. Piggee testified that one time the accelerator pedal came off one of Cotton\u2019s tracks while he was driving it. He also stated he almost had an accident once when he put the brakes on to avoid a car that had pulled in front of him on the freeway. Because the brakes were not adjusted correctly, his truck spun 360 degrees. Piggee testified rivets on Cotton\u2019s trailers were always popping out and causing com or other material to leak <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>and he would use duct tape to repair them. Piggee heard at least one employee of Gilbert, named Jerry, who worked at its Farmer Warehouse facility, refer to Cotton\u2019s trucks as \u201cjunk.\u201d Piggee claimed he also heard both Marvin Cotton and Maurice Cotton, Jr., refer to their trucks as \u201cold junk.\u201d Piggee claimed there was no policy at Cotton for a driver to check his brakes every day, and he did not do so. Piggee claimed he was terminated by Cotton because he was late to work, and denied Keller\u2019s allegation he had been terminated because he was using illegal drugs while on the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">I. <em>The lawyer as an expert witness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">Gilbert contends the trial court erred when it permitted Ellis Anderson, a lawyer specializing in the field of transportation, to testify as an expert. Anderson, who practiced primarily before the PUC, was offered to provide his opinions regarding whether Gilbert: had a nondelegable duty; was liable for the negligent hiring of an incompetent contractor; and was liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-7\">Gilbert concedes the jury\u2019s determination that Cotton was an independent contractor renders moot the issue of whether it was error to allow Anderson to give an opinion on the issue of respondeat superior. However, Gilbert claims Anderson\u2019s opinions on whether Gilbert had a nondelegable duty with respect to Cotton and whether Gilbert was liable based on the negligent hiring and retention of an incompetent contractor, involved legal questions which were not a proper matter for expert testimony. Gilbert claims Anderson\u2019s testimony invaded the province of the court because his opinion involved instructing the jury on the law applicable to plaintiffs\u2019 case. Gilbert argues that allowing Anderson to testify as an expert could have led the jury to believe he knew more about transportation law than the court, thereby inviting them to adopt his view of the applicable law rather than that contained in the court\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">A. <em>Standard of review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-9\">A trial court\u2019s determination that expert testimony is admissible is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rowland </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 238, 266 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 841 P.2d 897]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 778, 787 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 703].) Additionally: \u201c \u2018[T]he admissibility of expert opinion is a question of degree. The jury need not be wholly ignorant of the subject matter of the opinion in order to justify its admission; if that were the test, little expert opinion testimony would ever be heard. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>Instead, the statute declares that even if the jury has some knowledge of the matter, expert opinion may be admitted whenever it would \u201cassist\u201d the jury. It will be excluded only when it would add nothing at all to the jury\u2019s common fund of information, i.e., when \u201cthe subject of inquiry is one of such common knowledge that men of ordinary education could reach a conclusion as intelligently as the witness.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>McAlpin </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1289, 1299-1300 [283 Cal.Rptr. 382, 812 P.2d 563].) Although a trial court has a great deal of discretion when it comes to admitting expert testimony, \u201cthis discretion is not absolute. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(McCleery </em>v. <em>City of Bakersfield </em>(1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 1059, 1068 [216 Cal.Rptr. 852].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">B. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">1. <em>Anderson\u2019s testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">Prior to trial, Gilbert moved to exclude the testimony of Anderson on the ground his expert opinion related to a question of law, i.e., whether Gilbert had a nondelegable duty. Plaintiffs responded to Gilbert\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>claiming Gilbert was \u201cmischaracterizing the nature of [Anderson\u2019s] testimony.\u201d Plaintiffs contended Anderson\u2019s opinion would be on an issue of fact, not a question of law, i.e., that Gilbert was operating under a public franchise. Plaintiffs then claimed \u201cit would seem proper for Mr. Anderson to opine even as to the ultimate issue of whether there is vicarious liability. However, Mr. Anderson\u2019s opinion does not appear to go that far <em>yet. </em>Accordingly, Mr. Anderson\u2019s testimony is well within the ambit of acceptability and, more importantly, well within the range of admissibility.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">Plaintiffs attached a copy of Anderson\u2019s declaration to the opposition to Gilbert\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>ostensibly for the purpose of establishing his opinion was admissible and to dispel any misrepresentation by Gilbert concerning the nature of his opinion. However, review of Anderson\u2019s declaration supports the conclusion that if there was any misrepresentation of the nature of his opinion, it was by plaintiffs. The first sentence in Anderson\u2019s declaration provides: \u201cI, Ellis Ross Anderson, present this declaration in furtherance of my conclusion, as an expert on California and federal regulation of motor carriers, and the responsibility/liability to the public necessarily arising from that regulation, that Defendant A.L. Gilbert Company (\u2018Gilbert\u2019) is <em>vicariously liable </em>for the acts or omission of Defendant Cotton Trucking and its principals.\u201d (Italics added.) Anderson\u2019s declaration goes on to refute Gilbert\u2019s claim that the nondelegable duty doctrine does not apply to private carriers. He opines \u201cGilbert cannot avoid the application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>of this doctrine because it holds authority as a private carrier.\u201d Therefore, at the time of the accident, Gilbert operated pursuant to a \u201cpublic franchise.\u201d Anderson\u2019s declaration also purports to distinguish the cases relied upon by Gilbert and list applicable federal regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">The court denied Gilbert\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>on the grounds that Anderson\u2019s opinion was on a factual issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-5\">\u201cWith regard to ruling on Defendant Gilbert\u2019s Number Seven, which would preclude Mr. Anderson from testifying or giving an opinion that defendant Gilbert has a nondelegable duty as it relates to the acts of Cotton Trucking, Mr. Anderson can testify and give an opinion whether the defendant Gilbert had a nondelegable duty. This is a factual opinion based on the evidence made known to Mr. Anderson and his understanding of California law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-6\">\u201cWhile Mr. Anderson can testify as to his understanding of California law, and that being the basis of his opinion, or at least part of the basis of his opinion, he can not testify as to what California law actually is, and the jury will be instructed that the law is what the Court tells them that it is, not what a witness thinks that it is.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">Prior to Anderson being called as a witness, Cotton requested the court reconsider its ruling, again claiming his expert opinion went to an issue of law. The court declined to reconsider, claiming Anderson\u2019s opinion was akin to an attorney or doctor testifying to the standard of care in a legal or medical malpractice case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-8\">\u201cI\u2019ve made a ruling treating this somewhat analogous to whether or not a doctor or an attorney met the standard of care on a medical or legal malpractice suit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-9\">\u201cThe Court\u2019s going to allow Mr. Anderson to give an opinion whether or not Cotton\u2014excuse me, Gilbert\u2019s had a nondelegable duty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-10\">\u201c. . . That\u2019s right. He can\u2019t say the California law\u2019s A, B, C, and D. He can say it\u2019s his understanding what it is, so far as it\u2019s necessary for him to render an opinion whether or not there\u2019s a nondelegable duty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1004-11\">Gilbert then objected to Anderson expanding his testimony to address Cotton\u2019s permit to haul agricultural goods as well as the ownership of corn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>carried by Gilbert and the independent truckers it hired. The court refused to grant Gilbert\u2019s motion to exclude this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">When Anderson was called as a witness, the court gave the jury the following cautionary instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-6\">\u201cLadies and gentlemen, you will recall that earlier I told you that so far as facts and evidence, it\u2019s generally your discretion to decide. As to what the law is, I\u2019ll be instructing you as to what the law is at the end of the case. And again you have to accept what I say the law is, not what the attorneys say or not what Mr. Anderson says.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-7\">\u201cMr. Anderson may be telling you his opinion as to what the law is in support of any other opinions he gives you. Now, if I were to tell you that the law is this or the law is that and that happened to match Mr. Anderson\u2019s opinion as to what the law is, then that might support his other opinions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-8\">\u201cIf what I tell you the law is is contrary to what Mr. Anderson opines the law is, then that might detract from any other opinions he has.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">As a prelude to voicing his opinion, Anderson explained the information he relied upon in reaching his conclusions. He stated this information included \u201cmy file relative to the PUC\u2019s decisions as they might affect this since\u2014since the early \u201950s, and looked at the Vehicle Code to the extent\u2014 the California Vehicle Code, which is where the law is set forth with regard to some safety operations, and the California Public Utilities Code.\u201d Plaintiffs then gave Anderson a lengthy hypothetical set of facts based on the evidence they believed would be presented. At one point during the course of the recitation of these facts, Anderson interrupted plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to remind him to emphasize a fact from the case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-10\">\u201c[Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel] That Gilbert paid Cotton weekly where Cotton would actually show up and ask for his check on a weekly basis based on invoices. That Gilbert knew that Cotton was having financial difficulties. Gilbert knew and had loaned money to Cotton, interest free, on occasion and had taken out\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-11\">\u201cA. [Anderson] Without any documentation, wasn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-12\">\u201cQ. And there was no documentation for the loans.....\u201d Anderson then offered his opinion that Gilbert had a duty to make sure Cotton was operating safely. \u201cAnd in my view, Gilbert can\u2019t put Cotton on the road without being sure that Cotton is safe under the circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1006-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>Additionally, over Gilbert\u2019s objection, Anderson opined that failure of a trucking company to register with the PUC means it is operating illegally:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-4\">\u201cQ: Okay. So unless you do that, you don\u2019t even exist as far as the overall regulatory system unless you\u2019re somehow apprehended\u2014is that correct? \u2014unless you register?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-5\">\u201cA: That\u2019s correct. You\u2019re operating illegally unless you register.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-6\">\u201cQ: And if you hire somebody to perform work or activity for which there\u2019s no license, they may have a subsidiary license but they have no license to perform that kind of work or activity, they would likewise be operating illegally, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-7\">\u201cA: The\u2014if that\u2019s a\u2014I want to say yes, but there are circumstances under which I could hire a trucker and that operation could be legal. For example, if I want to treat that trucker as an employee, he doesn\u2019t need a license. If I want to treat that trucker as my\u2014as my employee, then he can operate under my particular authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-8\">\u201cBut in the absence of that kind of relationship, nobody can run a truck up and down the road without the benefit of either their license or somebody else\u2019s license in that context.\u201d Anderson then went on, over Gilbert\u2019s objection, to comment at length on whether hiring an unlicensed earner was an \u201cillegal\u201d act:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-9\">\u201cQ: And so if I hire somebody to perform work and they have not complied with this character of the law, I\u2019m basically hiring that person to perform an illegal act?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-10\">\u201cA: That would be correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-11\">\u201cQ: Again you talked about illegal agreement. Would that be an illegal agreement, to hire somebody to perform work which is illegal in nature?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-12\">\u201cA: In my view it would. It would be no different than trying to hire somebody to practice law that doesn\u2019t have a license to practice law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1006-13\">At one point Anderson also prompted plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to ask him questions about the \u201cpull notice program\u201d so that he could explain it to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-14\">\u201cThe Witness: Mr. Veen, are you going to explain what the pull notice program is? Because the jury\u2019s not going to understand.\u201d After objection by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>Gilbert, the court struck this comment. However, Anderson was permitted to testify at length concerning his understanding of the meaning of the term respondeat superior and the public policy considerations behind it. Additionally, over Gilbert\u2019s objection, Anderson explained his understanding of the doctrine of nondelegable duty:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-5\">\u201cThe Witness: If--I have the responsibility to act safely on the road, to perform transportation services in a safe and prudent manner. I may not\u2014I may not avoid that responsibility by having somebody else do it for me, even if that somebody else is a licensed independent contractor. I as a matter of public policy am not permitted to in effect step away from the liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-6\">\u201cAnd the basis for that is this: You\u2019re not going to permit somebody to get involved in the trucking business and then to freely hire people that aren\u2019t appropriately safe and duck the responsibility for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-7\">\u201cThe\u2014it\u2019s the flip side of the coin. You get a privilege. You can be a trucker. You registered. The flip side of that coin is <em>you\u2019re responsible for any activity that occurs and arises out of that, regardless of whether that\u2019s activity of your employee or the activity of somebody else that is licensed.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">Anderson\u2019s comments concerning nondelegable duty did not stop there. He went on to state his opinion concerning the viability of the doctrine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-9\">\u201cA. Not necessarily inherent dangers, but just potential dangers. Trucking is one of those activities. So the concept that we have got, this notice that you\u2019ve got a responsibility once you get a franchise carrier permit, comes in with a vengeance as the danger of the activity or as the complexity of the activity increases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-10\">\u201cAnd, as a consequence, the <em>concept of nondelegable duty as to truckers in 1993 is incredibly viable. . . .</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-11\">\u201cAnd the one is that you\u2019ve gotten derivative certain responsibilities, and the activity is potentially dangerous. And that means that if you\u2019re a trucker, you may not duck the responsibility just by handing the baton to somebody else in a particular instance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-12\">\u201cThat\u2019s the doctrine of nondelegable duty. I can\u2019t duck the responsibility. It\u2019s mine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-13\">\u201cQ: Can I call him an independent contractor and duck the responsibility?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>\u201cA: I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s an independent contractor or not. I wouldn\u2019t care if Cotton retained Gilbert. It doesn\u2019t make any difference. The entities that have the license may not delegate their responsibilities to the public under proper understanding of the way in which these entities are currently regulated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-4\">\u201cQ: <em>We talked about duties. They both then are\u2014legal responsibility is on both entities then?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-5\">\u201cA: <em>If you have two. If you have two carriers, both of them have independent responsibility. Both of them are, both of the participants are liable for the consequences that occur with regard to a joint activity. They\u2019re equally liable under this notion.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">In the event the jury somehow failed to grasp the significance of Anderson\u2019s opinion, plaintiffs asked him again to state his opinion on whether Gilbert was liable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-7\">\u201cMr. Veen: Q. In light of the assumptions\u2014let me try it again. Gilbert has a private carrier license, has the characteristics that we just discussed. It hires Cotton for its use, for its own benefit, to haul its com from one location to another. Cotton has an ag permit on and off, but on the particular day of the accident the ag permit is in effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-8\">\u201cRegardless of what Cotton is hauling, and regardless of whether it\u2019s within the context of his ag permit, but just Cotton is hauling Gilbert\u2019s product, do you have an opinion within the relationship as to whether or not Gilbert is subject to this nondelegable duty aspect of the law? Do you have an opinion in that regard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-9\">\u201cA. I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-10\">\u201cQ. What is that opinion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-11\">\u201cA. <em>Gilbert may not delegate its duties to ensure public safety in connection with that operation to Mr. Cotton. Gilbert stays on the hook.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-12\">\u201cQ. <em>So if Cotton gets in an accident for which he\u2019s legally responsible, then Gilbert is legally responsible?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-13\">\u201cA. <em>That\u2019s correct.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-14\">\u201cQ. <em>They\u2019re both legally responsible?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-15\">\u201cA. <em>That\u2019s correct.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Anderson was also allowed to explain the legal basis for his opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>\u201cA. There\u2019s no published case relative to it that has undertaken, no court that\u2019s undertaken, to analyze the current environment. I\u2019ll tell you that. You know, 1993 where the concepts, the concepts are reasonably recent, you know how long it takes for these things to grind through the court. So there\u2019s no published case on appeal which evaluates the current regulation of transportation in California. <em>There will be.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">Over Gilbert\u2019s objection, plaintiffs elicited Anderson\u2019s opinion on whether Gilbert was a contract carrier notwithstanding the fact it only had a license as a private carrier:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-6\">\u201cQ. Okay. Now, in looking at the various documents, do you have an opinion as to whether or not, apart from Gilbert acting as a private carrier, that Gilbert is also acting as a highway contract carrier, albeit without a license for being a highway contract carrier?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-7\">\u201cThe Witness: It is my view that Gilbert in a program that it calls the prepaid program is regularly putting its drivers and its trucks on the road transporting the product of somebody else, namely, feed and seed and other kinds of things that are owned by people that Gilbert does not\u2014does not\u2014well, owned by people other than Gilbert.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-8\">\u201cAnd under the circumstances as I read the depositions and looked at the documents, that transportation which is separately invoiced, sometimes Gilbert puts its trucks on it, sometimes it hires somebody else. That is a for hire activity.\u201d Anderson added that he was of the opinion that Gilbert was liable regardless of whether it was considered a private carrier or contract carrier.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1009-9\">When plaintiffs attempted to ask Anderson questions concerning the standard applicable to Gilbert\u2019s hiring of Cotton, the court sustained Gilbert\u2019s objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-10\">\u201cThe Court:\u2014Anderson will not be testifying on the\u2014with regard to any expertise dealing with the negligent hiring of an independent\u2014excuse me, the negligent hiring of an incompetent trucker.\u201d Despite this ruling, plaintiffs did elicit testimony from Anderson on the standards regarding negligent hiring of an incompetent trucker:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-11\">\u201cQ. And are you familiar with the standards as far as how carriers are retained by those that hire them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-12\">\u201cA. I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>\u201cQ. And as far as a carrier, I\u2019ll put this in a hypothetical. A carrier with this kind of a facility, hiring a trucker with a tractor that\u2019s 24, 25 years old and trailers that are old and that they\u2019re obviously old, is there any greater need to make further inquiry into those conditions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-4\">\u201cA. Well, yeah. I think a trucker who hires a trucker, because he or she is going to be liable for the activities of that trucker, would in any event inquire into the nature of the person that he was hiring, you know. Where I\u2019m going to have you do something for me, and if you screw it up I\u2019m going to be liable for it, I\u2019m going to be pretty darned careful with regard to what\u2014what I\u2019m doing. So in a sanitized context, truckers check to make sure that truckers they hire, because of this responsibility, are licensed and are safe operators, because they\u2019re going to get stuck with the responsibility if they\u2019re not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-5\">\u201cThat situation, that thing is increased radically when you hire a trucker that\u2014that is operating on the fringe and you know they\u2019re operating on the fringe. And when you hire a trucker day in, day out, day in, day out, day in, day out, as a captive trucker the level of concern about this on the part of this trucker who is going to be stuck with responsibility for that goes up, in my experience.\u201d When plaintiffs\u2019 counsel questioned Anderson concerning the use of the term \u201cstuck,\u201d Anderson responded: \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to use a term you didn\u2019t like, Mr. Veen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">Anderson also offered his opinion that all the loads carried by Cotton for Gilbert in the six months prior to the accident were \u201cunlawful,\u201d and there existed a principal-agent relationship between Gilbert and Cotton. Plaintiffs ended their direct examination of Anderson with the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-7\">\u201cQ. Is there any way that Gilbert could have avoided all legal responsibility for the acts of Cotton, in other words?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-8\">\u201cA. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-9\">\u201cQ. What is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-10\">\u201cA. Don\u2019t act as a trucker.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1010-11\">On cross-examination, Gilbert attempted to question the basis for Anderson\u2019s opinion that it was subject to a nondelegable duty with respect to Cotton and received the following exposition on the law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-12\">\u201cA. No court has declined to apply it. I don\u2019t mean to be argumentative with you. I know of no case which\u2014I know of no case law which extends that concept of nondelegable duty to the private carrier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>\u201cThe basis of my testimony wasn\u2019t the existence of case law though. The basis of my opinion on that subject was to look at the reasons and the predicates that the courts have historically provided that you couldn\u2019t delegate your duties, to compare those to the\u2014to the criterion in 1993 that were applied to a private carrier of a for hire carrier, and to tell you, Mr. Post, in that context that there\u2019s no distinction at all. There\u2019s no reason that the courts, fully informed, won\u2019t apply it, given the current regulations over transportation in the state of California.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">On redirect examination, plaintiffs provided Anderson a variation in the original hypothetical set of facts concerning the percentage of Cotton\u2019s business that was with Gilbert and then asked if it changed his opinion concerning Gilbert\u2019s liability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-6\">\u201cQ. Does it have any effect on any of your opinions? I believe you said\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-7\">\u201cA. No, it doesn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-8\">\u201cQ. Okay. <em>And we\u2019re talking about three separate bases of legal responsibility. </em>We\u2019re talking about the nondelegable duty being an independent basis. Does it have any effect?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-9\">\u201cThe Witness: It doesn\u2019t have any effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-10\">\u201cMr. Veen: Q. Okay. <em>The negligent retention of an incompetent contractor?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-11\">\u201cA. <em>It doesn\u2019t have any effect.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-12\">\u201cQ. Respondeat superior within the context that we have discussed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-13\">\u201cA. It doesn\u2019t have any effect. . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1011-14\">At the conclusion of trial, in response to Gilbert\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, the court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-15\">\u201cI am going\u2014I plan on finding that Gilbert was a private carrier, but that the 428 restatement nondelegable duty <em>can still apply </em>to private carriers, and I am not going to rule as a matter of law that Cotton was either an employee or an independent contractor, which\u2014something that the jury can make a determination on based on the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-16\">\u201cMr. Post [Gilbert\u2019s counsel]: When you say that 428 can apply, are you leaving that to the jury\u2019s discretion, Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>\u201cThe Court; You have argued that nondelegable duty is something that the Court has to decide. Mr. Veen or Miss McGuinn, any response to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-4\">\u201cMr. Veen [plaintiffs\u2019 counsel]: Well, I think the nondelegable duty as it pertains to a private carrier, we have proffered an instruction. The other part of that is that the work you\u2019re hiring the individual to perform has certain characteristics. That I believe does go to the jury, Your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-5\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Then the tentative ruling I announced will become the ruling of the Court.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">2. <em>Limitations on admissibility of expert opinion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">Gilbert\u2019s claim of error and Anderson\u2019s testimony raise serious questions concerning the proper role of expert testimony in a trial, especially when the purported expert is a lawyer.  As a general rule, the opinion of an expert is admissible when it is \u201c[r]elated to a subject that is sufficiently beyond common experience that the opinion of an expert would assist the trier of fact ...\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 801, subd. (a).) Additionally, in California: \u201cTestimony in the form of an opinion that is otherwise admissible is not objectionable because it embraces the ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 805.) However, the admissibility of opinion evidence that embraces an ultimate issue in a case does not bestow upon an expert carte blanche to express any opinion he or she wishes. (See <em>Nieves-Villanueva </em>v. <em>Soto-Rivera </em>(1st Cir. 1997) 133 F.3d 92, 100.) There are limits to expert testimony, not the least of which is the prohibition against admission of an expert\u2019s opinion on a question of law. This limitation was recognized by this court in <em>Ferreira </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1974) 38 Cal.App.3d 120 [112 Cal.Rptr. 232].</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-8\">In <em>Ferreira, </em>the plaintiff filed a workman\u2019s compensation claim due to a hernia he suffered. A doctor for the insurance company submitted a report in which he stated: \u201c \u2018The responsibility for the recurrent left inguinal hernia is, in our opinion, his own and not the responsibility of the employer or his workmen\u2019s compensation insurance carrier.\u2019 \u201d He further opined: \u201c \u2018The strain when he lifted the battery out of his truck was not an industrially related injury and we do not believe that the employer or the Aetna Insurance Company should be considered responsible for this condition.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ferreira </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>38 Cal.App.3d at p. 124.) On appeal we held the doctor\u2019s report was not admissible evidence. \u201cHowever, these statements are clearly legal conclusions and not medical opinions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>do not constitute substantial evidence. [Citation.] The manner in which the law should apply to particular facts is a legal question and is not subject to expert opinion. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 125-126.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">Similarly, in <em>Downer </em>v. <em>Bramet </em>(1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 837 [199 Cal.Rptr. 830], the court concluded expert opinions on legal questions are not admissible regardless of whether the opinion embraces an ultimate issue. In <em>Downer, </em>a former wife claimed she had a community property interest in the proceeds from the sale of a ranch conveyed to her former husband by his employer after the parties separated. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 839.) At trial, the former wife attempted to introduce expert testimony by her former attorney and an independent attorney regarding the components of an objective test to determine whether the transfer was a gift or deferred compensation.

The one possible exception to the rule against expert opinion on issues of law can be found in <em>Neal </em>v. <em>Farmers Ins.

The defendant contended this was not a proper subject for expert opinion because it was not a matter \u201c \u2018sufficiently beyond common experience that the opinion of an expert would assist the trier of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 924.)

[Citation.] We can conceive of many ways in which a lay jury, in assessing the conduct and motives of an insurance company in denying coverage under its policy, could benefit from the opinion of one who, by profession and experience, was peculiarly equipped to evaluate such matters in the context of similar disputes. Moreover, the jury was specifically instructed that it was not bound by the opinions of such witnesses but should give such opinions the weight to which they thought them entitled in view of the qualifications and credibility of the witnesses and the reasons given by them in support of their opinions. No abuse of discretion here appears.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">Close scrutiny of the court\u2019s decision in <em>Neal </em>reveals it actually involved an expert opinion on a factual issue rather than a legal one: <em>\u201cNeal </em>did <em>not </em>involve opinions on the legal question of whether coverage existed (since coverage concededly was present in <em>Neal), </em>but instead involved opinions on questions concerning such factual issues as the promptness of the insurer\u2019s responses to settlement overtures. [Citation.] Opinions approving the admission of expert testimony as to factual matters such as industry standards for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>dealing with covered claims cannot be read to authorize experts to opine in the first instance as to the existence of coverage.\u201d <em>(Devin </em>v. <em>United Services Auto.

The federal courts have uniformly held that allowing an expert to voice an opinion on an issue of law usurps the authority of the court: \u201cThe basis of expert capacity, according to Wigmore (\u00a7 555), may \u2018be summed up in the term \u201cexperience.\u201d \u2019 But experience is hardly a qualification for construing a document for its legal effect when there is a knowledgeable gentleman in a robe whose exclusive province it is to instruct the jury on the law. The danger is that the jury may think that the \u2018expert\u2019 in the particular branch of the law knows more than the judge\u2014surely an inadmissible inference in our system of law.\u201d <em>(Marx &amp; Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Diners\u2019 Club, Inc. </em>(2d Cir. 1977) 550 F.2d 505, 512, cert. den. 434 U.S. 861 [98 S.Ct. 188, 54 L.Ed.2d 134]; see <em>Burkhart </em>v. <em>Washington Metro.

The common law did not allow an expert witness to inform the jury of his or her factual conclusion concerning the \u2018ultimate issue\u2019 in the case, because this was thought to invade the province of the jury. The abolition in Rule 704(a) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>this \u2018ultimate issue\u2019 rule allows the expert witness to offer his or her factual conclusion in order to aid the jury, which properly can choose to accept or reject it. However, questions of law are not \u2018to be decided by the trier of fact\u2019; rather it is for the judge, not the lawyers or the witnesses, to inform the jury of the law applicable in the case and to decide any purely legal issue.\u201d <em>(Nieves-Villanueva </em>v. <em>Soto-Rivera, supra, </em>133 F.3d at p. 100.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">The federal courts recognize the potential for prejudice when an expert opines on an issue of law is especially acute because the purported expert is a lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">\u201cThere is a significant difference between an attorney who states his belief of what law should govern the case and any other expert witness. While other experts may aid a jury by rendering opinions on ultimate issues, our system reserves to the trial judge the role of adjudicating the law for the benefit of the jury. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">\u201cFirst, ... the jury may believe the attorney-witness, who is presented to them imbued with all the mystique inherent in the title \u2018expert,\u2019 is more knowledgeable than the judge in a given area of the law.

Notwithstanding any subsequent disclaimers by the witness that the court\u2019s instructions would govern, a practical and experienced view of the trial world strongly suggests the jury\u2019s deliberation was unduly prejudiced by the expert\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-7\">\u201cSecond, testimony on ultimate issues of law by the legal expert is inadmissible because it is detrimental to the trial process. If one side is allowed the right to call an attorney to define and apply the law, one can reasonably expect the other side to do the same. Given the proclivity of our brothers and sisters at the bar, it can be expected that both legal experts will differ over the principles applicable to the case.

There is no necessity for this kind of evidence; to receive it would tend to suggest that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1183\">*1183</page-number>the judge and jury may shift responsibility for decision to the witnesses; and in any event it is wholly without value to the trier of fact in reaching a decision.\u201d (1 McCormick on Evidence (4th ed. 1992) \u00a7 12, p. 47, fn. omitted.)

In other words, when an expert\u2019s opinion amounts to nothing more than an expression of his or her belief on how a case should be decided, it does not <em>aid </em>the jurors, it <em>supplants </em>them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">This problem is illustrated in <em>Marx &amp; Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Diners\u2019 Club, Inc., supra, </em>550 F.2d 505. The plaintiffs in <em>Marx &amp; Co., Inc., </em>brought suit claiming the defendant engaged in securities fraud and breached its contractual obligation to register stock received by plaintiffs. A primary issue at trial was whether the defendant breached its contractual obligation to use its best efforts to register the plaintiffs\u2019 stock. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 506.) The district court permitted the plaintiffs\u2019 expert, an attorney, to voice his opinion with respect to the legal obligations of the parties under the contract. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 508.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">On appeal, the Second Circuit held the trial court erred on two counts. First, it found the expert was erroneously allowed to testify on the applicable principles of law. <em>(Marx &amp; Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Diners\u2019 Club, Inc., supra, </em>550 F.2d at pp. 509-510.) The court also noted the lawyer-witness was improperly allowed to testify concerning his \u201cconclusions as to the legal significance of various facts adduced at trial.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 510.) He opined there were \u201cno <em>legal </em>excuses\u201d for nonperformance by the defendant based on his review of the documents and correspondence which were before the judge and jury. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court found this was error: \u201c[S]uch testimony \u2018amounts to no more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1184\">*1184</page-number>an expression of the [witness\u2019s] general belief as to how the case should be decided.\u2019 [Citation.] The admission of such testimony would give the appearance that the court was shifting to witnesses the responsibility to decide the case. [Citation.] It is for the jury to evaluate the facts in the light of the applicable rules of law, and it is therefore erroneous for a witness to state his opinion on the law of the forum.

It is undisputable that \u201c[t]he question of duty is . . . a legal question to be determined by the court. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Staten </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1628, 1635 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 657]; see <em>Owens </em>v. <em>Kings Supermarket </em>(1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 379, 385 [243 Cal.Rptr. 627] [\u201cThe issue whether a duty exists is a question of law to be determined by the court, and is reviewable de novo.\u201d]; cf. <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Richmond </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1070, 1087 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 768] [whether an attorney has breached a fiduciary duty to a client is generally a question of fact]; <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Rives </em>(1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 641, 647 [172 Cal.Rptr. 254] [expert testimony by a lawyer admissible in legal malpractice action to establish the applicable standard of care].) Plaintiffs do not even attempt to dispute this point. Rather, they argue admission of Anderson\u2019s testimony was not prejudicial error on two grounds: 1) Gilbert waived any error \u201cby failing to make timely specific objection to Anderson\u2019s testimony\u201d; and 2) any error in admitting Anderson\u2019s opinion was harmless since the court instructed the jury Gilbert was subject to a nondelegable duty and his opinion \u201cdid not affect any other issue submitted to the jury.\u201d Because it determines whether any further analysis is required, we first consider plaintiffs\u2019 claim that Gilbert waived any error in admitting Anderson\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">Based on the record, plaintiffs\u2019 claim of waiver is specious. A motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence is normally sufficient to preserve an issue for review without the necessity for defendant to renew an objection at the time the evidence was offered. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Morris </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 152, 190 [279 Cal.Rptr. 720, 807 P.2d 949], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Stansbury </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 824 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 394, 889 P.2d 588].) However, if the evidence presented during trial is substantially different from that presented at the hearing on the motion <em>in limine </em>or included in an offer of proof, it is incumbent on the party who made the motion to renew the objection to the evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Champion </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 879, 925 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 547, 891 P.2d 93] [when there are variations between an offer of proof and the evidence adduced at trial, defendant must bring them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1185\">*1185</page-number>to the attention of the court]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Morris, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 190 [\u201cEvents in the trial may change the context in which the evidence is offered to an extent that a renewed objection is necessary to satisfy the language and purpose of Evidence Code section 353.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">As previously mentioned, Gilbert filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude any opinion by Anderson relating to an issue of law. Plaintiffs claim Gilbert\u2019s motion was overly broad because it referred to \u201cany and all\u201d testimony by Anderson. However, it is apparent the motion was specifically targeted at what Gilbert perceived as the primary thrust of Anderson\u2019s proposed testimony, a perception which proved to be entirely correct. However, Gilbert did not stop there. During the course of Anderson\u2019s testimony, Gilbert objected no less than eight times on the ground it involved an impermissible subject for an expert opinion. Three of these included requests by Gilbert that its objection be treated as continuing in nature. Given this record, we have no trouble finding Gilbert preserved its objection to Anderson\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">In addition to his opinion that Gilbert had a nondelegable duty, the portions of Anderson\u2019s testimony which included opinions on issues of law are almost too numerous to list. They included opinions that: Cotton was hauling illegally; Gilbert\u2019s contracts with Cotton were illegal; Gilbert was legally required to be registered as a contract carrier rather than as a private carrier; and Gilbert was <em>liable </em>for the acts of Cotton under the doctrine of nondelegable duty, respondeat superior and negligent hiring of an incompetent contractor. Consistent with the overwhelming majority of precedent, Anderson\u2019s opinions on these issues were inadmissible because they usurped the responsibility of the court to instruct the jury on the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">Further, Anderson\u2019s opinion that Gilbert was <em>liable </em>for Cotton\u2019s conduct was not admissible because it went beyond merely addressing an ultimate issue. Anderson\u2019s \u201cexpert opinion\u201d was nothing more than an attempt to direct the jury to the ultimate conclusion they should reach\u2014Gilbert must be held liable for damages suffered by plaintiffs as the result of decedent\u2019s death. This opinion is not helpful; it is an attempt by the witness to usurp the role of the jury in weighing the evidence and drawing the appropriate conclusions. Reading Anderson\u2019s testimony in its entirety, we conclude that he was <em>advocating, </em>not <em>testifying. </em>In essence, cloaked with the impressive mantle of \u201cexpert,\u201d Anderson made plaintiffs\u2019 closing argument from the witness stand. This is a misuse of expert witnesses, and renders his testimony inadmissible under Evidence Code section 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">4. <em>Prejudicial effect of Anderson\u2019s testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-9\">Having determined the court erred in permitting Anderson to testify on issues of law as well as to his opinion on how the case should ultimately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1186\">*1186</page-number>be resolved, the question remains whether Gilbert was prejudiced by the error. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].) Since the jury found Gilbert liable on the basis it had a nondelegable duty and because it had negligently hired an incompetent contractor, it is necessary to consider the prejudicial effect on each theory of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">Plaintiffs argue any error in admitting Anderson\u2019s opinion on nondelegable duty was obviated when the court determined the doctrine of nondelegable duty could apply to private carriers and submitted to the jury the issue of whether Cotton\u2019s activity posed an unreasonable risk of harm to others.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, the court\u2019s instructions on nondelegable duty fell far short of Anderson\u2019s opinions on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">The court instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-6\">\u201cYou\u2019ve heard some mention of private carriers, common carriers, contract carriers, nondelegable duty. Those are matters the Court had to rule on as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-7\">\u201cI\u2019ve ruled as a matter of law that Gilbert is a private carrier. And I\u2019ve also ruled that the rules about theories of liability dealing with nondelegable duty <em>can </em>apply to a private carrier.\u201d (Italics added.) The only other instruction which the court gave concerning Gilbert\u2019s nondelegable duty was the instruction provided by plaintiff:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-8\">\u201cAn individual or a corporation carrying on an activity which can be lawfully carried on only under a franchise granted by public authority and which involves an unreasonable risk of harm to others, is subject to liability for physical harm caused to such others by the negligence of a contractor employed to do work in carrying on the activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1020-9\">The court did not instruct the jury that even though Gilbert was a private carrier it should be considered to be operating under a franchise granted by public authority. Neither did the court explain how its instruction that private carriers <em>could </em>be held liable based on the existence of a nondelegable duty related to its instruction that holders of public franchises <em>were </em>liable based on a nondelegable duty. The only legal and logical connection between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1187\">*1187</page-number>two was Anderson\u2019s opinion on the subject.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the appearance the court abdicated its responsibility to instruct the jury on the law to the expert could not have not been stronger.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">Moreover, Anderson\u2019s repeated references to the illegality of the contracts between Cotton and Gilbert, the illegality of Gilbert hauling products while registered as a private carrier, and Gilbert\u2019s liability under the doctrine of nondelegable duty, created a real danger the jury was unduly swayed by his exhortations. Anderson not only attempted to fill the void left by the court when it failed to fully instruct on the applicable law, but also attempted to dictate the ultimate outcome of the case. We conclude, therefore, Anderson\u2019s pervasive testimony on the issue of nondelegable duty was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">The question remains, however, whether Anderson\u2019s opinion concerning Gilbert\u2019s liability under the theory it negligently hired and retained an incompetent contractor was also prejudicial. In resolving this issue, we first address plaintiffs\u2019 contention that Anderson\u2019s testimony bore only on the issue of Gilbert\u2019s nondelegable duty and did not go to Gilbert\u2019s liability under the theory that it was negligent in hiring an incompetent contractor. This argument denies reality.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">Notwithstanding the court\u2019s admonition that Anderson would not be allowed to testify as an expert on the negligent hiring of an incompetent contractor, he did just that. Further, on redirect examination, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel asked Anderson\u2019s opinion on whether Gilbert was liable based on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1188\">*1188</page-number>nondelegable duty <em>and </em>whether Gilbert was liable based on the negligent hiring of an incompetent contractor. Therefore, plaintiffs\u2019 argument that Anderson\u2019s testimony did not reach the latter issue is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">In order for plaintiffs to recover from Gilbert on the basis that it was negligent in hiring and retaining an incompetent contractor, they were required to prove, among other things, that Cotton was incompetent with respect to the operation of its trucking company. It also had to prove that Gilbert failed to exercise reasonable care in hiring and retaining Cotton. There was more than ample evidence to support the conclusion that Cotton was incompetent in the operation of its trucking company without reference to Anderson\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">At the time of the accident, Cotton was not in compliance with several of the safety programs mandated as a condition to being allowed to operate trucks on highways in California. Moreover, the person responsible for maintenance of Cotton\u2019s trucks, Marvin Cotton, did not even know these programs existed. Cotton had been cited on numerous occasions for having deficient brakes on its trucks prior to the date of the accident, and only half of the brakes on the truck that struck decedent were operable. Piggee testified that on one occasion \u201cmisadjusted\u201d brakes on a Cotton truck he was driving caused him to spin 360 degrees when he attempted to avoid hitting a car that pulled in front of him. Both Keller and Piggee testified the trailers used by Cotton were cracked, with popped rivets, so that corn would leak from them. In light of this evidence, we conclude that even if Anderson\u2019s testimony was excluded, there is no reasonable probability the jury would have found Cotton was competent to perform the job for which it was hired. However, the question of whether the jury would have found Gilbert did not exercise reasonable care in hiring and retaining Cotton absent Anderson\u2019s testimony is not so easily answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">All the employees and principals from Gilbert disavowed any actual knowledge of maintenance deficiencies or safety problems with Cotton\u2019s trucks. All the employees and officers of Cotton testified they never told anyone at Gilbert about any maintenance problems they were having or asked Gilbert\u2019s assistance in correcting any problems they had with their trucks. The only testimony tending to contradict this evidence was Piggee\u2019s statement that he recalled an employee identified only as \u201cJerry\u201d at one of Gilbert\u2019s facilities other than Berry Seed and Feed Company, referring to Cotton\u2019s trucks as \u201cjunk.\u201d Thus, the question of whether Gilbert was negligent in hiring and retaining Cotton turned on the extent of Gilbert\u2019s duty to inquire about Cotton\u2019s safety and maintenance history, and what information Gilbert could have learned had it exercised reasonable care in making inquiries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>Plaintiffs attempted to establish that Gilbert could have learned of Cotton\u2019s incompetence in the exercise of reasonable diligence in two ways. First, they attempted to establish that Gilbert had a firsthand opportunity to assess Cotton\u2019s maintenance and safety problems based on the apparent deficiencies in the trucks Cotton used. To this end, plaintiffs highlighted the number of times Cotton trucks hauled loads to Berry Seed and Feed Company in the months preceding the accident. They also presented evidence of the obvious problems with the truck driven by Comacho on the morning of the accident, i.e., duct tape on the brake line. Additionally, plaintiffs presented evidence through Piggee that on more than one occasion, Cotton\u2019s tracks had broken down while at Berry Seed and Feed Company and on one occasion the track he was driving had to be towed by another Cotton track driven by Marvin Cotton.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">Second, plaintiffs attempted to establish it was standard practice in the industry to make inquiries concerning the safety record of a contractor before it is hired to haul goods. To this end, plaintiffs called William Praetz, a retired California Highway Patrolman who ran a consulting firm, to testify concerning the custom and practice in the <em>trucking industry </em>when hiring a subhauler. Praetz testified it was the custom and practice in the industry \u201cfor a motor carrier to investigate the safety program and the operational criteria . . .\u201d of any subhauler it utilized. Praetz testified Gilbert should have requested a copy of Cotton\u2019s MISTER Report, and should have required Cotton to designate Gilbert as a third party on the pull notice program. This would have resulted in Gilbert receiving notice of the driving record of Cotton\u2019s drivers. Praetz opined that Gilbert\u2019s level of inquiry into Cotton\u2019s safety record was not acceptable, and that within the custom and practice of the industry, Gilbert should have known Cotton was an incompetent contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence of Gilbert\u2019s failure to exercise reasonable care in hiring and retaining Cotton did not go unrebutted. In contrast to Piggee\u2019s testimony, Marvin Cotton and Keller testified they never broke down while at Berry Seed and Feed Company. Additionally, Keller testified he never had any problems with the brakes on any of Cotton\u2019s tracks, including the one driven by Comacho on the day of the accident. Keller testified the hole in the air line for the brakes only happened on the morning of the accident and he placed the duct tape over it as a temporary repair. As stated above, no employee or officer of Gilbert testified they observed any defect in Cotton\u2019s tracks, did not experience any unreliability while using Cotton to haul its products, and were unaware of any safety violations or problems Cotton was suffering. Finally, both Maurice and Marvin Cotton testified that if anyone asked, they would have said Cotton was properly licensed to carry agricultural goods and complied with all safety and maintenance programs prescribed by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>During cross-examination Praetz admitted that even if Gilbert had requested a MISTER report on Cotton, it would not have revealed Cotton\u2019s violations prior to 1993 because the report did not exist since Cotton was not participating in the BIT program in 1993. Praetz conceded that prior to March 12, 1993, the PUC did not require proof that a carrier was participating in the BIT program. He also conceded the Vehicle Code does not require an entity such as Gilbert to check a carrier\u2019s PUC status, request a MISTER report, obtain copies of the carrier\u2019s pull notice program, or ensure the carrier participates in the BIT program, before retaining it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">Gilbert also called Ned Nuerge, as an expert on the industry standard for hiring independent carriers. Based on his experience as the owner of his own trucking firm from 1990 to 1993, Nuerge testified that in March 1993, the standard practice for a shipper hiring an independent carrier was to interview the carrier and verify it had the proper permits. Nuerge testified a shipper would normally only verify that the carrier had the proper permits when it was initially hired\u2014not on a recurring basis. He stated it was not the standard practice in the industry to verify a carrier\u2019s permits on an annual basis, check the Department of Motor Vehicles records of the carrier\u2019s drivers, order a MISTER Report, or check the carrier\u2019s maintenance report. Nuerge explained the term \u201csubhauling\u201d pertains to the situation where one trucking company agrees to haul freight for another trucking company. Nuerge opined that based on his experience, Gilbert was a milling company\u2014not a trucking company. He based his conclusion on the fact that Gilbert operated its trucks as a service to its customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">Thus, absent Anderson\u2019s opinions on the theory of negligent hiring, the evidence of Gilbert\u2019s liability on this theory was far from overwhelming. In reality, it presented a very close question of fact. We conclude Anderson\u2019s inadmissible opinions on Gilbert\u2019s liability and the legality of Gilbert\u2019s actions was so pervasive that it infected the entire proceeding. Given the nature of the conflicting evidence on whether Gilbert exercised reasonable care in hiring and retaining Cotton, we cannot say it was unlikely the admission of Anderson\u2019s opinion on the subject did not affect the verdict. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d at p. 836.) We find, therefore, that the erroneous introduction of this evidence on the issue of negligent hiring and retention constituted prejudicial error as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">II., III.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1025-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">The judgment is reversed.

J., and Buckley, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied March 3, 1999, and respondents\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied April 28, 1999.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b997-8\">After the accident Comacho disappeared and neither party was able to locate him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">\u201cIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\u201d (Fed.

This is a distinction without a difference. By its very nature, expert opinions encompass what the expert <em>believes. </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 argument is meritless.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1021-8\">When a court finds that a defendant has a nondelegable duty as a matter of law, the instruction given by the court should specifically inform the jurors of that fact and not leave them to speculate on the subject.
