J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqD\">This appeal addresses the question whether the plaintiff in a SLAPP suit (a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation) can, by the device of dismissing the SLAPP prior to a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the complaint, avoid paying the attorney\u2019s fees incurred by the defendant in defending the suit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the instant case, the appellant contends the respondents filed a SLAPP cross-complaint against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>her. The trial court ruled that because respondents had dismissed their cross-complaint prior to the hearing on appellant\u2019s section 425.16 motion to strike that pleading, there was no need to decide the merits of that motion to strike. The trial court concluded that because appellant could not be said to be the prevailing party on her motion to strike, she was not entitled to section 425.16 attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The basis of the court\u2019s conclusion is the provision in the anti-SLAPP statute which provides that attorney\u2019s fees and costs are awarded to a defendant who prevails on a motion to strike. (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">We hold the trial court\u2019s ruling constitutes a nullification of an important part of California\u2019s anti-SLAPP legislation. If indeed respondents\u2019 cross-complaint against appellant is a SLAPP suit, then the court\u2019s decision to not hear the merits of appellant\u2019s motion to strike deprives appellant of the monetary relief which the Legislature intended to give her, while at the same time it relieves respondents of the punishment which section 425.16 imposes on persons who use the courts to chill others\u2019 exercise of their constitutional rights. We therefore reverse the trial court\u2019s order denying appellant attorney\u2019s fees and costs, and remand the case for further proceedings on the issue of the merits of appellant\u2019s motion to strike and, depending on the ruling thereon, her request for fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">This case had its beginning when Stefan Ashkenazy (Ashkenazy) sued Hong Liu (Liu) and Master Hong Alternative Healing (Alternative Healing; collectively, defendants). Alternative Healing is apparently a health care facility run by Liu. In his complaint, Ashkenazy alleged personal injuries connected with defendants\u2019 provision of health care services to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>In February 1997, defendants filed a third party cross-complaint against appellant Deborah Moore (Moore) and others. In that pleading the defendants alleged causes of action against Moore for breach of fiduciary duty, intentional and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage, indemnity, apportionment of fault, and declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">After being served with defendants\u2019 cross-complaint, Moore moved to strike it, contending it was a SLAPP suit. According to a declaration filed by Moore in support of her motion to strike, she had been employed, as a processor of medical bills, by the medical doctor with whom defendants shared office space, one Kwang Young (Young). During the course of her employment by Young she reported, to governmental agencies, irregularities in his Medicare and insurance company billing. She also notified these agencies that Liu was holding himself out as a medical doctor when he was not licensed as such, and that Young was engaging in the falsification and destruction of patients\u2019 medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Defendants did not submit opposition to Moore\u2019s motion to strike. Rather, in July 1997, prior to the hearing on that motion, defendants filed a request to have their cross-complaint dismissed as to Moore only. The dismissal was without prejudice. No hearing was ever held on Moore\u2019s motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Thereafter, Moore filed a motion, under subdivision (c) of section 425.16, seeking attorney\u2019s fees and costs from defendants. In September 1997, the trial court denied the motion, saying Moore does not fit within the specific language of subdivision (c). Subdivision (c) states that fees and costs are to be awarded to \u201ca prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike.\u201d The court reasoned there was no longer a viable motion to strike, because of the dismissal of Moore from the cross-complaint, and therefore Moore could not be a prevailing party on such a motion. The court ruled that if Moore wanted attorney\u2019s fees, she should have made a motion for them under section 128.7.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>Issues on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Moore\u2019s appeal raises the question whether a SLAPP plaintiff can avoid payment of the SLAPP defendant\u2019s section 425.16 fees and costs by dismissing that defendant from the case prior to a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the SLAPP complaint. Moore also raises two other issues. First, was she entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under sections 1032 and 1033.5 when the cross-complaint against her was dismissed and, second, is she entitled to attorney\u2019s fees for prevailing in this appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">1. <em>Moore Has a Right to Have Her Section 425.16 Motion Heard</em></p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">The purpose of section 425.16 is clearly to give relief, including financial relief in the form of attorney\u2019s fees and costs, to persons who have been victimized by meritless, retaliatory SLAPP lawsuits because of their \u201cparticipation in matters of public significance\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (a)). Under the trial court\u2019s reasoning, a defendant in a SLAPP suit who has been dismissed from that suit after filing a section 425.16 motion to strike, must jump through an additional hoop to obtain attorney\u2019s fees and costs\u2014a motion under section 128.7\u2014even though section 425.16 already provides for an award of those expenses. Such a requirement, even if it were workable (which, as discussed below, it is not), would prolong both the defendant\u2019s predicament and the plaintiff\u2019s outrageous behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">Section 128.7 is not a viable alternative to the attorney\u2019s fees and costs relief afforded by section 425.16. First, under subdivision (c) (1) of section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>128.7 (see fn. 2, <em>ante), </em>a SLAPP defendant cannot even file a section 128.7 motion with the court if the plaintiff has, within 30 days of being served with such motion, dismissed the defendant from the suit, since the dismissal has the effect of withdrawing the challenged complaint. Second, whereas section 425.16 <em>requires </em>the court to award fees and costs to a defendant who prevails on a motion to strike brought under that section, section 128.7 gives the court discretion as to what, if any, sanction it will impose on a litigant. (\u00a7 128.7, subds. (c)(1) &amp; (d).) Thus under section 128.7, it is possible for the plaintiff in a SLAPP suit to file its meritless complaint with impunity by simply dismissing the SLAPP defendant within 30 days of being served with a section 128.7 motion. A reading of section 425.16 clearly shows that the Legislature envisioned <em>actual relief </em>for SLAPP defendants when it drafted that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">We conclude the trial court\u2019s decision works a nullification of an important provision of section 425.16. We hold that a defendant who is voluntarily dismissed, with or without prejudice, after filing a section 425.16 motion to strike, is nevertheless entitled to have the merits of such motion heard as a predicate to a determination of the defendant\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs under subdivision (c) of that section. Therefore, the order denying Moore\u2019s motion for fees and costs must be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings on Moore\u2019s motion to strike.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">2. <em>Coltrain v. Shewalter Does Not Require a Different Result</em></p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\"><em>Coltrain </em>v. <em>Shewalter </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 94 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 600] (Coltrain) also grappled with the issue of a defendant\u2019s section 425.16 claim to fees and costs when the plaintiff has dismissed its suit prior to the hearing on the defendant\u2019s section 425.16 motion to strike the complaint. <em>Coltrain </em>held th\u00e1t in such a situation, \u201cthe trial court has discretion to determine whether the defendant is the prevailing party for purposes of attorney\u2019s fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (c).\u201d (66 Cal.App.4th at p. 107.) \u201cIn making that determination,\u201d said the <em>Coltrain </em>court, \u201c. . . the critical issue is which party realized its objectives in the litigation. Since the defendant\u2019s goal is to make the plaintiff go away with its tail between its legs, ordinarily the prevailing party will be the defendant. The plaintiff, however, may try to show it actually dismissed because it had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>substantially achieved its goals through a settlement or other means, because the defendant was insolvent, or for other reasons unrelated to the probability of success on the merits.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court stated that \u201cregardless of whether the action is a SLAPP suit or not, the plaintiff may have good-faith reasons for the dismissal that have nothing to do with oppressing the defendant or avoiding liability for attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">We respectfully disagree with Coltrain\u2019s reasoning on this point. To begin with, if the plaintiff in a SLAPP suit \u201csubstantially achieved its goals through a settlement or other means,\u201d then the plaintiff succeeded in \u201cchill[ing] the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (a)), since that is the purpose of a SLAPP suit. Also, in a SLAPP, it is quite possible that the plaintiff is not worried the defendant might be insolvent, since the focus of the SLAPP is to chill speech and/or the petitioning of government, not necessarily to line the plaintiff\u2019s pockets with the defendant\u2019s money.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Moreover, section 425.16 specifically provides for attorney\u2019s fees and costs (1) to a defendant, if the defendant prevails on a motion to strike, and (2) to a plaintiff, if it can be said that the defendant\u2019s motion to strike \u201cis frivolous or is solely intended to cause unnecessary delay\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (c)). Under the terms of subdivision (c), the critical issue is the merits of the defendant\u2019s motion to strike. This is as it should be. Persons who threaten the exercise of another\u2019s constitutional rights to speak freely and petition for the redress of grievances should be adjudicated to have done so, not permitted to avoid the consequences of their actions by dismissal of the SLAPP suit when a defendant challenges it. An adjudication in favor of the defendant on the merits of the defendant\u2019s motion to strike provides both financial relief in the form of fees and costs, as well as a vindication of society\u2019s constitutional interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Therefore, the trial court\u2019s adjudication of the merits of a defendant\u2019s motion to strike is an essential predicate to ruling on the defendant\u2019s request for an award of fees and costs. An award of these expenses under section 425.16 is only justified when a defendant demonstrates that plaintiff\u2019s action falls within the provisions of subdivision (b) and the plaintiff is unable to establish a reasonable probability of success. <em>(Church of Scientology </em>v. <em>Wollersheim </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 628, 653-655 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 620].) Until a court determines that these circumstances exist, a moving defendant is not entitled to its fees and costs under section 425.16. If such a judicial determination were not first required, and a fair procedural opportunity to obtain it allowed, then a plaintiff\u2019s voluntary dismissal of the action could have the effect of (1) depriving a true SLAPP defendant of statutorily authorized fees, or (2) entitling a defendant to such relief in a non-SLAPP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>action which was dismissed by the plaintiff for entirely legitimate reasons. In both situations, the purpose of the statute\u2019s remedial provisions would be frustrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Thus, we do agree with the <em>Coltrain </em>court\u2019s conclusion that a plaintiff\u2019s voluntary dismissal of a suit, after a section 425.16 motion to strike has been filed, neither automatically precludes a court from awarding a defendant attorney\u2019s fees and costs under that section, nor automatically requires such an award. The <em>Coltrain </em>court observed that if the former result were true, \u201cSLAPP plaintiffs could achieve most of their objective with little risk\u2014by filing a SLAPP suit, forcing the defendant to incur the effort and expense of preparing a special motion to strike, then dismissing the action without prejudice. The specter of the action being refiled (at least until the statute of limitations had run) would continue to have a significant chilling effect on the defendant\u2019s exercise of its First Amendment rights. At that point, the plaintiff would have accomplished all the wrongdoing that triggers the defendant\u2019s eligibility for attorney\u2019s fees, but the defendant would be cheated of redress. [\u00cd0 On the other hand, these policies likewise do not support [the argument] that a voluntary dismissal while a special motion to strike is pending should automatically entitle a defendant to attorney\u2019s fees. At that point, there has been no judicial determination that the action is in fact a SLAPP suit.\u201d <em>(Coltrain, supra, 66 </em>Cal.App.4th at pp. 106-107, italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">3. <em>Moore Was Not Entitled to Attorney\u2019s Fees Under Sections 1032 and 1033.5</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">Moore\u2019s alternative argument asserts the trial court should have awarded her attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to sections 1032 and 1033.5 when the defendants dismissed their cross-complaint against her. Her analysis is as follows. First, subdivision (a)(4) of section 1032 provides that as used in that section, the term \u201cprevailing party\u201d includes, among other litigants, \u201ca defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered,\u201d and Moore is therefore a prevailing party for purposes of section 1032. Second, subdivision (b) of section 1032 states: \u201cExcept as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding,\u201d and therefore Moore, as a prevailing party, is entitled to recover costs in defendants\u2019 cross-complaint suit against her. Third, under section 1033.5, subdivision (a)(10)(B), attorney\u2019s fees are deemed to be costs if authorized by contract, <em>statute, </em>or law. Fourth, section 425.16 is a statute which authorizes attorney\u2019s fees. Fifth, Moore is therefore entitled to section 425.16 attorney\u2019s fees as an item of costs because she is the prevailing party since this suit against her was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">Moore\u2019s analysis is flawed because while section 425.16 does authorize attorney\u2019s fees, it specifically states the defendant only receives such fees if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>the defendant prevails <em>on the motion to strike. </em>Thus, a dismissed defendant\u2019s receipt of attorney\u2019s fees under section 425.16 is grounded on the defendant having prevailed on her motion to strike, not on her having been dismissed from a SLAPP suit. Therefore, attorney\u2019s fees are not automatic under section 1032 if a defendant is dismissed from what she contends is a SLAPP suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">This result is in keeping with the stated purpose of section 425.16. That is, it is entirely possible that a plaintiff who is served with a section 425.16 motion to strike actually filed a <em>legitimate suit, </em>not a SLAPP. Permitting the defendant in such a suit to recover attorney\u2019s fees under section 1032 merely because the plaintiff dismissed the action would not further the Legislature\u2019s intent of discouraging true SLAPP plaintiffs. However, we note that while a defendant who is dismissed from what is judicially determined to be a non-SLAPP lawsuit may not recover attorney\u2019s fees under sections 1032 and 1033.5, such a defendant is nonetheless a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under section 1032 for purposes of recovering <em>applicable </em>costs under section 1033.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">4. <em>It Is Yet to Be Determined Whether Moore Is Entitled to Attorney\u2019s Fees for Prevailing in This Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">Lastly, we address Moore\u2019s contention that she is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees for prevailing in this appeal. Moore cites <em>Church of Scientology </em>v. <em>Wollersheim, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th at pages 659-660 to support her position. However, that case is distinguishable on its procedural facts because when the appeal was filed therein, the defendant had already been judicially determined, in the trial court, to be the victim of a SLAPP suit. The reviewing court affirmed the trial court\u2019s determination and also awarded the defendant attorney\u2019s fees on appeal. In awarding such fees, it applied the rule that when a statute authorizes a trial court to award attorney\u2019s fees, the statute also permits an award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees unless the statute-specifically provides otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">Section 425.16 does not prohibit an award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees. However, it specifically states that a defendant is only entitled to attorney\u2019s fees if he or she prevails on the motion to strike the complaint. Therefore, if Moore prevails on her motion to strike, upon our remand of this case for hearing on that motion, the trial court shall award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to her for her trial court efforts (both before and after this appeal), and her efforts in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">At this stage of the proceedings, however, Moore finds herself in a situation which is similar to that of a litigant who has succeeded in securing the reversal of a summary judgment on appeal. In such a case, attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>fees are not awardable to the litigant at that time under section 1021.5 (the private attorney general statute) or under Civil Code section 1717 (providing for reciprocal contractual attorney\u2019s fees). Rather, the issue of the right to attorney\u2019s fees for the successful appeal is deferred until the final resolution of the merits of the case. <em>(Urbaniak </em>v. <em>Newton </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1837, 1844-1845 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 333] [private attorney general statute]; <em>Presley of Southern California </em>v. <em>Whelan </em>(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 959 [196 Cal.Rptr. 1] [Civ. Code, \u00a7 1717 fees]; accord, <em>Lindenstadt </em>v. <em>Staff Builders, Inc. </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 882, 894, fn. 9 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 484] [binding arbitration agreement calling for attorney\u2019s fees to party prevailing in arbitration].) Thus, under these statutes, including section 425.16, while Moore may ultimately be entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees, an award for this <em>interim </em>appellate success would be premature. Of course, Moore is entitled to her other appellate costs, under section 1034 and California Rules of Court, rule 26, because such costs do not depend on her status as the prevailing party on the motion to strike, but rather on her having prevailed in this appeal. However, as already noted, if Moore is ultimately determined to be the prevailing party on her motion, any award of attorney\u2019s fees under section 425.16, subdivision (c), shall also include the fees incurred in prosecuting this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The order denying Moore\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Costs on appeal to Moore.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Kitching, J., and Aldrich, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied February 22, 1999.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b707-9\">Legislation regarding SLAPP suits is found in Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, a statute specifically enacted to give both a summary disposition and attorney\u2019s fees and costs to persons named as defendants in such actions.
