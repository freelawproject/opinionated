(hereafter Doctor\u2019s) is a now-defunct firm which formerly provided doctors with laboratory analysis of specimens of blood, urine, and the like. A large portion of Doctor\u2019s income was derived from Medi-Cal patients. Medi-Cal is a State of California program to subsidize medical care for the poor and indigent. Doctor\u2019s brought this action to compel respondent Connell, Controller of California, to release approximately $3 million which Doctor\u2019s claimed was due for services to Medi-Cal patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">Medi-Cal payments to patients are funded with federal moneys provided under the Medicaid legislation. To obtain federal moneys the states must comply with the federal statutory and regulatory requirements of Medicaid. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>(42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a); <em>Wilder </em>v. <em>Virginia Hospital Assn. </em>(1990) 496 U.S. 498, 502 [110 S.Ct. 2510, 2513-2514, 110 L.Ed.2d 455].)</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Federal law specifies that a state <em>must designate a single agency </em>to administer its Medicaid plan (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(5)), and further, forbids the designated agency from delegating, except to its own officials, authority to exercise discretion in administering the plan. (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 431.10(e)(1)-(3) (1998).) Federal regulations permit the designated agency to use services of other state agencies, but <em>not to delegate administrative discretion </em>to such agencies: \u201cIf other State . . . agencies or offices perform services for the Medicaid agency, they must not have the authority to change or disapprove any administrative decision of that agency, or otherwise substitute their judgment for that of the Medicaid agency with respect to the application of policies, rules, and regulations issued by the Medicaid agency.\u201d (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 431.10(e)(3) (1998).)</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">In addition to the single agency and nondelegation requirements, federal law requires states participating in Medicaid to establish procedures to investigate abuses while protecting providers. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396a(a)(3), (a)(42); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 447.200, 447.202, 455.12-23 (1998).) Carrying out these requirements, California\u2019s Welfare and Institutions Code requires DHS to have an administrative appeals process \u201cto review grievances or complaints arising from the findings of an audit or examination . . . .\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 14171, subd. (a).) California regulations state that \u201c[a] provider may request a hearing ... to examine.any disputed audit or examination finding which results in an adjustment to Medi-Cal program reimbursement . . . .\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \u00a7 51017.) DHS cannot recoup alleged overpayments to a provider until the administrative appeals process is complete, absent special circumstances not present in this case. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \u00a7\u00a7 51017, 51047, subd. (a); Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 14170.5, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">California\u2019s Medicaid plan, submitted in 1993, certified to the federal government that California\u2019s Department of Health Services is the single agency which administers Medi-Cal. A DHS organization chart submitted with California\u2019s plan identified a \u201cFiscal Intermediary Management Division\u201d of DHS. An accompanying description of the Fiscal Intermediary Management Division stated that its provider services section was responsible for all contacts between providers and the state concerning payments, and that its on-site management branch was responsible for audits and reviews concerning accurate payments of claims. The Medi-Cal organization chart also identified an audits and investigations division, whose responsibilities were described in the plan to include identifying excess payments to medical service providers, and taking corrective action.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>DHS contracted with a private entity, called EDS, to review and process provider claims for payment for services rendered to Medi-Cal patients. Federal regulations permit the contracting-out of this function to a private concern. (42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7434.4-434.10 (1998); Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 14000.3, 14104.3, subd. (a), 14105; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \u00a7\u00a7 50007, 51529.) EDS reviews the claims, determines the amount owed, approves the claim, and submits it to respondent Controller for issuance of a check or \u201cwarrant\u201d to the provider.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">Until mid-1997 the Controller\u2019s services to DHS for Medi-Cal were apparently limited to issuing checks, a nondiscretionary activity. In June 1997 DHS entered an interagency agreement with the Controller under which the Controller agreed to perform audits to identify overpayments to providers, and to take corrective action, presumably withholding sums believed to constitute overpayment. The agreement stated that \u201cDHS will review all reports of overpayments identified by [Controller] for policy and/or procedural implications.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">In late November 1997 Doctor\u2019s filed the present suit seeking, inter alia, a writ of mandate compelling the Controller to pay Doctor\u2019s approximately $3 million allegedly earned and owed for services to Medi-Cal patients. Doctor\u2019s alleged that in September 1997, without notice to Doctor\u2019s, the Controller commenced withholding payments due Doctor\u2019s and already approved for payment by EDS. Doctor\u2019s urged that DHS had unlawfully delegated its Medi-Cal powers to the- Controller, and that the Controller had violated the administrative procedures for dealing with overpayments. Doctor\u2019s further claimed that the Controller\u2019s refusal to pay the claims had driven Doctor\u2019s out of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">In response to Doctor\u2019s suit, the Controller contended that she was justified in withholding payments because Doctor\u2019s claims contained insufficient information concerning services provided, and reflected unusually high claims amounts for the services provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">The trial court rejected Doctor\u2019s claim that DHS had illegally delegated audit and overpayment remedial functions to the Controller. However, the trial court found that the Controller was obliged under Government Code section 926.15, subdivision (a), to pay provider claims approved by EDS, less contested amounts, within 30 days after receipt. It granted a writ of mandate ordering the Controller to comply with section 926.15, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">Both sides appealed from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">As a preliminary matter, we reject the Controller\u2019s argument that Doctor\u2019s lacks standing to. bring the present claims. The Controller relies on <em>Sobky </em>v. <em>Smoley </em>(E.D. Cal. 1994) 855 F.Supp. 1123, a federal case holding that methadone recipients and providers lack standing under 42 United States Code section 1983 to enforce the \u201csingle state agency\u201d requirement of Medicaid law, because that requirement benefits them only indirectly (through more efficient administration of Medicaid). However Doctor\u2019s sued here for a writ of mandate, made available under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1085. While section 1983 of 42 United States Code requires violation of a private right, privilege, or immunity to confer standing, section 1085 of the California Code of Civil Procedure creates a broad right to issuance of a writ of mandate \u201cto compel performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins.\u201d Section 1085 \u201cis available not only to those who have enforceable private rights, but to those who are \u2018beneficially interested\u2019 parties within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 1086.\u201d <em>(California Homeless &amp; Housing Coalition </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 450, 458 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 639] [per Chin, J., homeless coalition has standing despite <em>Sobky </em>rule to seek mandamus compelling state agency to comply with federal AFDC law].)</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Doctor\u2019s is a \u201cbeneficially interested party\u201d and has standing to pursue its action in mandamus against the Controller.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">We turn to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">State participation in Medicaid is voluntary, but once a state elects to participate and receive federal funds, it is obliged to fully comply with federal statutes and regulations. <em>(Frank </em>v. <em>Kizer </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 919, 923 [261 Cal.Rptr. 882].)</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">As noted above, federal Medicaid statutes and regulations require designation of a single state agency to administer a state\u2019s Medicaid program, and further, forbid delegation of the agency\u2019s power to make administrative judgments or decisions about the application of the agency\u2019s policies, rules and regulations. Consistent with these provisions, California\u2019s Medi-Cal plan affirmed compliance with the single agency requirement and stated that auditing of provider claims and recapture of overpayments would be done by DHS.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">The interagency agreement, however, authorized the <em>Controller </em>to audit provider claims and \u201ctake corrective action.\u201d Delegation of these powers to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>the Controller was contrary to DHS\u2019s representation to the federal government (in DHS\u2019s Medicaid plan) that <em>audits and corrective action would be DHS\u2019s province. </em>Further, the authority extended to the Controller to \u201ctake corrective action\u201d was authority to change or disapprove prior decisions by DHS\u2019s agent (EDS) to pay provider claims. This transfer of authority from DHS to the Controller violated the federal statutory and regulatory bar on delegation by the \u201csingle designated agency\u201d of discretionary authority. It improperly empowered the Controller to \u201cchange or disapprove\u201d administrative decisions by DHS and its agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">The interagency agreement\u2019s recitation that \u201cDHS will review all reports of overpayments identified by [Controller] for policy and/or procedural implications\u201d does not save the delegation of authority from violating federal law. The express ban on delegating discretionary power contains no exception permitting delegation so long as decisions are later \u201creviewed\u201d (in some unspecified manner) by the designated \u201csingle agency.\u201d The bar to delegation of discretionary power would be easily circumvented if such a provision in an interagency agreement were given effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">The Controller could not lawfully exercise power to audit provider payments and withhold alleged excesses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">The Controller argues that she has an independent duty under California law to supervise payments from the treasury of California. While this is generally true, California modified this duty with respect to Medi-Cal payments by accepting federal moneys and agreeing to be bound by federal laws requiring designation of a single California agency to administer those payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">Neither side has cited legislative history or case law discussing the legislative and regulatory reasons for the single agency and nondelegation rules. But the circumstances of the present case suggest some of these reasons. First, such rules, if adhered to, avoid the delay entailed when several state agencies in succession review claims before payment is made. Here, DHS\u2019s agent, EDS, approved the claims, but then the Controller held them up. Second, the rules offer a degree of assurance that state agencies reviewing provider claims will have knowledge and expertise concerning medical expense claims and the peculiar rules and regulations which govern Medicaid claims. By contrast, a nonspecialized agency such as the Controller, newly embarked on the business of reviewing medical provider claims, might well lack the expertise needed for prompt, fair review.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>And of course, prompt, knowledgeable, fair review and payment of provider claims are essential to the basic statutory purpose to provide medical care to the indigent and elderly. Private providers will soon be discouraged from offering Medicaid services if they are not paid promptly and fairly for their services. Indeed, providers will not be <em>able </em>to provide such services if they go out of business because the state improperly withholds payments \u2014as Doctor\u2019s alleges occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">In accordance with the foregoing, we will modify the trial court\u2019s judgment to require that the Controller release all sums which EDS has approved for payment to Doctor\u2019s, without prejudice to subsequent audits and claims for overpayment by DHS, in compliance with the governing rules and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">The judgment of the trial court is modified to require Controller to forthwith pay to Doctor\u2019s all amounts approved for payment by the Department of Health Service\u2019s fiscal intermediary, EDS. As so modified, the judgment is affirmed. Plaintiff and appellant shall recover its costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">Lillie, P. J., and Johnson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied March 3, 1999, and the petition of defendant and appellant for review by the Supreme Court was denied May 26, 1999. Kennard, J., and Brown, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b819-8\">While it is not controlling precedent, we note that the federal District Court for the Central District of California reached the same conclusion as we do, on the same reasoning, in its unpublished decision filed April 9, 1998, in <em>Health Line Clinical Laboratory, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connell </em>(U.S. Dist.Ct. (C.D.Cal.)) No. CV-98-1620-RJK.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
