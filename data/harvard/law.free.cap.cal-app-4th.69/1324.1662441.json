J.</author>\n<p id=\"AY5\">Custodio Garcia, defendant, was one of four perpetrators involved in a home invasion. Two of his accomplices were shot and killed by the victim of the home invasion. Defendant submitted his case to the trial court based on the preliminary hearing transcript. The trial court found defendant guilty of conspiracy to commit robbery, burglary, and murder. Pursuant to a prior stipulation between the parties, the murder was reduced to involuntary manslaughter. Defendant appeals, claiming he was improperly convicted of the provocative act murder of his accomplice because: (1) there was no provocative act, (2) his guilt cannot be based on the provocative act of a deceased accomplice, even though that accomplice is not the one alleged in the information as the murder victim, and (3) the murder victim himself committed a provocative act which was the sole cause of his death, thus absolving defendant of legal culpability. In addition, defendant claims the evidence is insufficient to support his other convictions and the trial court erred in imposing the upper term for the burglary conviction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-6\">Facts and Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-7\">Defendant, Adrian Alvarez, Nemecio Quezada, and one other individual went to the apartment of Narcisio Pena at approximately 4:00 a.m. Pena was asleep in one of the two upstairs bedrooms with his girlfriend when the four men broke down the front door with a sledgehammer. All four men went upstairs. Pena heard a loud noise and heard footsteps running up the stairs. He grabbed his .38-caliber pistol. Pena opened the bedroom door slightly to see what was going on, and he saw three or four men in the upstairs hallway of his apartment. Pena tried to close the bedroom door; the men rushed the door and tried to push it open. While Pena was attempting to close the door, someone fired a round into the bedroom. Pena saw the muzzle flash and heard the shot. Pena fired several rounds back and managed to shut the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-8\">Pena heard some noise and opened the door again. He saw an individual run out of the other upstairs bedroom, across the hall, and toward the stairs. This individual pointed a gun at Pena. Pena fired again. Pena shut the bedroom door and his girlfriend called 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-9\">Police arrived. The body of Quezada was outside of Pena\u2019s apartment. A .40-caliber Smith &amp; Wesson gun was found next to his body. The doorjamb of Pena\u2019s front door had been broken away. A sledgehammer, not belonging to Pena, was downstairs on the kitchen floor, wrapped in a towel. The body of Alvarez was found at the foot of the stairs. A nine-millimeter handgun was next to his body. The gun was loaded with a live round in the chamber.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1328\">*1328</page-number>A .40-caliber bullet was found in the ceiling above the bed in Pena\u2019s bedroom. The bullet had been fired somewhere from a zero- to 45-degree angle. Five .38-caliber casings were found in the apartment\u2014four upstairs and one downstairs. One .40-caliber casing was found downstairs. No 9-millimeter casings were found. Several unidentifiable bullet fragments were found in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-4\">Quezada and Alvarez were each killed by a single gunshot wound. The bullets retrieved from their bodies were .38-caliber bullets. Quezada had a significant amount of methamphetamine in his body when he died.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-5\">Officers found approximately $2,000 in five locations in Pena\u2019s bedroom. In addition, a car parked outside Pena\u2019s apartment, belonging to Pena, had been modified by placing a hidden compartment in the backseat.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-6\">Following the preliminary hearing, defendant was held to answer on charges of murder of Alvarez, conspiracy to commit robbery, and burglary. In addition, it was alleged as to all counts that defendant was armed with a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-7\">Defendant filed a Penal Code section 995 motion to dismiss, claiming he could not be found guilty of murder based on the provocative act theory of murder. The motion was denied. Defendant sought writ review in this court in <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Dec. 30, 1996) F027395 (nonpub. opn.). His petition was denied. Defendant\u2019s case was set for trial. The People filed a petition for writ of mandate in this court, challenging a portion of the jury instruction the court had determined it was going to give. This court, by written opinion, issued the peremptory writ of mandate requiring a modification of the trial court\u2019s intended jury instruction regarding the provocative act theory of murder. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Garcia) (Mar. 19, 1997) F027797 [nonpub. opn.].) We grant the motions of both parties that we take judicial notice of our previous opinion in No. F027797. (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 452 &amp; 453.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-8\">After the case was returned to superior court, the parties agreed that defendant would submit the case to a trial before the court utilizing the preliminary hearing transcript. It was further stipulated that if the court found defendant guilty of all counts and enhancements, the murder count would, in the interests of justice, be reduced to involuntary manslaughter and defendant would receive a maximum sentence of seven years in prison. It was also agreed that defendant could challenge the application of the provocative act theory of murder on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-9\">The court found all counts to be true beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court sentenced defendant to the upper term of six years for the burglary, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1329\">*1329</page-number>plus one year for the arming allegation. The conspiracy to commit robbery sentence was stayed and the involuntary manslaughter sentence was ordered to run concurrently. Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-7\">(a) <em>Was there a provocative act?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1131-8\">The \u201cWashington-Gilbert\"<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or provocative act theory of murder is invoked when a victim or police officer has killed a felon.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To qualify as a provocative act under the provocative act theory of murder, the conduct of the felon must be sufficiently provocative of lethal response to support a finding of implied malice. <em>(Taylor </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 578, 583 [91 Cal.Rptr. 275, <em>477 </em>P.2d 131].) \u201c[M]ere participation in an armed robbery is not sufficient to invoke murder liability, direct or vicarious, when the victim resists and kills.\u201d <em>(In re Joe R. </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 496, 504 [165 Cal.Rptr. 837, 612 P.2d 927].) The life-threatening acts must be other than those implicit in the crime of armed robbery. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 503.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1131-9\">Defendant claims that Quezada\u2019s act of discharging a handgun into the ceiling was not life threatening. He argues that Quezada\u2019s act was inherent in the underlying crime and was not beyond that necessary to commit the robbery. Therefore, defendant contends, there was no provocative act to support the provocative act theory of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-10\">It has been repeatedly noted that \u201ca person who initiates a gun battle in the course of committing a felony intentionally and with a conscious disregard for life commits an act that is likely to cause death.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Antick </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 79, 91 [123 Cal.Rptr. 475, 539 P.2d 43].) \u201c[A] gun battle can be initiated by acts of provocation falling short of firing the first shot.\u201d <em>(Taylor </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1330\">*1330</page-number>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d at p. 584.) Circumstances \u201c \u2018fraught with grave and inherent danger to human life\u2019 \u201d are sufficient to raise an inference of malice. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1132-4\">Here, Quezada fired a gun into an occupied bedroom. Although the bullet ended up in the ceiling, this does not diminish the gravity of the act. First, the fact that the bullet wound up in the ceiling does not necessarily prove that this was where the gun was intentionally aimed. During the struggle at the door the gun may have been jostled, causing it to be fired in a direction other than where it was intended. Also, the evidence shows the bullet likely entered the ceiling at an angle; thus, the fact that it ended up in the ceiling does not mean that before it entered the ceiling it did not travel through a part of the room where it could endanger human life. Furthermore, Pena probably was not aware that the bullet was headed toward the ceiling and merely knew that the room he was occupying with his girlfriend had been fired upon. The gun battle was initiated when Quezada fired his .40-caliber gun into the room occupied by Pena and his girlfriend. This act was not inherent in armed robbery and was an act done with a conscious disregard for life. There was substantial evidence of a provocative act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-5\">(b) <em>Can defendant\u2019s conviction be based on the provocative act of a deceased accomplice who is not the alleged murder victim?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1132-7\">Defendant cites the general rule that the provocative conduct of a criminal actor who is killed by the victim cannot form the basis for a murder for which his accomplices can be held responsible. And defendant asserts that if Quezada\u2019s act was a provocative act, any provocative act he committed is irrelevant because he died.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-8\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Antick, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 79, the defendant and his accomplice, Bose, burglarized a home. Later, officers approached a car suspected to have been used in the burglary. Bose was seated in the driver\u2019s seat. The defendant was not in the car; he was nearby outside a house. Bose was ordered out of the car and the officer saw a revolver on the seat of the car. The officer drew his gun and ordered Bose to put his hands on the hood of the car; the defendant approached the car. Bose pulled a second gun from his waist area and fired at the officer. The officer fired at Bose. Bose ran. Another officer ordered Bose to stop. When he did not, the second officer fired, killing Bose. The defendant was convicted of the murder of Bose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-9\">The Supreme Court reversed the defendant\u2019s murder conviction. Although Bose\u2019s conduct in initiating the gun battle may have established the requisite malice, Bose\u2019s conduct (provocative act) did not result in the unlawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1331\">*1331</page-number>killing of another human being, but resulted in Bose\u2019s death. Because Bose could not be guilty of murder in connection with his own death, \u201c. . . it is impossible to base defendant\u2019s liability for this offense upon his vicarious responsibility for the crime of his accomplice.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Antick, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 91.) The defendant was not guilty of murder because he \u201cwas convicted of murder based upon his vicarious liability for the acts of an accomplice who could not himself have been found guilty of that offense.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 92.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-5\">It is from this holding in <em>Antick </em>the courts have stated repeatedly that to prove the provocative act theory it must be shown that the defendant or a surviving accomplice committed a life-threatening act beyond that necessary to commit the robbery. <em>(People v. White, supra, </em>35 Cal.App.4th at p. 764.) Although this component refers to a surviving accomplice, this reference is meant to exclude liability when the deceased provocateur accomplice is the sole cause of his death and is the accomplice whom defendant is charged with murdering.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-6\">Here, although Quezada is deceased, defendant is not charged with Quezada\u2019s death; he is charged with Alvarez\u2019s death. Quezada\u2019s act resulted in the unlawful killing of another human being, Alvarez. Because Quezada, if he had survived, could have been found guilty of the murder of another human being, Alvarez, defendant\u2019s liability is based upon defendant\u2019s vicarious responsibility for the crime of his accomplice, Quezada. The circumstance that Quezada also died should not reduce defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, the surviving accomplice phrase, so often repeated, is meant to exclude a defendant from being charged with the murder of a sole provocateur; it was not formulated to preclude liability when a provocateur-accomplice does an act that results in the unlawful killing of <em>another </em>human being. \u201cIt is only in cases like <em>Antick, </em>where the defendant\u2019s responsibility for murder is based on his vicarious liability for the acts of an accomplice <em>who could not himself have been guilty of the offense </em>that liability will not lie.\u201d <em>(People v. Superior Court </em>(Shamis) (1998) 58 Cal.App.4th 833, 845 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 388].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-7\">(c) <em>Was the provocative act of the murder victim the sole cause of his death?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1133-9\">Defendant\u2019s final argument regarding the provocative act theory is that Pena shot at Alvarez in response to Alvarez\u2019s aiming of a gun at Pena. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1332\">*1332</page-number>Thus, contends defendant, Alvarez was the sole cause of his own death. The argument follows that under the law of <em>Antick, </em>because Alvarez cannot be criminally liable for his own death, defendant cannot be liable under a theory of vicarious responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-4\">In the previous writ petition before this court <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Garcia), supra, </em>F027797), the People claimed that the proposed instruction by the trial court was erroneous. This instruction provided in part: \u201cIn order to prove this crime [of murder], each of the following elements must be proved: ffl] . . . flQ 5. The victim Adrian Ledesma Alvarez did not commit a provocative act which was a cause of his own death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-5\">We held the instruction was erroneous. Our discussion was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1134-6\">\u201cIn <em>People </em>v. <em>Caldwell </em>(1984) 36 [Cal.]3d 210 [203 Cal.Rptr. 433, 681 P.2d 274], the deceased and his two accomplices all committed provocative acts which thereafter led to the killing of the deceased perpetrator by police. <em>Caldwell </em>held that the two accomplices could be vicariously liable for the deceased\u2019s death even though the deceased\u2019s provocative acts contributed in part to his own death. Thus, the fact that the decedant\u2019s <em>[sic] </em>provocative act was a partial cause of his own death would not bar the accomplices\u2019 liability for murder if their provocative acts were a \u2018substantial factor\u2019 which contributed to the ultimate result. <em>(Caldwell, id. </em>at pp. 219-220)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1134-7\">\u201cFrom <em>Caldwell, </em>it follows that the element 5 of the modified instruction challenged by petitioner is erroneous insofar as it precludes criminal liability if the deceased\u2019s provocative act was only a partial cause of his own death.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Garcia), supra, </em>F027797.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1134-8\">Defendant is relieved from liability for the death of Alvarez only if Alvarez\u2019s actions were the sole cause of his own death. From the facts here, the trial court was entitled to believe that Quezada\u2019s provocative act set the gun battle into motion and that Alvarez\u2019s pointing of the gun at Pena was merely a part of the chain reaction that led to Alvarez\u2019s death. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Mai </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 117, 128-129 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 141].) There is nothing in the evidence demonstrating a significant lull in the action which might have caused Pena to no longer be reacting to the gun battle initiated by Quezada.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-9\">Thus, Alvarez\u2019s pointing of the gun at Pena was not the sole cause of Alvarez\u2019s death. Defendant was properly convicted of the death of Alvarez because defendant was an accomplice to Quezada, one of the provocateurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1333\">*1333</page-number>II.-IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1135-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-7\">Thaxter, J., and Wiseman, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1131-11\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 777 [44 Cal.Rptr. 442, 402 P.2d 130]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gilbert </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 690 [47 Cal.Rptr. 909, 408 P.2d 365] (judgment vacated on other grounds <em>Gilbert v.
