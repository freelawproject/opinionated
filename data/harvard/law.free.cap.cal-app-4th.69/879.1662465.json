S.), P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aoo\">Justin B., a minor, appeals from the order of wardship (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 602), following his admission to having received stolen property (Pen. Code, \u00a7 496)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as alleged in count 2 of the petition, and \u201csuitable placement\u201d for a confinement period not to exceed three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">Appellant contends the court erred in denying his motion to suppress (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 700.1) the statements he made at the police station on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>the ground they were \u201cillegally seized because there was insufficient probable cause to arrest him on the auto burglary [and receiving stolen property] charge[s] and the curfew violation did not authorize transporting him to the police station for questioning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Based on our review of the record and applicable law, we agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">We hold that the mere presence of a passenger in a vehicle lawfully stopped for a traffic violation and which contained in plain view behind the driver\u2019s seat personal property which possibly could have been stolen from unknown vehicles at some unspecified time does not constitute probable cause to arrest the passenger for vehicle burglary (\u00a7 459) or receiving stolen property (\u00a7 496).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">We further hold that where a minor\u2019s only offense is a curfew violation, a peace officer abridges the minor\u2019s right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures (U.S. Const., 4th Amend.) when that officer transports the minor to the police station and subjects the minor to questioning designed to elicit incriminating responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">Factual and Procedural Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">At the hearing on the suppression motion, Manhattan Beach Police Officer Robert Cochran testified that on February 11, 1998, about 3:56 a.m., he observed a GMC or Chevrolet pickup truck, which had a broken taillight and a large crack across the entire length of the windshield, traveling about 60 miles per hour (MPH) east on Rosecrans near Sepulveda where the speed limit was 40 MPH.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">After stopping the vehicle, Officer Cochran approached the driver\u2019s side and asked Joseph C., a minor, for his driver\u2019s license, the vehicle registration, and proof of insurance, which Joseph C. provided. The truck was registered to his father, Donald C. While standing at the driver\u2019s window, the officer, who had a flashlight, observed three \u201ccell phones\u201d with cigarette lighter adapters next to a \u201cvery large speaker box\u201d on the back floorbed of the extended cab on the driver\u2019s side. He also noticed an owner\u2019s manual from a Ford Explorer and another manual cover from a Lincoln next to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">When asked who owned the phones, Joseph C. responded that they belonged to his father who was \u201ca cable guy.\u201d When asked where he was coming from and where he was headed, Joseph C. replied \u201cthey had been working on his vehicle at his house earlier in the evening and went to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>Jack-in-the-Box to get something to eat.\u201d The officer considered his reply to be suspicious because the vehicle was not being driven in a manner consistent with his statement that \u201cthey were heading home\u201d in view of the address on his driver\u2019s license and the officer\u2019s personal knowledge of the location of the two Jack-in-the-Box restaurants he was aware of in the surrounding area.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">Based on his suspicion that Joseph C. and his passenger, appellant, were involved in auto burglaries, the officer removed the minors out of the pickup truck and placed both under arrest, i.e., he handcuffed the minors and placed them in the back of his police vehicle. He ordered appellant out of the pickup in order to arrest him \u201c[s]everal minutes\u201d after he ordered Joseph C. to exit that vehicle. After retrieving the cell phones, the officer conducted a search of the pickup and found in front of the \u201cbench-type seat\u201d a black canvas bag containing tools. He opined the \u201cscrewdrivers, pliers, [and] channel locks\u201d found inside the bag were \u201cthe type that are commonly used to help commit burglaries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Officer Cochran testified that he was aware of information about recent vehicle burglaries in Manhattan Beach at the time of the initial stop. He explained that after he arrives at work at night, he reads the log of the events that occurred during the day. Based on his reading of those logs, he noticed that \u201c[v]ery frequently, when there\u2019s a host of vehicle burglaries, ... 90 percent of the time the only thing that is taken are cellular phones.\u201d He believed that the vehicle burglaries were \u201c[predominantly nighttime burglaries\u201d which were not discovered, and thus, not reported until the next morning. He admitted, however, there was \u201c[n]ot one consistent method\u201d in which these vehicle burglaries were committed. He further admitted that at the time he took custody of both minors, he did not have any information about any vehicle burglaries that had occurred that evening or about the theft of the phones or any other items he observed in the pickup.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Officer Cochran also testified that at the time of the traffic stop, he was aware Joseph C. and appellant were minors and were in violation of the Manhattan Beach curfew, which was in effect from 10:00 p.m. until 6:00 a.m.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He believed a curfew violation was an \u201carrestable offense.\u201d He admitted, however, that neither Joseph C. nor appellant was arrested for a curfew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>violation. They were arrested \u201cstrictly for burglary and receiving.\u201d It was stipulated that Joseph C. was on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">After arresting the minors, Officer Cochran called for a tow truck and impounded the pickup. He then transported the minors to the station, which occurred about 30 to 40 minutes after their arrest. They arrived around 4:40 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Between 4:40 a.m. and 5:22 a.m., when he began to interrogate appellant, Officer Cochran made investigative telephone inquiries to determine whether the cellular phones were \u201ccloned\u201d and to verify Joseph C.\u2019s claim that the phones belonged to his father. Prior to questioning appellant, Officer Cochran \u201chad no indication that these phones were stolen\u201d and his belief that they were stolen \u201cwas not verified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Officer Cochran interviewed appellant about the phones at 5:22 a.m., around 35 to 40 minutes later, in the station briefing room. Appellant agreed to speak after having been advised of and waiving his rights. <em>(Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436 [86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, 10 A.L.R.3d 974].) Appellant then made the statements at issue, which are not part of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">In denying the suppression motion, the juvenile court first found that the items found in the truck were properly seized pursuant to a search incident to the arrest of the minors for probable cause. The court also found the officer was entitled to conduct the search because the minors were in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>curfew, which the court believed was an arrestable offense. The court further found the officer was justified in conducting an inventory search because the pickup was impounded.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">With respect to the statements, the court ruled that the statements were admissible because the detention was not \u201cunduly lengthy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">1. <em>No Probable Cause to Support Arrest for Vehicle Burglary or Receiving Stolen Property</em></p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">Appellant contends the evidence is insufficient to support the court\u2019s finding that appellant\u2019s arrest was warranted based on probable cause to believe appellant committed the offenses of vehicle burglary and receiving stolen property. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">\u201cA brief stop of a suspicious individual, in order ... to maintain the status quo momentarily while obtaining more information, may be most reasonable in light of the facts known to the officer at the time.\u201d <em>(Adams </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1972) 407 U.S. 143, 146 [92 S.Ct. 1921, 1923, 32 L.Ed.2d 612].) \u201cThe law is well-established that \u2018in order to justify an investigative stop or detention the circumstances known or apparent to the officer must include specific and articulable facts causing him to suspect that (1) some [criminal] activity ... is occurring or about to occur, and (2) the person he intends to stop or detain is involved in that activity.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Loewen </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 117, 123 [196 Cal.Rptr. 846, 672 P.2d 436].) \u201c \u2018[T]he possibility of an innocent explanation does not deprive the officer of the capacity to entertain a reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct. Indeed, the principal function of his investigation is to resolve that very ambiguity and establish whether the activity is in fact legal or illegal\u2014to \u201cenable the police to quickly determine whether they should allow the suspect to go about his business or hold him to answer charges. . . .\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Leyba </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 591, 599 [174 Cal.Rptr. 867, 629 P.2d 961], quoting <em>In re Tony C. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 888, 894 [148 Cal.Rptr. 366, 582 P.2d 957].)</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">\u201cAs has been noted, the principal difference between a <em>Terry </em>detention and an arrest is the distinction between \u2018suspicion that [a person] may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>be connected with criminal activity\u2019 <em>(Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>[1968] 392 U.S. [1,] 10 . . .), and \u2018probable cause to believe that the suspect has committed a crime. . . .\u2019 <em>(Ibid.) </em>And what is probable cause? In <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates </em>(1983) 462 U.S. 213 . . . , the court stated: \u2018 \u201c[T]he term \u2018probable cause,\u2019 according to its usual acceptation, means less than evidence which would justify condemnation. ... It imports a seizure made under circumstances which warrant suspicion.\u201d . . . While an effort to fix some general, numerically precise degree of certainty corresponding to \u201cprobable cause\u201d may not be helpful, it is clear that \u201conly the probability, and not a prima facie showing, of criminal activity is the standard of probable cause.\u201d \u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at p. 235 . . . .) [\u00b6] In <em>People </em>v. <em>Price </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 324, 410 . . . , our Supreme Court stated probable cause to arrest \u2018exists when the facts known to the arresting officer would lead a person of ordinary care and prudence to entertain an honest and strong suspicion that the person arrested is guilty of a crime.\u2019 At some point, a detention can become an arrest if not by actual express designation, then by effect. \u2018When the detention exceeds the boundaries of a permissible investigative stop, the detention becomes a de facto arrest requiring probable cause.\u2019 <em>(In re Carlos M. </em>(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 372, 384 . . . ; see, e.g., <em>Dunaway </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1979) 442 U.S. 200, 212 . . . .)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gorrostieta </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 71, 82-83 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 92].)</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">\u201cDetermining whether an officer had cause to arrest requires two analytically distinct steps, each with its own standard of review. First, the court ascertains when the arrest occurred and what the arresting officer then knew; second, the court decides whether the officer\u2019s knowledge at the time of arrest constituted adequate cause. On appeal, a reviewing court must accept the trial court\u2019s express or implied findings on disputed factual issues in the first step of the inquiry if they are supported by substantial evidence, but a reviewing court must use its independent judgment to review the second step of the inquiry. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Duncan </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 91, 97 . . . ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Leyba </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 591, 596-597 . . . .)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Price </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 324, 409 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 821 P.2d 610].)</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Mindful of these principles, we conclude the record is barren of any facts known to Officer Cochran at the time of appellant\u2019s arrest which would support the requisite probable cause justifying appellant\u2019s arrest for vehicle burglary or receiving stolen property. The officer made no inquiry of appellant. There are no facts from which the court could infer that appellant, who was simply a passenger and who did not say or do anything suspicious, even knew of or should have known of the presence of the phones behind the driver\u2019s seat or the presence and contents of the black canvas bag in the front part of the pickup. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 565, 568 [88 Cal.Rptr. 349] [\u201cno evidence that the officer knew anything at all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>about the relationship between defendant and the driver of the car except that defendant was a passenger\u201d]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Vermouth </em>(1971) 20 Cal.App.3d 746, 755 [98 Cal.Rptr. 65] [\u201cWhether there is probable cause to arrest more than one occupant of a vehicle halted by the police on a public highway for a felony based upon possession of contraband observed in the car generally depends upon the facts of a given case.\u201d]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 731, 749, fn. 19 [117 Cal.Rptr. 393, 528 P.2d 1] [presence of marijuana in defendants\u2019 vehicle found during valid investigation, coupled with defendants\u2019 attempt to escape, constituted probable cause to arrest both driver and passenger for possession of marijuana, albeit \u201cwhether a passenger can validly be arrested for auto theft under these circumstances\u201d is an issue left \u201cfor another day\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 275, 278-279 [94 Cal.Rptr. 735] [defendant passenger observed jointly loitering near school, a prohibited activity, with driver]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ragone </em>(1948) 84 Cal.App.2d 476, 480 [191 P.2d 126] [driver and defendant passenger exited parked stolen car with motor running and attempted to commit a burglary].)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">2. <em>Statements From Custodial Interrogation Based on Curfew Violation Product of Unlawful Search and Seizure</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Appellant contends his custodial interrogation was not proper as incident to an arrest for a curfew violation. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">Appellant\u2019s attorney specifically objected that the officer could not \u201ctake [appellant] to the station for a curfew violation and keep him an hour and a half or however long and investigate and interrogate him about this other crime.\u201d He did not identify any particular statutory or other authority in support of his objection. Nonetheless, we find this objection to be sufficiently specific to alert the court to the basis of his complaint, i.e., the officer was not authorized by law to conduct a custodial interrogation of appellant at the station based on a curfew violation. (See, <em>e.g., People </em>v. <em>Holt </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 619, 666-667 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 782, 937 P.2d 213] [claim of error not forfeited or waived if objection alerts court to basis on which exclusion sought since a particular form of objection is not required]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Torres </em>(1950) 98 Cal.App.2d 189, 192 [219 P.2d 480] [court is presumed to know the law].)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">The Manhattan Beach Curfew Ordinance authorizes a police officer to demand from the person under reasonable suspicion of violating its provisions any information which would be reasonably necessary to determine whether a violation had occurred. It does not, however, contain any provision regarding what the officer can or cannot do upon determining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>person has violated the ordinance. Such guidance is provided, instead, by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">As a general rule, a peace officer is entitled to take a minor who is in violation of a local curfew ordinance into \u201ctemporary custody,\u201d the functional equivalent of the arrest of an adult <em>(In re Thierry S. </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 727, 734, fn. 6 [139 Cal.Rptr. 708, 566 P.2d 610]), but the officer must then either release the minor; deliver or refer the minor to the proper agency for shelter care, counseling, or diversion; release the minor following the preparation of a notice to appear before the probation officer; or take the minor without unnecessary delay before the county probation officer. Moreover, the officer \u201cshall prefer the alternative which least restricts the minor\u2019s freedom of movement, provided that alternative is compatible with the best interest of the minor and the community.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 601, 625, 626, 626.5.) Alternatively, if the officer determines the minor should be \u201cbrought to the attention of the juvenile court, he or she shall thereafter\u201d either release the minor after delivery of written notice to appear to the minor, parent, guardian, or responsible relative or take the minor without \u201cunnecessary delay\u201d before the county probation officer within 24 hours after taking the minor into custody, whichever \u201calternative . . . least restricts the minor\u2019s freedom of movement, provided that alternative is compatible with the best interest of the minor and the community.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 626.5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">In contrast, where a city or county adopts a resolution implementing Welfare and Institutions Code section 625.5, the officer, for the first curfew violation, is not authorized to do anything other than to issue the minor a warning citation, a copy of which is forwarded to the minor\u2019s parents or guardian for signature and return. For a subsequent violation, the officer is entitled to temporarily detain the minor and then the officer must transport the minor to the minor\u2019s parent or to a temporary place of residence within the state. The officer is also imbued with discretion not to detain the minor temporarily if he or she determines the minor has a valid reason for violating the ordinance. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 625.5, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">In view of the above statutory restrictions, we conclude the Legislature has preempted the field of what precise actions a peace officer may undertake upon finding a minor in violation of a curfew ordinance. (See <em>Lancaster </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 805, 807-808 [100 Cal.Rptr. 609, 494 P.2d 681] [\u201cLocal legislation in conflict with general law is void. Conflict exists if the ordinance duplicates . . . , contradicts . . . , or enters an area fully occupied by general law, either expressly or by legislative implication . . . .\u201d]; <em>Galvan </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 851, 859-860 [76 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 642, 452 P.2d 930] [no local legislation is permissible if the Legislature\u2019s intent to occupy a particular field is apparent from the \u201c \u2018 \u201cwhole purpose and scope of the legislative scheme\u201d \u2019 . . .\u201d (citation omitted)]; cf. <em>In re Rudolfo A. </em>(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 845, 849-853 [168 Cal.Rptr. 338] [ordinance criminalizing trespass on school grounds not preempted by state law].) Transporting the minor who has violated a curfew ordinance to the station and conducting a custodial interrogation is not authorized.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (See also 80 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 149 (1997).)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude Officer Cochran\u2019s transportation of appellant to the station and the ensuing custodial interrogation were unlawful and violative of appellant\u2019s right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment of the federal Constitution. The court therefore erred in denying appellant\u2019s suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">The order of wardship is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Hastings, J., and Curry, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b804-10\">All further section references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b806-7\">We take judicial notice of Manhattan Beach Ordinance No. 1755, effective August 6, 1987, and ordinance No. 1982, effective June 4, 1998 (Manhattan Beach Curfew Ordinance). The former was in effect at the time of appellant\u2019s detention and arrest. The latter became effective after his arrest. (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 452, subd. (b), 459.) Section 4.56.030 of title 4, chapter 56 of that ordinance provides: \u201c4.56.030 Curfew.

The propriety of the seizure of the items in the vehicle as incident to an inventory search following impound of the vehicle, as to appellant, thus depends on whether appellant\u2019s arrest was lawful.
