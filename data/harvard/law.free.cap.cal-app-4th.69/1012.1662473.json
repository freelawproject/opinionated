Appellant contends that the proper test is the normal preponderance of the evidence burden of proof that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>applies generally to factfinding proceedings in a trial court. Respondent contends that the proper test is the substantial evidence test normally applied only by an appellate or other reviewing court. The issue is directly controlled by Evidence Code section 115 (section 115). Section 115 identifies three possible burdens of proof applicable to factfinding proceedings: preponderance of the evidence, clear and convincing proof, and proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Section 115 specifies that \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law, the burden of proof requires proof by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d The law does not otherwise provide, and preponderance of the evidence is therefore the test which must be applied. The substantial evidence test has no application in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">a. <em>The substantial evidence issue.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">Plaintiff Larry Wollersheim sued the Church of Scientology of California (CSC) on various tort claims in 1980. While the case was in its pretrial stages, CSC was reorganized and the two entities which are now appellants were created: Church of Scientology International (CSI) and Religious Technology Center (RTC). Wollersheim eventually obtained judgment against original defendant CSC. After many years of appeals and related proceedings, Wollersheim made a motion in the superior court to add CSI and RTC as judgment debtors on the grounds that CSI and RTC are the alter egos of CSC. His briefing was dominated by issues relating to the long delay between the judgment and the motion, the nature of the evidence, the elements which must be proven to establish alter ego liability, etc. In a brief comment, however, Wollersheim\u2019s moving papers stated that a \u201cjudgment is properly amended where the movant shows <em>substantial evidence </em>that a party\u2019s alter ego should be held accountable for that party\u2019s wrong.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">In support of his proposition that the substantial evidence test should be applied to his alter ego motion, Wollersheim cited <em>NEC Electronics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hurt </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 772 [256 Cal.Rptr. 441] <em>(NEC). NEC </em>concerned a judgment creditor\u2019s motion to have the judgment debtor\u2019s chief executive officer and sole shareholder added to the judgment as an alter ego. The trial court granted the motion, and the chief executive officer/sole shareholder/ alter ego (CEO) appealed. After summarizing the facts, the Court of Appeal in <em>NEC </em>made the unremarkable statement: \u201c. . .we must consider whether the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by <em>substantial </em>evidence.\u201d <em>(NEC, supra, </em>208 Cal.App.3d at p. 777, italics added.) The CEO was arguing that the judgment creditor\u2019s evidence was insufficient to show that he was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>alter ego. Although the CEO acknowledged that there was a unity of interest between him and the corporation, he argued that the evidence failed to establish that an inequitable result would follow if he and the corporation were treated as separate entities. The Court of Appeal rejected this argument, finding that \u201cthere is <em>substantial evidence </em>to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that [the CEO\u2019s] manipulation of the assets of [the corporation] produced an inequity . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 778, italics added.) Continuing with its inquiry, the court later found \u201cwe do not believe that there is <em>substantial evidence </em>to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that [the CEO] controlled the action between NEC and [the corporation].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 781, italics added.) The alter ego finding was therefore reversed on this latter point.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\">As is plain, <em>NEC </em>is simply an example of the standard application of the substantial evidence test <em>by a reviewing court on appeal. NEC </em>does not stand for the proposition that a trial court, in carrying out its factfinding duties, can apply the substantial evidence test. The substantial evidence test is entirely unsuited to factfinding proceedings, inasmuch as it can require a reviewing court to affirm a factual finding which the reviewing court does not regard as supported by a preponderance of the evidence. Inherent in the substantial evidence test is the proposition that a finding must be affirmed even though the reviewing court considers it more likely than not that the finding under review is incorrect, so long as that finding is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Perhaps because the proposition that a trial court should apply the substantial evidence test when factfinding is so clearly misdirected, or perhaps because the subject of proper test to be applied was so minimally mentioned in Wollersheim\u2019s briefing, CSI and RTC made no express argument regarding burden of proof in their initial opposing papers in the trial court. Instead, their opposing papers focused on the facts, arguing them as if based on an assumption that the normal preponderance of the evidence standard would be applied. This is not surprising, since it is well established that in making factual findings, a trial court must apply the preponderance of the evidence burden of proof except in special circumstances not here involved. (Evid. Code \u00a7 115 [\u201cExcept as otherwise provided by law, the burden of proof requires proof by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">The trial court\u2019s ruling, issued initially by minute order and without oral hearing, stated the determinative question as follows: \u201cThe court must determine whether there is substantial evidence of the following: ffl] 1. CSI and RTC are the alter egos of CSC; [and] [^] 2. CSI and RTC controlled the litigation.\u201d For this proposition, the minute order cites <em>NEC Electronics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hurt, supra, </em>208 Cal.App.3d 772 and <em>Triplett </em>v. <em>Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1415, 1420, 1421 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 741] <em>(Triplett).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number><em>NEC </em>has been discussed above. <em>Triplett </em>concerned a car accident. The defendant\u2019s insurer refused to settle, and the matter was tried to a judgment for the plaintiff. The trial court then added the insurer to the judgment, even though it was undisputed that the insurer was not the defendant\u2019s alter ego, and additionally sanctioned the insurer for refusing to settle. The Court of Appeal reversed, but without making any rulings germane to the instant case. <em>Triplett </em>does, however, cite <em>NEC </em>and state the general law of alter ego.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">After receiving the court\u2019s minute order, CSI and RTC moved to vacate the judgments against them on the grounds that the trial court had applied an inapplicable standard. Wollersheim opposed. He acknowledged that the court had \u201cfound that substantial evidence presented by Mr. Wollersheim supported his alter ego allegations,\u201d and continued to argue that substantial evidence was the correct standard, stating that \u201cthe cases are uniform in declaring that, where a trial court\u2019s finding is based upon substantial evidence, that determination will not later be disturbed.\u201d This latter statement is a correct description of the function of a reviewing court applying the substantial evidence standard of review, but it does not describe the function of a trial court acting as a finder of fact. (See, e.g., \u00a7 115, [specifying application of the preponderance of the evidence burden of proof].)</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">At oral argument, CSI and RTC argued that Wollersheim\u2019s briefing had led the trial court astray in several particulars, first among them \u201cthat the burden was substantial evidence as opposed to a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d Arguing this point, counsel for RTC stated: \u201cThey cited a case, of course, which stands for the proposition that is unremarkable at best, that is, an appellate court reviews a record of a trial court below on a substantial evidence standard. I want to go back to basics. Everyone agrees that Mr. Wollersheim has the burden of proof in alleging\u2014in asking your honor to amend the judgment to include anyone else. Everyone agrees to that. Everyone agrees that the burden of proof means, at a minimum, in a civil action, preponderance. . . .\u201d In response, counsel for Wollersheim stated: \u201cBriefly, with regard to the standard of proof, you know, case after case after case, as your honor is certainly aware, cites \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 as being that which the court must find in order to make a finding of alter ego.\u201d Wollersheim\u2019s counsel went on to argue that no appellate court had ever stated that the necessary findings for an alter ego determination had to be made by a preponderance of the evidence, and concluded that \u201cwe are ready to have the appellate court look at it at this point.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">The trial court did not respond specifically to the arguments concerning the preponderance of the evidence burden of proof versus the substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>evidence standard of review, but instead simply stated \u201cI don\u2019t think I have made any mistake. I think I\u2019m absolutely correct on the law.\u201d The motion to vacate was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\">The proposition that the substantial evidence test has no proper application to factfinding in the trial court does not require extended discussion or an elaborate explanation. The matter is directly controlled by section 115, which states the general rule that factual findings must be made by a preponderance. The substantial evidence test simply accords deference to trial court findings made according to a preponderance in order to avoid de novo redetermination of every factual issue at the appellate level. The substantial evidence test is uniquely unsuited to initial factfinding. It begins with a bias toward confirming findings already made, and rejects them only if there is no evidence upon which a reasonable person could make such findings. The substantial evidence test does not ask what proposed facts are more likely than not to be the true facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Wollersheim nevertheless relies upon an isolated misstatement in <em>Jack Farenbaugh &amp; Son </em>v. <em>Belmont Construction, Inc. </em>(1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 1023, 1029-1030 [240 Cal.Rptr. 78]. In a lengthy opinion traversing the law of alter ego and affirming a trial court order adding an alleged alter ego as a judgment debtor, the <em>Farenbaugh </em>court stated: \u201c[o]nce the trial court was satisfied that there was substantial evidence [of alter ego status] . . . , it was empowered to amend the judgment to add appellant as a judgment debtor.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>This isolated passage could be read literally to support the proposition that a trial court may add an alleged alter ego as a judgment debtor based merely on substantial evidence. If so read, however, it would stand in stark contrast to well-settled law that the preponderance test applies generally in the trial court. We conclude that the <em>Farenbaugh </em>court simply \u201cmisspoke\u201d when it stated that the trial court, rather than the appellate court, must determine whether there is substantial evidence to support a factual finding. The trial court must determine whether a requested factual finding is supported by a preponderance; the appellate court then reviews that finding according to the substantial evidence test.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">If the issue of the proper test to be applied had not been vigorously and expressly contested in the trial court, it might be appropriate to assume that the trial court had applied the preponderance of the evidence test in the normal course. On this record, however, in which Wollersheim argued both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>orally and in writing that the substantial evidence test should be applied, in which CSI and RTC pointed out both orally and in writing the error in this contention, and in which the trial judge expressly chose to apply the substantial evidence test even after oral argument of a motion to vacate, we must reverse and remand for new findings of fact to be made according to the preponderance of the evidence standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">b. <em>Other issues.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">The judgments against the Church of Scientology International (CSI) and Religious Technology Center (RTC) are reversed. This matter is remanded for further consideration of plaintiff\u2019s motion to add these parties to the judgment by evaluating the evidence according to the preponderance of the evidence burden of proof in a manner consistent with this opinion. Each side to bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">Boren, P. J., and Fukuto, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b908-7\">In view of the wide spectrum of subject matter subject to the preponderance of the evidence burden of proof (including almost every factual issue tried in a civil court other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>special subjects such as punitive damages; see Civil Code, \u00a7 3294, subdivision (a)), it is undoubtedly true that there is not a separate case expressly stating that the preponderance burden of proof applies to every separate conceivable factual issue that can arise in a trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b910-8\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1012.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
