J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADG\">Petitioner Patricia O. (mother) seeks writ review (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 366.26, subd. (l); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 39.1B)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of respondent court\u2019s order denying mother family reunification services and setting a hearing under section 366.26 as to minors Salman Y. and Jasmine Y. on February 24, 1999. We deny the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">The minors were declared wards of the court pursuant to section 300 based on a second amended petition which, as sustained, alleged: (1) the minors were in danger of serious physical harm in that their sibling, Adan Y., died on February 8, 1998, as a result of severe physical injuries including \u201cblunt force trauma to the abdomen, disrupted blood vessels, lacerations and hemorrhaging of tissues, a tom liver, an abrasion on the left temple, and fractured vertebrae,\u201d and Adan previously had suffered a spiral fracture of the right humeras on July 27, 1997; (2) mother failed to protect the minors from mother\u2019s male companion, Victor Z., who had physically abused Salman and Jasmine by hitting the minors\u2019 buttocks with an open hand, twisting the minors\u2019 legs and arms, and, as to Salman, striking the minor in the abdomen with his fist; (3) the minors were inadequately supervised in December of 1997 or January of 1998 when Jasmine was found in the streets of Huntington Park by a Pacific Bell employee who took the minor to the home of the maternal aunt, and in October of 1997 when the maternal aunt found Salman \u201cwandering in the streets of Huntington Park unsupervised and she almost accidentally hit him with her automobile\u201d; (4) mother and Victor Z. had violent physical and verbal disputes in 1997 and on February 5, 1998, which endangered the minors\u2019 safety; and, (5) Victor Z. had endangered the minors by using marijuana in their presence and in their home.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">The application for petition dated February 9, 1998, prepared by the department of children and family services (DCFS) included a copy of a police report which indicated that on February 8,1998, officers responded to a \u201cbaby not breathing call\u201d at a laundromat on Florence Boulevard in Huntington Park. The officers found Adan Y. lying on a bench outside the laundromat and the minor\u2019s 34-year-old mother and her 22-year-old boyfriend, Victor Z., standing next to the bench. Adan Y. had no pulse and was pronounced dead at St. Francis Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>Mother told investigators she had separated from the minors\u2019 father approximately one year earlier, she had been dating Victor Z. for approximately eight months, and that Victor Z. had been residing with mother and the minors. Mother admitted she and Victor Z. had argued several times, had struck each other once and the police had been called on that occasion. Mother denied Victor Z. had ever struck her children. Mother claimed that, on the night of Adan\u2019s death, they had been doing laundry. Victor Z. took Adan outside while mother folded laundry and, a short while later, ran into the laundromat and stated Adan was unconscious. Victor Z. claimed he had dropped the minor accidentally, Adan had landed on his head, and never regained consciousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">An autopsy revealed Adan\u2019s death had been caused by \u201cmultiple injuries to the abdomen area as the result of blunt force trauma.\u201d Both of the doctors present at the autopsy stated such injuries \u201cwould require a great amount of force\u201d and were consistent with \u201ca punch or a kick from an adult.\u201d \u201cThe injuries included a disruption of the blood vessels, lacerations and hemorrhaging .... There was also one fractured vertebrae (L2), and a tom liver. There was over one cup of blood in the abdomen which [the deputy medical examiner] said was approximately <em>Va </em>of the victim\u2019s blood supply. The [doctors] further indicated that death would occur minutes following the blow, and no later than one hour after\u201d it. X-rays revealed a healed fracture of Adan\u2019s right arm. Victor Z. denied responsibility for this injury and claimed mother told him that Adan had fallen down the stairs and broke his arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">The autopsy report concluded Adan had been the victim of battered child syndrome as demonstrated by the presence of multiple acute and chronic injuries. These injuries included a healing fracture of the L2 vertebrae which was approximately four to six weeks old, a mature healing fracture of the right humems which was consistent with the reported history of a broken arm six months prior to death, and a periosteal calcification along the proximal humems which was approximately one and one-half to three weeks of age. \u201cThe findings are consistent with repetitive trauma to the humeras.\u201d Adan\u2019s liver was lacerated and showed recent hemorrhaging, sections of his ileum and ascending colon showed fresh hemorrhage, and the mesentery showed evidence of hemorrhage consistent with an injury one to two weeks old.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">On February 11, 1998, the juvenile court ordered the minors placed in the care of the maternal aunt.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">A social study prepared for the pretrial resolution conference (PRC) on April 14, 1998, indicated Salman told the childem\u2019s social worker (CSW) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>that Victor Z. had killed Adan, had struck Salman and Jasmine with his fist, and had twisted Jasmine\u2019s legs and arms. Salman said he told his mother and father about Victor Z.\u2019s abuse. The report indicated mother had visited Victor Z. in jail since his arrest for the murder of Adan and that mother told the CSW \u201cshe is \u2018in love\u2019 with him.\u201d The maternal aunt advised the CSW that mother had visited Victor Z. more frequently than she had visited the minors. The father acknowledged he was not fit to care for the minors and indicated he wished them to be placed with the maternal aunt.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">A supplemental PRC report prepared for May 5, 1998, indicated mother told the CSW Adan broke his arm on July 27, 1997, when he fell down numerous steps in the home. Mother admitted Victor Z. had resided with mother at the time of this incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">A CSW\u2019s report prepared for September 16, 1998, indicated mother had enrolled in parent education and domestic violence counseling and that minors and mother had commenced counseling with Teresita Morales, Ph.D., at Eastside Family Counseling Center. Morales reported mother \u201ccontinues to minimize the abuse and does not appear to grasp the severity of the crime. [Mother] is beginning to confront her denial.\u201d Attached to the report were copies of sheriff\u2019s visitation logs which indicated mother had visited Victor Z. at the county jail on February 24, 28, and March 2, 3 and 16, 1998. The minor\u2019s father provided the CSW with an audiocassette containing two recorded messages from Victor Z. to mother which Victor Z. had left on mother\u2019s telephone answering machine while mother was residing temporarily with father. The CSW noted mother had attended Victor Z.\u2019s criminal trial and met a witness who had observed Victor Z. \u201cthrow minor Adan up in the air.\u201d Mother nonetheless continued in \u201cher wishful thinking that minor Adan\u2019s death was accidental. Mother continues to minimize the incident and states that she is confused about the whole situation [even though mother] is aware of the autopsy results. Further, she is still unsure if she plans to wait for [Victor Z.], once he is released from jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">The report also indicated Salman had reported that Victor Z. \u201cwould hit . . . Adan with a steel stick on his head . . . .\u201d Salman stated Victor Z. twisted their arms and legs and that Victor Z. had injured Adan\u2019s arm by twisting it. Salman stated \u201che told his mommy 1,000 times and \u2018she didn\u2019t listen.\u2019 [Salman] stated that a 1,000 times was many, many, many, many, many times.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">At the adjudication on September 16, 1998, the juvenile court received into evidence: (1) the supplemental report with the autopsy report, sheriff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>jail visitation logs and transcribed tape recorded messages; (2) the application for petition with attachments including the detention report and police reports; (3) the PRC and supplemental PRC reports with all attachments, and, (4) records of the Huntington Park Police Department, Children\u2019s Hospital, and St. Francis Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">A DCFS progress report prepared for October 14, 1998, indicated the father wished the minors to be adopted by the maternal aunt and did \u201cnot want his children ever returned to their mother. He stated that their mother is very selfish and has not shown any improvement.\u201d The father described the current placement of the minors with the maternal aunt as \u201cperfect and he couldn\u2019t ask for anything else.\u201d The father indicated he wished to waive his right to family reunification services.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">The CSW indicated that, in an interview with mother on October 8, 1998, mother was \u201clamenting her boyfriendfs] conviction. She still doubts that he killed her son, . . .\u201d Mother would admit only that \u201c(maybe)\u201d he did it. Mother stated, \u201cI still feel something for him. I\u2019ll never forget him. It will take a long time for me to forget him.\u201d The report recommended mother be denied family reunification services.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">The juvenile court sustained the petition under section 300, subdivisions (a), (b), (f), (i) and (j), and set the matter for a contested disposition as to mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">At the hearing on the contested disposition, Donald Roger, M.D., a diagnostic radiologist, testified the fracture of Adan\u2019s L2 vertebrae was at least four to six weeks old, and such an injury required \u201ca great deal of force\u201d and would have been \u201cvery symptomatic in this child.\u201d Roger also noted a six-month old fracture to the right distal humerus, and an injury to the proximal right humerus which appeared to be one and a half to three weeks old. These injuries indicated \u201cthere had been multiple episodes of . . . fairly severe trauma . . . .\u201d Roger testified the injury to the L2 vertebrae requires \u201csevere bending of the spine to achieve . . . .\u201d Such an injury is sometimes seen in \u201csevere auto accidents\u201d and it requires \u201csevere force.\u201d The injury to the distal humerus similarly would require great force. However, Roger conceded the injury to the proximal humerus \u201cpotentially\u201d could be caused by a fall but would be uncommon. Adan\u2019s arm injuries would have resulted in a great deal of swelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">Victor Whitman, M.D., a forensic pathologist, ascribed Adan\u2019s death to \u201cblunt abdominal trauma as a consequence of battered-child syndrome.\u201d Adan succumbed approximately one hour after the fatal abdominal injury. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>Whitman also noted a nonfatal. injury to the mesentery which was at least one week old. Whitman further found \u201ca series of bruises and scars to the head, basically, the face and the scalp, . . .\u201d The deceased had several bruises of different ages which indicate \u201ca series of injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">Teresita Morales, Ph.D., testified mother commenced individual counseling with Morales once per week in May of 1998, and that mother had joined Morales\u2019s physical abuse group approximately one month before the disposition hearing. In counseling, Morales had attempted to address mother\u2019s \u201cfailure to protect the child, understanding the dynamics that led her to minimize and not confront the abuse, [and] self-esteem issues related to enduring the abuse.\u201d Morales testified that although mother had made \u201csome progress,\u201d mother continued to be in denial. Morales stated that mother \u201chas not been able to acknowledge . . . that there was abuse ongoing before the incident with Adan. She has struggled with accepting the death of Adan was murder, as opposed to an accident.\u201d Morales opined that, unless mother \u201cworks through the abuse issues,\u201d she \u201cmost likely\u201d will become involved in other abusive relationships in the future. Mother\u2019s low self-esteem affects her ability to protect her children and she is not prepared, at this time, \u201cto provide a safe environment for them.\u201d Morales had also counseled Salman and Jasmine since May of 1998. Salman originally expressed fear of mother but now states he \u201cjust [feels] bad, . . .\u201d Salman has expressed feelings of helplessness in play therapy by creating \u201ca very dangerous world which reflects . . . his . . . feelings of powerlessness and . . . not having anyone to protect him. [^] [Morales saw] this as a direct reflection of the abuse and not being able to do anything to protect himself or his brother.\u201d Jasmine was fearful of Victor Z. but not mother. Morales testified reunification would not be in the minors\u2019 best interests at this time. Morales recommended adoption by maternal aunt.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">When asked on cross-examination if Morales thought it would be detrimental to the minors to attempt reunification and have those efforts fail, Morales responded, \u201cI don\u2019t think that would be detrimental any more so than what\u2019s already happened.\u201d Morales conceded mother had improved to some degree, but not \u201cconsiderably.\u201d Morales also admitted she expected mother would make more progress, mother had been an active participant in the group setting, and the group format may help mother \u201cconfront her denial more directly, as well as develop assertiveness and communication skills.\u201d When asked when mother might have the skills necessary to protect the minors, Morales stated it was \u201ca very difficult thing to estimate. ... I would think maybe within a year, but that\u2019s a rough estimate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">Mother testified she no longer was involved with Victor Z. and that he had been sentenced to 25 years in state prison for the murder of Adan. Mother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>admitted she had visited Victor Z. between three and five times while he was in jail awaiting trial for the murder of Adan, and that she had spoken with Victor Z. on the telephone between ten and twenty times while he was in jail. Mother claimed she had seen Victor Z. strike Salman with a belt only one time. However, on that occasion Victor Z. struck Salman several times and Salman \u201chad a number of marks.\u201d Thereafter, mother told Victor Z. to discipline the minors with time-outs and not to hit them. However, after this incident, mother allowed Victor Z. to be alone with the minors because she trusted him and he promised he would not strike them again.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">Mother denied Salman had ever reported any abuse by Victor Z. Mother testified she had completed a parenting class and a domestic violence prevention class in October of 1998 and that she had accepted the fact that Victor Z. had murdered Adan but \u201cit has been difficult.\u201d Mother testified she believed counseling had helped her and she had no intention of having any type of relationship with Victor Z. again.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">After hearing extensive argument from counsel, the trial court indicated that, if it found mother came within section 361.5, subdivision (b)(4) and (6), \u201cit seems . . . that it would be irrelevant whether the mother would benefit from services .... [These] sections focus on the children and whether . . . it would be in the best interest of the children, under those particular circumstances, to order family reunification services.\u201d The juvenile court noted the testimony and the other evidence before the court demonstrated mother\u2019s \u201cgeneral reckless disregard for the welfare of the minors.\u201d The juvenile court found mother\u2019s neglect had contributed to the death of Adan based on the presence of \u201cold, as well as fresh, injuries which would have been symptomatic, and then add that to the statements of [Salman] who indicated that he had pleaded with the mother a number of times with respect to. the acts that were occurring at the hands of [Victor Z.], the circumstances of the death and the mother\u2019s knowledge [which created] the dangerous situation these children were placed in. fl[] This rises to a level of criminal neglect. And I can only express surprise that the mother was not additionally charged for the murder in this case. ft[] So, therefore, the court does find, by clear and convincing evidence, that the minors fall within section 361.5, subdivision (b)(4) and (6).\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">The juvenile court then considered whether family reunification services would be in the best interests of the minors and concluded \u201call the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>is quite to the contrary. The expert testimony is that the best interest of the minors are served by stability in their lives, [and] there is someone willing to provide that stability at this particular point in time.\u201d The juvenile court noted Salman had expressed a desire to remain with maternal aunt and the juvenile court had taken that into consideration. The juvenile court stated it was appropriate to consider \u201cwhat has occurred in the past\u201d in determining the best interests of the minors and in this case mother had demonstrated a \u201ctotal and complete disregard for the minors\u2019 welfare.\u201d The juvenile court found, \u201cunder section 361.5(b)(6), . . . that it would not benefit the minors to pursue reunification services with the mother and . . . , by clear and convincing evidence, that. . . it\u2019s not in the best interests of the minors to pursue reunification services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\">The juvenile court directed DCFS not to provide family reunification services and set the matter for a hearing under section 366.26 on February 24, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Mother contends the evidence does not support the finding she caused the death of Adan within the meaning of section 361.5, subdivision (b)(4), or that the denial of family reunification services would be in the minors\u2019 best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">1. <em>The record supports the juvenile court\u2019's finding that mother\u2019s neglect caused the death of Adan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">Mother contends the evidence demonstrated that Adan\u2019s death was caused by abdominal injuries sustained while Adan was in the custody of Victor Z.: mother testified Adan had not previously exhibited symptoms of abuse, and Salman never told her Victor Z. had been physically abusive; and the older injuries found in the autopsy could have been caused by accidental falls. Mother concludes DCFS failed to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that mother caused Adan\u2019s death within the meaning of section 361.5, subdivision (b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">This claim is meritless. Section 361.5, subdivision (b), permits denial of family reunification services \u201cwhen the court finds, by clear and convincing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>evidence, . . . ffl] . . . [H] (4) That the parent or guardian of the minor has caused the death of another minor through abuse or neglect.\u201d In this case, the juvenile court determined that mother\u2019s neglect rose to a level of criminal culpability and that mother should have been prosecuted with Victor Z. for Adan\u2019s death. The evidence supports this conclusion. The expert evidence indicated Adan\u2019s chronic injuries would have caused symptoms and pain which would have been obvious. Additionally, Salman reported to the CSW that he repeatedly told mother about Victor Z.\u2019s abuse but she did nothing to stop it. In sum, on this record, mother\u2019s claim of insufficient evidence to support the finding under section 361.5, subdivision (b)(4), borders on frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">2. <em>Substantial evidence supports the juvenile court\u2019s finding that provision of family reunification services would not be in the best interests of the minors.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">Mother contends the evidence does not support the juvenile court\u2019s finding that denial of family reunification services was in the best interest of the minors. Mother asserts the juvenile court failed to apply the factors cited in section 361.5, subdivision (h), and relied instead on mother\u2019s general reckless disregard for the welfare of the minors.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Mother claims the juvenile court improperly focused on mother\u2019s past conduct without considering whether the minors could be returned to mother during the reunification period. Mother also claims the juvenile court erroneously believed it was not relevant to consider if mother would benefit from family reunification services. Mother argues the juvenile court thus ignored the possibility that appropriate services might help mother overcome the deficiencies which had resulted in the detention of the minors. <em>(In re Rebekah R. </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1638, 1651 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 265].)</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">Mother asserts this case is factually similar to <em>In re Rebekah R., </em>in which the denial of family reunification services to a parent was reversed on appeal because there was no evidence appropriate services would not be sufficient to permit the parent to reunify with the minor. Mother asserts the juvenile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>court in this case similarly refused to consider mother\u2019s ability to benefit from services. Mother claims the evidence demonstrates she would have benefited from services and thus it must be assumed there is a likelihood the minors might be returned safely to mother within 18 months. Mother points out Morales testified mother might have the necessary skills within one year and that her progress might accelerate with involvement in group therapy. Mother asserts her testimony at the disposition hearing indicated progress in that she believed counseling had helped her, she had accepted the fact that Victor Z. had murdered Adan, she did not intend to continue a relationship with Victor Z., and she realized at the criminal trial that Victor Z. was lying.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">Mother also claims the trial court gave undue weight to the interest in stability for the minors and notes Morales testified family reunification services would not be any more detrimental to the minors than what already had happened to them. Mother asserts the juvenile court failed to consider factors 4 and 5 under section 361.5, subdivision (h), which address the history of abuse by mother and the likelihood the minors could safely be returned to mother within 18 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Mother\u2019s assertion is meritless. Section 361.5, subdivision (c), directs that a juvenile court \u201cshall not order reunification for a parent or guardian described in paragraph ... (4) [or] (6), ... of subdivision (b) unless the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that reunification is in the best interest of the minor.\u201d The factors found in section 361.5, subdivision (h), are relevant only when the juvenile court seeks to determine whether reunification services should be denied under section 361.5, subdivision (b)(6). Thus, even assuming for the sake of discussion the juvenile court erroneously failed to consider the factors in section 361.5, subdivision (h), that purported omission would affect only the denial of services under section 361.5, subdivision (b)(6). Because the asserted error would have had no impact on the propriety of the denial of services under section 361.5, subdivision (b)(4), the error must be seen as harmless in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Moreover, contrary to mother\u2019s claim, the record indicates the juvenile court did consider all relevant factors and concluded family reunification services were not in the best interest of the minors. The juvenile court addressed the first two factors under section 361.5, subdivision (h), by making repeated reference to the severity of the abuse inflicted on the minors and mother\u2019s \u201ctotal and complete disregard for the minors\u2019 welfare.\u201d The third factor, emotional trauma suffered by the minors, was addressed by Morales\u2019s testimony, which indicated Salman had experienced great distress as a result of being unable to protect Adan from Victor Z. The fourth factor, history of abuse of other children by the offending parent or guardian, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>clearly was considered in this case. Indeed, the juvenile court found mother had been guilty of criminal neglect in the death of Adan. Regarding the fifth factor, the likelihood the minors may be safely returned to mother within eighteen months with no continuing supervision, Morales testified mother might be in a position to protect the minors within one year but it was difficult to predict such things and mother had not improved \u201cconsiderably\u201d in counseling. Finally, as to the sixth factor, whether the minors wished to be reunified, the juvenile court expressly noted Salman had requested to remain with maternal aunt and Jasmine had expressed no opinion on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">In sum, the record discloses the juvenile court considered each of the factors contained in section 361.5 subdivision (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Mother\u2019s reliance on <em>In re Rebekah R. </em>is misplaced. In that case the juvenile court failed to comply with section 361.5, subdivision (i), which requires the court to state on the record the facts underlying its determination the minor had suffered abuse within the meaning of section 361.5, subdivision (b)(6). No similar deficiency appears here.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">In sum, mother\u2019s claim of error fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">The petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">Croskey, J., and Aldrich, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b847-8\">Subsequent unspecified statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b847-9\">We adopt the spelling of the names of Salman and Adan, as well as the name of mother\u2019s male companion, Victor Z., as they appear in the second amended petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b849-8\">Father is not a party to this writ proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b852-7\">Section 361.5, provides, in part: \u201c(b) Reunification services need not be provided to a parent or guardian described in this subdivision when the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, any of the following: [H] . . .
