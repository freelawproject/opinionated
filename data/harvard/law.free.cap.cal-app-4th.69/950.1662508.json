(Betz), and his former supervisors, respondents Robert Van Aken and Richard Miller. The court granted summary judgment in favor of respondents. In our original opinion filed May 13, 1998, we affirmed the judgment. Thereafter, we granted a petition for rehearing in order to resolve certain issues related to the grant of summary judgment on the harassment claim in favor of the individual defendants. Having read and considered the parties\u2019 supplemental briefs and the arguments raised at oral argument, we again affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">Appellant worked as a chemical operator for Betz for 13 years until his termination in March or April of 1995. Approximately six months prior to his termination, Drain had become disabled and was absent from his employment on short-term disability leave. Under Betz\u2019s written policy, employees were permitted to take up to six months\u2019 disability leave, after which time they would be terminated if they were still unable to return to their jobs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant attempted to return to work in March, but was unable to perform certain tasks assigned to him on that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>On March 24, 1995, appellant submitted a statement of claim for long-term disability benefits. Where the form asked which of his regular job duties he was unable to perform, he responded \u201call duties\u201d and to \u201cPlease see doctors report for return date to work.\u201d Appellant listed the following job duties on the form: \u201cmake out batch sheet formulations\u2014collect the raw materials using a fork lift\u2014make the chemical formulations in huge vatts [sic]\u2014do quality assurance [for] the completed work\u2014load tanker trucks, lead storage tanks\u2014also help train newly hired worker.\u201d The attached doctor\u2019s report stated that appellant was totally disabled from his regular occupation as well as for \u201cany occupation.\u201d The doctor gave a retum-towork date of May 8, 1995. Betz responded with an April 13, 1995, letter from Glenn Wilson, its human resources manager, that \u201cin accordance with your doctor\u2019s certificate dated March 28, 1995, this letter will confirm company policy on this matter. Since you have continued to be disabled at the end of your six months of Short Term Disability, your employment has been terminated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">On August 29, 1995, appellant presented a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, stating that he had a continuing disability which had begun on September 19, 1994. He sought indemnity for both temporary and permanent disability. He claimed injury to his \u201c[n]ervous system, psyche, internal, [and] cardiac,\u201d as the result of his \u201c[u]sual and customary\u201d duties and \u201cjob stress and harassment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">In May of 1996, the parties settled the workers\u2019 compensation claim utilizing a standardized Department of Industrial Relations \u201ccompromise and release\u201d form. The settlement agreement stated that appellant had sustained the following injuries: \u201cstress, nervous system, psyche, internal, cardiac, digestive system, hemorrhoids, anal ulcers, harassment/discrimination and any and all body parts identified as injured in the medical reports herein.\u201d In a section reserved for a brief description of the evidence the employer would offer, the parties stated that Van Aken and Miller would testify that \u201cthe applicant Terry Drain was not harassed or discriminated against (including racial discrimination)\u201d and that the defense medical expert would report \u201cthere was no evidence of harassment or discrimination.\u201d The agreement also provided: \u201cUpon approval of this compromise agreement by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board or a workers\u2019 compensation judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>and payment in accordance with the provisions hereof, said employee releases and forever discharges said employer and insurance carrier from all claims and causes of action, whether now known or ascertained, or which may hereafter arise or develop as a result of said injury, including any and all liability of said employer and said insurance carrier and each of them to the dependents, heirs, executors, representatives, administrator or assigns of said employee.\u201d Elsewhere the agreement stated: \u201cApplicant agrees that in consideration of payment by defendant as indicated herein, any and all of the above issues and claims as well as all other issues covered in this Compromise and Release Agreement, shall be deemed fully resolved. The parties by this settlement intend to settle any claims that the applicant may have against defendant for industrial injuries while in the employment of defendant/ employer, whether occurring on a specific date or over a period of time and whether or not specifically recited in this Agreement.\u201d It also contained an express waiver of Civil Code section 1542 rights<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for \u201call unknown and unanticipated injuries and damages resulting from such accident, casualty, and/or employment . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">In the meantime, in May of 1995, appellant submitted a claim to the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) based on having been \u201cterminated\u201d by \u201cBob VanAken <em>[sic] </em>or Betz Lab Inc. (supervisor) or Glen <em>[sic] </em>Wilson[,] Manager Human Resources.\u201d Appellant\u2019s DFEH complaint was directed against respondents Betz and Van Aken only.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Proceedings Below<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">A.*</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Appellant contends the trial court erred in applying the doctrine of judicial estoppel to the statements he made in his application for disability benefits and in the settlement of his workers\u2019 compensation claim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Respondents established in the summary judgment motion that appellant filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits in which he stated his disability was continuing from September 19, 1994, to August 29, 1995, and sought compensation for permanent disability as of August 29, 1995. They also established that in March of 1995, appellant submitted a long-term disability form to the company in which he claimed inability to perform any of his job-related duties and in support of which he submitted a physician\u2019s report confirming that he was totally disabled from performing any occupation. After reviewing the evidence, the trial court ruled that appellant\u2019s claims were \u201cbarred by estoppel due to his binding admissions of total temporary disability in his worker[s\u2019] compensation proceeding . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">In <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co. </em>(1956) 141 Cal.App.2d 121 [296 P.2d 386], the court recognized a \u201cform of estoppel, which prevents a party who has assumed a particular position in a judicial proceeding to assume an inconsistent position to the prejudice of the adverse party in a subsequent proceeding involving the same parties and questions.\u201d (141 Cal.App.2d at p. 128.) According to the court, \u201c[t]his form of estoppel \u2018has been said to be one of vague application, and in many cases it has been held inoperative, or has not been applied\u2019 (31 C.J.S. 373). It cannot be invoked where the position first assumed was taken as a result of ignorance or mistake (31 C.J.S. 372). The position must be clearly inconsistent so that one necessarily excludes the other. The application has also sometimes been limited by the requirement that to permit one party to change must be unjust to the other party (19 Am.Jur. 710).\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">The doctrine of judicial estoppel was applied in <em>Billmeyer </em>v. <em>Plaza Bank of Commerce </em>(1995) 42 Cal.App.4th 1086 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 119] where a bankrupt company failed to report as an asset a potential claim against its lender and then sued the lender separately, contending that its improper practices caused the bankruptcy. The court affirmed a judgment in favor of the lender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>based in part on \u201c \u2018[t]he federal doctrine of judicial estoppel\u2019 \u201d which \u201c \u2018precludes a party from asserting a position in a judicial proceeding which is inconsistent with a position previously successfully asserted by it in a prior proceeding. \u201cThus, the \u2018essential function and justification of judicial estoppel is to prevent the use of intentional self-contradiction as a means of obtaining unfair advantage in a forum provided for suitors seeking justice.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d [Citation.] The primary purpose of the doctrine is not to protect the litigants, but to protect the integrity of the judiciary. [Citations.] The doctrine does not require reliance or prejudice before a party may invoke it.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Billmeyer </em>v. <em>Plaza Bank of Commerce, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th at p. 1092, quoting <em>Southmark </em>v. <em>Trotter, Smith &amp; Jacobs </em>(1994) 212 Ga.App. 454 [442 S.E.2d 265, 266-267]; accord, <em>In re Marriage of Dekker </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 842, 850 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 642] [\u201cJudicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine aimed at preventing fraud on the courts. It is applied to keep litigants from playing \u2018fast and loose with the court.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">The doctrine of judicial estoppel has had particular significance in cases involving the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101-12213 (hereafter ADA).) Some claimants would successfully recover workers\u2019 compensation benefits based on total disability and then bring separate civil lawsuits against their employers for discrimination for failure to make reasonable accommodation under the ADA, forcing the courts to reconcile these two seemingly contradictory positions. In <em>Dush </em>v. <em>Appleton Elec. Co. </em>(8th Cir. 1997) 124 F.3d 957, for example, the employee claimed that her termination violated the ADA because she was a qualified individual with a disability and could have continued to do her job if the employer had offered reasonable accommodation. In the meantime, she was found totally disabled for purposes of Nebraska\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation law. On appeal after dismissal of her ADA claim, she argued that \u201cbecause the ADA includes the concept of \u2018reasonable accommodation,\u2019 whereas workers\u2019 compensation law does not . . . she could have been totally disabled under Nebraska law, but still have been able to perform the essential functions of her job with a reasonable accommodation (namely, reduced hours).\u201d (124 F.3d at p. 964, fn. omitted.) The court disagreed, stating that the workers\u2019 compensation referee had specifically ruled that the plaintiff was \u201c \u2018unable to continue [existing] light duty employment on any long term sustained basis,\u2019 \u201d and affirmed summary dismissal of the ADA claim. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 965.) The court noted that \u201c[a] significant number of federal courts have . . . decided that a person who characterizes herself as \u2018totally disabled\u2019 in order to receive state, federal, or even insurance benefits will normally be estopped from proving that she is a qualified individual with a disability within the meaning of the ADA or similar state laws. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 961-962.)</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>In <em>Rissetto </em>v. <em>Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 343 </em>(9th Cir. 1996) 94 F.3d 597, judicial estoppel was applied in an age discrimination FEHA claim (California Fair Employment and Housing Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12900 et seq.)) where the employee received workers\u2019 compensation benefits for temporary total disability. The employee\u2019s civil suit against her employer was premised on the theory that she had been able to perform her job but that she had been constructively discharged. The Ninth Circuit found that theory to be inconsistent with the basis of the workers\u2019 compensation award: \u201c[Pjlaintiff claimed and obtained money on the basis of an assertion that she had an \u2018inability to work,\u2019 indeed a \u2018total\u2019 inability to earn income. Yet she claims in this lawsuit that she was performing her job adequately and that defendants\u2019 cutting her down to one or two days per week was a mere pretext for age discrimination, rather than an appropriate response to her physical inability to perform her job. [^] Plaintiff cannot be permitted to recover money twice on these inconsistent positions. We hold that, having obtained a favorable [workers\u2019 compensation] settlement based on her assertion that she could not work, plaintiff was estopped from claiming that she was performing her job adequately.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 605-606.)</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">After reviewing these authorities as well as others from a number of state and federal jurisdictions, the court in <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 171 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 96], concluded that as a matter of state law the doctrine of judicial estoppel should apply when: \u201c(1) the same party has taken two positions; (2) the positions were taken in judicial or quasi-judicial administrative proceedings; (3) the party was successful in asserting the first position (i.e., the tribunal adopted the position or accepted it as true);.(4) the two positions are totally inconsistent; and (5) the first position was not taken as a result of ignorance, fraud, or mistake. [Citations.]\u201d (60 Cal.App.4th at p. 183.) Concerning the third factor, the court further held that because judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine, it could not \u201crule out the possibility that, in a future case, circumstances may warrant application of the doctrine even if the earlier position was not adopted by the tribunal. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 183-184, fn. 8; see <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Zurich Ins. Co. </em>(4th Cir. 1982) 667 F.2d 1162, 1167 [\u201cThough perhaps not necessarily confined to situations where the party asserting the earlier contrary position [has] prevailed, [judicial estoppel] is obviously more appropriate in that situation. [Citations.]\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">In <em>Jackson, </em>the employee had received a stipulated workers\u2019 compensation award based on the agreed finding that he needed a\" \u201c \u2018work environment free from emotional stress and strain and no heavy work ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th at p. 177.) The employer then terminated him because his job function as safety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>police officer necessarily involved stress, and an ADA lawsuit ensued. On this record, the appellate court believed \u201c. . . the elements of judicial estoppel have been satisfied. First, Jackson has taken two positions: In the workers\u2019 compensation proceeding, he agreed with Dr. Low\u2019s assessment that he had to have a stress-free job; in this action, he claims that he could perform the essential functions of a safety police officer III. Second, both positions were taken in judicial or quasi-judicial administrative proceedings. Third, Jackson was successful in asserting the first position: The requirement of a stress-free job appeared in the parties\u2019 .\u2018Stipulations with Request for Award\u2019 (which Jackson and his attorney signed), and the workers\u2019 compensation judge adopted the stipulations in making the award. Fourth, the two positions are totally inconsistent: Jackson cannot have a stress-free work environment and perform the essential functions of a safety police officer III. The County has classified that job as \u2018arduous\u2019 for good reason, and Jackson has admitted that all of the duties of safety police officer III involve stress. Nor was a reasonable accommodation possible. Despite the County\u2019s efforts to rehabilitate Jackson and find him an alternative job, he withdrew from the rehabilitation program and indicated that the only job he wanted was that of safety police officer III. Finally, Jackson\u2019s first position\u2014that he needed a stress-free work environment\u2014was not the result of ignorance, fraud, or mistake. Jackson knowingly agreed to the work restriction based on the report of Dr. Low, who evaluated Jackson at his attorney\u2019s request. The parties\u2019 stipulation recited the work restriction in language taken almost verbatim from Dr. Low\u2019s report.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 190-191, fns. &amp; italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Appellant\u2019s claim, although phrased in terms of racial discrimination, is analogous to an ADA claim in that he is contending his employer should have accommodated his disability by giving him a light duty position because it had done the same for White employees. The evidence propounded by respondents in support of summary judgment established that after receiving compensation for short-term disability for six months, appellant presented, a claim to his employer for long-term disability benefits in which he swore he was disabled from performing all of his duties and a physician\u2019s report which found him disabled from \u201cany occupation.\u201d This formed the basis for his later workers\u2019 compensation application whereby he sought total temporary disability from September 19, 1994, to August 29, 1995, \u201cand continuing,\u201d and received an award through compromise and settlement, approved by the workers\u2019 compensation referee. Although no factual findings were incorporated in the referee\u2019s approval of the parties\u2019 compromise and release, that is not fatal. As the court said in Jackson, \u201ccircumstances may warrant application of the doctrine even if the earlier position was not adopted by the tribunal. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th at p. 184, fn. 8.) Looking at the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>here, we are persuaded that the trial court\u2019s application of judicial estoppel was supported by substantial evidence. (See <em>In re Marriage of Dekker, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.4th at p. 850 [\u201cA trial court\u2019s determination on the issue of estoppel is a factual finding which will be upheld if supported by substantial evidence. [Citation.]\u201d].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\"><em>Prilliman </em>v. <em>United Air Lines, Inc., </em>does not mandate a different result. In <em>Prilliman, </em>the plaintiff was an airline pilot with AIDS receiving disability benefits which were payable \u201c \u2018as long as [he] remained] permanently grounded and not re-employed by the Company in a flight qualified position until age 60 or for 5 years, whichever is greater.\u2019 \u201d (53 Cal.App.4th at p. 962.) Commercial pilots must regularly undergo comprehensive physical examinations administered by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) examiner in order to receive a medical certificate enabling them to pilot an aircraft, and those who have AIDS or an ADDS-defining condition, such as Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma, are not eligible to receive the necessary medical certificate. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 941.) After discovery of his condition, Prilliman was grounded and placed on medical disability without being considered for any other position. He sought to prove in a claim brought under the provisions of the FEHA that United had failed to reasonably accommodate his disability in the workplace. The court reversed summary judgment granted in favor of United. In so doing, it explained that the position taken in the application for disability benefits was not \u201cclearly inconsistent\u201d with the position taken in the lawsuit because \u201cthe receipt of United disability benefits [was] based on Prilliman\u2019s grounding and lack of reemployment by United in a flight qualified position, matters as to which there is no dispute herein. . . . [T]he receipt of such disability benefits does not answer the question as to whether United violated the FEHA by failing to make known to Prilliman other suitable job opportunities within United that do not require medical certification from the FAA.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 962-963.)</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\"><em>Prilliman </em>was followed recently in <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Wells Fargo Bank </em>(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1382 [73 Cal.Rptr.2d 354]. There, the plaintiff, a bank examiner with HIV employed by Wells Fargo, sought to establish that the company had failed to reasonably accommodate his disability by discontinuing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>policy-which allowed him to telecommute one day a week. Prior to filing the lawsuit, the plaintiff had quit his job, and applied for and received state and federal disability benefits from insurance and Social Security. Wells Fargo obtained summary judgment on the sole ground that \u201c \u2018Plaintiff is estopped from claiming disability discrimination in violation of Government Code Section 12940, <em>et seq., </em>because he has admitted that he cannot perform the essential functions of his job\u2019 on his disability applications.\u201d <em>(Bell </em>v. <em>Wells Fargo Bank, supra, </em>62 Cal.App.4th at p. 1384.) The court concluded that Wells Fargo had not adequately shown that the plaintiff had taken totally inconsistent positions in the two proceedings. \u201cWells Fargo\u2019s proof is essentially a series of statements made in connection with plaintiff\u2019s disability applications, statements to the effect that \u2018sickness\u2019 rendered him \u2018disabled\u2019 and unable to perform \u2018his regular and customary work.\u2019 But the meaning of these statements cannot be determined without knowing what plaintiff meant by \u2018regular and customary work.\u2019 For example, was he referring to his job as he knew it before Wells Fargo changed his existing accommodation or was he referring to the job at the time he was completing the benefits application, which is to say, after Wells Fargo had refused to continue the accommodation and after his employment had ended?\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1387-1388, fn. omitted.) The court pointed to evidence submitted by the plaintiff, including a disability questionnaire in which he stated he anticipated returning to his previous job based on receiving \u201creasonable accommodations,\u201d and declarations from treating physicians who stated that plaintiff could have continued working if the prior conditions were restored. From this the court concluded: \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s [disability application] statements are not inherently and totally inconsistent with his litigation position that he could have continued working had his accommodation been left in place. It is possible to reconcile the statements made by plaintiff at different times about the nature and extent of his disability. The statements ... do not necessarily exclude his subsequent litigation posture.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1388.)</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Unlike the plaintiff in <em>Prilliman, </em>appellant did not seek disability benefits based on inability to perform a specific job function; unlike the plaintiff in <em>Bell, </em>appellant\u2019s disability application was not susceptible of varying interpretations. Appellant sought and obtained recovery based on total inability to perform any of his job functions or any other occupation. The evidence of inconsistency in the positions taken in the disability proceeding and the current lawsuit supports the trial court\u2019s application of the judicial estoppel doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">II, III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">Vogel (C.

The evidence in the record which we have recounted supported the trial court\u2019s ruling, and appellant raised no triable issue of fact concerning any of the determinative factors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b868-6\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 950.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
