J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWS\">Defendant Thomas Michael Moore was convicted on a plea of no contest of committing a lewd act on a child under the age of 14. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (a).) On appeal from the judgment with a certificate of probable cause, Moore contends that the court erred in denying his motion to withdraw the plea. The issue is whether the court was required to advise Moore, before accepting his plea, that he might eventually be subject to additional confinement under the Sexually Violent Predator Act. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6600 et seq.; hereafter the SVP Act). We conclude that this advice was not required and affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">According to evidence presented at the preliminary hearing, Moore spent a few nights at the home of the victim, Jessica F., and her mother in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>November 1996. Jessica testified that on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving Moore woke her by placing his hands on her stomach underneath her nightgown, and asked if she would like to watch television with him. They then lay side by side on the couch under a blanket and Moore touched her vaginal area. Jessica said that she heard Moore unzip his pants and that he touched his penis to her vagina. She said it hurt when Moore touched her \u201cprivate\u201d with his \u201cprivate.\u201d Jessica\u2019s mother testified that Jessica had told her, on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, that Moore had put his \u201cprivate\u201d on her \u201cprivate\u201d and that it had \u201churt a little.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">By information filed in February 1997, Moore was charged among other things with violating Penal Code section 288, subdivision (a). It was alleged that Moore was ineligible for probation because he was a stranger to the victim within the meaning of Penal Code section 1203.066, subdivision (a)(3). It was further alleged that he had been convicted in October 1985 of violating Penal Code section 288, subdivision (a), and Penal Code section 288a (oral copulation with a minor).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">In March 1997, Moore pled no contest to a violation of Penal Code section 288, subdivision (a), admitted the Penal Code section 1203.066, subdivision (a)(3) allegation, and admitted a prior strike conviction. In May 1997, the trial court allowed Moore to withdraw his no contest plea and reinstate his original not guilty plea. In June 1997, Moore renewed his no contest plea to a Penal Code section 288, subdivision (a) violation, and again admitted the Penal Code section 1203.066, subdivision (a)(3) allegation and the prior strike conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Moore\u2019s counsel then withdrew from the case citing a conflict of interest, new counsel was appointed, and Moore moved to withdraw his no contest plea for the second time. The motion was based on various grounds, including the court\u2019s failure to advise Moore that he might eventually be subject to proceedings under the SVP Act. The motion was denied, and Moore was sentenced to 12 years in state prison pursuant to a negotiated disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">Moore contends that his motion to withdraw his second no contest plea should have been granted because the court failed to advise him, before the plea was entered, that the plea could lead to SVP Act proceedings which might require him to \u201cspend the rest of his life in prison.\u201d Although \u201cthe withdrawal of such a plea rests in the sound discretion of the trial court\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Francis </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 335, 338 [267 P.2d 8]), we will presume <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>that the motion to withdraw the plea was erroneously denied if the advisement at issue was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">\u201cIn all guilty plea and submission cases the defendant shall be advised of the direct consequences of conviction.\u201d <em>(Bunnell </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 592, 605 [119 Cal.Rptr. 302, 531 P.2d 1086].) \u201cThis judicially mandated rule of criminal procedure encompasses only primary and direct consequences of a defendant\u2019s impending conviction as contrasted with secondary, indirect or collateral consequences.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 280, 282 [252 Cal.Rptr. 202].) The advice requirement generally extends only to \u201cpenal\u201d consequences <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kunkel </em>(1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 46, 53 [221 Cal.Rptr. 359]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Myers </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 1162, 1168 [204 Cal.Rptr. 91]), which are \u201cinvolved in the criminal case itself\" <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harty </em>(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 493, 504 [219 Cal.Rptr. 85]).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">A consequence is deemed to be \u201cdirect\u201d it if has \u201c \u2018 \u201ca definite, immediate and largely automatic effect on the range of the defendant\u2019s punishment.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Torrey </em>v. <em>Estelle </em>(9th Cir. 1988) 842 F.2d 234, 236.) Such direct consequences include: the permissible range of punishment provided by statute <em>(Bunnell </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d at p. 605); imposition of a restitution fine and restitution to the victim <em>(People </em>v. <em>Walker </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 1013, 1030 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 902, 819 P.2d 861]); probation ineligibility <em>(People </em>v. <em>Caban </em>(1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 706, 711 [196 Cal.Rptr. 177]); the maximum parole period following completion of the prison term <em>(In re Carabes </em>(1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 927, 932 [193 Cal.Rptr. 65]); registration requirements <em>(Bunnell </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d at p. 605); and revocation or suspension of the driving privilege <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dakin </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 1026, 1033 [248 Cal.Rptr. 206]).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">A consequence is considered \u201ccollateral\u201d if it \u201cdoes not \u2018inexorably follow\u2019 from a conviction of the offense involved in the plea.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Crosby </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 1352, 1355 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 159].) Collateral consequences include: the possibility of enhanced punishment in the event of a future conviction (ibid.); the possibility of probation revocation in another case <em>(People </em>v. <em>Searcie </em>(1974) 37 Cal.App.3d 204, 211 [112 Cal.Rptr. 267]); and limitations on the ability to earn conduct and work credits while in prison <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cortez </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 426, 429-431 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 71]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Reed </em>(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 593, 597-601 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 615]).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Any commitment Moore may suffer under the SVP Act will be neither a \u201cdirect\u201d nor a \u201cpenal\u201d consequence of his plea under the foregoing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>authorities. Accordingly, the court was not required to advise of the possibility of such a commitment, and there was no abuse of discretion in refusing to allow withdrawal of the plea.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Moore contends that, by virtue of his plea and admissions, he will necessarily be subject to a screening under the SVP Act before his release from custody. The SVP Act provides that \u201c[w]henever the Director of Corrections determines than an individual who is in custody . . . may be a sexually violent predator, the director shall, at least six months prior to that individual\u2019s scheduled date for release from prison, refer the person for evaluation.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6601, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The individual is then screened by the Department of Corrections and the Board of Prison terms to determine whether he or she is \u201clikely\u201d to be a sexually violent predator. (\u00a7 6601, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">A \u201csexually violent predator\u201d is defined as \u201ca person who has been convicted of a sexually violent offense against two or more victims for which he or she has received a determinate sentence and who has a diagnosed mental disorder that makes the person a danger to the health and safety of others in that it is likely that he or she will engage in sexually violent criminal behavior.\u201d (\u00a7 6600, subd. (a).) \u201c \u2018Sexually violent offense[s]\u2019 \u201d include violations of Penal Code sections 288, subdivision (a) and 288a, if \u201ccommitted by force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury.\u201d (\u00a7 6600, subd. (b).) \u201c \u2018Predatory\u2019 \u201d is defined as \u201can act [which] is directed toward a stranger, a person of casual acquaintance with whom no substantial relationship exists, or an individual with whom a relationship has been established or promoted for the primary purpose of victimization.\u201d (\u00a7 6600, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Although it is not apparent that the current Penal Code section 288, subdivision (a) offense, or the prior Penal Code sections 288, subdivision (a) and 288a offenses Moore admitted, were sexually \u201cviolent\u201d within the meaning of the SVP Act, Moore submits that these offenses satisfied the SVP Act\u2019s two-victim requirement. Moore also notes that by admitting the Penal Code section 1203.066, subdivision (a)(3) allegation, he admitted \u201cpredatory\u201d behavior within the meaning of SVP Act. Moore reasons that because he has admitted sex crimes against two victims, and at least one of the crimes was predatory, he is a person who <em>\u201cmay </em>be a sexually violent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>predator\u201d within the meaning of section 6601, subdivision (a) (italics added), and thus will necessarily be referred by the Director of Corrections for screening under that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">We will assume without deciding that Moore is correct, and that, by virtue of his plea and admissions, he will automatically be referred for an initial screening under the SVP Act before his release from prison. However, this screening would not necessarily lead to a finding that Moore was a sexually violent predator (hereafter SVP) under the SVP Act. Any such determination would require additional steps and would depend on additional findings which would not be controlled by Moore\u2019s plea and admissions herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">After the initial screening, the proceedings for determining whether a person is an SVP include an evaluation, a probable cause hearing and, finally, a trial. (\u00a7 6601 et seq.) If the Department of Corrections and Board of Prison Terms find that an individual is likely to be an SVP, the person is then referred to the Department of Mental Health for evaluation to determine whether a petition for commitment for treatment should be filed with the superior court. (\u00a7 6601, subds. (c), (d).) If a petition is filed, the judge then holds a hearing to determine if there is probable cause to believe that the person is likely to engage in sexually violent behavior. (\u00a7 6602.) If probable cause is found, a trial is conducted \u201cto determine whether the person is, by reason of a diagnosed mental disorder, a danger to the health and safety of others in that the person is likely to engage in acts of sexual violence upon his or her release . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 6602.) Persons found to be SVP\u2019s cannot be committed for more than two years without additional proceedings. (\u00a7 6604.)</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">It is apparent from this brief outline of the SVP Act procedures that any finding that Moore is an SVP will not be an \u201cimmediate\u201d or \u201cinexorable\u201d result of his plea and admissions in this case. <em>(Torrey </em>v. <em>Estelle, supra, </em>842 F.2d at p. 236; <em>People </em>v. <em>Crosby, supra, </em>3 Cal.App.4th at p. 1355.) Such a finding would result only from new determinations years in the future of issues such as whether Moore was <em>at that point </em>mentally disordered and likely to reoffend (\u00a7\u00a7 6600, 6602)\u2014matters which are not admitted by his plea and admissions herein. (See also \u00a7 6600, subd. (a) [conviction of the enumerated crimes \u201cshall not be the sole basis for the [SVP] determination\u201d].) Thus, potential commitment under the SVP Act is at most a collateral consequence of the plea and admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Nor would any such commitment be a \u201cpenal\u201d consequence of the plea and admissions. (See <em>Hubbart </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1138 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 492, 969 P.2d 584].) Although Moore argues at length that the SVP Act is a penal law, that argument has been rejected in <em>Hubbart.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>Moore notes that a defendant must be advised of the possibility of certain types of civil commitments, and he argues that the same requirement should apply to SVP Act commitments, even if they are not a form of punishment. The commitments to which Moore refers are: those formerly provided for treatment of mentally disordered sex offenders following pleas or findings of guilt (see <em>Bunnell </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d at p. 605 [referring to former \u00a7 6302]); commitments for treatment of narcotics addiction <em>(ibid. </em>[referring to \u00a7\u00a7 3050, 3051]); and commitments following pleas of not guilty by reason of insanity <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lomboy </em>(1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 67, 68-69 [171 Cal.Rptr. 812]). However, these commitments are distinguishable from those under the SVP Act because they could be ordered by the sentencing court in the case in which the plea is entered. Unlike SVP Act commitments, these commitments are an \u201cimmediate\u201d consequence of the plea <em>(Torrey </em>v. <em>Estelle, supra, </em>842 F.2d at p. 236), <em>\u201cin the criminal case itself (People </em>v. <em>Harty, supra, </em>173 Cal.App.3d at p. 504, italics added).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">SVP Act proceedings are more analogous to deportation than the commitment proceedings Moore cites because an SVP commitment, like deportation, depends on additional findings by a different tribunal after the defendant has been sentenced. A defendant must be advised of the possibility of deportation, but that requirement is imposed by <em>statute </em>(Pen. Code, \u00a7 1016.5), rather than by the \u201c \u2018judicially declared rule of criminal procedure\u2019 \u201d Moore invokes <em>(In re Carabes, supra, </em>144 Cal.App.3d at p. 929). If, as Moore maintains, defendants in his situation should be informed of the potential for such a commitment, the remedy is with the Legislature and not this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Poch\u00e9, J., and McGuiness, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied March 31, 1999. Mosk, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b613-8\">This conclusion is dispositive of Moore\u2019s suggestion that his sentence exceeded his plea agreement because he was not told of potential consequences under the SVP Act. The sentence Moore received was consistent with the one indicated at the time of the plea in any event.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b613-9\">Unless otherwise indicated, all further statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b615-10\">Presiding Justice of the Court of Appeal, First District, Division Three, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
