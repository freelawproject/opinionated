J.</author>\n<p id=\"AE\">Plaintiff Wallace Silver appeals a summary judgment favoring defendant Lawrence McNamee on Silver\u2019s complaint for medical malpractice. Silver contends the superior court erred in concluding this lawsuit was time barred as a matter of law. We reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">The parties dispute whether Silver timely served McNamee with notice of intent to sue (Code Civ. Proc.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 364)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> so as to toll for 90 days the 1-year limitations period of section 340.5. Resolution of this case involves analysis of the interplay among subdivisions (a) and (d) of section 364 and subdivision (a) of section 1013. Section 364, subdivision (a) deals with the amount of notice to which McNamee was entitled before Silver filed this lawsuit. Section 364, subdivision (d) provides for tolling of the statute of limitations when the. notice of intent to sue is served within 90 days of the expiration of such limitations statute. Section 1013, subdivision (a) governs service by mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">On January 8, 1997, three days before the limitations period was set to expire on his claim against McNamee for medical malpractice, Silver mailed to McNamee\u2019s Ohio residence two section 364 notices of intent to sue, one by regular mail and the other by certified mail. On March 21, 1997, Silver filed this lawsuit against McNamee.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">McNamee sought summary judgment on the ground this lawsuit was time-barred since McNamee assertedly did not receive \u201cactual notice\u201d of Silver\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>intent to sue until March 1997, almost two months after expiration of section 340.5\u2019s one-year limitations period. McNamee claimed that in February 1997 he declined to accept the certified mail from Silver and in March 1997 he first received the section 364 notice sent by regular mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">In granting summary judgment favoring McNamee, the superior court determined section 340.5\u2019s one-year statute of limitations expired before McNamee had \u201cactual notice\u201d of Silver\u2019s intent to sue and thus such limitations statute was not tolled for ninety days under subdivision (d) of section 364. The court also determined the effective date of the notices mailed by Silver on January 8, 1997, was delayed by 10 days under section 1013, subdivision (a)\u2019s provisions governing service by mail outside California and thus\u2014by not becoming effective until January 18, 1997, after expiration of section 340.5\u2019s limitations period\u2014such notices were untimely for purposes of tolling the statute of limitations for 90 days under section 364, subdivision (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Concluding Silver\u2019s notices of intent to sue McNamee were effective immediately upon their deposit in the mail, we determine the superior court erred in construing section 1013, subdivision (a) as delaying the effective date of such notices by 10 days. Further, in light of evidence indicating Silver strictly complied with relevant statutes governing service by mail, we also determine the superior court erred in concluding subdivision (d) of section 364 could not apply to toll the statute of limitations unless and until McNamee had \u201cactual notice\u201d of Silver\u2019s intent to sue. Hence, we reverse the summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">For purposes of determining the propriety of the summary judgment favoring McNamee, we state the facts undisputed by the parties. We state other facts in the light most favorable to Silver as appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">In January 1992 McNamee read Silver\u2019s lumbar \u201cMRI\u201d without noting Silver\u2019s aortic aneurysm.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">On January 10, 1996, Silver suffered acute pain in his lower extremities.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>On January 11, 1996, Silver went to an emergency room where he was diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">On January 12, 1996, Silver underwent a procedure where the aneurysm was resected.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">On January 14, 1996, Silver underwent a fasciotomy procedure to alleviate the pressure to his lower calves caused by the resulting blood clot in his aneurysm.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">On January 31, 1996, after Silver developed gangrene of his lower extremities, a bilateral below-knee amputation was performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Silver\u2019s Notice of Intent to Commence Action Against McNamee</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">On January 8, 1997, three days before the one-year limitations period was to expire on his claim against McNamee for medical malpractice, Silver retained counsel Mulligan. On that date, Mulligan\u2019s office sent by regular first class United States mail to McNamee in Ohio a notice of Silver\u2019s intent to commence a professional negligence action. (\u00a7 364, subd. (a).) The notice was properly addressed to McNamee, bore the correct amount of prepaid postage, and was placed in the United States mail. On that date, Mulligan\u2019s paralegal also executed a declaration of mailing such notice. The notice sent by regular mail was never returned by the post office to Mulligan.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">Also on January 8, 1997, Mulligan\u2019s office sent by certified mail to McNamee in Ohio a second notice of intent to commence a professional negligence action. The second notice was properly addressed to McNamee, bore the correct amount of prepaid postage, and was placed in the United States mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">On January 10, January 22, and January 28, 1997, the post office attempted to deliver to McNamee the notice sent by certified mail. The post office returned the certified mail to Mulligan as unclaimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Superior Court Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">On March 21, 1997, Silver filed this medical malpractice lawsuit against McNamee. Silver alleged he lost his legs as a result of McNamee\u2019s failure to diagnose an aortic aneurysm when reading Silver\u2019s lumbar MRI.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">In July 1997, answering Silver\u2019s complaint, McNamee affirmatively alleged this lawsuit was time-barred under section 340.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">In December 1997 McNamee filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground Silver\u2019s lawsuit was barred under section 340.5\u2019s one-year statute of limitations. McNamee asserted that not until March 1997, almost two months after expiration of the one-year limitations period, did he receive \u201cactual notice\u201d of Silver\u2019s intent to commence this professional negligence lawsuit against him.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">Opposing McNamee\u2019s summary judgment motion, Silver asserted his lawsuit was timely filed since the notices sent on January 8, 1997, by first class mail and certified mail to McNamee at his Ohio residence satisfied the requirements of section 364 and thus tolled for 90 days the statute of limitations governing this action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">In January 1998 by telephonic ruling, the superior court granted McNamee\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court concluded section 340.5\u2019s one-year limitations period expired before \u201cactual notice\u201d to McNamee of Silver\u2019s intent to sue and thus the statute of limitations was not tolled for ninety days.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>In February 1998 after hearing, the superior court reaffirmed its ruling granting summary judgment favoring McNamee. The court concluded section 364, subdivision (b) did \u201cnot require any particular form\u201d of notice; section 364, subdivision (c) permitted service of the notice in the manner prescribed in section 1010 et seq.; since Silver served McNamee on January 8, 1997, by mail at an address outside California, an extension of 10 days was required by section 1013, subdivision (a); cases arising under section 1013, subdivision (a) involving notice \u201ctack the time on the beginning\u201d; cases cited by Silver were distinguishable as extending \u201ctime to respond\u201d; and thus \u201c[t]he only timely notice in this case would have been by personal service or Express Mail service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">In March 1998 the superior court entered summary judgment dismissing Silver\u2019s lawsuit against McNamee.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Silver appeals the summary judgment favoring McNamee.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Silver contends the superior court erred in granting summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds. Asserting he successfully served McNamee on January 8, 1997, with section 364 notices before expiration of section 340.5\u2019s one-year limitations period so as to toll the statute of limitations for ninety days under subdivision (d) of section 364, Silver contends this lawsuit was filed timely on March 21, 1997. Specifically, Silver asserts the section 364 notices served on McNamee were effective immediately upon deposit in the mail. Silver also asserts that where, as here, a plaintiff strictly complies with relevant statutes governing service by mail, neither section 364 nor case law requires the plaintiff to give the health care provider \u201cactual notice\u201d of the plaintiff\u2019s intent to sue.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">\n<em>Supreme Court Construction of Section 364</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">In <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Young </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 315 [279 Cal.Rptr. 613, 807 P.2d 455], a decision construing section 364, the Supreme Court held section 340.5\u2019s \u201c1-year statute of limitations is tolled for 90 days when the plaintiff gives the notice of intent to sue in the last 90 days of the limitations period . . . .\u201d <em>(Woods </em>v. <em>Young, supra, </em>at p. 319.) The Supreme Court later applied the same tolling rule to section 340.5\u2019s three-year statute of limitations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number><em>(Russell </em>v. <em>Stanford University Hospital </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 783 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 97, 937 P.2d 640].)</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">In <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Young, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d 315, the Supreme Court observed that subdivision (a) of section 364 \u201crequires that, before filing a medical malpractice action, a plaintiff give the defendant at least 90 days\u2019 notice of intent to sue. The purpose of this 90-day waiting period is to decrease the number of medical malpractice actions filed by establishing a procedure that encourages the parties to negotiate \u2018outside the structure and atmosphere of the formal litigation process.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Woods </em>v. <em>Young, supra, </em>at p. 320.) After discussing section 365,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Supreme Court also observed: \u201cUnless the giving of the 90-day notice tolls or extends the statute of limitations, sections 364(a) and 365 pose a dilemma for the plaintiff\u2019s attorney who serves the notice within the last 90 days of the 1-year limitations period. In that situation, the attorney must either comply with section 364(a)\u2019s proscription against commencing the action during that statute\u2019s 90-day waiting period, thereby forfeiting the client\u2019s cause of action, or the attorney must file the lawsuit during the statutory 90-day waiting period, thereby \u2018triggering\u2019 section 365\u2019s provision of possible disciplinary action by the State Bar. In the absence of tolling or extension, a plaintiff\u2019s attorney wishing to protect the client\u2019s rights without risking disciplinary proceedings would have to serve the 90-day notice within 9 months of the plaintiff\u2019s discovery of the injury. This would, in effect, shorten the statutory limitations period from one year to nine months, [ft The Legislature attempted to resolve this problem through section 364, subdivision (d) . . . .\u201d <em>(Woods </em>v. <em>Young, supra, </em>at pp. 320-321.) However, as the Supreme Court recognized, \u201cliteral application of section 364(d)\u201d would lead to \u201cincongruous results\u201d by requiring \u201ca medical malpractice plaintiff to commence the lawsuit in the same period of time during which section 364(a) precludes the plaintiff from filing suit.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 321, 325.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Resolving the problem created by a literal application of subdivision (d) of section 364, the Supreme Court construed \u201csection 364(d) as tolling the one-year statute of limitations when section 364(a)\u2019s ninety-day notice of intent to sue is served during, but not before, the last ninety days of the one-year limitations period. Because the statute of limitations is tolled for 90 days and not merely extended by 90 days from the date of service of the notice, this construction results in a period of 1 year and 90 days in which to file the lawsuit.\u201d <em>(Woods </em>v. <em>Young, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 325.) The Supreme Court observed: \u201cIn providing for a waiting period of at least 90 days before suit can be brought, this construction achieves the legislative objective of encouraging negotiated resolutions of disputes. ft\u00a1] Moreover, this interpretation resolves the dilemma . . . that sections 364(a) and 365 pose for a plaintiff\u2019s attorney who serves the 90-day notice of intent to sue required by section 364(a) in the last 90 days of the 1-year limitations period. Our construction of section 364 as <em>tolling, rather than merely extending, </em>the statute of limitations, permits the plaintiff to commence the action after the 90-day \u2018waiting\u2019 period has elapsed and before the limitations period has expired.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 325-326, italics added.) Thus, a \u201cplaintiff who serves the notice of intent to sue on the last day of the limitations period has one day after the ninety-day waiting period to file the complaint.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 326, fn. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">In sum, \u201cwhen a plaintiff gives the 90-day notice of intent to sue required by section 3.64(a) in the last 90 days of the 1-year statute of limitations that statute is tolled for 90 days.\u201d <em>(Woods </em>v. <em>Young, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 328.)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">\n<em>Effect of Section 1013, Subdivision (a)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The superior court essentially concluded subdivision (d) of section 364 did not entitle Silver to a 90-day tolling of section 340.5\u2019s 1-year statute of limitations because such statutory limitations period expired after Silver mailed the section 364 notices to McNamee but before such notices became effective 10 days later under section 1013, subdivision (a). However, the court misperceived section 1013, subdivision (a) as delaying the effectiveness of Silver\u2019s section 364 notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>As noted, section 364, subdivision (c) provides that service of a notice of intent to sue \u201cmay be served in the manner prescribed\u201d in section 1010<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> et seq. Section 1011 deals with the method and place of personal service. Sections 1012<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and 1013<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> involve service by mail. Section 1013a deals with the method of proof of service by mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">\u201cA successful service by mail requires strict compliance with the statute.\u201d <em>(Valley Vista Land Co. </em>v. <em>Nipomo Water &amp; Sewer Co. </em>(1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 172, 174 [63 Cal.Rptr. 78].) Thus, \u201ceffective service requires strict compliance with Code of Civil Procedure sections 1012, 1013, and 1013a . . . .\u201d <em>(Sharp </em>v. <em>Union Pacific R.R. Co. </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 357, 360 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 925].)  This record contained evidence sufficient to support a conclusion such statutory requirements were met.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Evidence indicated Silver complied with section 1012 by mailing the section 364 notices to McNamee\u2019s residence address, a place with a delivery service by mail. Evidence also indicated Silver complied with section 1013, subdivision (a) by depositing the notices in the United States mail in sealed envelopes, with postage paid, addressed to McNamee at his place of residence. Evidence further indicated the paralegal for Silver\u2019s counsel executed a proof of service by regular mail complying with section 1013a, subdivision (1). Thus, although McNamee claimed the notice sent by certified mail was rejected in February 1997 and the notice sent by regular mail was not received until March 1997, service was complete on January 8, 1997, when those notices were deposited in the mail. (\u00a7 1013, subd. (a); <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Union Pacific R.R. Co., supra, </em>8 Cal.App.4th at p. 360.) Silver did not have the burden to show the notices were actually received by McNamee. <em>(Ibid.) </em>On the contrary, \u201caddressee\u201d McNamee incurred \u201cthe risk of the failure of the mail.\u201d <em>(Caldwell </em>v. <em>Geldreich </em>(1955) 137 Cal.App.2d 78, 81 [289 P.2d 832].) Hence, since Silver\u2019s section 364 notices were served on McNamee on January 8, 1997\u2014within 90 days of the January 11, 1997, expiration date of section 340.5\u2019s 1-year limitations period\u2014the time for commencement of Silver\u2019s action was tolled by 90 days from January 8, 1997, until April 8, 1997. (\u00a7 364, subd. (d).) Accordingly, for purposes of the statute of limitations, Silver\u2019s lawsuit filed on March 21, 1997, was timely. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Nonetheless, the superior court determined Silver\u2019s lawsuit to be untimely. In making such determination, the court concluded the effective date of Silver\u2019s section 364 notices\u2014whose service on McNamee in Ohio was completed upon their deposit in the mail on January 8, 1997\u2014was delayed by 10 days under the portion of subdivision (a) of section 1013 providing that \u201cservice is complete at the time of the deposit, but any period of notice and any right or duty to do any act or make any response within any period or on a date certain after the service of the document, which time period or date is prescribed by statute or rule of court, shall be extended ... 10 days if the place of address is outside the State of California but within the United States . . . .\u201d However, we have not been alerted to any case law supporting the superior court\u2019s interpretation of such portion of section 1013, subdivision (a) as operating to delay the effective date of service so as to preclude application of section 364, subdivision (d) to toll by 90 days the applicable statute of limitations. Indeed, such interpretation contravenes the language of section 1013, subdivision (a) that expressly provides service by mail, is \u201ccomplete\u201d upon deposit in the mail.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Contrary to the superior court\u2019s interpretation of subdivision (a) of section 1013, case law suggests such statute at most may have entitled McNamee to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>10 additional days of prior notice under section 364, subdivision (a) of Silver\u2019s intent to commence this lawsuit. (See, e.g., <em>California Business Council </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1100, 1105 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 7]; <em>Citicorp North America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 563, 567 [261 Cal.Rptr. 668]; <em>Fritts </em>v. <em>County of Kern </em>(1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 303, 308 [185 Cal.Rptr. 212].)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Such application of section 1013, subdivision (a) would thus have required that Silver not commence this lawsuit until April 18, 1997 (100 days after January 8, 1997, the date when Silver served McNamee by mail with notice of intent to sue).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> However, even if McNamee were entitled to an additional 10 days of notice of Silver\u2019s intent to sue, such application of section 1013, subdivision (a) would not render this lawsuit untimely. Instead, any failure by Silver to provide McNamee under section 1013, subdivision (a) with an additional 10 days of section 364 notice would do no more than present possible grounds for professional discipline against Silver\u2019s attorney.

(d); <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Young, supra, </em>at pp. 319, 325-326.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Hence, this lawsuit, filed on March 21, 1997, well before expiration of the one-year limitations period as tolled under subdivision (d) of section 364, was timely.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>In sum, we conclude the superior court erred in determining section 1013, subdivision (a) delayed by 10 days the effective date of Silver\u2019s service on McNamee of the notices of intent to sue so as to preclude application of section 364, subdivision (d) to toll by 90 days the 1-year limitations period of section 340.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">\n<em>No Requirement of Actual Notice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">The superior court also concluded section 340.5\u2019s one-year limitations period expired before McNamee had \u201cactual notice\u201d of Silver\u2019s intent to sue and thus the statute of limitations was not tolled for ninety days under section 364, subdivision (d). Attacking that conclusion, Silver contends \u201cactual notice\u201d to McNamee was not required since Silver strictly complied with all relevant service statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">As discussed, \u201cservice is complete at the time the document is deposited in the mail.

However, McNamee contends case law has imposed a requirement that service of a section 364 notice must result in \u201cactual notice\u201d to such health care provider if the plaintiff is to take advantage of such tolling provision. Specifically, McNamee relies on <em>Godwin </em>v. <em>City of Bellflower </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 1625 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 524] <em>(Godwin); Hanooka </em>v. <em>Pivko </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1553 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 70] <em>(Hanooka); </em>and <em>Derderian </em>v. <em>Dietrick </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 892 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 800] <em>(Derderian). </em>However, those cases are factually distinguishable as involving situations where plaintiffs did not strictly comply with statutes governing the method of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">In <em>Godwin, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th 1625., the appellate court held that \u201c. . . when a plaintiff who knows the names of treating doctors serves a notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>intent to sue on the hospital within 90 days of the ranning of the statute of limitations, but fails to name or serve the known doctors, such notice [does not extend] the statute of limitations as to the unnamed doctors.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1627.) The court observed that \u201c. . . the specific notice requirements of section 364, subdivision (a) were designed to serve a distinct purpose, viz., to give a health care provider notice of the imminence of suit, and thus promote prelitigation settlement. This purpose can only be effectuated if the health care provider has actual notice.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1631.) The court thus rejected the plaintiff\u2019s contention that notice to the hospital should be held sufficient notice to the treating physicians as the hospital\u2019s alleged agents. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court stated that \u201c. . . unless a health care provider has actual notice of a party\u2019s intent to sue, no prelitigation settlement can be considered, much less reached. Plaintiff\u2019s argument that the hospital was responsible for identifying and notifying the individual doctors ignores the undisputed fact that at the time he served the section 364 notice, plaintiff was aware of the doctors\u2019 identities and could have notified them. There can be little question that plaintiff was well positioned to comply with both the letter and spirit of section 364\u2019s notice requirement.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Hence, the court concluded: \u201cWithout addressing whether, under different circumstances, something less than actual notice would be sufficient, we hold that where, as here, a plaintiff has actual knowledge of the identities of the treating physicians whom he intends to sue, section 364, subdivision (a) notice on the hospital, without naming the physicians, is insufficient notice to them to extend the statute of limitations under section 364, subdivision (d).\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1632.)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">In <em>Hanooka, supra, </em>22 Cal.App.4th 1553, the appellate court held the plaintiffs\u2019 service of a hospital with a notice naming defendant physicians did not constitute service on those physicians for purposes of section 364, subdivision (a). The court indicated reluctance \u201cto impute knowledge of a principal to its agent, or to assign responsibility to a hospital for identifying and notifying individual doctors of actions commencing against them.\u201d <em>(Hanooka, supra, </em>at pp. 1559-1560.) Hence, the court found the plaintiffs \u201cwere in a position similar to that of the plaintiffs in <em>Godwin </em>[, <em>supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th 1625], in that they were aware of the doctors\u2019 identities and could easily have effected service of the notice.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1560.) The court observed: \u201cAs we previously stated in <em>Godwin, </em>the purpose of the specific notice requirement of section 364, subdivision (a) is to promote prelitigation settlement, which can only be effectuated if the health care provider has actual notice.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court thus concluded that where \u201cdoctors did not receive actual notice pursuant to section 364, subdivision (a), [the plaintiffs] cannot take advantage of the 90-day extension period provided by section 364, subdivision (d). Furthermore, we hold that a plaintiff cannot rely on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>hospital to forward section 364, subdivision (a) notices to individual physicians where, as here, the plaintiff has knowledge of the identity and location of the physicians.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">In <em>Derderian, supra, </em>56 Cal.App.4th 892, the appellate court concluded \u201c. . . it was not sufficient for [the plaintiffs] to send the section 364 notice letter to the address listed on the bill they possessed. From the face of the bill, [the plaintiffs] could not have gleaned adequate assurance that the Chatsworth post office box address of St. Luke Emergency Associates, from whom the bill was received, had any direct connection with [the defendant physician].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 899.)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Thus, in <em>Derderian, supra, </em>56 Cal.App.4th 892, <em>Hanooka, supra, </em>22 Cal.App.4th 1553, and <em>Godwin, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th 1625, the issue of \u201cactual notice\u201d arose in the context whether service on a defendant\u2019s purported principal of a notice of intent to sue the defendant constituted service on such defendant. Since the plaintiffs in those cases did not strictly comply with statutes involving service whether by mail or otherwise, the courts were required to consider the alternate theory whether the defendants had nevertheless received \u201cactual notice\u201d of the plaintiffs\u2019 intent to sue. However, unlike the plaintiffs in those cases, Silver strictly complied with statutes governing service by mail. Further, unlike the situation here, neither <em>Derderian, Hanooka, </em>nor <em>Godwin, </em>involved the adequacy of a method of service on a defendant directly. Nothing in those cases suggests that application of subdivision (d) of section 364 to toll the statute of limitations depends upon the defendant\u2019s receiving \u201cactual notice\u201d when served directly by a means authorized under sections 364 and 1010 et seq. in strict compliance with the statutory requirements. On the contrary, as discussed in <em>Godwin, </em>the appellate court expressly left open the issue whether something less than actual notice would be sufficient under other factual circumstances. (5 Cal.App.4th at p. 1632.) Similarly, in <em>Derderian, </em>the appellate court stated: \u201cWe do not hold, and need not address, the issue of whether section 364 requires that the health care provider receive actual notice in every case. Instead, under the circumstances present here, we hold that [the plaintiffs] did not take adequate steps which would be likely to result in actual notice to [the defendant].\u201d (56 Cal.App.4th at p. 899, fn. 7.) Moreover, nothing in those cases suggests personal service of the section 364 notices on McNamee was required. Indeed, reasonably read, <em>Derderian, </em>indicates service directly on a defendant physician by an authorized means other than personal service would satisfy any requirement of \u201cactual notice\u201d for purposes of section 364: \u201cThere is no reasonable explanation as to why the [plaintiffs] did not avail themselves of the public records which assured notice of their malpractice claim would actually be sent to and received by [the defendant]. If [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>plaintiffs] had given notice to [the defendant] at the address he is required to file with the Medical Board of California, he could hardly claim he did not receive actual notice.\u201d <em>(Derderian, supra, </em>at p. 900, citing <em>Baughman </em>v. <em>Medical Board </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 398, 402 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 498] (Baughman).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">In sum, on this record the superior court erred in concluding as a matter of law that without \u201cactual notice\u201d to McNamee, Silver\u2019s service by mail of the notices of intent to sue was insufficient to invoke the provisions of section 364, subdivision (d) to toll the statute of limitations governing this lawsuit.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Hence, the summary judgment favoring McNamee must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">The judgment is reversed.

If, however, the plaintiff were to file <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>the action one day after the extended period, that is, one year and forty-one days after discovery of the injury, the action would be barred by the one-year statute of limitations because it was filed one day beyond the limitations period as extended.
