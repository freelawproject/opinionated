Schumacher, and Allan M. Levine (collectively Strasbourger) appeal the order disqualifying Stroock &amp; Stroock &amp; Lavan and Michael F. Perils, a member of the firm (collectively Stroock), from representing Strasbourger in the action below, claiming the trial court abused its discretion because: (1) Stroock\u2019s representation caused, at most, the mere appearance of impropriety; (2) Stroock represented Strasbourger, the underwriter in Wiz Technology, Inc.\u2019s (Wiz) stock offering, and never represented Wiz; (3) even if Stroock technically represented Wiz, the trial court failed to determine whether a substantial relationship existed; (4) Wiz had no reasonable expectation any of the information it gave to Stroock would be kept confidential; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1402\">*1402</page-number>(5) Stroock\u2019s representation of Wiz\u2019s former auditors did not give rise to a duty of confidentiality to Wiz; and (6) the trial court failed to consider that Wiz\u2019s motion to disqualify Stroock was tardy and brought solely for tactical purposes.  We reverse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1204-5\">Strasbourger, an investment banking firm, served as an underwriter for Wiz\u2019s public stock offering. It purchased 1,820,000 shares of Wiz stock for resale to the public. Stroock, Strasbourger\u2019s usual corporate counsel, participated in the process by preparing the registration statement, prospectus, and certain regulatory filings, performing a due diligence investigation concerning the correctness of Wiz\u2019s representations, and involving itself, in the negotiation of an underwriting agreement and a warrant agreement which governed the transaction. Stroock also worked to qualify the stock under the \u201cblue sky\u201d laws of states where the securities were to be sold, and filed necessary materials with the National Association of Stock Dealers. To perform its functions, sorbe of Stroock\u2019s lawyers met several times with personnel working for Wiz, which provided the lawyers with information concerning these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-6\">The underwriting agreement provided Wiz would pay the attorney fees for its counsel and Strasbourger. Hand &amp; Hand was listed in the agreement as Wiz\u2019s counsel and Stroock was listed as Strasbourger\u2019s. The prospectus noted Hand &amp; Hand would pass on the shares\u2019 legality and Stroock would pass on certain legal matters for Strasbourger. Wiz paid Stroock\u2019s bill of $23,666.05 for the blue sky work, as itemized in its statement to Wiz.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-7\">About a year and a half later, Wiz engaged Coopers &amp; Lybrand (Coopers) as auditors. To enable Coopers to do its job, Wiz disclosed financial and other information regarding every aspect of its business, activities, and operations, including accounting and management issues. Wiz also discussed the specifics of an SEC (Securites and Exchange Commission) investigation with Coopers. During this time, Stroock was legal counsel for Coopers, while it was also Strasbourger\u2019s counsel. Coopers eventually resigned as Wiz\u2019s auditors, which Wiz asserted caused its stock value and ability to raise funds to decline. Wiz believed Stroock played a part in Coopers\u2019s resignation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1403\">*1403</page-number>Several months later, Strasbourger sued Wiz for allegedly breaching the underwriting agreement by selling shares of its stock on its own, and breaching the warrant agreement by failing to register the shares. Wiz eventually brought a motion to disqualify Stroock from representing Strasbourger on the grounds Stroock had a conflict of interest because it represented Wiz in the stock qualification process and represented Coopers while it served as Wiz\u2019s auditor. The court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-6\">Strasbourger contends Stroock\u2019s disqualification was erroneous because Stroock represented Strasbourger and never represented Wiz in the stock transaction.  We review the trial court\u2019s ruling using the abuse of discretion standard. <em>(In re Complex Asbestos Litigation (1991) 232 </em>Cal.App.3d 572, 585 [283 Cal.Rptr. 732].) In exercising its discretion, the trial court must make a reasoned judgment that complies with applicable legal principles and policies. <em>(Henriksen </em>v. <em>Great American Savings &amp; Loan (1992) </em>11 Cal.App.4th 109, 113 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 184].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-7\">The disqualification issue impacts each party\u2019s concerns, such as the right to counsel of choice, and professional ethical considerations, such as client confidentiality and trust. It also implicates public trust \u201c \u2018in the scrupulous administration of justice and the integrity of the bar.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tracinda Corp. </em>(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1832, 1838 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 327], italics omitted.) The importance of a disqualification motion mandates a careful review of the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion. <em>(Ibid.; </em>see also <em>Western Digital Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1471, 1480 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 179].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-8\">In deciding whether the trial court abused its discretion, \u201c[w]e are . . . bound ... by the substantial evidence rule. [Citations.] . . . The judgment of the trial court is presumed correct; all intendments and presumptions are indulged to support the judgment; conflicts in the declarations must be resolved in favor of the prevailing party, and the trial court\u2019s resolution of any factual disputes arising from the evidence is conclusive. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Zimmerman </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 556, 561-562 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 132].) We presume the court found in Wiz\u2019s favor on all disputed factual issues. <em>(Responsible Citizens </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1717, 1734 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 756].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-9\">The trial court\u2019s disqualification, order was grounded on rule 3-310(E) of the Rules of Professional Conduct of the State Bar, which provides: \u201cA member shall not, without the informed written consent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1404\">*1404</page-number>client or former client, accept employment adverse to the client or former client where, by reason of the representation of the client or former client, the member has obtained confidential information material to the employment.\u201d (See <em>In re Marriage of Zimmerman, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th at pp. 562-563 [invoking the rule].) An attorney-client relationship must have existed before disqualification is proper. (See <em>Responsible Citizens </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>16 Cal.App,4th at p. 1723 [considering the attorney-client relationship as determinative].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-5\">The court in <em>Responsible Citizens </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th 1717 set forth the appropriate standards for determining whether an attorney-client relationship existed: \u201c \u2018Except for those situations where an attorney is appointed by the court, the attorney-client relationship is created by some form of contract, express or implied, formal or informal. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citations.] . . . [f] \u2018An implied contract is one, the existence and terms of which are manifested by conduct.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018The distinction between express and implied in fact contracts relates only to the manifestation of assent; both types are based upon the expressed or apparent intention of the parties.\u2019 [Citation.] HD . . . [f] . . . [I]n determining whether an attorney-client relationship exists . . . primary attention should be given to whether the totality of the circumstances, including the parties\u2019 conduct, implies an agreement by the . . . attorney not to accept other representations adverse to the [putative client\u2019s] personal interests. (See Friedman, <em>The Creation of the Attorney-Client Relationship: An Emerging View </em>[(1986)] 22 Cal. W[estern] L.Rev. [209,] 231 suggesting that one of the most important facts involved in finding an attorney-client relationship is \u2018the expectation of the client based on how the situation appears to a reasonable person in the client\u2019s position.\u2019) fl[] . . . [H] The question of whether an attorney-client relationship exists is one of law. [Citation.] However, when the evidence is conflicting, the factual basis for the determination must be determined before the legal question is addressed. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1732-1733, italics omitted.) In deference to the trial court\u2019s presumed findings, factual disputes are resolved in Wiz\u2019s favor. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1734.) With these principles in mind, we review the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-6\">Wiz asserts we need only review Stroock\u2019s billing to Wiz to affirm the appeal. But payment of attorney fees alone does not determine an attorney-client relationship; it is merely a factor. <em>(Lasky, Haas, Cohler &amp; Munter </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 264, 285 [218 Cal.Rptr. 205].) The underwriting agreement, which Wiz signed, and the prospectus rebut any inference arising from the billing. In both, Stroock was named as Strasbourger\u2019s attorneys, and Hand &amp; Hand was listed as Wiz\u2019s attorneys. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1405\">*1405</page-number>The underwriting agreement provided Wiz would pay Stroock\u2019s fees for the blue sky compliance. Nothing in the record indicates the billing or payment was based on a relationship other than that set forth in the agreement\u2014Wiz was to pay Strasbourger\u2019s lawyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-5\">Any inference to the contrary is rebutted by the habit and custom of parties in stock underwriting transactions. The company traditionally pays for the blue sky work done by the underwriter\u2019s counsel. (See 2A Haft, Venture Capital and Small Business Financings (1991) \u00a7 5A.01 p. 5A-3 et seq.; Bloomenthal, Going Public Handbook (1996 ed.) \u00a7 3.12(3), (5), pp. 3-77 to 3-78.) A savvy company involved in a stock offering would not consider the underwriter\u2019s counsel to be its attorney simply because it performed blue sky work for the transaction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1207-6\">Wiz asserts <em>International Tele-Marine </em>v. <em>Malone &amp; Associates </em>(D.Colo. 1994) 845 F.Supp. 1427 compels a contrary conclusion. The case involved a stock offering with an underwriting agreement under which the underwriter\u2019s counsel was to perform functions similar to those Stroock performed, and the company was to pay the underwriter\u2019s counsel for its blue sky work. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1431-1432.) The company and the underwriter\u2019s counsel entered into another agreement, however. That agreement was consistent with the underwriting agreement in some respects but also referred to \u201c \u2018withdraw [al] as <em>counsel for [the company].\u2019 \u201d </em>The court found that language could be construed as creating an attorney-client relationship and denied summary judgment. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1432-1433.) Nothing in <em>International Tele-Marine </em>mandates a finding the evidence here was sufficient to establish an attorney-client relationship, particularly in the absence of any express representation by Stroock. Indeed, the <em>International Tele-Marine </em>court noted the mere performance of blue sky work in an offering does not create an attorney-client relationship between the underwriter\u2019s counsel and the issuing company. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1207-7\">Wiz also relies heavily on <em>Jack Eckerd Corp. </em>v. <em>Dart Group Corp. </em>(D. Del. 1985) 621 F.Supp. 725. In <em>Eckerd, </em>Dart wanted to obtain shares in another company, but wanted to avoid the restrictions inherent in being labeled an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the Investment Company Act of 1940. It hired First Boston Corporation, an investment banking firm, to advise it. First Boston obtained the services of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson (Fried, Frank) in connection with the work. Fried, Frank received permission from Dart\u2019s regular outside counsel to confer with Dart. One of Fried, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1406\">*1406</page-number>Frank\u2019s attorneys obtained information from Dart and prepared a complex memorandum discussing the issue. By agreement with First Boston, Dart paid Fried, Frank\u2019s fee. When Jack Eckerd Corporation sued Dart later on a substantially related matter, Dart sought to have Fried, Frank disqualified as Eckerd\u2019s counsel. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 728-730.) The district court granted the motion, finding there had been at least an implied attorney-client relationship between Fried Frank, and Dart. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 731-732.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-5\">Although the fact situations of <em>Eckerd </em>and this case are similar, the distinctions mandate a different result. No agreement, like the one here, designated Fried, Frank as First Boston\u2019s counsel. To the contrary, First Boston was required to obtain Dart\u2019s approval of the counsel First Boston obtained for the work. (621 F.Supp at p. 732.) Indeed, the district court in <em>Eckerd </em>found First Boston acted as Dart\u2019s agent in obtaining Fried, Frank. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 733.) And, unlike the blue sky work here, which inured to Strasbourger\u2019s benefit, the memorandum Fried, Frank prepared affected only Dart\u2019s interests. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 732.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-6\">Despite this lack of support from out-of-state federal district court cases, Wiz points to several factors it claims supported the trial court\u2019s conclusion Stroock represented Wiz. Wiz\u2019s president, Arthur Tendler, submitted a declaration stating Stroock \u201cadvised Wiz in connection with [blue sky issues],\u201d and Tendler \u201chad numerous contacts with Stroock lawyers ... in connection with these matters.\u201d Wiz\u2019s lawyer, Hand, offered a declaration asserting Stroock \u201cdirectly represented WIZ in connection with blue sky state securities registrations; matters involving the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; matters involving the U. S. Securities &amp; Exchange Commission; and matters involving the American Stock Exchange.\u201d Hand also alleged Stroock \u201ccame into possession of confidential and proprietary WIZ information,\u201d which could be measured by \u201ceverything that WIZ told to Stroock, less only that information that was publicly disclosed in regulatory filings . . . .\u201d Hand alluded to Stroock\u2019s due diligence work as a primary source of the information.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1208-7\">In light of the express underwriting terms and the normal practices in stock offerings through underwriters, these facts do not rise to the level of substantial evidence Stroock represented Wiz. Tendler made the conclusory statement Stroock advised Wiz on the blue sky issues, but he gave no particulars. Hand appended a letter from a Stroock legal assistant that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1407\">*1407</page-number>claimed supported the assertion Stroock represented Wiz. The letter merely \u201cadvised\u201d Wiz it needed to send the Pennsylvania Securities Division originals of certain documents instead of copies, or the Pennsylvania Securities Commission would issue a stop order on issuance of the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-5\">This flimsy \u201cevidence\u201d speaks volumes. The only reasonable inference that can be drawn from it is Stroock\u2019s advice to Wiz was limited to perfunctory instructions necessary for blue sky compliance. It is not the type of evidence that connotes attorney representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-6\">Hand\u2019s declaration asserts Stroock represented Wiz on matters other than blue sky compliance involved in the offering. Notably absent from Wiz\u2019s evidence is a bill from Stroock for any other alleged work. We cannot believe Stroock would represent Wiz in these other matters on a pro bono basis. No rational trier of fact could conclude Wiz <em>reasonably </em>believed Stroock did.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-7\">Hand also appended to his declaration a letter from the Pennsylvania Securities Commission to Wiz that Hand claimed showed a Stroock attorney represented he was counsel for Wiz. But the letter merely refers to the attorney as \u201ccounsel representing the Wiz <em>Offering </em>before the Commission.\u201d (Italics added.) Even if we assume the letter\u2019s author had personal knowledge on that point, the letter does not show Stroock, or any firm members, ever held itself out as Wiz\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-8\">As Strasbourger correctly notes, Wiz apparently bases at least part of its argument Stroock represented it on its misperceptions that Wiz designated the states where the offering was to be made, and that Wiz was responsible for blue sky compliance. Pursuant to the underwriting agreement Strasbourger designated the states where offerings would be made. This made sense because Strasbourger made a \u201cfirm commitment\u201d to purchase all the stock in the offering, making Strasbourger solely responsible for its resale. (See Loss &amp; Seligman, Securities Regulation (3d ed. 1989) p. 324.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-9\">Wiz also errs by assuming it was solely responsible for blue sky compliance. The Uniform Securities Act, which many states have adopted, mandates registration of securities, but does not specify who must register them. (7B West\u2019s U. Laws Ann. (1985) U. Securities Act \u00a7 414(a); see Loss &amp; Seligman, Securities Regulation, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 98-99.) The registration may be filed \u201cby the issuer, any other person on whose behalf the offering is to be made, or a registered broker-dealer [licensed under this Act].\u201d (7B West\u2019s U. Laws Ann., <em>supra, </em>U. Securities Act \u00a7 305(a).) Typically, when an underwriting broker-dealer, like Strasbourger, purchases shares for resale, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1408\">*1408</page-number>underwriting agreement provides the underwriter\u2019s counsel will qualify the offering in each state where the underwriter wishes to make resales, as Stroock did. (See, e.g., 2A Haft, Venture Capital and Small Business Financings, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 5A.01, p. 5A-3 et seq.; Bloomenthal, Going Public Handbook, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 3-77 to 3-78.) The usual industry practice coupled with the underwriting agreement precluded Wiz from reasonably believing it was responsible for blue sky compliance or that Stroock represented it in the registration work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-5\">Two other factors reinforce the conclusion Stroock represented only Strasbourger in the blue sky compliance work and Wiz could not have reasonably believed otherwise: Strasbourger faced penalties if the offering was not properly registered and it had to perform a due diligence investigation to avoid liability for misstatements concerning the offering. As the broker-dealer in a firm commitment underwriting, Strasbourger was subject to disciplinary action if it sold unregistered securities. (See, e.g., 7B West\u2019s U. Laws Ann., <em>supra, </em>U. Securities Act \u00a7 204; Corp. Code, \u00a7 25212.) Strasbourger had the responsibility to ensure the stock offering was properly registered in each jurisdiction in which shares were to be sold. (See Loss &amp; Seligman, Securities Regulation, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 92-133; Bloomenthal, Going Public and the Public Corporation (1992) 9a-11 to 9a-13, 9a-22 to 9a-42.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-6\">Concerning due diligence, under the Securities Act of 1933, an underwriter is liable for any material misstatements in the registration statement. (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k (a).) The underwriter has a defense to such a claim if it can show it performed a reasonable investigation to ensure all necessary disclosures were made and were true. (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k(b)(3); and see <em>In re Software Toolworks Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1994) 38 F.3d 1078, 1083.) As Hand noted in his declaration, Stroock performed due diligence work for the offering. Hand asserted the work was done for Wiz, but 15 United States Code section 77k(b)(3) does not provide a due diligence defense for the stock issuer. Stroock could only have been doing the work for Strasbourger and Wiz could not have reasonably believed otherwise.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nor could Wiz reasonably believe Stroock represented Wiz or that information Wiz gave Stroock would be kept confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-7\">We do not lightly reject the trial court\u2019s implied findings, but all of the evidence suggested Stroock was Strasbourger\u2019s counsel during the offering, and none of the evidence except Wiz\u2019s unsupported conclusions and assumptions suggested the contrary. (See <em>Western Digital Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1409\">*1409</page-number><em>supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th at p. 1487 [disqualification order reversed; suspicion and conjecture cannot support a ruling when all evidence is to the contrary].) Wiz did not show the requisite attorney-client relationship to disqualify Stroock from the case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1211-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-6\">Strasbourger claims Stroock\u2019s representation of Wiz\u2019s former auditors did not give rise to a duty of confidentiality to Wiz. Wiz grounded its motion to disqualify Stroock, in part, on that representation, and the trial court may have based its ruling on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-7\">Wiz\u2019s argument on this point is not entirely clear. Wiz refers to a pronouncement concerning auditor-client confidentiality contained in the Statements of Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Standards Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. We presume Wiz does not argue for an auditor-client privilege since that contention has been soundly rejected. (See <em>Couch </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1973) 409 U.S. 322, 335 [93 S.Ct. 611, 619, 34 L.Ed.2d 548]; and see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Arthur Young &amp; Co. </em>(1984) 465 U.S. 805, 817-818 [104 S.Ct. 1495, 1502-1503, 79 L.Ed.2d 826] [no accountant-client privilege for tax accrual work papers]; <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1976) 425 U.S. 391 [96 S.Ct. 1569, 48 L.Ed.2d 39] [no inherent self-incrimination privilege for communications to accountant].) Instead, it appears Wiz asserts Stroock, as its former counsel, had a duty to maintain Wiz\u2019s confidences with Coopers. Wiz errs in its premise. As we explained, Stroock never represented Wiz.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-8\">Wiz also appears to contend Stroock had a duty to Wiz independent of any prior attorney-client relationship. To make this argument, Wiz relies heavily on <em>In re Complex Asbestos Litigation, supra, </em>232 Cal.App.3d 572, where the Court of Appeal upheld the disqualification of a law firm that hired a paralegal who had obtained attorney-client confidential information when he worked for the opposing party\u2019s lawyers. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 580-585, 599.) Wiz stresses the disqualified firm never had an attorney-client relationship with the opposing party and argues for the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-9\">But the <em>Complex Asbestos Litigation </em>court emphasized that its analysis \u201cdoes not mean that there is or should be any broad duty owed by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1410\">*1410</page-number>attorney to an opposing party to maintain that party\u2019s confidences in the absence of a prior attorney-client relationship. The imposition of such a duty would be antithetical to our adversary system and would interfere with the attorney\u2019s relationship with . . . clients. The courts have recognized repeatedly that attorneys owe no duty of care to adversaries in litigation or to those with whom their clients deal at arm\u2019s length. [Citations.]. Instead, we deal here with a prophylactic rule necessary to protect the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship and the integrity of the judicial system, and with the appropriate scope of the remedy supporting such a rule.\u201d (232 Cal.App.3d at p. 588.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-5\">In reaching that conclusion, the court distinguished <em>Maruman Integrated Circuits, Inc. </em>v. <em>Consortium Co. </em>(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 443 [212 Cal.Rptr. 497] and <em>Cooke </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 582 [147 Cal.Rptr. 915], which rejected the disqualification of attorneys who obtained the opposing party\u2019s confidential information from their own clients. <em>(In re Complex Asbestos Litigation, supra, </em>232 Cal.App.3d at pp. 589-591.) The <em>Complex Asbestos Litigation </em>court reasoned, \u201cMere exposure to the confidences of an adversary does not, standing alone, warrant disqualification. Protecting the integrity of judicial proceedings does not require so draconian a rule. Such a rule would nullify a party\u2019s right to representation by chosen counsel any time inadvertence or devious design put an adversary\u2019s confidences in an attorney\u2019s mailbox. ... [H] ... [H] The salient fact that distinguishes the present appeal from <em>Maruman </em>and <em>Cooke </em>is the person who disclosed the adverse party\u2019s attorney-client communications. If the disclosure is made by the attorney\u2019s own client, disqualification is neither justified nor an effective remedy. A party cannot \u2018improperly\u2019 disclose information to its own counsel in the prosecution of its own lawsuit. Even if counsel were disqualified, the party would be free to give new counsel the information, leaving the opposing party with the same situation. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Complex Asbestos Litigation, supra, </em>232 Cal.App.3d at pp. 589-591.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-6\">That reasoning and the balance of the court\u2019s discussion reveals the <em>Complex Asbestos Litigation </em>court fashioned a rule of disqualification clearly limited to cases where employees or agents of attorneys go to work for opposing counsel and bring confidential <em>attorney-client </em>information with them. (232 Cal.App.3d at pp. 587-596.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Wiz\u2019s case is distinguishable. As in <em>Maruman Integrated Circuits, Inc. </em>v. <em>Consortium Co., supra, </em>166 Cal.App.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1411\">*1411</page-number>443 and <em>Cooke </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>83 Cal.App.3d 582, any information Stroock obtained concerning the Coopers audit came from its client, Coopers. As such, it could not form the basis for disqualification. <em>(Maruman Integrated Circuits, Inc. </em>v. <em>Consortium Co., supra, </em>166 Cal.App.3d at pp. 447-451; <em>Cooke </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>83 Cal.App.3d at pp. 590-592.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1213-5\">The order disqualifying Stroock is reversed. Strasbourger is entitled to its costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-6\">Sills, P. J., and Sonenshine, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-7\">Respondent\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied May 19, 1999.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1204-8\">Preliminarily, Wiz suggests the disqualification order is not appealable. Not so. It is appealable, at least, as an order granting an injunction. <em>(In re Lee G. </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 17, 25, fn. 4 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 375]; <em>Vivitar Corp. </em>v. <em>Broidy </em>(1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 878, 881 [192 Cal.Rptr. 281]; <em>Chronometrics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sysgen, Inc. </em>(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 597, 599, fn. 1 [168 Cal.Rptr. 196]; and see <em>Conservatorship of Rich </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1233, 1236 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 459].) On the merits, we will conclude Strasbourger\u2019s second and fifth arguments have merit and mandate reversal, obviating the need to consider the others.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1207-8\">Jehu Hand, of Hand &amp; Hand, Wiz\u2019s counsel, has \u201cconsiderable background and expertise in securities law matters.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1208-8\">Wiz also mentions the opinion of its experts as a basis for concluding Stroock represented Wiz, but the experts never addressed that issue. Instead, they <em>assumed </em>the representation as part of the facts they used to conclude the representation was improper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1210-8\">We find nothing in the record suggesting Stroock ever affirmatively represented to Wiz anything to the contrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1211-10\">Because we reach this conclusion, we need not address Strasbourger\u2019s argument the trial court erred by failing to show on the record it considered proper factors when it ruled on the motion. (See <em>Smith, Smith &amp; Kring </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 573, 582 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 507] [\u201c. . . trial judges must indicate on the record they have considered the appropriate factors and make specific findings of fact when weighing the conflicting interests involved in recusal motions.\u201d].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1212-7\"><em>At </em>Wiz\u2019s invitation, we have reviewed several cases it asserts \u201c[c]onfirm[] the holding of <em>[Complex Asbestos </em>Litigation].\u201d Nothing in any of them alters our interpretation of the case. All of them involved a current or prior attorney-client relationship between the attorneys for whom disqualification was sought and the party seeking disqualification. None of them cited <em>Complex Asbestos Litigation, </em>if at all, for the proposition disqualification can be had absent an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1411\">*1411</page-number>attorney-client relationship. Indeed, most of the cases pre-dated <em>Complex Asbestos Litigation, </em>so they could hardly \u201cconfirm\u201d its holding.
