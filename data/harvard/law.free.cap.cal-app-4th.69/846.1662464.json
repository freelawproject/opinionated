Many of us can relate to this phenomenon by reflecting upon our own experience behind the wheel of a car when a driver cuts too close to your vehicle, and \u201croad rage\u201d sets in.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">The roots of this case are planted in a simple street scene. A group of men were crossing the road when Alex Bernal sped around the comer in his vehicle, and had to quickly brake. Words were exchanged, threats were hurled, and moments later Bernal was dying with a knife wound to his heart.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-10\">What makes this case unusual is defense counsel\u2019s attempt to introduce expert testimony on the sociology of poverty, and the role of honor, paternalism, and street fighters in the Hispanic culture. Although interesting, we conclude the trial court correctly decided this evidence was irrelevant to 1) whether defendant <em>actually </em>believed he was in imminent danger of death or great bodily injury; and 2) whether such a belief was <em>objectively </em>reasonable. In the words of the trial court, we are not prepared to sanction a \u201creasonable street fighter standard.\u201d The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">By information, defendant was charged with the murder of Alex Bernal. (Pen. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 187.) It was further alleged defendant personally used a knife in the commission of the murder. (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Defendant pled not guilty and denied the knife use allegation. A jury found him guilty of second degree murder, and determined the knife use allegation to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">Defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was denied. Probation was also denied, and defendant was sentenced to prison for a term of 15 years to life on the murder, plus an enhancement of 1 year for the knife use, for a total of 16 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">Timely notice of appeal was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-9\">Factual History</p>\n<p id=\"b791-10\">In the late hours of August 3, and the early hours of August 4, 1995, defendant, Allen Powell, defendant\u2019s brother, Freddy Romero, Michael Madera, Jackie Fisher and Caytano Robles III (Junior), were all together at Junior\u2019s father\u2019s house in Modesto drinking alcohol. At some point they decided to walk to Diana Cantu\u2019s apartment to continue the party.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-11\">As they crossed the sheet near the comer of Riverside and Miller Streets, a car came speeding around the comer. The vehicle braked quickly to allow the group to cross the street. Some of the members of the group, including defendant, angrily yelled at the driver, Alex Bemal, to slow down. Bemal stated they should move out of the way, and that he was looking for somebody. He then sped up, and defendant again yelled at him to slow down.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-12\">At this point, Bemal pulled the car over and parked by the sidewalk. Defendant walked across the street toward the car shouting obscenities. Junior also approached the car on the passenger side. Bemal then pushed the driver\u2019s door open with his foot and kicked toward defendant, who was approaching him. Defendant backed off a little. As they swore at each other, Bemal said he was just looking for his daughter, Carolina, but also kept stating, \u201cYou want to fight? Come on, let\u2019s fight then.\u201d Defendant responded that he did not care that Bemal was looking for someone; he still should not have come around the comer so fast. Defendant also stated, \u201c \u2018I\u2019ll fight, I\u2019ll <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>fight. . . \u201d When Powell heard Bernal say he was looking for Carolina, he told the group that Bernal was Carolina\u2019s father, and to \u201csettle down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Bernal then kicked off his shoes and began kicking into the air. Freddy Romero testified that both defendant and Junior fought with Bernal. After Bernal attempted to kick defendant and Junior, defendant struck Bernal in the chest with his bare hand. Then, Junior hit Bernal with his fist. Bernal fell, and defendant started walking away. Bernal also began to walk away, however, he yelled, \u201c \u2018I\u2019ll be back.\u2019 \u201d At this point, defendant took out a knife, unfolded it, held it by the grip, and swung it twice at Bernal missing both times. After another swing, Bernal stated, \u201c \u2018I\u2019m bleeding, you cut me.\u2019 \u201d Everyone then left.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Allen Powell testified that both defendant and Junior approached Bernal as he attempted to get out of his car. When he opened the door, Powell saw that Junior had a knife and made a stabbing motion toward Bernal. It appeared that Junior made contact with Bernal, but Powell could not tell whether Junior had stabbed him. Bernal then began kicking, trying to get out of the car, however, he did not appear to be hurt. Although Junior remained in the area with defendant, Junior did not do anything else. Bernal kicked three or four times in the air, but never hit anyone. Bernal then took up a boxer\u2019s stance, ready to fight. He swung at defendant, but defendant dodged the blow and punched Bernal in the chest. Defendant immediately stepped back. Powell did not see a knife in defendant\u2019s hands. However, Bernal backed up and began to hold his chest. Bernal stated, \u201c \u2018My heart, my heart. Stabbed me in my heart.\u2019 \u201d As Bernal held his chest, Powell saw blood dripping down his fingers and onto his feet. Everyone began to walk away. Powell asked Bernal if he was all right. Bernal simply stated \u201c \u2018I\u2019ll be back. I\u2019ll be back.\u2019 \u201d Bernal then walked toward some apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">Michael Madera testified that it was not much of a fight. Bernal and defendant were fighting, and as Madera approached they were holding each other. As Madera got closer, he recognized Bernal as Carolina\u2019s father. He stated, \u201c \u2018Hey, man, this is Carolina\u2019s dad.\u2019 \u201d Madera grabbed defendant and pulled him off Bernal. As they separated, Bernal kept saying, \u201c \u2018I\u2019m going to come back for you. I\u2019m going to come back for you.\u2019 \u201d He also said, \u201c \u2018You little punk, I\u2019m going to get you.\u2019 \u201d Defendant became angry and hit Bernal once in the chest. Bernal grabbed his heart and said, \u201c \u2018I\u2019ve been stabbed. Go get my daughter.\u2019 \u201d Madera did not see a weapon in defendant\u2019s hand. He never saw Junior, who stayed on the sidewalk, go near Bernal. As everyone left, the last words he heard from Bernal were \u201c \u2018I\u2019ll be back.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">The group walked toward their friend\u2019s apartment and stood outside. Within 15 minutes, a police vehicle and an ambulance arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>Officer Moniz was dispatched to Miller and Riverside at 2:34 a.m. on August 4, 1995, regarding a stabbing. On his way, Moniz saw a shirtless man on the comer of Yosemite and Miller, who appeared to be out of breath. Moniz stopped and made contact with him. He noticed blood spatters on a T-shirt the man was holding, and on his tennis shoes. The man identified himself as Tommy Romero and then as Tommy Munoz. Moniz noticed abrasions on his upper arms, dried blood on his left palm, and lacerations on his right hand. The man was later determined to be defendant, and was taken to the Modesto police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Detectives Owen and Hendee later found two knives in a field approximately two hundred yards from the comer of Miller and Riverside. Officer Siville spoke with Bemal for over 30 minutes at the Stanislaus County Medical Center. Bemal was able to respond affirmatively when asked if he knew who stabbed him. However, he was in great pain and could give no further responses before he died.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Doctor Thomas Beaver, a pathologist and coroner, testified that he performed the autopsy on Bemal. Bernal was stabbed once in the right and once in the left side of the chest. He died from a stab wound to the heart. There were no defensive wounds on the victim\u2019s hands, arms or feet. Dr. Beaver opined that the knife which caused the wounds probably had a single-edged blade. A knife identified as People\u2019s exhibit 1 was capable of causing the fatal wound to Bemal. Bemal had a blood-alcohol level of .12 percent at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">Criminalist John Yoshida conducted protein and enzyme analyses on the blood samples collected from Bemal, defendant, the knives found in the field, and from the crime scene. He found that defendant\u2019s phosphoglucomutase (PGM) type is 2 plus, 1 minus, and Bernal\u2019s was a 1 plus. Both defendant and Bemal tested as ACP type B. Defendant had an esterase D type 1, while Bemal had a 2, 1, type.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">A comparison of the bloodstains with the known blood types of Bemal and defendant disclosed the following information: the blood on the asphalt was consistent with Bernal\u2019s and not defendant\u2019s blood; a stain on one of the knives was consistent with Bernal\u2019s types; a stain on the other knife was consistent with defendant\u2019s blood types; and the bloodstains on defendant\u2019s T-shirt and right shoe were consistent with Bernal\u2019s types.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">\n<em>Defense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">Defendant testified that when Bemal came around the comer in the car, he yelled, \u201cSlow down, fool.\u201d After Bemal parked and got out of his car, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>and defendant began fighting. Defendant separated from the group and approached the driver because he felt he had to protect his younger brother. The fighting stopped, and defendant started to walk away. Bernal then struck him from behind. At this point defendant retrieved a knife from an unknown person, and began swinging it at Bernal to scare him away. As defendant swung the knife, Bernal was backing up. Defendant testified, \u201cI had to stop him. From there, I didn\u2019t think of nothing else, you know.\u201d Bernal kicked at defendant a couple times, and defendant swung the knife at him. His only intention was to stop Bernal, who was kicking toward him. Defendant, however, admitted, \u201cI can\u2019t say that I was scared.\u201d Defendant felt he had to stop Bernal from getting past him. However, he said, \u201cI can\u2019t explain me doing what I did to him . . . .\u201d Defendant acknowledged stabbing Bernal in the heart, but claimed he was attempting to stab Bernal in the leg. While admitting responsibility for Bernal\u2019s death, defendant maintained he never intended anyone to die.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Defendant testified he never saw Bernal with any weapons. He admitted Bernal never did or said anything to give defendant a reason to think Bernal was out to get his brother. When asked what caused him to think he had to stab Bernal to protect his brother, defendant responded: \u201cI don\u2019t know where my brother was standing, who was doing what, where. All I know I couldn\u2019t let [Bernal] get there.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t let him pass me.\u201d \u201cAll I know is to stop that guy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Other defense witnesses testified to Bernal\u2019s drinking problem, his temper, and his violent past. One witness, James Howard, testified that in 1979, his passenger/friend had thrown a shot glass at Bernal\u2019s car. In retaliation, Bernal shot Howard\u2019s car with a shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">I. <em>The court properly excluded the testimony of a proposed expert witness regarding self-defense in the Hispanic culture.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">Defendant contends the trial court erred by ruling that the proposed testimony of Martin Sanchez Jankowski, a sociology professor, was irrelevant and inadmissible.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to defense counsel, Professor Jankowski had authored a book and numerous articles on the subject of street violence, and was an expert in Hispanic culture. We reject the claim of error and, in any event, find defendant was not prejudiced by the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>Defendant cites <em>People </em>v. <em>Humphrey </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 1073 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 142, 921 P.2d 1] in support of his position that the proposed testimony was relevant.  At pages 1082-1083, <em>Humphrey </em>summarized the law on self-defense as it relates to the use of deadly force:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-5\">\u201cFor killing to be in self-defense, the defendant must actually and reasonably believe in the need to defend. [Citation.] If the belief subjectively exists but is objectively unreasonable, there is \u2018imperfect self-defense,\u2019 i.e., \u2018the defendant is deemed to have acted without malice and cannot be convicted of murder,\u2019 but can be convicted of manslaughter. [Citation.] To constitute \u2018perfect self-defense,\u2019 i.e., to exonerate the person completely, the belief must also be objectively reasonable. [Citations.] As the Legislature has stated, \u2018[T]he circumstances must be sufficient to excite the fears of a reasonable person . . . .\u2019 (Pen. Code, \u00a7 198; see also \u00a7 197, subds. 2, 3.) Moreover, for either perfect or imperfect self-defense, the fear must be of imminent harm. \u2018Fear of future harm\u2014no matter how great the fear and no matter how great the likelihood of the harm\u2014will not suffice. The defendant\u2019s fear must be of <em>imminent </em>danger to life or great bodily injury.\u2019 [Citation.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-6\">\u201cAlthough the belief in the need to defend must be objectively reasonable, a jury must consider what \u2018would appear to be necessary to a reasonable person in a similar situation and with similar knowledge . . . .\u2019 (CALJIC No. 5.50.) It judges reasonableness \u2018from the point of view of a reasonable person in the position of defendant . . . .\u2019 [Citation.] To do this, it must consider all the \u2018 \u201c \u2018facts and circumstances ... in determining whether the defendant acted in a manner in which a <em>reasonable man </em>would act in protecting his own life or bodily safety.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 [Citation.] As we stated long ago, \u2018. . . a defendant is entitled to have a jury take into consideration all the elements in the case which might be expected to operate on his mind . . . .\u2019[Citation.]\u201d (13 Cal.4th at pp. 1082-1083, fn. omitted.)  With these principles in mind, we consider the relevance of Professor Jankowski\u2019s proposed testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">According to defense counsel, Professor Jankowski\u2019s expertise deals with the sociology of poverty. He would testify that (1) street fighters have a special understanding of what is expected of them; (2) for a street fighter in the Hispanic culture, there is no retreat; (3) the Hispanic culture is based on honor, and honor defines a person; and (4) in this culture a person \u201cwould be responsible to take care of someone,\u201d i.e., defendant had a strong motivation to protect his younger brother. Stated differently, \u201cHe\u2019s the eldest male. He would assume a paternalistic role whether he wanted to or not. Something is expected of him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>Given the law, we conclude the testimony of Professor Jankowski was irrelevant to whether defendant actually believed he was in imminent danger of death or great bodily injury, and whether such a belief was <em>objectively </em>reasonable. We are unsure what defendant means by his reference to the sociology of poverty, and how it might affect his actual beliefs and the <em>objective </em>reasonableness of those beliefs. Similarly, even if we assume street fighters have a special understanding of what is expected of them, and that this is something with which the jurors are not acquainted, why is it relevant? Are street fighters expected to kill every person they fight with, regardless of the circumstances? If so, does this expectation replace or relax the legal requirement that before deadly force may be used a person must actually fear imminent death or great bodily injury? As noted by the trial court, \u201cThen you\u2019re creating a separate standard for what you call street fighters.\u201d No authority or case law has been cited which supports a separate standard, and we decline to adopt one here. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Humphrey, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 1087 [\u201cOur decision would not, in another context, compel adoption of a \u2018 \u201creasonable gang member\u201d standard.\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">In the same vein, whether a person should or should not retreat from a \u201cstreet fight,\u201d has no bearing on whether that person may lawfully use deadly force. A decision not to retreat from a physical confrontation and a decision to kill are two separate acts and involve different mental exercises. The laws governing self-defense recognize these distinctions and apply different rules to these legal concepts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While defendant attempted to blur the distinctions between the laws governing self-defense, the trial court correctly did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The evidence regarding honor, like evidence of street fighter mentality, is not relevant to whether deadly force was warranted under the circumstances. Is there honor in killing an unarmed man, and assuming that in defendant\u2019s mind it was the honorable thing to do, how does this relate to self-defense? Clearly, the question of defendant\u2019s honor was irrelevant to whether defendant was in actual fear of death or great bodily injury, and whether his fear was objectively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>Finally, even if defendant had a strong motivation to protect his younger brother, this does not answer the question of why it was necessary to use deadly force. Self-defense and defense of another are both recognized in the law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, as with the legal concept that one need not retreat, motive is only part of the question. Assuming defendant was justified in using force to defend himself and/or to protect his brother, the question of whether he could use deadly force was a separate issue. Any expert testimony regarding honor, tradition, street mentality, culture, paternalism, poverty or sociology simply was irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Minifie </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 1055 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 133, 920 P.2d 1337, 55 A.L.R.5th 835], does not help defendant\u2019s argument. There, the court held it was error for the trial court to have excluded evidence that the defendant (who shot a man that knocked him down and threatened to hit him with a crutch) had been threatened by members of a group who Minifie believed were associated with the victim. Unlike in <em>Minifie, </em>the testimony excluded in this case had nothing to do with a prior threat received by defendant from someone he associated with the victim. <em>Minifie </em>is not analogous to the issue here\u2014the propriety of excluding sociological evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Similarly, <em>People </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 648 [47 Cal.Rptr. 801, 408 P.2d 129] does not help defendant. There, the evidence excluded was testimony from independent witnesses of prior incidents where the victim allegedly attacked other persons, sometimes with a knife. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 656.) In this case, defendant was permitted to, and did, present evidence of prior acts of violence by the victim. Thus, no error under the <em>Davis </em>rationale occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Romero </em>(Cal.App., B051210), cited by defendant, was deleted from the official published reports following a grant of review by the California Supreme Court. The appellate court decision was therefore superseded. Since the Supreme Court did not subsequently reorder the Court of Appeal opinion to be published pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 976(d), it is not citable as authority under California Rules of Court, rule 977(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">Finally, defendant relies on <em>People </em>v. <em>Vu </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 810 [278 Cal.Rptr. 153] for his contention that the exclusion of Professor Jankowski\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>testimony was error. There the court found the exclusion of an expert\u2019s testimony to be harmless error. The expert witness, a psychologist, was to testify about the effects of stress on perception to show that defendant\u2019s actual view of events may have differed from reality due to stress and preconceived expectations about what might happen. The defendant had testified he started to leave the apartment where his archenemy lived, after hearing someone call out to remove a gun and grenade. As he entered an alley, the victim, Cong Phan, and another man followed him. When he heard someone mention taking out a gun, and fearing he would be shot, he turned and shot Cong Phan. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 813-815.) The court held the expert testimony was admissible \u201cbecause defendant claimed he honestly believed Cong Phan was trying to hurt him.\u201d The expert testimony \u201cwould have supported defendant\u2019s argument that stress and expectations caused him to honestly perceive a threat where no threat was intended or apparent to others at the scene.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 814.) However, since the jury rejected the charge of attempted murder and convicted the defendant of voluntary manslaughter on the theory of imperfect self-defense, the defendant was not prejudiced by the exclusion of the expert\u2019s testimony. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 814, 815.)</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Putting aside the question of whether <em>Vu </em>was correctly decided, it is distinguishable. Here, unlike in <em>Vu, </em>defendant did not testify he was in imminent fear for his life at the time he stabbed Bernal. Thus, whatever stress he was under or expectation he had when he first started fighting with Bernal changed after it became obvious Bernal was not armed. Any preconceived notion defendant may have had about Bernal having a gun disappeared when Bernal fought by simply kicking into the air, and defendant could see he was unarmed. Under these circumstances, either defendant accidentally stabbed Bernal in the heart while attempting to stab his leg, as defendant testified, or he intentionally stabbed Bernal in the heart with malice aforethought, as established by the prosecution. Either way, defendant was not in fear of imminent death or great bodily injury when he stabbed Bernal. Although only defendant knows what his actual motivation was for stabbing Bernal, even his own testimony indicates it was not fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Further, no sociological expert could have provided this missing mental state of defendant\u2019s actual subjective state of mind at the time he stabbed Bernal. Therefore, even assuming Professor Janskowski could provide relevant testimony about street fighting, Hispanic honor and paternalism, its exclusion was harmless. Absent evidence that defendant was in fear of imminent death or great bodily injury, the jury had no evidentiary basis from which to conclude that defendant <em>subjectively </em>had an actual but unreasonable fear which negated malice aforethought. Thus, it is not reasonably probable that but for exclusion of the proffered evidence, defendant would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>received a more favorable result. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].)</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">II., III.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">Dibiaso, Acting P.
