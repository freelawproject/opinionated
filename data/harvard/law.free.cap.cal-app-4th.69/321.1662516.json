The hatch was negligently maintained by the building owner. In a personal injury action by the employee, is the building owner covered by an endorsement to the contractor\u2019s commercial general liability policy making the owner an additional insured \u201cbut only with respect to liability arising out of\u2019 the contractor\u2019s work for the owner? Like the great majority of courts in other jurisdictions where such issues have been considered, we conclude the additional insured endorsement applies, whether the clause in question is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>considered ambiguous and thus construed in favor of coverage, or whether it is given the broad meaning generally accorded to the term \u201carising out of\u2019 in contracts of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Acceptance Insurance Company (AIC) appeals from judgments in favor of respondents Reliance Insurance Company of Illinois (Reliance), and Syufy Enterprises and related entities (collectively, Syufy). The judgments were entered after the trial court granted summary judgment motions by Reliance and Syufy. At issue is whether Syufy is covered by the additional insured endorsement obtained by AIC\u2019s named insured, C &amp; C Building Automation Company (C &amp; C), which performed electrical work for Syufy. Because there is a cross-complaint by Syufy pending in the trial court, we have dismissed the appeal from the judgment obtained by Syufy under the one final judgment rule. <em>(Morehart </em>v. <em>County of Santa Barbara </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 725, 743 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 804, 872 P.2d 143].) However, the Reliance judgment is properly before us, and the parties raise the same issue regarding both judgments. We affirm the Reliance judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The relevant facts are undisputed. C &amp; C contracted with Syufy to upgrade the lighting and temperature controls at a theater owned by Syufy. Although the contract stated \u201cOwner is to carry necessary insurance,\u201d C &amp; C requested its commercial general liability insurer, AIC, to provide additional insured coverage to Syufy. The endorsement issued by AIC provided that Syufy was included as an insured under the policy, \u201cbut only with respect to liability arising out of \u2018your work\u2019 for that insured by or for you.\u201d The policy specified that \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d referred to C &amp; C, the named insured. It defined \u201cyour work\u201d as \u201c[w]ork or operations performed by you or on your behalf.\u201d Syufy was also covered by a policy from Reliance, which by its terms was excess to. other insurance available to Syufy, and which included a self-insured retention of $150,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">In April 1994, C &amp; C employee Kurt Weber was working on the roof of Syufy\u2019s theater. His wife was visiting him on the job. Weber took a break to take his wife to the airport, after which he planned to return to work. A roof hatch provided the only access to and from the roof. As Weber was climbing down through the hatch, it fell and severed one of his fingers. Weber sued Syufy, alleging his injury was the result of Syufy\u2019s failure to provide and maintain a safe closing mechanism on the hatch, and its failure to warn him about the hatch\u2019s defective condition. Syufy tendered the defense of Weber\u2019s action to AIC, and AIC accepted the tender without reservation. Through investigation and discovery, AIC eventually learned that Weber was leaving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>to take his wife to the airport at the time of the accident, and that neither he nor any C &amp; C employee ever did any work on the hatch. AIC also came to believe that Syufy had known for several years that the hatch was defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">AIC sent Syufy a letter advising that there was potentially no coverage under the additional insured endorsement. AIC asked Syufy to notify Reliance about the incident and about Reliance\u2019s duty to participate in the defense and indemnification of Weber\u2019s claim. AIC noted that a mandatory settlement conference was scheduled the next month, requested Syufy and Reliance to attend, and declared its intent to seek indemnification for any damages that did not arise out of C &amp; C\u2019s work. Thereafter, AIC funded a $400,000 settlement with Weber on Syufy\u2019s behalf. AIC then brought the instant action against Syufy and Reliance, seeking declaratory relief regarding the parties\u2019 rights and obligations in the defense and indemnification of Weber\u2019s claim, and equitable contribution or indemnification for the costs of defending and settling the Weber action.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The trial court granted Reliance\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that the AIC policy \u201cunambiguously provides coverage to Syufy for Syufy\u2019s independent negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Summary judgment is properly granted when there is no triable issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. When, as in this case, there is no dispute about the relevant facts, we exercise our independent judgment regarding their legal effect. The only issue before us involves the meaning and application of the language in AIC\u2019s policy, which is a pure issue of law. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c); <em>Old Republic Ins.

Co. </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 857, 868 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 107, 959 P.2d 265], citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">AIC contends the \u201cliability arising out of \u2018your work\u2019 \u201d clause of the additional insured endorsement is ambiguous, because it might be interpreted to include any liability arising while C &amp; C was on Syufy\u2019s premises to perform its work, or it might be restricted to liability arising directly from C &amp; C\u2019s work product. AIC suggests extrinsic evidence must be consulted to resolve the ambiguity. It argues that because the contract between Syufy and C &amp; C called on Syufy to \u201ccarry necessary insurance\u201d without requiring C &amp; C to name Syufy as an additional insured under C &amp; C\u2019s policy, the parties must have contemplated that the additional insured endorsement would cover Syufy only where C &amp; C\u2019s work or operations exposed Syufy to liability where none would otherwise exist. Because Weber was injured after he stopped working and was leaving the jobsite, through a roof hatch on which C &amp; C performed no work, and which injured him solely because of Syufy\u2019s negligent maintenance, there could be no coverage under the additional insured endorsement, according to AIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">There are several problems with AIC\u2019s analysis, even accepting its premise that the clause at issue is ambiguous. First, AIC fails to explain how the contract between Syufy and C &amp; C affected AIC\u2019s understanding of the additional insured endorsement\u2019s scope. If policy language appears ambiguous, we must first attempt to interpret the ambiguous provision in the sense the insurer believed the insured would reasonably and objectively have understood it when the policy was issued. <em>(Bank of the West </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1264-1265 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545].) The record does not indicate that AIC reviewed the contract between Syufy and C &amp; C before issuing the additional insured endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Second, the contract provision requiring Syufy to carry \u201cnecessary insurance\u201d does not logically support AIC\u2019s restrictive reading of the additional insured endorsement. Instead, the contract\u2019s insurance provision appears to be fundamentally inconsistent with the issuance of the endorsement. Additional insured coverage would not have been needed if Syufy were providing whatever insurance was \u201cnecessary\u201d for purposes of its contract with C &amp; C.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Finally, AIC fails to confront the familiar rule that when an ambiguity remains unresolved after considering the policy\u2019s language and context, and the parties\u2019 objectively reasonable expectations, then the ambiguity is resolved against the insurer and in favor of coverage. <em>(Foster-Gardner, Inc. </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co., supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 868; <em>Bank of the West </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 2 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1265.) No California precedent has construed an additional insured endorsement like the one before us, but in <em>Merchants Ins. Co. of New Hampshire, Inc. </em>v. <em>USF&amp;G </em>(1st Cir. 1998) 143 F.3d 5, the court applied Massachusetts law to an additional insured clause identical to AIC\u2019s, concluding that if the \u201carising out of\u2019 phrase were viewed as ambiguous it had to be construed liberally in favor of the additional insured and against the insurer, and thus would not exclude coverage for the additional insured\u2019s own negligence. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 9-10.) The same rationale has been followed in other cases involving similar additional insured provisions. (See, e.g., <em>Tishman Const. Corp. </em>v. <em>CNA Ins. Co. </em>(1997) 236 A.D.2d 211 [652 N.Y.S.2d 742, 743]; <em>Florida Power &amp; Light </em>v. <em>Penn America </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1995) 654 So.2d 276, 279; <em>McIntosh </em>v. <em>Scottsdale Ins. Co. </em>(10th Cir. 1993) 992 F.2d 251, 254 [applying Kansas law].)</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">AIC argues that even without considering the parties\u2019 underlying intent, its additional insured endorsement would not apply to Syufy\u2019s liability for Weber\u2019s injury under California case law interpreting the policy term \u201carising out of.\u201d AIC relies on cases involving automobile insurance covering liability \u201carising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use\u201d of an automobile. It cites <em>Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>Reed </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 1230, 1233 [248 Cal.Rptr. 11], for the proposition that there must be a causal connection between the use and the injury beyond a \u201cbut for\u201d link; the use of the vehicle must be a \u201cpredominating cause\u201d or a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in causing the injury. AIC cites <em>Pacific Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Truck Ins. Exch. </em>(1969) 270 Cal.App.2d 700, 704-705 [76 Cal.Rptr. 281], for the proposition that the negligence of another\u2014in that case, the negligent maintenance of a hoist by a shop owner that caused the insured\u2019s vehicle to fall on the insured\u2014 constitutes an intervening cause precluding coverage. AIC also notes that in <em>Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>Hansel </em>(1970) 12 Cal.App.3d 570, 574 [90 Cal.Rptr. 654], the court ruled that an injury arising from the \u201cuse\u201d of an automobile to break a bottle that was then wielded in a traffic altercation, and the \u201cuse\u201d of a car door as a shield, was \u201cnot the form of loss for which the automobile liability policy may reasonably be expected to provide indemnity.\u201d From these cases, AIC draws the analogy that its policy does not apply because Weber\u2019s presence on the roof to do.his job was not sufficiently causally connected with his injury, which was attributable solely to Syufy\u2019s negligent maintenance of the roof hatch.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">We are not persuaded. In each of the cases cited by AIC, the court took pains to distinguish automobile liability insurance from general liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>insurance, and accordingly to focus on the \u201cuse\u201d of a vehicle as a factor in the injury. <em>(Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>Reed, supra, </em>200 Cal.App.3d at p. 1233 [\u201c \u2018Clearly the parties to an automobile liability policy do not contemplate a general liability insurance contract.\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Pacific Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Truck Ins. Exch., supra, </em>270 Cal.App.2d at p. 704 [\u201cvehicle liability policies stop somewhere short of all-risk coverage\u201d]; <em>Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>Hansel, supra, </em>12 Cal.App.3d at p. 574 [\u201cwe reject appellant\u2019s contention that uninsured motorist coverage is a substitute for general . . . liability coverage\u201d]; see also <em>Continental Heller Corp. </em>v. <em>Amtech Mechanical Services, Inc. </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 500, 506, fn. 2 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 668] [\u201cWithout this restrictive interpretation of the causation requirement, automobile liability policies would be converted into general liability insurance contracts\u201d].) Here, we are determining coverage under a commercial general liability policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Furthermore, California courts have consistently given a broad interpretation to the terms \u201carising out of\u2019 or \u201carising from\u201d in various kinds of insurance provisions. It is settled that this language does not import any particular standard of causation or theory of liability into an insurance policy. Rather, it broadly links a factual situation with the event creating liability, and connotes only a minimal causal connection or incidental relationship. (See, e.g., the discussions in <em>Fibreboard Corp. </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 492, 503-505 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 376] [products hazard provision in general liability policy]; <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Salas </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 268, 274, fn. 4 [271 Cal.Rptr. 642] [exclusionary clause in homeowners policy]; <em>Continental Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>City of Richmond </em>(9th Cir. 1985) 763 F.2d 1076, 1080, applying California law [exclusionary clause in errors and omissions policy]; <em>Transport Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Schnack </em>(1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 149, 151-152 [182 Cal.Rptr. 256] [coverage clause in aircraft liability policy]; see also <em>Century Transit Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>American Empire Surplus Lines Ins. Co. </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 121, 127, fn. 4 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 567] [\u201cbased on\u201d term of exclusionary clause in general liability policy given same broad interpretation as \u201carising out of\"]; cf. <em>Charles E. Thomas Co. </em>v. <em>Transamerica Ins. Group </em>(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 379, 383-384 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 577] [exclusion of loss \u201carising out of . . . any request, demand, or order\u201d to monitor, clean up, or respond to pollutants did not apply to liability not resulting from any request, demand, or order].)</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Under this commonsense approach, Weber\u2019s injury clearly \u201carose out of\u2019 the work he was performing on the roof of Syufy\u2019s building. The relationship between the defective hatch and the job was more than incidental, in that Weber could not have done the job without passing through the hatch. The fact that the defect was attributable to Syufy\u2019s negligence is irrelevant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>since the policy language does not purport to allocate coverage according to fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">This reading of AIC\u2019s additional insured endorsement is consistent with the reasoning adopted in cases from other jurisdictions concerning the effect of additional insured provisions governing liability \u201carising out of \u2018your work\u2019 \u201d or \u201carising out of operations performed\u201d by the named insured. <em>(Merchants Ins. Co. of New Hampshire, Inc. </em>v. <em>USF&amp;G, supra, </em>143 F.3d at pp. 9-10, applying Massachusetts law [\u201carising out of\u2019 denotes \u201cintermediate causation standard\u201d between \u201cbut for\u201d and proximate cause; endorsement covered additional insured for its own negligence]; <em>Township of Springfield </em>v. <em>Ersek </em>(Pa.

Co. </em>v. <em>Northbrook Property </em>(1986) 150 Ill.App.3d 472 [103 Ill.Dec. 501 N.E.2d 812, 814-815] [\u201cbut for causation\u201d is sufficient; coverage does not depend on fault of named insured]; see also <em>Florida Power &amp; Light </em>v. <em>Penn America, supra, </em>654 So.2d at p. 279, approved in <em>Container Corp. of America </em>v. <em>MD Cas. Co. </em>(Fla. 1998) 707 So.2d 733, 737 [coverage \u201conly with respect to operations by or on behalf of the Named Insured\u201d did not require fault on part of named insured before additional insured would be included]; <em>Lim </em>v. <em>Atlas-Gem Erectors Co., Inc. </em>(1996) 225 A.D.2d 304 [638 N.Y.S.2d 946, 947] [negligence of additional insured was immaterial under provision covering it \u201c \u2018only with respect to operations performed by or on behalf of the Named Insured\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Our research has disclosed only one jurisdiction, Texas, which has taken a restrictive, fault-based view of an additional insured endorsement for liability \u201carising out of\u2019 work or operations performed by the named insured. In <em>Granite Const. </em>v. <em>Bituminous Ins. </em>(Tex.Civ.App. 1992) 832 S.W.2d 427, the named insured contracted to haul materials from a construction site, and obtained an additional insured endorsement covering the construction contractor \u201cbut only with respect to liability arising out of operations performed for [the additional insured] by or on behalf of the named insured.\u201d An employee whose truck overturned while he was driving sued the additional insured, alleging that his injuries were caused by its negligent loading of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>truck. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 428.) With little discussion, the court concluded \u201cit is at once obvious\u201d that the employee\u2019s claim arose out of the loading of the truck, which was the additional insured\u2019s sole responsibility, and not out of the hauling performed by the named insured, which was the only operation to which the additional insured endorsement applied. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 430; see also <em>Northern Ins. Co. of N.Y. </em>v. <em>Austin Commercial, Inc. </em>(N.D.Tex. 1994) 908 F.Supp. 436, 437 [following <em>Granite Construction, </em>and holding that similar additional insured endorsement only covered claims involving direct negligence by named insured].)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">We disagree with the Texas approach. It is inconsistent with the ordinary broad meaning of \u201carising out of,\u201d which as noted above has been regularly applied by California courts in insurance cases. This inconsistency leads to tortured results. In <em>Granite Construction, </em>the negligent loading of the named insured\u2019s truck caused no injury (and no liability) until the named insured\u2019s employee began hauling the load, in the course of which the truck overturned. It is difficult to understand how the driver\u2019s claim did not arise out of the hauling operation in the most direct way, unless one assumes that fault is a predicate for coverage. We do not believe such an assumption is justified by the policy term \u201cliability arising out of operations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Insurance companies are free to, and commonly have, issued additional insured endorsements that specifically limit coverage to situations in which the additional insured is faced with vicarious liability for negligent conduct by the named insured. (See, e.g., <em>Consolidation Coal Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. </em>(W.D.Pa. 1976) 406 F.Supp. 1292, 1294, fn. 2 [additional insured covered \u201conly with respect to acts or omissions of the named insured\u201d]; <em>Harbor Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(E.D.Pa. 1983) 562 F.Supp. 800, 801 [additional insureds covered \u201conly to the extent of liability resulting from occurrences arising out of negligence\u201d of the named insured]; <em>Maryland Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 21, 28 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 113] [additional insured covered \u201c\u2018only to the extent [the additional insured] is held liable for [the named insured\u2019s] acts or omissions arising out of and in the course of operations\u2019 \u201d].) We believe the better view is that when an insurer chooses not to use such clearly limited language in an additional insured clause, but instead grants coverage for liability \u201carising out of\u2019 the named insured\u2019s work, the additional insured is covered without regard to whether injury was caused by the named insured or the additional insured. <em>(Merchants Ins. Co. of New Hampshire, Inc. </em>v. <em>USF&amp;G, supra, </em>143 F.3d at p. 10; <em>Township of Springfield </em>v. <em>Ersek, supra, </em>660 A.2d at p. 676; <em>Consolidated Edison </em>v. <em>Hartford Ins.

However, because it provided its insureds with a broader additional insured endorsement than the ones before the <em>Maryland Casualty </em>and <em>Harbor </em>courts, AIC cannot take advantage of the reasoning in those cases. The same court that issued the <em>Harbor </em>opinion has made it clear that \u201c[t]he <em>Harbor </em>court interpreted specific contract language. It did not . . . articulate a rule of law limiting the interest of an additional insured on a comprehensive general liability policy to those cases in which it is vicariously liable for the acts of the primary policyholder.\u201d <em>(Philadelphia Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(E.D.Pa. 1989) 721 F.Supp. 740, 742 <em>(PECO).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">In <em>PECO, </em>the named insured, Davey Tree, obtained a certificate of insurance making PECO an additional insured \u201c \u2018for any work performed by [Davey Tree] on [PECO\u2019s] behalf.\u2019 \u201d (721 F.Supp. at p. 742.) The court held: \u201cThe contract language in this case contemplates a wider scope of coverage than the language in <em>Harbor. </em>If the parties had intended coverage to be limited to the vicarious liability type suggested by the defendants, language clearly embodying that intention was available\u2014that is the lesson of <em>Harbor. </em>Here, the language of the Certificate of Insurance should be read to include all liability arising in connection with Davey Tree\u2019s work, including PECO\u2019s own negligence.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The lesson of <em>Harbor </em>and <em>PECO, </em>and of nearly all cases interpreting additional insured provisions like AIC\u2019s, supports the trial court\u2019s ruling in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">The judgment is affirmed. Reliance shall recover its costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Corrigan, Acting P. J., and Phelan, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied April 14, 1999.
