As part of their duties, PSO\u2019s supervise county jail inmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-11\">We conclude that the PSO\u2019s are \u201csafety members\u201d of PERS. We therefore reverse the trial court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-12\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b962-13\">As authorized by statute, Mono County (Mono) has contracted with PERS for retirement benefits for county employees. (Gov. Code, former \u00a7 20450;</p>\n<p id=\"b963-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>all future references to sections are to the Government Code unless otherwise indicated<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; <em>City of Sacramento </em>v. <em>Public Employees Retirement System </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1470, 1476, fn. 2 [280 Cal.Rptr. 847].) By choosing to contract with PERS, Mono is subject to the statutory scheme governing PERS benefits (the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement Law, or PERL). (Former \u00a7 20000 et seq.; <em>Tuolumne County Deputy Sheriffs\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Administration </em>(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 1236, 1238 [257 Cal.Rptr. 824]; <em>Oden </em>v. <em>Board of Administration </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 194, 201 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 388] <em>(Oden) </em>[statutes defining the scope of PERS compensation cannot be qualified by bargaining agreements].) PERL classifies covered local agency employees as either \u201clocal miscellaneous\u201d or \u201clocal safety\u201d members, depending on their typical duties. (Former \u00a7\u00a7 20018, 20019; <em>Tuolumne County Deputy Sheriffs\u2019 Assn., supra.) </em>Generally, safety members are entitled to better retirement benefits than miscellaneous members. <em>(Tuolumne County Deputy Sheriffs\u2019 Assn., supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">Under PERL, \u201ccounty peace officers\u201d are classified as safety members. (Former \u00a7\u00a7 20019, 20021.5.) In late 1973, PERS questioned whether the position of Mono County Deputy Sheriff I\u2014a position that worked in county correctional facilities\u2014met the definition of \u201ccounty peace officer.\u201d PERS then reclassified the Deputy Sheriff I position from a safety member to a miscellaneous member.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">Mono protested this reclassification, noting that Deputy Sheriff I\u2019s were fully trained and certificated deputy sheriffs who had always been classified and hired as safety members. PERS noted that PERL allowed counties, at their election, to amend their contracts with PERS to include \u201cjailer and matron type employees\u201d as \u201ccounty peace officers\u201d (and thus entitle them to safety member status). Mono opted for this amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">In 1974, Mono amended its contract with PERS to include the following language recommended by PERS:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b963-8\">\u201c6. The following additional provisions of the [PERL] which apply only upon election of a contracting agency shall apply to [Mono] and its employees:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b963-9\">\u201ca. County Peace Officers shall participate as local safety members ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b963-10\">\u201cb. \u2018County Peace Officer\u2019 shall include persons employed on and after July 1, 1974, in positions described in Section 20021.9 (providing for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>participation of those employees of the Sheriff employed in [a] county jail, detention or correctional facility and having as their primary duties and responsibilities the supervision and custody of persons committed to such facility).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">This is the language at issue in these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">In 1982, Mono conducted an employee classification study through a consultant, Ralph Anderson and Company. To reduce the cost of staffing the county jail with sworn deputy sheriffs, Mono adopted that study\u2019s recommendation to create a civilian (nonswom) sheriff position of PSO. PSO\u2019s have three basic functions: dispatch; care and control of evidence and records; and supervision and custodial duties regarding county jail inmates (under the ultimate supervision of a sworn sheriff jail commander). Mono has always classified PSO\u2019s as miscellaneous members.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">In January of 1993, PERS determined, in accordance with former section 20021.9 and the Mono-PERS contract incorporating that section, that the PSO\u2019s should have been (and should be) classified as safety members; PERS noted that adjustments in both the employer and employee accounts would have to be made retroactively. (Former section 20021.9 [now section 20439] defines \u201ccounty peace officer\u201d to include jail employees whose primary duty is the supervision and custody of jail inmates, whether or not the employees are deputized.) An administrative law judge (ALJ) and the PERS Board of Administration, in adopting the ALJ\u2019s decision, upheld this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">Mono petitioned for a writ of administrative mandate. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5.) Independently reviewing the administrative record, the trial court granted the petition and directed PERS to deny safety member status to the PSO\u2019s. The trial court ruled against PERS on a host of independently dispositive issues. The court concluded that former section 20021.9\u2014as incorporated into the Mono-PERS contract through the 1974 amendment\u2014 did not apply to the PSO\u2019s. The court also found that the PSO\u2019s\u2019 \u201cprimary duty\u201d\u2014the former section 20021.9 touchstone\u2014was not the supervision and custody of jail inmates. The court added that estoppel, laches, and the statute of limitations foreclosed PERS from making its safety member determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b964-9\">1. <em>The Meaning of Former Section 20021.9 in the Mono-PERS Contract</em></p>\n<p id=\"b964-10\">The trial court concluded that former section 20021.9\u2014as incorporated into the Mono-PERS contract through the 1974 amendment\u2014did not apply to the PSO\u2019s. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>As noted, pursuant to the following language recommended by PERS, Mono amended its PERS contract in 1974 to incorporate former section 20021.9:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-5\">\u201c6. The following additional provisions of the [PERL] which apply only upon election of a contracting agency shall apply to [Mono] and its employees:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-6\">\u201ca. County Peace Officers shall participate as local safety members ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-7\">\u201cb. \u2018County Peace Officer\u2019 shall include persons employed on and after July 1, 1974, in positions described in Section 20021.9 (providing for the participation of those employees of the Sheriff employed in [a] county jail, detention or correctional facility and having as their primary duties and responsibilities the supervision and custody of persons committed to such facility).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">Former section 20021.9 provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-9\">\u201c \u2018County peace officer\u2019 . . . include[s] employees of the sheriff employed in a county jail, detention or correctional facility and having as their primary duty and responsibility the supervision and custody of persons committed to such jail or facility, whether or not such employees are deputized. It shall not include persons employed as clerks, typists, teachers, instructors, psychologists or to provide food, maintenance, health or supporting services, even though responsibility for custody and control of persons so committed may \"be incident to, or imposed in connection with, such service or the employees are deputized.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-10\">\u201cThe provisions of this section shall not apply to the employees of any contracting agency nor to any such agency unless and until the contracting agency elects to be subject to the provisions of this section by amendment to its contract with [PERS], made as provided in Section 20461.5 or by express provision in its contract with [PERS].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b965-11\">PERS contends the language of the 1974 amendment incorporating the former section 20021.9 definition is clear, and includes within its ambit the PSO\u2019s; judicial interpretation is therefore unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-12\">The trial court rejected PERS\u2019s contention that the language of the 1974 amendment is clear, and considered extrinsic evidence on its application. Mono tendered extrinsic evidence to show that Mono and PERS intended the 1974 amendment to apply to sworn deputy sheriffs working as jailers, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>had nothing to do with the PSO\u2019s (a position not even contemplated until eight years after the 1974 amendment). We conclude the trial court erred in this respect and that PERS\u2019s contention is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Through the 1974 amendment, Mono elected to incorporate the former section 20021.9 definition of \u201ccounty peace officer\u201d into its contract with PERS. \u201cAny such election so made by amendment to the contract shall be irrevocable until the contract is terminated.\u201d (Former \u00a7 20461.5 [now \u00a7 20474].) Mono has not terminated its contract with PERS; indeed, it has reincorporated the former section 20021.9 definition into the contract on at least six occasions from 1980 through 1992. Former section 20021.9 defines \u201ccounty peace officer\u201d to include sheriff employees employed in a county jail, detention or correctional facility who have as \u201ctheir primary duty and responsibility the supervision and custody of persons committed to such jail or facility, whether or not such employees are deputized.\u201d This statutory definition includes the PSO\u2019s\u2014who are sheriff employees employed in the county jail\u2014if their primary duty is the supervision and custody of persons committed to the jail (a question we explore in the next section of this opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">Mono claims the 1974 amendment incorporating the statutory definition of former section 20021.9 was intended to apply to sworn deputy sheriffs working as jailers and had nothing to do with the PSO position (a position not even created until 1982). The reason for the 1974 amendment was that PERS had reclassified the then deputy sheriff-jailer from a safety member to a miscellaneous member, and Mono wanted all of its sworn deputy sheriffs to be safety members.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">Mono\u2019s claim, however, runs afoul of the explicit definition contained in former section 20021.9; this statutory definition still binds Mono because the contract containing it is still in force. (See former \u00a7\u00a7 20021.9, 20461.5.)  \u201cA contract with PERS subjects the contracting agency to the [PERL] \u2018and all amendments thereto applicable to members, local miscellaneous members, or local safety members except such as are expressly inapplicable to a contracting agency unless and until it elects to be subject to such provision.\u2019 (\u00a7 20493 [now \u00a7 20506].)\u201d <em>(City of Sacramento </em>v. <em>Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 786, 791 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 545].) Whether a local agency employee legally falls within a statutory definition that is incorporated into the local agency\u2019s contract with PERS, is a question of statutory interpretation. <em>(Crumpler </em>v. <em>Board of Administration </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 567, 576-577 [108 Cal.Rptr. 293]; <em>Schaeffer </em>v. <em>Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System </em>(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 609, 612 [248 Cal.Rptr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>647].) Furthermore, statutes defining the scope of PERS benefits cannot be qualified by bargaining agreements. <em>(Oden, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th at p. 201.)</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">It is true that Mono can elect not to adopt the definition of \u201ccounty peace officer\u201d set forth in former section 20021.9. (Former \u00a7 20021.9.) Mono <em>did </em>elect to do so. Having done so, Mono can escape former section 20021.9\u2019s definition only by terminating the contract. (Former \u00a7 20461.5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">Finally, in line with evidence that Mono had tendered, the trial court interpreted the 1974 amendment as applying to sworn deputy sheriffs working as jailers but not to PSO\u2019s.  For this interpretation, the court implicitly relied on the contractual interpretive principle that extrinsic evidence is admissible to interpret a written instrument if that evidence is relevant to prove a meaning to which the language of the instrument is reasonably susceptible. <em>(Horsemen\u2019s Benevolent &amp; Protective Assn. </em>v. <em>Valley Racing Assn. </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1538, 1559 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 698]; <em>Roddenberry </em>v. <em>Roddenberry </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 634, 645-646 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 907].)  There are two problems with this approach, however. The first one is that we are dealing, ultimately, with the interpretation of a statute rather than with the interpretation of a written instrument. Secondly, even assuming for the sake of argument that this interpretive principle can apply to statutory interpretation (see <em>City of Sacramento </em>v. <em>Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, supra, </em>22 Cal.App.4th at pp. 790, fn. 3, 792-797), Mono\u2019s proffered evidence that sworn deputy sheriffs were to be included in the former section 20021.9 incorporation is not evidence that the PSO\u2019s were to be excluded. In any event, there is no \u201csemantically permissible reading\u201d of the former section 20021.9 incorporation in the Mono-PERS contract \u201cby which to achieve the result\u201d sought by Mono. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 794.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">We conclude that former section 20021.9\u2014as incorporated originally into the Mono-PERS contract through the 1974 amendment\u2014applies to the PSO\u2019s, if the PSO\u2019s\u2019 primary duty is the supervision and custody of jail inmates (for simplicity, we use the term \u201cjail inmates\u201d to refer to those persons committed to jail, detention or correctional facilities as specified in former section 20021.9). We turn to that \u201cprimary duty\u201d issue now.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>2. <em>Primary Duty of PSO\u2019s</em></p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">The trial court found that the PSO\u2019s\u2019 \u201cprimary duty\u201d\u2014the former section 20021.9 touchstone\u2014was not the supervision and custody of jail inmates. We conclude there is insufficient evidence to support this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">The trial court\u2019s role regarding this issue was to exercise its independent judgment on the evidence. (See <em>Mansell </em>v. <em>Board of Administration </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 539, 543-544 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 574].) Our task in this regard is to review the record to determine whether the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 544.) \u201c \u2018The trial court\u2019s decision should be sustained if it is supported by credible and competent evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em> The trial court\u2019s finding regarding primary duty is not supported by credible and competent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">As noted, PSO\u2019s have three basic functions: dispatch; care and control of evidence and records; and supervision and custodial duties regarding jail inmates (under the ultimate supervision of a sworn sheriff jail commander). However, the evidence is clear and uncontroverted that the PSO\u2019s\u2019 \u201cprimary duty\u201d is the supervision and custody of jail inmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">A parade of former and current PSO\u2019s testified that the supervision and custody of jail inmates is the \u201cmain function,\u201d the \u201cfirst and foremost duty,\u201d the \u201cprimary function\u201d and the \u201cprimary duty\u201d of a PSO; carrying out this duty occupies 50 to 70 percent of the PSO\u2019s\u2019 work time. The trial court discounted this testimony because it was self-serving and not submitted with supporting time records. However, this testimony was never rebutted. Furthermore, Mono\u2019s current undersheriff testified that a PSO\u2019s \u201cprimary responsibility\u201d is the supervision and custody of jail inmates. Moreover, Mono\u2019s current sheriff noted that the PSO position was created to replace the deputy sheriffs who had once worked in the jail (but were now used exclusively in the field).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">A chart of \u201cJail Division Staffing Trends for Mono County\u201d shows that in 1982 the jail personnel consisted of one jail commander and nine correctional officers. In 1983, when the PSO\u2019s came on board, the jail personnel encompassed one jail commander, one supervising PSO, and nine PSO\u2019s. The number of PSO\u2019s had increased to 12 by 1987. A March 1994 letter from the undersheriff to the county counsel estimates that PSO\u2019s assigned as jailers spend about 95 percent of their time on the supervision and custody of inmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-9\">In the face of this extensive and uncontroverted evidence, the trial court chose to base its finding regarding \u201cprimary duty\u201d on the written job <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>description for the PSO position. That job description simply lists all the PSO duties, without specifying how much time will be spent on each task. Even this job description, though, places the supervision of jail inmates at the top of the listed tasks.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">We conclude there is insufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that a PSO\u2019s \u201cprimary duty\u201d is not the supervision and custody of jail inmates. The record is clear that supervision and custody of jail inmates <em>is </em>the PSO\u2019s \u201cprimary duty.\u201d Accordingly, PSO\u2019s come within the statutory definition of \u201ccounty peace officer\u201d set forth in former section 20021.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">3., 4.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">5. <em>Statute of Limitations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">The trial court determined that PERS was barred under the three-year statute of limitations of either former section 20181, subdivision (b), or Code of Civil Procedure section 338, subdivision (a), from claiming that PSO\u2019s are safety members and from seeking retroactive contributions on that basis (at least outside this three-year period). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">The issues here are whether PERS has timely made its reclassification claim and, if so, how far back it can go to correct the classification of the PSO\u2019s, who have been classified as miscellaneous members instead of as safety members since 1982. We conclude that PERS has timely made its reclassification claim and that it can make the correction from 1982 onward.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b969-10\">Three PERL statutes are implicated. They are the statute of limitations section set forth in former section 20181, subdivision (b), and the two sections on retroactive correction\u2014former sections 20180 and 20165.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-11\">Former section 20181 stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-12\">\u201c(b) For the purposes of payments into or out of the retirement fund for adjustment of errors or omissions, whether pursuant to Sections 20165, 20180, or 20527 [not relevant here], or otherwise, the period of limitation of actions shall be three years, and shall be applied as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>\u201c(1) In cases where the system makes an erroneous payment to a member or beneficiary, the system\u2019s right to collect shall expire three years from the date of payment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-4\">\u201c(2) In cases where the system owes money to a member or beneficiary, the period of limitations shall not apply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-5\">\u201c(3) In cases where payment is erroneous because of the death of the retired member or beneficiary or because of the remarriage of the beneficiary, the period of limitation shall commence with the discovery of the erroneous payment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-6\">\u201c(c) Notwithstanding subdivision (b), where any payment has been made as a result of fraudulent reports for compensation made, or caused to be made, by a member for his or her own benefit, the period of limitation shall be 10 years and that period shall commence either from the date of payment or upon discovery of the fraudulent reporting, whichever date is later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-7\">\u201c(d) The board shall determine the applicability of the period of limitations in any case, and its determination with respect to the running of any period of limitation shall be conclusive and binding for purposes of correcting the error or omission.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">Former section 20180 provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-9\">\u201c(b) . . . [PERS] shall correct all actions taken as a result of errors or omissions of . . . any contracting agency, ... or this system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-10\">\u201c(e) Corrections of errors or omissions pursuant to this section shall be such that the status, rights, and obligations of all parties described in subdivisions (a) and (b) [which include active and retired members, beneficiaries, contracting agencies and PERS itself] are adjusted to be the same that they would have been if the act that would have been taken, but for the error or omission, was taken at the proper time. However, notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this section, corrections made pursuant to this section shall adjust the status, rights, and obligations of all parties described in subdivisions (a) and (b) as of the time that the correction actually takes place if the board finds any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>\u201c(1) That the correction cannot be performed in a retroactive manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-5\">\u201c(2) That even if the correction can be performed in a retroactive manner, the status, rights, and obligations of all of the parties described in subdivisions (a) and (b) cannot be adjusted to be the same that they would have been if the error or omission had not occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-6\">\u201c(3) That the purposes of this part will not be effectuated if the correction is performed in a retroactive manner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">Former section 20165 provided in pertinent part: \u201cNo adjustment shall be made because less than the correct amount of normal contributions was paid by a member if the board finds that the error was not known to the member and was not the result of erroneous information provided by him to the system or to his employer and such failure to adjust will not preclude action under Section 20180 correcting the date upon which the person became a member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">The statute of limitations language of former section 20181 does not apply here. This is not a case where PERS has made an erroneous payment to a member or beneficiary (subd. (b)(1)); or where PERS owes money to a member or beneficiary, at least at this juncture (subd. (b)(2)); or where an erroneous payment has been made because of death or remarriage (subd. (b)(3)); or where payment has been made as a result of a fraudulent report (subd. (c)). Instead, this is a case where PERS seeks to reclassify PSO\u2019s as safety members and to retroactively assess Mono and the PSO\u2019s the difference in contributions between miscellaneous and safety membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-9\">Since PERL does not set forth a specific statute of limitations that applies here, PERS\u2019s claim for reclassification and retroactive contributions is governed by the general statute of limitation provisions set forth in the Code of Civil Procedure. As Code of Civil Procedure section 312 recognizes: \u201cCivil actions, without exception, can only be commenced within the periods prescribed in this title, after the cause of action shall have accrued, unless where, in special cases, a different limitation is prescribed by statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b971-10\">The applicable statute of limitations here is the three-year period set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 338, subdivision (d), for \u201c[a]n action for relief on the ground of . . . mistake.\u201d (See <em>County of Marin Assn. of Firefighters </em>v. <em>Marin County Employees Retirement Assn. </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 1638, 1651-1652 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 736] <em>(County of Marin).) </em>\u201cThe cause of action [under section 338, subdivision (d)] is not to be deemed to have accrued until the discovery, by the aggrieved party, of the facts constituting the . . . mistake.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 338, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b972-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number><em>County of Marin </em>is similar to the present matter. In <em>County of Marin, </em>it was determined that \u201choliday pay\u201d had been mistakenly excluded\u2014since 1975\u2014as an element of compensation in computing retirement benefits for county firefighters. The county retirement board then claimed that the county firefighters had to pay arrears contributions, retroactively to 1975, to compensate for the failure to deduct from the firefighters\u2019 paychecks the pension contributions based on the holiday pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">The <em>County of Marin </em>court upheld the retirement board\u2019s claim and concluded that Code of Civil Procedure section 338, subdivision (d), provided the statute of limitations. (30 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1644, 1650-1653.) The <em>County of Marin </em>court likened the retirement board\u2019s request for retroactive contributions to a claim for recovery of public moneys paid out through mistake, a claim deemed subject to the three-year statute of limitations of Code of Civil Procedure section 338, subdivision (d), under the authority of <em>People </em>v. <em>Union Oil Co. </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 476, 483 [310 P.2d 409]. (30 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1651-1652.) Said <em>County of Marin: </em>\u201cThe money was paid out in the form of salary to the employees. The mistake was in the failure to include holiday pay as an element of compensation and the consequent failure to deduct contributions for holiday pay from employee paychecks. . . . Like the mistake at issue in <em>Union Oil, </em>the mistake here at issue \u2018is not a mere incident to [the] right to recovery. Rather it is the very basis or gravamen of [the right of] action.\u2019 \u201d <em>(County of Marin, supra, </em>30 Cal.App.4th at p. 1652.) Much the same can be said here regarding PERS\u2019s claim for reclassification and retroactive contributions covering the contributory differences between PSO\u2019s as miscellaneous members and PSO\u2019s as safety members. (See <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Board of Administration </em>(1980) 103 Cal.App.3d 565, 567 [163 Cal.Rptr. 198] <em>(Campbell).)</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">The question then becomes whether PERS met the three-year statute of limitations set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 338, subdivision (d). It did. The evidence shows that PERS discovered the mistaken classification of the PSO\u2019s in July of 1990, while conducting for Mono a general training session on membership and payroll reporting. Within three years of this date\u2014January 8, 1993, to be exact\u2014PERS formally determined that PSO\u2019s were safety members and notified Mono that adjustments in both employer and employee accounts would have to be made retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>The firefighters in <em>County of Marin </em>also argued that Code of Civil Procedure section 338, subdivision (d), limited the retirement board\u2019s recovery to three years of contributions prior to the date the board determined that \u201choliday pay\u201d should have been included in compensation for pension proposes. <em>(County of Marin, supra, </em>30 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1644, 1653.) The court in <em>County of Marin </em>disagreed, noting: \u201cThe effect of [Code of Civil Procedure section 338,] subdivision (d) is to delay <em>accrual </em>of the cause of action, and it requires filing of suit within three years of accrual. So long as this requirement is satisfied, subdivision (d) does not in any way limit a plaintiff\u2019s ability to recover for events that occurred more than three years prior to accrual or filing.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">Mono makes a similar argument here, asserting that.PERS \u201ccan seek retroactive status only for a period of three years prior to its formal determination in 1993\u201d that PSO\u2019s are safety members. Mono\u2019s argument meets a similar fate as the firefighters\u2019 argument in <em>County of Marin. </em>Mono is mixing the \u201capple\u201d of statute of limitations (concerning <em>whether </em>a claim can be made because of a timeliness requirement) with the \u201corange\u201d of retroactive relief (concerning <em>what </em>can be obtained pursuant to that claim). As noted, PERS has timely made its claim\u2014doing so within three years of discovering that the PSO\u2019s were mistakenly classified as miscellaneous members instead of as safety members. PERS can now seek the relief to which it is entitled under its claim unbridled by the statute of limitations requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">Finally, the following language of former section 20165 cannot be used to obtain the gain of safety status without the pain of retroactive contributions: \u201cNo adjustment shall be made because less than the correct amount of normal contributions was paid by a member if [PERS] finds that the error was not known to the member and was not the result of erroneous information provided by him to the system or to his employer . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">This part of former section 20165 was at issue in <em>Campbell, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.3d 565. In <em>Campbell, </em>PERS had misclassified bailiffs as miscellaneous members instead of as safety members. PERS reclassified the bailiffs as safety members and retroactively assessed each party the difference in contributions that would have been made by the bailiffs as safety members. The bailiffs sought relief from the retroactive assessments under this language of former section 20165. The <em>Campbell </em>court upheld PERS\u2019s determination that this language applies only to minor clerical, mechanical, or other errors made by PERS in calculating a member\u2019s \u201cnormal contribution,\u201d and not to the more substantive error of misclassification. (103 Cal.App.3d at pp. 567-571.)</p>\n<p id=\"b974-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>The court in <em>Campbell </em>applied former section 20180 to allow PERS to reclassify the bailiffs retroactively and then to assess them for the differences in their respective past contributions. (103 Cal.App.3d at p. 571; see <em>Button </em>v. <em>Board of Administration </em>(1981) 122 Cal.App.3d 730, 736 [176 Cal.Rptr. 218].) Former section 20165 provides a procedure by which the required corrections specified in former section 20180 can be made. (See <em>Campbell, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.3d at p. 571; see also former \u00a7\u00a7 20180, 20165.) Former section 20180 applies to retired members as well as to active, members, and applies equally to postretirement changes in status. <em>(Button, supra, </em>122 Cal.App.3d at p. 737.)</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">In sum, under the applicable statute of limitations (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 338, subd. (d)) PERS timely sought reclassification and retroactive contributions. Under the applicable retroactive correction statutes (former \u00a7\u00a7 20180, 20165), PERS can obtain retroactive contributions covering the difference between miscellaneous membership and safety membership.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">The judgment is reversed.

In <em>Boxx, </em>the local agency and PERS were allowed to amend their contract because both entities had clearly intended to cover all of the agency\u2019s employees, but by mutual error one group of agency employees was misclassified. (114 Cal.App.3d at pp. 81, 88-89.) The evidence here does not show such clear intent and mutual error. PERS simply informed Mono that by amending their contract, Mono could include jailer employees as \u201ccounty peace officers\u201d entitled to safety member status.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b969-13\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1105.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b969-14\">Our decision is limited to the PSO\u2019s, as was PERS\u2019s formal determination in January 1993 and the ALJ\u2019s decision that PERS adopted as its own decision in 1995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b970-11\">Subdivision <em>(d) </em>of former section 20181 does not apply here.
