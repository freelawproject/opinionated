The bill sought not only to restrain the sale, but to avoid the judgment and execution, and to cause the bond upon which the judgment was entered, to be delivered up to the receivers, to be cancelled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-10\">Upon filing the bill an injunction was allowed and issued.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b222-11\"><em>B. </em>Williamson, for the State of Indiana,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzW\">now moved to dissolve the injunction, upon notice, without answer, for want of equity in the bill.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b222-12\"><em>E. Vanarsdale, </em>for complainants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AoEy\">objected to the hearing coming on. He insisted that the motion to dissolve an injunc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>tion could not be entertained before answer filed, and cited Rules, IX. s. 2.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b223-4\">Williamson, contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqe\">insisted that the hearing should proceed. The sheriff, he contended, ought not to have been restrained from making sale. The property was thereby exposed to waste, and the plaintiff in execution to unavoidable loss. The proper course would have been, to allow the sale to be made, and to stay the proceeds of the sale in the sheriff\u2019s hands, subject to the order of the court: <em>Hawkshaw </em>v. <em>Parkins, </em>2 <em>Swans. </em>549.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-5\">In support of his right to be heard upon the motion to dissolve the injunction before answer, he cited <em>Drewry on Inj. </em>371; <em>Vipan </em>v. <em>Mortlock, 2 Mer. </em>479; <em>Roper </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>1 <em>Turn. and Russ. </em>18; 1 <em>Newland\u2019s Ch. Pr. </em>236.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b222-13\"> See ante, vol. i. page 409, note.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b223-6\">The Chancellor.</author>\n<p id=\"AEO\">Where the motion is to dissolve the injunction for want of equity in the bill, the rule requiring an answer clearly does not apply; it is only when the motion is to be sustained by affidavits, or other matter is relied on, independent of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Where the object of the bill will be answered, the sale should be suffered to proceed, and the money should be staid in the sheriff\u2019s hands. That course, however, would not meet the object of the present bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">The sheriff remains liable for the property in his hands, notwithstanding the injunction: he is bound to take charge of it. If any part of the property levied on has gone into the hands of the receivers, they should compensate the sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">I am clearly of opoinion, that where an injunction is granted ex parte, and notice is given of a motion to dissolve the injunction for want of equity in the bill, I must hoar the motion, except for special cause, as for the illness of counsel. The motion should not be delayed, merely because the party or his counsel is not ready for the argument; the court must hear the motion at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">The argument must proceed, unless counsel otherwise agree.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
