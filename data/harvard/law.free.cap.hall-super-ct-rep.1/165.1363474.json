Term, 1828.</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b187-10\">An application to amend the declaration, will at all times be granted upon payment of costs, where such amendments .do not operate as a surprise upon the defendant, nor subject him to injury. But the defendant, in such a case, will be permitted to withdraw his pleas, and plead again, <em>de novo.</em></headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-11\"><em>Mr. C. C. King, </em>in behalf of the plaintiffs, at the last August term of this court, moved for leave to amend the declaration in this cause by inserting special counts therein.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b187-12\"><em>Mr. G. W. Strong, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0-\">opposed the motion; and contended, that if the application were granted, that the plaintiffs ought to stipulate to accept a common notice of set-off, instead of special pleas, if such pleas should finally be required for the defence. But the court ruled, that the plaintiffs had a right to amend their declaration, as a matter of course, before plea pleaded, upon payment of costs ; and they therefore granted the motion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-13\">And now, at this term, after the defendant had put in his pleas, <em>Mr. King </em>again moved for leave to amend the declaration a second time, stating as a reason, that a mistake had been made in setting out the quantities of certain goods specified in the special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>counts, for which promissory notes had been promised, but never . * i i furnished. -*</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b188-8\"><em>Mr. G. </em>Griffin, for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvL\">stated, that he had a judgment against the plaintiffs for an amount equal^to^their claim : that the promise to give a promissory note was denied, and that the real object of the plaintiffs was to avoid the set-off.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b188-9\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"ASg\">The plaintiffs are entitled to the effect of their motion, as a matter of course: an application to amend never being refused where it does not operate as a surprise upon the defendant, nor subject him to injury. The plaintiffs, however, must pay the costs of the motion; and <em>the </em>defendant has leave to withdraw his pleas, and plead again <em>de novo. </em>He cannot be subjected to any injury by the amendments, because he will have every opportunity to shape his defence according to the exigency of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">\n<em>Motion granted on payment of costs.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">[C.
