Term, 1828.</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b413-6\">A court of law cannot take jurisdiction of accounts between partners. To an action upon a promissory note, the defendant pleaded that the note was given as the consideration of a release of a certain lot of land held by himself and his co-partner <em>jointly, </em>upon the supposition that the balance of the partnership accounts was in favour of such co-partner; whereas in point of fact, the balance was in his own favour, and so, that the consideration had failed. The plaintiffs replied that the balance of said accounts was <em>not </em>in favour of the defendant, and and that the said lot of land was held by the said co-partners not jointly, but as tenants in common. Upon demurrer to this replication it wqs held that the <em>plea </em>was no bar to the action, as it sought to cause an investigation of accounts between partners, before a court of law. The <em>plaintiffs </em>th\u00e9refore, had judgment on the demurrer. \u2022</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-7\">The declaration in this case contained two founts. The first was upon a promissory note for $1457. 74., bearing date the first day of May 1827., made,by the firm of N. .Rogers ind Son, in favour of the defendant, payable twelve months after date at the Bank of New-York, and <em>endorsed </em>by the defendant to the <em>testator </em>of the plaintiffs. The declaration alleged a regular demand at the Bank of New-York, when the note became payable, and a refusal of payment on the part of the makers with notice to the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-8\">The second count, was for money lent and advanced, money paid, money had and received and upon account an stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-9\">The defendant pleaded first, non-assumpsit, and secondlyin bar of the action, that the consideration of the notes specified in the declaration and <em>the bill of particulars </em>of the plaintiffs, \u201cwas the re- \u201c lease by said testator of his supposed right and interest in cer- \u201c tain real estate situate in Pearl-street, (No. 232.) in the city of \u201c New-York, wherein the defendant and the said testator were \u201c jointly and exclusively interested as co-partners under the firm \" of Rogers &amp; Lambert, and said makers \u00f3f said notes above de- \u201c clared on and mentioned in said bill of particulars, had <em>not </em>any \u201c interest therein; and under an impression <em>that </em>said co-partnership in form, (but the defendant in fact,) was indebted to said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>\u201c testator on co-partnership account; a <em>release </em>of his said supposed \u201cinterestin said real estate was executed and said notes were given \u00ab therefor, whereas in fact and truth, since the giving of said \u201c notes, viz : within a short time before the institution of this suit, <em>tt </em>h Was discovered that the balance of account between the de- \u201c fendant and said testator, in said partnership account is against \u201c said testator in \u00bf large amount, and was in fact, against said \" testator at the time of the giving of said noteand the defendant averred, \u201c that said testator had not any right or interest in \u201c said real estate to release,\u201d &amp;c.'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-4\">To <em>this </em>plea the plaintiffs replied by protesting, that the balance of account between the defendant .and said testator in their co-partnership accounts was not against the said testator at the time of the giving of said note, and by alleging \u201c that said testator and e\u2018 the said defendant were not <em>jointly </em>interested in the said real \u201c estate as co-partners under the firm of Rogers &amp; Lambert, as in &lt;c the said plea is alleged, but as <em>tenants </em>in common, and that the \u201csaid testator had a right\" or interest in said real estate as .such \u201c tenant in common to release,\u201d and of this he put himself on the country.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-5\">To this replication, the defendant demurred specially; first, because the plaintiffs, by their replication, admit that the balance of a\u00f3count mentioned or referred to, was against the said testator, and yet deny that said real estate was co-partnership property. Secondly, because the replication is double. Thirdly, because the balance of account being against the said testator, the real estate was thereby c\u00f3-partnership property. Fourthly, because the plaintiffs have not set out with sufficient certainty the title and interest which they aver then testator had and released ; whereas they ought to have averred that their testator was seized in fee, (and undivided \"with said Nehemiah) of a certain specific portion of said real estate, and being so seized thereof, released the same to. the makers or endorsers of said notes, as the case might be.

The plea is argumentative.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b415-11\"><em>Mr. Sedgwick </em>insisted principally upon his third point, and that matters of partnership between the parties -could not be investigated in a trial at law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b415-12\">The court decided the demurrer in favour of the plaintiff on the argument, upon the ground that the matters set up in the plea, if they could furnish any defence, were not available as a bar to the action in a court of law.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b415-13\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"As66\">If the defendant relies upon partnership transactions as a defence to an action at law, his course obviously is to go into a Court of Equity, which alone has the power to investigate accounts between partners, and to do justice between them. This suit might be restrained by an injunction out of Chancery upon a bill which the defendant has the power of filing. If he wishes to have an investigation of the accounts between himself and his deceased partner, he has merely to apply to the tribunal which has jurisdiction over the subject matter to be examined. But how can this court ascertain in an action at law, upon which side liesthe balance of the accounts <em>1 </em>Are they to be investigated by a jury at the trial, and can they examine the transactions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>ye are perhaps, and measure out justice in an intelligent and impartial manner, upon matters which may require an appeal to the consciences of the parties, as .well as to the ordinary proofs furnished in a trial at law 1 It is obvious that the defendant has mistaken the proper mode of defending himself and has sought to !nvestigate matters before a tribunal which cannot take proper cognizance of them. His plea, therefore, cannot be sustained, and as the first fault inpleading is his, the plaintiffs must have judgment upon the de-murrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiffs on the demurrer.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">[D.
