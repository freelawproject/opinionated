He subsequently attached the same vessel on nine other writs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-7\">Upon the eleventh writ placed in his hands he attached the vessel, subject to the former attachments, and also attached \u201c a lot of rigging on board the vessel and the spars belonging to said vessel, this being the first attachment made upon the rigging and spars.\u201d He then, upon three other writs, attached the vessel, rigging and spars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-8\">He then attached, upon the <em>plaintiff\u2019s </em>writ, the vessel, subject to fourteen prior attachments, and also <em>\u201c </em>a lot of rigging on board said vessel and the spars belonging to the same vessel, subject to four prior attachments of said rigging and spars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-9\">The plaintiff recovered judgment and seasonably delivered his execution to Barker to be levied on the property attached.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-10\">Upon that execution, Barker made return as follows: \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-11\">\u201c Lincoln ss. Nov. 9th, 1849. By virtue of the within execution I have this day demanded of Charles C. Laiton, Moses Call, Nathaniel Bryant and Henry C. Lowell the payment of the within execution, as said Call, Bryant and Lowell are bondsmen for said C. C. Laiton for the property attached on the original writ on which the within execution was issued. I therefore return the within execution in no part satisfied. \u201c E. W. Barker, <em>Deputy Sheriff.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-12\">This suit is brought against the sheriff for the neglect of the deputy to satisfy the plaintiff\u2019s execution out of the property attached.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-13\">The first attachment upon the vessel was made March 28, 1848, on the writ as above stated in favor of Huston. Upon that writ the officer made return of that attachment under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>that date, and also, under date of June <em>27, </em>1848, returned as follows: \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-5\">\u201c By virtue of this writ I have herewith returned the bond accompanying this writ, said bond having been taken pursuant to the provisions of the 53d, 54th, 55th, 56th and 57th sections of chapter 114 of the Revised Statutes, and also a certificate of my doings as provided in section 58 of said chapter. \u201c E. W. Barker, <em>Deputy Sheriff.\"</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-6\">Barker also, with said writ, returned the bond above referred to, together with his own official certificate that Laiton, the debtor on the-day of June, 1848, being defendant in the suits on which the \u201c vessel with the spars, &amp;c.,\u201d were attached, made application to have the vessel <em>appraised; </em>and that after certain preliminary proceedings, (which are described,) an appraisement of said vessel, spars, &amp;c. was made at the sum of $12000, whereof the debtor gave the requisite bond, and that he delivered the <em>\u201c </em>vessel, spars, &amp;c.\u201d to the debtor, all pursuant to R. S., c. 114.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-9\">The bond recited the appraisal of the \u201c vessel, spars, &amp;c.\u201d at $12000, and that the \u201c vessel, spars, &amp;c,,\u201d had been delivered by the officer to the debtor, and was conditioned to pay to the officer the $12000, or satisfy the judgments which might \u201cbe recovered in the suits in which the vessel and spars were attached,\u201d if seasonably demanded, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-10\">If upon the foregoing facts the Court should be of opinion that the plaintiff has maintained his action, the defendant is to be defaulted, and the plaintiff is to have judgment, damages to be assessed by the Court on hearing; otherwise the plaintiff is to become nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b163-11\"><em>Paine, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-12\">The officer\u2019s return shows, that he attached on the plaintiff \u2019s writ the vessel subject to fourteen, and the rigging and spars, subject to four prior attachments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-13\">The plaintiff having recovered judgment and seasonably placed his execution in the hands of the deputy, has made a <em>prima facie </em>case. This case must be repelled by the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>fendant. To accomplish that, he relies upon the facts in relation to the appraisement and delivery to the debtor of the property attached. But the defence fails : \u2014 \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-5\">1st. Because the rigging attached is in no way accounted for. No reason is offered why the plaintiff\u2019s execution was not levied upon that. That property is not mentioned either in Laiton\u2019s application for an appraisal, nor in the appraisal itself, nor in the bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ae0\">2d. Because the spars were not appraised in. a separate proceeding. R. S. c. 114, \u00a7 58, requires the officer to return the bond with a certificate of his doings with the writ on which the first attachment was made. But the first attachment of the <em>spars </em>was made on the eleventh writ. The bond and certificate are returned with the writ in favor of Huston, upon which the <em>vessel </em>was first <em>attached; </em>not that on which the spars and rigging were attached.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-7\"><em>Section 55 </em>authorizes the creditor to choose one of the appraisers. The creditors were those and those only who attached the property, that is, the <em>spars.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-8\">3d. Because- the two kinds of .property in which different sets of creditors were interested, were commingled in the appraisal. And if this be allowable, the attachment law is defeated. Such a course would give full pay to one, and that too out of property which he had not attached. There were two classes of creditors. By one of these classes the vessel alone had been attached. By the other the vessel and spars. These classes might not agree in the appointment of an appraiser. There must therefore be two sets of appraisers, and two bonds were necessary.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b164-9\"><em>Bradbury, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-10\">1. The vessel and spars were taken from the officer by virtue of R. S. c. 114, \u00a7 \u00a7 53; 54, 55, 56, 57. It is not pretended by the opposing counsel that any single step in the statute requirements, preliminary to the surrender of the vessel to the debtor, was deficient or irregular. The appraisers adjudged the property to be liable to waste and to be greatly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>depreciated ill value. Their adjudication is conclusive of that fact. <em>Crocker </em>v. Baker, 18 Pick. 407. On giving the bond, therefore, the officer was bound to deliver the property to the debtor. It was therefore impossible, that the officer should levy the plaintiff\u2019s execution upon it, and he cannot be charged for not keeping what the law took from his possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-5\">2. The attachment of the vessel included the spars. Both in the officer\u2019s return and in the appraisal, they'are described as \u201c belonging to said vessel.\u201d They were in her, and if \u201cbelonging\u201d to her, they were a part of her. There is nothing to show that the spars appraised were not on board and in their appropriate places. They were a necessary appurtenant passing with the vessel. <em>Farrar, </em>v. <em>Stackpole, </em>6 Maine, 164.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-6\">It was not the <em>hull </em>of the vessel, but the vessel that was attached, and the addition of the word spars is mere surplusage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-7\">The lien law, (R. S., c. 125, \u00a7, 25,) regards the .materials when fitted for the vessel as a part of the vessel. It provides that \u201c any person who shall perform labor or furnish materials, for or on account of any vessel, building or standing on the stocks, shall have a lien on such vessel.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-8\">The design of the law is to protect those who furnish the materials or labor. To do this the lien must extend to the materials when fitted and prepared for the vessel; they then become a part of her; otherwise the man who labors on the spars and fits them for the vessel would have no lien for his labor, if they were not put in their place within four days of the launching, for the lien is on \u201c the vessel\u201d <em>eo nomine.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-9\">By the admission of the plaintiff, the spars are a part of the vessel. The plaintiff claims as a lien creditor on this vessel, and as he makes claim to the spars, and the lien is on the vessel, he consequently includes the spars as a part of the vessel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-10\">The appraisal therefore properly included the spars with the vessel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-11\">3. But whether so or not, <em>the appraisal of the vessel is still valid. </em>The fact that a few spars were included with it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>and increased its value, could not vitiate the appraisal. Nor can the plaintiff take advantage of it. He is not injured by augmenting the appraised value of the vessel, and therefore, of the bond, in which he has his remedy therefor. As to the spars, if not properly appraised, he could have no lien on them, and no preference as a lien creditor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-5\">4. <em>The impropriety, if it was one, of including the spars in the appraisal, was the act of the appraisers, and not of the officer, and he is not to be prejudiced by it. </em>He performed his duty; furnished them with a proper schedule, and possessed no power <em>to </em>force the appraisers to conform to his views. They determined that the spars \u201cbelonging to the vessel,\u201d did belong to it, and constitute a part of it, and the officer was bound by their decision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-6\">Nor does the case show that any spars were appraised that were not at the time actually on board, and in their-proper places. Nothing is to be presumed in' order to vitiate proceedings under the authority of law, and fair upon the face of them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b166-7\"><em>Paine, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-8\">The officer made a discrimination in the sorts of property which he attached. Some of the creditors were content to rely on the vessel alone. Others, among whom was the plaintiff, required the rigging and the spars to be attached in addition to the vessel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-9\">Suppose the bond to be paid, how will the funds be distributed? The plaintiff has no remedy on the bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-10\">The defendant therefore has shown no legal disposition of the property attached by us.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b166-11\">Howard, J. \u2014</author>\n<p id=\"AqJ\">The plaintiff\u2019s attachment was numbered fifteen, and was subject to fourteen prior attachments of a vessel upon the stocks, and to four previous attachments upon \u201c a lot of rigging on board said vessel, and the spars belonging to the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">The vessel and spars were appraised under the provisions of the R. S. c. 114, \u00a7 \u00a7 53, 56, and delivered to the debtor, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>his giving to the attaching officer a bond, conformable to section 57, of the same chapter. The bond and his certificate were returned by the officer, with the writ on which the <em>vessel </em>was first attached. Section 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">It does not appear that the spars or rigging were fitted or attached to the vessel, though intended for her use. They were not, therefore, embraced in either of the first ten attachments, which were of the <em>vessel, </em>only, <em>eo nomine. </em>They might have been appraised and disposed of under process numbered eleven, on which they were first returned as attached, but could not, properly, have been appropriated in that manner, under the first attachment of the <em>vessel. </em>Delivering them to the debtor, under such appraisal and proceedings, furnishes no protection to the officer. He is accountable for the spars, precisely as if no appraisal had been attempted. For the rigging, which was not appraised, he is accountable in a like manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">A creditor\u2019s remedy under his attachment of the vessel, is by suit upon the bond taken by the officer from the debtor, and not by action against the officer. The proceedings under the statute referred to, when correct, are conclusive, and they constitute a justification to the officer, and exempt him from liability for the property attached, and disposed of under the appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The action is, therefore, maintained, for default of the officer in failing to appropriate the <em>spars </em>and <em>rigging </em>to the satisfaction of the plaintiff\u2019s judgment, in the order of his attachment. But, by the agreement, he is to have judgment for such damages, only, as shall be assessed by the Court, on hearing. <em>Defendant defaulted.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">\n<em>Hearing in damages.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b167-9\">Shepley, C.
