Respondent may not re-argue his other disciplinary case in this court. <em>See In re Zdravkovich, </em>881 A.2d 964 (D.C.2003). Further, as the underlying complaint in the state of New Jersey alleged knowing misappropriation, such a finding, if made in the first instance in this court, would result in disbarment. <em>See, In re Addams, </em>579 A.2d 190 (D.C.1990) (en banc) (in virtually all cases of misappropriation, disbarment is the only appropriate sanction).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
