Such arrangements align the employees\u2019 financial incentives with, those of the company: If the company succeeds financially, so too do its stake-holding employees; but if the company falters\u2014even to and beyond the point of bankruptcy\u2014its employees bear some of the loss. Prior to its bankruptcy filing, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (\u201cLehman Brothers\u201d) adopted this approach, compensating many of its employees in part with restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d), which gave them a contingent right to own Lehman Brothers common stock at the conclusion of a five-year holding period. The holder of an RSU had risk and return expectations similar to those of a shareholder; he or she would ultimately benefit from any increase in the stock price or suffer from any decline.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-14\">When Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on September 15, 2008\u2014the largest bankruptcy filing in United States history<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\u2014thousands of its employees were holding RSUs that had been awarded over the preceding five years, but that had not yet vested and had therefore apparently been rendered worthless by the bankruptcy filing. Many of these employees filed proofs of claim in the Chapter 11 proceeding seeking cash payments in the amounts of and as substitutes for compensation they had been paid in RSUs. Lehman Brothers filed omnibus objections to the claims, and the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (James M. Peek, <em>Judge) </em>sustained these objections on two alternative grounds. First, it concluded that because the claims arise from the purchase or sale of securities, they must be subordinated to the claims of general creditors pursuant to section 510(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 510(b). Second, the court decided that because an RSU is an \u201cequity security,\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(16), the employees\u2019 claims were dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>allowed insofar as the claimants, as equity security holders, may assert only proofs of interest, not proofs of claim. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Richard J. Sullivan, Judge) affirmed on both grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">We note at the outset that we need not determine whether an RSU is an \u201cequity security\u201d pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(16), because, even if it is, RSU holders are not barred from asserting proofs of claim\u2014 such as the breach-of-contract claims asserted here\u2014inasmuch as at least some of their claims are not duplicative of proofs of interest. We conclude, however, that Lehman Brothers\u2019 omnibus objections must nonetheless be sustained on the alternative ground that, pursuant to section 510(b), the claims must be subordinated to the claims of general creditors because, for purpose of this statute, (1) RSUs are securities, (2) the claimants acquired them in a purchase, and (3) the claims for damages arise from those purchases or the asserted rescissions thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-7\">Lehman Brothers paid many of its employees a portion of their compensation in RSUs,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> equity awards that gave each of the recipient employees a contingent right to own Lehman Brothers common stock five years after issuance of each RSU so long as certain employment-related conditions were met. When Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on September 15, 2008, many of its employees were holding RSUs that had not yet vested. They filed proofs of claim in the bankruptcy proceedings for cash payments equivalent to the amounts they had received in RSUs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-10\">\n<em>The Program</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-11\">The RSUs were awarded in accordance with Lehman Brothers\u2019 Equity Award Program (the \u201cProgram\u201d), which was administered by Lehman Brothers\u2019 Board of Directors\u2019 Compensation and Benefits Committee (the \u201cCommittee\u201d). The Program\u2019s purpose was to give Lehman Brothers\u2019 employees (1) a financial stake in the company that aligned their interests with those of the company, and (2) a financial incentive to remain with the company until the RSUs matured.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-12\">In accordance with those goals, the Program gave Lehman Brothers discretion to pay some of its employees a portion of their compensation in equity-based awards, including RSUs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cAt [Lehman Brothers\u2019] option, a portion of [an employee\u2019s] total compensation ... may be payable in the form of conditional equity awards ([RSUs], stock options, or other equity awards) pursuant to the [Program].\u201d Joint App\u2019x (\u201cJA\u201d) at 7 \u00b6 2. And where Lehman Brothers had employment contracts with its employees, those contracts stated that \u201c[a]t the Firm\u2019s discretion, a portion of [the employees\u2019] total ... compensation ... will be [or may be] payable in conditional equity awards ([RSUs] and/or other equity awards) pursuant to the [Program].\u201d <em>Id. </em>In practice, RSUs were awarded near the end of each year to some employees. These RSU holders were entitled to Lehman Brothers common stock at the conclusion of a five-year holding period, assuming they met certain employment-related conditions. Employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>whose RSUs vested at the end of the five-year holding period could dispose of their shares of common stock as they saw fit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">The Program was governed by the terms of various documents, including the Employee Incentive Plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d). Section 8(b) of the Plan provides in pertinent part that Lehman Brothers\u2019 RSU obligation is limited to delivery of the stock, \u2022and does not include payment of cash:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ane-dedup-0\">With respect to any [RSUs] granted under the Plan, the obligations of the Company or any Subsidiary are limited solely to the delivery of shares of Common Stock on the date when such shares of Common Stock are due to be delivered under each Agreement, and in no event shall the Company or any Subsidiary become obligated to pay cash in respect of such obligation (except that the Company or any Subsidiary may pay to [Plan] Participants amounts in cash in respect of a restricted stock unit equal to cash dividends paid to a holder of shares of Common Stock, for fractional shares or for any amounts payable in cash upon the occurrence of a Change in Control).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 2890. Section 13(b) further provides that \u201c[t]he grant of an Award shall not be construed as giving a Participant the rights of a stockholder of Common Stock unless and until shares of Common Stock have been issued to Participants pursuant to Awards hereunder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Section 16 provides additional information about the rights of Plan participants, and authorizes the creation of trusts to meet Plan obligations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-6\">With respect to any payments not yet made to a Participant, ... nothing herein contained shall give any Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company. In its sole discretion, the Committee may authorize the creation of trusts or other arrangements to meet the obligations created under the Plan to deliver Common Stock or payments in lieu thereof. .'..</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1068-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 2891.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-9\">During the five-year holding period, the common stock was held in a trust, established and governed by a Trust Agreement, which provides that the \u201cassets[,] including [s]hares, that shall be held therein\u201d are \u201csubject to the claims of the Company\u2019s general creditors in the event the Company becomes insolvent ... until paid to Participants ... in such manner and at such times as the Company may specify to fulfill [its] obligations under the Plans.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1835. Section 1(e) of the Trust Agreement subjects the trust assets to claims of general creditors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-10\">The principal of the Trust, and any earnings thereon, .,. shall be used exclusively for the uses and purposes of Participants and general creditors as herein set forth. Participants shall have no preferred claim on, or any beneficial ownership interest in, any assets of the Trust. Any rights created under the Plans and this Agreement shall be mere unsecured contractual rights of Participants against the Company. Any assets held by the Trust will be subject to the claims of the Company\u2019s general creditors under federal \u00bfnd state law in the event the Company becomes insolvent. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1068-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 1836. Section 3(b) reiterates that, \u201c[a]t all times during the continuance of this Trust, ... the principal and income of the Trust shall be subject to claims of general creditors of the Company under federal and state law\u201d in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 1838.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-12\">Program documents for the years 2003 and 2004 (but not after) included provisions (\u201cSubordination Provisions\u201d) explicit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>ly stating that, \u201cin the event of bankruptcy,\u201d RSU-holder claims would be \u201cdeemed ... claims for damages arising from the purchase or sale of [Lehman Brothers c]ommon [s]tock[] within the meaning of section 510(b) ... and shall have in such bankruptcy the same priority as, and no greater priority than, common stock interests in [Lehman Brothers],\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52 \u00b6 10, 57 \u00b6 10. The record on appeal does not appear to disclose why, after 2004, the Program documents no longer included these Subordination Provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-4\">Employees received annual notice of the Program\u2019s terms by way of information packets containing a summary of the Program\u2019s material terms and a Program brochure.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These brochures stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that an RSU \u201crepresents [a] conditional right to receive one share of Lehman Brothers common stock,\u201d which \u201cthe firm holds on [an employee\u2019s] behalf for five years, which [he or she] will be entitled to receive at that time, provided [the employee] meet[s] certain terms and conditions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36, 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-5\">Although common stock was not issued until the completion of a five-year period,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> RSU holders received benefits similar to those of shareholders. They were paid dividends in the form of additional RSUs during the five-year period, and Program documents indicate that they could direct the trustee\u2019s votes on the shares held in the trust in proportion to the number of RSUs each owned. The value' of their RSUs, moreover, was directly tied to the value of Lehman Brothers\u2019 common stock: If the stock\u2019s value increased during the five-year holding period, RSU holders would benefit from that increase; if the stock\u2019s value decreased during that same period, they would ultimately bear the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-8\">\n<em>The Dispute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-9\">When Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on September 15, 2008, thousands of Lehman Brothers employees were holding RSUs that had not yet vested, having been granted for services performed between 2003 and 2008. Many RSU holders filed proofs of claim in the bankruptcy proceeding seeking cash payments equivalent to the amounts previously paid to them in RSUs. In response, Lehman Brothers filed fourteen omnibus objections seeking to reclassify over 3,000 RSU-based claims as equity interests and to subordinate them to the claims of general creditors. Most of the claimants did not oppose Lehman Brothers\u2019 objections, and accordingly, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York reclassified their claims as equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-10\">But 222 of the claimants opposed the objections. The bankruptcy court therefore held a hearing on December 21, 2011, where it indicated that it would follow the reasoning of <em>In re Enron Corp., </em>341 B.R. 141 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2006), which held \u201cthat claims for damages that arise from the ownership of employee stock options ... should be subordinated [to the claims of general creditors] pursuant to section 510(b),\u201d <em>id. </em>at 144, unless the claimants could establish that their RSUs were meaningfully different from the stock options at issue in <em>Enron. </em>The bankruptcy court directed the parties to develop a factual record in this regard. And in April 2014, at the conclusion of more than a year of discovery, the bankruptcy court conducted a three-day evidentiary hearing at which it heard live testimony from six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>witnesses. The parties then submitted supplemental briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-4\">On November 3, 2014, the bankruptcy court (Shelley C. Chapman, <em>Judge)</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>issued a decision sustaining Lehman Brothers\u2019 omnibus objections on two alternative grounds. <em>See In re Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc., </em>519 B.R. 47, 67 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2014), <em>aff'd, </em>548 B.R. 663 (S.D.N.Y. 2016). First, it held that the RSU-based claims, like the claims at issue in <em>Enron, </em>must be subordinated pursuant to section 510(b). <em>See id. </em>at 59-65. Second, it held that because the RSUs are equity securities under section 101(16) of the Bankruptcy Code, the claimants may assert only proofs of interest\u2014not proofs of claim\u2014against the debtor. <em>See id. </em>at 65-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-5\">Thereafter, some of the claimants appealed the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. And on March 30, 2016, the district court issued an opinion and order affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision on both grounds. <em>In re Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc., </em>548 B.R. 663, 671, 673 (S.D.N.Y. 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-9\">Three sets of claimants, representing a portion of the remaining claimants and each represented by different counsel, appealed from the judgment of the district court: (1) the Adler Claimants,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (2) the Antoncic Claimants,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and (3) the Neuber-ger Claimants.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The pertinent facts are essentially the same with respect to all three sets, with one exception: The Neu-berger Claimants became Lehman Brothers employees (and RSU holders) when Lehman Brothers acquired Neuberger Berman, an investment management firm. As former managing directors of Neuber-ger Bergman, they are subject to restrictive non-compete covenants. They assert that they had no real choice but to accept RSUs as part of their compensation because the acquisition forced them to become Lehman Brothers employees, and the restrictive non-compete covenants effectively forced them to remain employed at Lehman Brothers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">The bankruptcy and district courts addressed the subordination issue before considering whether the claims at issue here are disallowed because the claimants are equity security holders. We address these two issues in the reverse order because we think it more appropriate to determine whether the asserted claims are disallowed full stop, before considering whether they must be subordinated; an affirmative answer to the first question could preclude the need to answer the second. We conclude, however, that the claims at issue are not categorically disallowed because at least some of the claims are distinct from any equity security interests the claimants may otherwise hold, but that the claims must nonetheless be subordinated pursuant to section 510(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-6\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-7\">\u2018We exercise plenary review over a district court\u2019s affirmance of a bankruptcy court\u2019s decision, reviewing <em>de novo </em>the bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusion of law, and reviewing its findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>ANZ Sec., Inc. v. Giddens (In re Lehman Bros. Inc.), </em>808 F.3d 942, 946 (2d Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when \u201cthe reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWhere there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfin-der\u2019s choice between them cannot be clear'ly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-10\">II. Permissibility of the Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-11\">A debtor in bankruptcy may file an \u201comnibus objection\u201d to purported claims on the ground they are \u201cinterests, rather than claims.\u201d Fed R. Bankr. P. 3007(d)(7). The Bankruptcy Code defines a \u201cclaim\u201d as a \u201cright to payment ... or ... an equitable remedy,\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(5), whereas an \u201cequity security\u201d is, as relevant here, a \u201cshare in a corporation, whether or not transferrable or denominated \u2018stock,\u2019 or similar security,\u201d or a \u201cwarrant or right, other than a right to convert, to purchase, sell, or subscribe to [such an interest],\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 101(16)(A), (C). Those with \u201cclaims\u201d against a debtor are \u201ccreditors,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 101(10), and those with \u201cequity securities\u201d of the debtor are \u201cequity security holders,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 101 (17). Thus, an interest in an equity security is distinct from a claim to a right to payment or an equitable remedy. <em>See In re Pine Lake Vill. Apartment Co., </em>21 B.R. 478, 480 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1982) (distinguishing an interest in an equity security from \u201ca claim against the debtor for which the equity holder may assert a right to payment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-12\">But under some circumstances, an equity security holder may assert both an interest and a claim relating to that interest. <em>See </em>2 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 101.16 (Alan N. Resnick <em>&amp; </em>Henry J. Sommer eds., 16 ed.) (explaining that \u201cthe holder of an equity security may also hold a claim that relates to or arises out of an equity security\u201d). If an equity security holder, \u201cout of confusion,\u201d \u201cfile[s] [a] proof[] of claim\u201d\u2014instead of a proof of interest\u2014the claim is \u201cproperly disallowed\u201d as \u201cduplicative\u201d of a proof of interest. <em>USA Capital Realty Advisors, LLC v. USA Capital Diversified Trust Deed Fund, LLC (In re USA Commercial </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number><em>Mortg. Co.), </em>377 B.R. 608, 615 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 2007). But where an equity security holder asserts \u201c[a] proof of claim ... for breach of contract [or] fraud relating to the purchase of a security,\u201d that claim \u201cis ... not duplicative of the equity holder\u2019s proof of interest\u201d and may therefore be allowed, notwithstanding the claimant\u2019s status as an equity security holder. <em>Id. </em>(distinguishing between equity security holders\u2019 proofs of interest and proofs of claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">Here, the bankruptcy court determined that an RSU constitutes an \u201cequity security\u201d pursuant to section 101(16); on this basis alone, it held that the claimants\u2019 proofs of claim must be disallowed. <em>See Lehman Bros., </em>519 B.R. at 65-67 (\u201c[T]he [claimants] assert an interest based on equity securities, and, accordingly do not assert a \u2018claim\u2019 at all under the Bankruptcy Code.\u201d). This reasoning skips a step: Even assuming that RSU holders do have the right to assert proofs of interest insofar as RSUs constitute equity securities, it does not necessarily follow that the proofs of claim asserted by the claimants must be disallowed. They might be allowed if they are not duplicative of an asserted interest in an equity security. <em>See USA Commercial Mortg., </em>377 B.R. at 615. And in our view, at least some of the breach-of-contract claims at issue here fall into this category.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">The claimants assert, for example, that Lehman Brothers breached its contractual obligation to compensate them insofar as it did not pay them the cash value of the RSUs that never vested. This breach-of-contract claim, whatever its merits, is analytically distinct from any equity interest the claimants may or may not have in the RSUs. Thus, we need not resolve whether an RSU is an \u201cequity security\u201d pursuant to section 101(16) because, regardless of how we answer that question, the claimants are permitted to bring at least some of the claims at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-7\">III. Subordination of Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-8\">Although equity security holders may assert claims related to, but distinct from, their equity security interests, such claims are not necessarily on a par with other claims against the debtor. They must be subordinated if they are governed by section 610(b), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1072-9\">For the purpose of distribution under this title, a claim arising from rescission of a purchase or sale of a security of the debtor or of an affiliate of the debtor, [or] for damages arising from the purchase or sale of such a security, ... shall be subordinated to all claims or interests that are senior to or equal the claim or interest represented by such security, except that if such security is common stock, such claim has the same priority as common stock.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1072-10\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 510(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-11\">Section 510(b) safeguards the absolute priority rule, a bedrock principle of bankruptcy law, under which creditors are entitled to be paid ahead of shareholders in the distribution of corporate assets. <em>See Motorola, Inc. v. Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (In re Iridium Operating LLC), </em>478 F.3d 452, 463 (2d Cir. 2007) (explaining that, under the absolute priority rule, \u201cany plan of reorganization in which stockholders are preferred before the creditor is invalid\u201d (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)); Elizabeth Warren, <em>Bankruptcy Policy, </em>54 U. Chi. L. Rev. 775, 793 (1987) (explaining that \u201c[t]he [Bankruptcy] Code provides that the equity owners participate in distributions or maintain ownership interests following reorganization only if the creditors have been paid in full or ... consent to their continued ownership^]\u201d in accordance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>the \u201calmost axiomatic principle ... that, because equity owners stand to gain the most when a business succeeds, they should absorb the costs of the business\u2019s collapse\u2014up to the full amount of the investment\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Section 510(b) preserves the absolute priority rule by ensuring that security holders may not gain parity with creditors simply by alleging claims that arise from the purchase of their securities. <em>See </em>4 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 510.04 (\u201cThe clear mandate of section 510(b) is that shareholder claimants will not be permitted to elevate their interests from the level of equity to general claims.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">To that end, we construe section 510(b) broadly. <em>See Rombro v. Dufrayne (In re Med Diversified, Inc.), </em>461 F.3d 251, 255-59 (2d Cir. 2006). We do so in light of the statute\u2019s legislative history, specifically the House Report on the 1978 Bankruptcy Reform Act, H. Rep. No. 95-595, Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 (1977) (\u201cHouse Report\u201d), which, in adopting the language contained in the Act, relied on an article by John J. Slain and Homer Krip-ke, <em>The Interface Between Securities Regulation and Bankruptcy\u2014Allocating the Risk of Illegal Securities Issuance Between Securityholders and the Issuer\u2019s Creditors, </em>48 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 261 (1973) (\u201cSlain and Kripke\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See </em>House Report at 196 (explaining that \u201c[t]he bill generally adopts [the] Slain[ and JKripke position\u201d); <em>see also Med Diversified, </em>461 F.3d at 255-56. The House Report reflects Congress\u2019s apparent view that claims should be subordinated where, <em>inter alia, </em>the claimant \u201ctook on the risk and return expectations of a shareholder, rather than a creditor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus we held in <em>Med Diversified </em>that section 510(b) required subordination of fraud and breach-of-contract claims arising from a debtor\u2019s alleged failure to issue common stock in the debtor in exchange for the claimant\u2019s shares in another company inasmuch as the claimant had taken on the \u201crisk and return expectations of a shareholder\u201d by \u201cbargaining] not for cash but to become a stockholder in the debtor\u201d; we explained that he \u201cbecame bound by the choice he made to trade the relative safety of cash compensation for the upside potential of shareholder status\u2014the very choice highlighted by Slain and Kripke.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1073-9\">In <em>Med Diversified, </em>we also cited with approval <em>In re Enron Corp., </em>341 B.R. 141 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2006), a thorough and well-reasoned bankruptcy court decision applying section 510(b) to fraud and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>breach-of-contract \u201cclaims by employees for damages they allegedly suffered when, due to the debtor\u2019s fraud, they chose not to exercise stock options immediately when they vested but to hold onto the options with hopes for future higher returns.\u201d <em>Med Diversified, </em>461 F.3d at 257 (\u201cHelpful too is the recent and extraordinarily thorough decision in <em>In re Enron </em>[.] \u201d). Adopting a broad construction of section 510(b) premised on Slain and Kripke, <em>Enron, </em>341 B.R. at 163-65, the <em>Enron </em>court concluded, <em>inter alia, </em>that (1) a stock option is a \u201csecurity\u201d within the meaning of section 510(b) insofar as it meets the definition of that term set forth in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(49)(A)(xv) (providing that the term \u201csecurity\u201d includes a \u201cwarrant or right to subscribe to or purchase or sell[ ] a security\u201d), <em>id. </em>at 149-50; and (2) the employees \u201cpurchase[d]\u201d the stock options within the meaning of section 510(b) inasmuch as they \u201cwillingly accepted [them] in return for their labor,\u201d even though they \u201cwere required to receive [them as] a portion of their compensation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 151. The court therefore held that the breach-of-contract claim arising from their stock options must \u201cbe subordinated under section 510(b).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 161. In reaching that result, it explained that allowing parties to \u201crecharacterize\u201d equity-based claims as breach-of-contract claims of a creditor would undermine the purpose of section 510(b): \u201cto prevent shareholders and other securityholders from bootstrapping their equity interests to a level on [a] par with general creditors and thus sharing equally in the distribution of the bankrupt estate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1074-7\">In light of the analysis set forth in <em>Med Diversified </em>and <em>Enron, </em>the claims at issue here must be subordinated pursuant to section 510(b) if each of the following three conditions is met: (1) RSUs are securities, (2) the claimants acquired them in a purchase, and (3) the claims for damages arise from that purchase or the asserted rescission of it. We address each in turn, and ultimately conclude that subordination is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-8\">\n<em>A. RSUs as Securities</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-9\">At the threshold lies the question whether an RSU of the sort at issue here constitutes a \u201csecurity,\u201d as that term is defined by the Bankruptcy Code. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(49). We conclude that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-10\">Section 101(49) contains two subsections. Subsection (A) enumerates fifteen interests \u201cinclude[d]\u201d in the definition of a \u201csecurity\u201d: Fourteen of these are specific examples, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 101(49)(A)(i)-(xiii), (xv);<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the fifteenth is a residual clause that covers any \u201cother claim or interest commonly known as \u2018security,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 101(49)(A)(xiv). Subsection (B) enumerates seven items excluded from the definition of a security, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 101(49)(B)(i)\u2014(vii);<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> it does not include a residual clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>As a practical matter, some interests will not perfectly match any of the specific examples in either list, and it will not immediately be clear whether they are \u201csecurities.\u201d On these occasions, it should be borne in mind that the interests specifically enumerated in subsection (A) do not exhaust the universe of securities within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code. This is clear from the text of subsection (A), which provides that \u201c[t]he term \u2018security ... <em>includes\u201d </em>the items listed, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 101(49)(A) (emphasis added), where the term \u201c \u2018includes ... [is] not [a] limiting\u201d term, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 102(3). Thus, as other courts have recognized, the statutory list of securities set forth in subsection (A) is \u201cnonexclusive.\u201d <em>O\u2019Donnell v. Tristar Esperanza Props., LLC (In re Tristar Esperanza Props., LLC), </em>488 B.R. 394, 399 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 2013) (concluding that a membership interest in an LLC is a \u201csecurity\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>782 F.3d 492 (9th Cir. 2015); <em>see also O\u2019Cheskey v. Templeton (In re Am. Hous. Found.), </em>No. 09-20232-RLJ-11, 2013 WL 1316723, at *18, 2013 Bankr. LEXIS 1449 (Bankr. N.D. Tex. Mar. 30, 2013) (concluding that the enumerated list in section 101(49) is not exhaustive and that securities are not limited to the items specifically identified), <em>affd in part, rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>785 F.3d 143 (5th Cir. 2015). Indeed, the residual clause set forth in subsection (A)(xiv) clearly opens the door to securities not specifically listed. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(49)(A)(xiv) (providing that the term \u201csecurity\u201d includes any \u201cother claim or interest commonly known as [a] \u2018security \u201d); <em>see also SeaQuest Diving, LP v. S&amp;J Diving, Inc. (In the matter of SeaQuest Diving, LP), </em>579 F.3d 411, 418 (5th Cir. 2009) (observing that subsection (A)(xiv) is a \u201cbroad residual category\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-8\">An argument can be made that an RSU of the sort at issue qualifies as a security pursuant to one of the specific examples enumerated in subsection (A), namely that it is a \u201ccertificate of interest or participation in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase or sell, a security.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(49)(A)(xv); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 101(49)(A)(ii) (identifying \u201cstock\u201d as a \u201csecurity\u201d). As the bankruptcy court explained, \u201ca grant of an RSU constitutes a contingent right to participate in, receive [or] purchase [Lehman Brothers] common stock\u201d \u201conce certain employment-related conditions have been satisfied.\u201d <em>Lehman Bros., </em>519 B.R. at 60 (citing various Program documents). But even assuming that the claimants\u2019 RSUs do not fall squarely within subsection (A)(xv)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>\u2014or any of the other enumerated examples in subsection (A)\u2014we think that they nevertheless qualify as securities pursuant to the residual clause. <em>See </em>101 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(49)(A)(xiv).</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-9\">We reach this conclusion on the ground that, in certain important respects, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>claimants\u2019 RSUs resemble other securities specifically enumerated in subsection (A), see <em>United States v. Amato, </em>540 F.3d 163, 160 (2d Cir. 2008) (explaining that, under the canon of construction <em>ejusdem generis, </em>\u201cgeneral terms that follow specific ones are interpreted to embrace only objects of the same kind or class as the specific ones\u201d), <em>cert denied, </em>556 U.S. 1138, 129 S.Ct. 1635, 173 L.Ed.2d 1014 (2009). Indeed, these RSUs bear many of the hallmark characteristics of a security. Like many security holders, the RSU holders had limited voting rights<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and received any declared dividends in the form of additional RSUs.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> And of most significance, they had the same risk and benefit expectations as shareholders because the value of their RSUs was tied to the value of Lehman Brothers\u2019 common stock. Each RSU holder therefore had \u201cgreater financial expectations than [a] creditor\u201d inasmuch as a \u201ccreditor can only recoup her investment,\u201d whereas an RSU holder \u201cexpected] to participate in firm profits.\u201d <em>Med Diversified, </em>461 F.3d at 257 (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\">Several courts have similarly defined \u201csecurity\u201d in section 510(b) in terms of an interest tied to a firm\u2019s overall success. <em>See, e.g., KIT digital, Inc. v. Invigor Grp. Lid. (In re KIT digital, Inc.), </em>497 B.R. 170, 183 (Bankr.

We think they did insofar as Lehman Brothers awarded the claimants the RSUs as compensation for their labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-7\">The term \u201cpurchase\u201d in section 510(b) is properly construed broadly to include circumstances where a claimant has received equity securities in exchange for labor. <em>See Enron, </em>341 B.R. at 151 (\u201cWhile it is true that the [claimants did not purchase the stock options on the open market, they nonetheless exchanged value for the options: here, their labor. Such exchange falls under a broad reading of the term \u2018purchase.\u2019\u201d); <em>see also Med Diversified, </em>461 F.3d at 258 (noting that the rationale for mandatory subordination \u201capplies even if there is no actual sale or purchase\u201d of securities (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Liquidating Trust v.

As the bankruptcy court determined, \u201calthough the RSU [c]laimants had the option to leave employment at Lehman, they elected voluntarily not to do so primarily because of the high cost associated with leaving\u2014 i.e., leaving unvested equity awards \u2018on the table\u2019 [and] the inability to make as much money anywhere else.\u201d <em>Lehman Bros., </em>519 B.R. at 60-61. By agreeing to work for Lehman Brothers, the claimants voluntarily accepted that Lehman Brothers had the discretion\u2019 to pay part of their total compensation in RSUs.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>Cf Enron, </em>341 B.R. at 151 (concluding that the claimants purchased securities insofar as they \u201cwillingly accepted,\u201d as \u201ca condition of [their] employment,\u201d \u201ca portion of their compensation as [stock] options ... in return for their labor\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\">In arguing otherwise, the claimants point to <em>International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America v. Daniel, </em>439 U.S. 551, 99 S.Ct. 790, 58 L.Ed.2d 808 (1979), in which the Supreme Court held that participation in a compulsory and noncontributory pension plan does not constitute an investment decision within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act, <em>id. </em>at 559-60, 99 S.Ct. 790. Other courts, also in the context of federal securities law, have extended <em>Daniel </em>to compulsory and involuntary employee stock option plans. <em>See, e.g., McLaughlin v. Cendant Corp. (In re Cendant Corp. Sec. Litig.), </em>76 F.Supp.2d 539, 545 (D.N.J. 1999) (holding that the \u201c[p]laintiff did not receive her options as part of a bargained-for exchange that required her to make an affirmative investment decision\u201d where her \u201cparticipation in the option plan was an incident of employment and [her] only [other] choice would have been to [forgo] the receipt of benefits entirely\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted) (second brackets in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-7\">Here, however, <em>Daniel </em>is a glove that does not fit. It focused on whether employees made an investment decision that could be influenced by fraud or manipulation; the present case poses the distinct question whether equity was purchased through labor for purposes of subordination in bankruptcy. No case has been cited by the parties\u2014nor have we found one\u2014in which a court has applied the <em>Daniel </em>principle to section 510(b). And the claimants fail to make a compelling argument why the holding of <em>Daniel </em>should be extended beyond the context of federal securities laws so as to contravene the lesson of <em>Med Diversified </em>and <em>Enron: </em>Section 510(b) should be broadly construed in light of its purpose, <em>see Med Diversified, </em>461 F.3d at 255-59, to include circumstances where a claimant has received a security in exchange for labor, <em>Enron, </em>341 B.R. at 150-51.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1079-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>The Neuberger Claimants argue that, whatever can be said of the means by which the other claimants acquired RSUs, they did not voluntarily purchase them. They urge that when Lehman Brothers acquired Neuberger Berman, they had no realistic choice but to continue employment with Lehman Brothers\u2019 subsidiary because not doing so would have required them to forfeit their previously earned equity in Neuberger Berman, and to abandon their careers in light of pre-existing non-compete covenants imposed by Neu-berger Berman. We do not find this argument persuasive. As the bankruptcy court reasoned, \u201cbeginning with the merger and every day thereafter, the Neuberger [] Claimants,\u201d exactly like the other claimants, \u201chad the choice to \u2018vote with their feet\u2019 against the terms of the Program by leaving Lehman [Brothers].\u201d <em>Lehman Bros., </em>519 B.R. at 62. That they considered this option to be less rewarding than remaining employed by Lehman Brothers does not mean that they had no choice in the matter; it means that they \u201cmade an economic decision based on rational self-interest.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">Nor can the Neuberger Claimants successfully argue economic duress under New York law, a doctrine \u201creserved for extreme and extraordinary' cases,\u201d <em>VKK Corp. v.

New York, </em>13 A.D.3d 873, 874, 787 N.Y.S.2d 155, 157 (3d Dep\u2019t 2004). And even in the unlikely event that they could meet these requirements,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the Neuberger Claimants have waived any economic duress argument by failing to seek prompt repudiation of the terms of their 2003 agreement with Lehman Brothers. <em>See VKK Corp., </em>244 F.3d at 123 (explaining that \u201cit is well established under New York law that a party asserting duress must do so promptly\u201d and that \u201c[d]elays as short as six months have been held to constitute forfeiture of the claim\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The Neuberger Claimants\u2019 assertion of economic duress many years after entering the agreement is untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-8\">Thus, within the meaning of section 510(b), we conclude that all the claimants purchased their RSUs by voluntarily choosing to receive them in exchange for a portion of their labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>\n<em>C.

In light of the well-settled principle that this provision is to be interpreted broadly, <em>see Med Diversified, </em>461 F.3d at 257-58, courts have concluded that section 510(b) covers \u201ca wide variety of causes of action arising out of securities transactions.\u201d 4 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 510.04 (collecting cases). A claim (no matter how it is characterized by the claimant) arises from a securities transaction so long as the transaction is part of the causal link leading to the alleged injury. <em>See, e.g., Med Diversified, </em>461 F.3d at 257-59 (holding that section 510(b) applies to a claim arising from a failed securities transaction even though the claimant never received shares in the debtor); <em>Baroda Hill Invs., Ltd. v.

Alternative Performance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ATb\">The claimants first assert that they have .alternative-performance claims against Lehman Brothers to be paid in cash in exchange for their labor because the RSUs they received never vested. These claims, they contend, do not arise from the purchase of a security within the meaning of section 510(b), but are instead general-creditor claims for cash owed in exchange for services rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-11\">This theory finds no support in the Program documents under the terms of which Lehman Brothers had the discretion to pay a portion of the claimants\u2019 compensation with RSUs; those documents also make clear that once Lehman Brothers chose to award RSUs in this manner, it had no further obligation to pay cash for that same portion of compensation.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>only remaining obligation was to deliver stock to the RSU holders at the conclusion of the five-year period, assuming the specified conditions were met. In this regard, the Plan provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-5\">With respect to any [RSUs] granted under the Plan, the obligations of the Company or any Subsidiary are limited solely to the delivery of shares of Common Stock on the date when such shares of Common Stock are due to be delivered under each Agreement, and in no event shall the Company or any Subsidiary become obligated to pay cash in respect of such obligation... ,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"axm-dedup-0\">JA at 2890 \u00a7 8(b); <em>see also id. </em>at 3505 \u00a7 8(b) (same). The Trust Agreement further reflects that RSU holders are distinct from general creditors insofar as the assets held in the trust, including the shares held for RSU holders, are \u201csubject to the claims of the Company\u2019s general creditors in the event the Company becomes insolvent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1835,1838.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">The claimants point to the following language of the Plan as evidence that RSU holders are to be treated as general creditors: \u201cWith respect to any payments not yet made to a [p]articipant, .... nothing herein contained shall give any [p]artici-pant any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2891 \u00a7 16. But this provision does not support the claimants\u2019 assertion. Its plain language reflects no more than that the participants\u2019 rights may not be <em>greater </em>than those of general creditors, not that they may not be <em>less </em>than\u2014or subordinate to\u2014the rights of general creditors. The provision, moreover, applies by its own terms only to \u201cany payments not yet made to a participant,\u201d <em>id., </em>which, in light of the other Program documents already described, clearly refers to circumstances where Lehman Brothers has not yet paid its employees\u2014 either in cash or in RSUs\u2014for services rendered. The provision does not apply where, as here, Lehman Brothers has already made payments to the claimants for all services rendered, either in the form of cash or RSUs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-10\">In sum, we conclude that the claimants cannot assert claims arising from anything other than the purchase of RSUs because they have already been paid the compensation they were due in the form of RSUs and, as a result, have no right to any other mode of performance. Once they received RSUs, their only right vis-a-vis Lehman Brothers was for the delivery of stock at the conclusion of the five-year holding period, assuming the specified employment-related conditions were met. They therefore cannot avoid subordination of their claims under section 510(b).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>\n<em>2. Restitution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">Nor can the claimants circumvent section 510(b) by asserting restitution claims. In light of the failure of their alternative-performance theory, their strongest argument for restitution appears to be that: (1) Lehman Brothers, by filing for bankruptcy, repudiated its contractual condition to issue stock to RSU holders (who presumably satisfied their own employment-related conditions); and (2) as a result, RSU holders are entitled to recover in restitution for the reasonable value of the services they rendered to Lehman Brothers. Yet, under Delaware law, which governs the construction of the Program documents, <em>see </em>JA at 68, a breach-of-contract claim requires \u201cdamage to the plaintiff\u2019 resulting from the breach, <em>VLIW Tech., L.L.C. v. Hewlett-Packard Co., </em>840 A.2d 606, 612 (Del. 2003). Although the claimants were theoretically wronged by not receiving the Lehman Brothers shares they were owed, those shares became worthless once Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. They therefore suffered no actual injury because the only thing to which they were contractually entitled\u2014 shares of Lehman Brothers common stock\u2014had no value. This defeats their breach-of-contract claim and, thus, their right to restitution.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1083-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>\n<em>8. Subordination Provisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"aqih-dedup-0\">Finally, the claimants contend that the deletion of the Subordination Provisions in the Program documents evidences the parties\u2019 intention to treat the claimants as general creditors in the event of bankruptcy-</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">As we have noted, Program documents for 2003 and 2004 included Subordination Provisions explicitly stating that in the event of bankruptcy, claims of RSU holders would be deemed to be claims for damages arising from the purchase or sale of a security pursuant to section 510(b); Program documents for subsequent years, however, did not contain Subordination Provisions. The claimants assert that this history supports a conclusion that (at least after 2004) the parties intended for the claimants to be treated as general creditors. But this assertion rests entirely on speculation. The claimants cite, and we ourselves see, no record evidence establishing the reason for the removal of the Subordination Provisions.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> There is thus no basis to conclude that the removal of these provisions reflects the parties\u2019 intention to treat RSU holders as general creditors in the event of insolvency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-6\">\u215c \u215c \u215c</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-7\">In sum, we conclude that the claimant\u2019s\u2019 RSU-based claims\u2014no matter how they are characterized\u2014must be subordinated pursuant to section 510(b) because they arise from the purchase or sale of securities.

The claimants assert that they did not have voting rights, but fail to cite any record evidence supporting their assertion. The documentary evidence on which the bankruptcy court relied, <em>see Lehman Bros., </em>519 B.R. at 56, reflects that Lehman Brothers established a trust, funded with shares to be issued upon the conversion of RSUs to common stock, that gave RSU holders the ability to direct voting on those shares based on the proportion of the number RSUs held by the employees. <em>See, </em>e.g., JA at 2616 (2003 Program); <em>id. </em>at 2862 (2005 Program),</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1076-6\">.

Whatever the merits of this argument, it does not change the outcome here because a claim for rescission\u2014like a claim for damages\u2014is subject to section 510(b), <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 510(b) (\"[A] claim arising from rescission of a purchase or sale of a security of the debtor ... shall be subordinated to all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>claims or interests that are senior to or equal the claim or interest represented by such security. ...\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">. Even if the claimants could allege an actual injury, their restitution claims might nonetheless be subordinated under section 510(b) inasmuch as those claims are functionally equivalent to a claim for rescission or a claim for damages, both of which are expressly covered by section 510(b). \"As a remedy for [a] breach [of contract], \u2018restitution\u2019 means either the restoration of a specific thing or the payment in money of the value of a contractual performance by [the claimant].\u201d Henry Mather, <em>Restitution as a Remedy for Breach of Contract: The Case of the Partially Performing Seller, </em>92 Yale L. J. 14, 14 n.l (1982) (citing Restatement of Contracts \u00a7 326(b) (1932)). In the former sense, a \"plea for restitution is merely the remedial flip side of [a] rescission claim; rescission will unwind or avoid the transaction, and restitution will put the parties back in their original positions.\u201d <em>Tekinsight.Com, Inc. v. Stylesite Mktg., Inc. (In re Stylesite Mktg., Inc.), </em>253 B.R. 503, 510-11 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2000). A claim for restitution in this sense may well be subject to section 510(b), broadly interpreted, insofar as it is functionally equivalent to a claim for rescission. <em>See id. </em>at 511 (explaining that a claim that \"depend[s] on [the claimant\u2019s] purchase of the [debtor\u2019s] stock ... arise[s] from that purchase\u201d regardless of whether the claimant \"chooses to call it\u201d rescission or restitution). Similarly, the second sense in which the term \"restitution\u201d can be used as a breach-of-contract remedy\u2014payment measured in terms of the defendant\u2019s gain rather than the claimant\u2019s loss\u2014might sometimes (though not always) be functionally equivalent to a claim for damages. Restitution, of course, provides for a measure of recovery that is analytically distinct from that of damages. <em>See In re Gartenberg, </em>636 F.2d 16, 17 (2d Cir. 1980) (\u201cRestitution is a remedy distinct from damages and requiring different proof.\u201d); <em>see also </em>Douglas Laycock, <em>Restoring Restitution to the Canon, </em>110 Mich. L. Rev. 929, 938 (2012) (\"The fundamental question in damages ... is how much a plaintiff lost.... But in restitution, ... [it] is how much [the] defendant was unjustly enriched.\u201d). But \"[w]hen the restitu-tionary claim leads to the same recovery as the ... claim [for damages], there is little reason to distinguish between them.\u201d Douglas Laycock, <em>The Scope and Significance of Restitution, </em>67 Tex. L. Rev. 1277, 1286 (1989). Indeed, \"[w]hen the underlying wrong is the same and the remedy is the same, important collateral issues,\u201d such as whether to subordinate claims pursuant to section 510(b), \"should not be left open to the option of the clever pleader.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, it appears that the claimants\u2019 remedy would be the same whether awarded as damages or as restitution. Indeed, in making their restitution argument, the claimants contend that the proper measurement for recovery is the amount of cash that Lehman Brothers could have paid them in lieu of RSUs, the very same amount they seek in damages by means of their alternative-performance theory. <em>See supra. </em>In this regard, the restitution theory seems to be merely a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>new bottle for old vinegar; the two theories appear to be functionally the same. To be clear, though, this is not the basis on which we reject the claimants\u2019 restitution argument; we reject it because the claimants are unable to allege an injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b1083-9\">.
