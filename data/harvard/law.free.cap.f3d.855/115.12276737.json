CABRANES, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">This petition for enforcement of an order of the National Labor Relations Board (the \u201cBoard\u201d or the \u201cNLRB\u201d) and an employer\u2019s cross-petition for review present two questions. The first is whether the employer, Respondent-Cross-Petitioner Pier Sixty, LLC (\u201cPier Sixty\u201d), has forfeited its challenge to the legality of the appointment of Acting General Counsel of the NLRB, Lafe Solomon (\u201cSolomon\u201d). Pier Sixty argues that Solomon, who authorized the complaint in this case, served in violation of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 (the \u201cFVRA\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that the complaint was therefore issued illegally. Although Pier Sixty failed to raise this argument before the Board, as required by Section 10(e) of the National Labor Relations Act (the \u201cNLRA\u201d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pier Sixty argues that we may nonetheless consider it on appeal, under the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d exception in that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">The second question presented is what constitutes \u201copprobrious conduct\u201d in the context of an employee\u2019s comments on social media. To be more precise: the NLRA generally prohibits employers from terminating an employee based on that employee\u2019s union-related activity. But even an employee engaged in protected activity \u201ccan, by opprobrious conduct, lose the protection of the [NLRA.] \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We are thus required to resolve whether an employee\u2019s Facebook post insulting his boss\u2019s mother and encouraging other employees to vote for the union ought to receive protection under Sections 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) of NLRA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-15\">We hold that Pier Sixty has not shown the existence of an \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d that requires us to waive the ordinary rule against considering arguments not presented to the Board as required by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e). We therefore do not reach the merits of the challenge to Acting General Counsel Solomon\u2019s appointment. We also affirm the NLRB\u2019s determination that Pier Sixty violated Sections 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) by discharging Hern\u00e1n Perez <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>since Perez\u2019s conduct was not so \u201copprobrious\u201d as to lose the protection of the NLRA. Our decision rests heavily on the deference afforded to NLRB factual findings, made following a six-day bench trial informed by the specific social and cultural context in this case. We note, however, that Perez\u2019s conduct sits at the outer-bounds of protected, union-related comments for the reasons laid out below.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Accordingly, we GRANT the Board\u2019s application for enforcement and DENY Pier Sixty\u2019s cross-petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Pier Sixty operates a catering company in New York, N.Y. In early 2011, many of its service employees began seeking union representation. Following what the parties substantially agree was a tense organizing campaign that included threats from management that employees could be penalized or discharged for union activities, Pier Sixty employees voted to unionize in an October 27, 2011 election.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Two days before that election, Hern\u00e1n Perez was working as a server at a Pier Sixty venue. A supervisor, Robert McSweeney, gave Perez and two other servers various directions in what the NLRB\u2019s opinion describes as a \u201charsh tone.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> These directions included \u201cTurn your head that way [towards the guests] and stop chitchatting,\u201d and \u201cSpread. out, move, move.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> McSweeney\u2019s attitude in delivering these instructions upset Perez, who viewed them as the latest instance of the management\u2019s continuing disrespect for employees. About forty-five minutes later, during an authorized break from work, Perez used his iPhone to post the following message on his Facebook page:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Asp\">Bob is such a NASTY MOTHER FUCKER don\u2019t know how to talk to people!!!!!! Fuck his mother and his entire fucking family!!!! What a LOSER! !!! Vote YES for the UNION! !!!!!!<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">\u201cBob\u201d referred to McSweeney. Perez knew that his Facebook \u201cfriends,\u201d including ten coworkers, would be able to see the post; the post was also publicly accessible, although Perez may not have known so at the time.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Perez took down the post three days later, on October 28, 2011. The post had already come to the attention of the management of Pier Sixty which, following an investigation, fired Perez on November 9, 2011.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">Later that day, Perez filed a charge with the NLRB alleging that he had been terminated in retaliation for \u201cprotected concerted activities.\u201d On December 15, 2011, Evelyn Gonzalez, who had led organizing efforts at Pier Sixty, filed a second charge, alleging various unfair labor practices in violation of Section 8(a)(1) of the NLRA. On August 24, 2012, NLRB Region Two issued an amended complaint consolidating those two charges.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>On April 18, 2013, the presiding Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) issued a decision finding, as relevant here, that Pier Sixty had violated Sections 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) of the NLRA by discharging Perez in retaliation for protected activity.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Pier Sixty filed exceptions, and a three-member panel of the NLRB affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision, with one member dissenting. The NLRB filed an application for enforcement, and Pier Sixty filed a cross-petition for review that are now before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">While both parties agree that we have jurisdiction, we nonetheless consider the issue independently.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As an initial matter, the Board had jurisdiction over the original petition under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(a)-(c), which empowers the Board to prevent unfair labor practices.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Exercising that pow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>er, the Board issued a final order in this matter on March 31, 2015.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Since Pier Sixty is located in New York and transacts business within this Circuit, we have jurisdiction over both the Board\u2019s petition for enforcement of that order, under Section 10(e) of the NLRA,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and Pier Sixty\u2019s cross-petition for review of that order, under Section 10(f) of the NLRA.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">A. The Validity of the Acting General Counsel\u2019s Appointment</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">As an initial matter, we address Pier Sixty\u2019s argument that the Court cannot enforce the NLRB decision because the complaint against Pier Sixty was not authorized by law. We do not reach the merits of this FVRA challenge because Pier Sixty has forfeited the issue by not raising it in the proceedings before the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-18\">In making this argument, Pier Sixty relies entirely on <em>SW General, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>a recent decision of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (\u201cD.C. Circuit\u201d), which held that the NLRB\u2019s Acting General Counsel Solomon \u2014 under whose authority the complaint against Pier Sixty issued \u2014 served in violation of the FVRA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3345 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Supreme Court recently affirmed that decision and adopted the D.C. Circuit\u2019s interpretation of the FVRA. Once President Obama nominated Solomon (on January 5, 2011) to serve as General Counsel, the Supreme Court concluded, the FVRA prohibited Solomon from continuing his service as Acting General Counsel.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Pier Sixty argues that because the complaint here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>was issued under the purported authority of Solomon as Acting General Counsel on August 24, 2012, it was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">But unlike the petitioner in RW <em>General, </em>Pier Sixty never raised this argument before the Board. Pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e), \u201c[n]o objection that has not been urged before the Board ... shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances.\u201d Our precedents make clear, moreover, that even an apparently meritorious challenge to the authority of an NLRB agent in itself does not qualify as an \u201cexceptional circumstance\u201d allowing the party to raise the argument for the first time before our Court.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">While we recognize that this issue, generally construed, has divided various panels of the Courts of Appeals,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Pier Sixty does not even cite or acknowledge <em>any </em>of those cases \u2014 aside, of course, from asking us to \u201ctake judicial notice of the [D.C. Circuit\u2019s opinion in] &lt;SW <em>General\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2014 let alone address any of the arguments with which those panels have grappled. Our Court has already addressed the matter, so we need not be long detained by these other decisions; we simply note that to the extent Pier Sixty\u2019s \u201carguments\u201d might be construed as requesting us to reconsider our precedents, we decline to do so. Accordingly, we conclude that Pier Sixty forfeited its FVRA challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"AmF\">B. The NLRB\u2019s Decision That Pier Sixty Violated the NLRA by Discharging Perez</p>\n<p id=\"b147-13\">We now turn to the second question presented \u2014 namely, whether the NLRB\u2019s petition for enforcement should be granted. That question itself turns on a more particular one: was Perez\u2019s Facebook post so \u201copprobrious\u201d as to lose the protection that the NLRA affords union-related speech?</p>\n<p id=\"b147-14\">In answering that question, we will accept the NLRB\u2019s factual findings \u201cif they are supported by substantial evidence in light of the record as a whole.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Sub-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>stantial evidence means \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Furthermore, we will not disturb the Board\u2019s adoption of an ALJ\u2019s credibility determinations unless \u201cthe testimony is hopelessly incredible or the findings flatly contradict either the law of nature or undisputed documentary testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> While we review the NLRB\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de -novo,</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201c[l]egal conclusions based upon the Board\u2019s expertise should receive, pursuant to longstanding Supreme Court precedent, considerable deference.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">The NLRA generally prohibits employers from discharging an employee for concerted or union-related activity. Specifically, Section 7 of the NLRA guarantees employees the right \u201cto engage in ... concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Determining whether an activity falls within the meaning of Section 7 is a task that \u201cimplicates [the Board\u2019s] expertise in labor relations\u201d and is for \u201cthe Board to perform in the first instance.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">This right to engage in union-related activity is protected by Sections 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) of the NLRA, which prohibit an employer from discharging employees for participating in protected, union-related activity under Section 7.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> But even an employee engaged in ostensibly protected activity may act \u201cin such an abusive manner that he loses the protection\u201d of the NLRA.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The parties disagree about the proper framework for identifying \u201cabusive\u201d behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-13\">The \u201cabusive\u201d behavior at issue here is Perez\u2019s use of obscenities in the workplace. Traditionally, the starting point for evaluating whether an employee\u2019s \u201cuttering of ... obscenities\u201d in the workplace qualifies for protection under the NLRA has been the four-factor test established by the NLRB in <em>Atlantic Steel.</em><footnotemark><em>32</em></footnotemark><em> </em>That test considers: \u201c(1) the place of the discussion; (2) the subject matter of the discussion; (3) the nature of the employee\u2019s outburst; and (4) whether the outburst was, in any way, provoked by an employer\u2019s unfair labor practice.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-14\">But the <em>Atlantic Steel </em>test has come under pressure in recent years. In <em>NLRB v. Starbucks, </em>this Court concluded that the <em>Atlantic Steel </em>test gave insufficient weight to employers\u2019 interests in preventing em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>ployees\u2019 outbursts \u201cin a public place in the presence of customers\u201d and we suggested more balanced standards for evaluating \u201copprobrious\u201d conduct in that context.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> We remanded the cause to the NLRB to develop an appropriate test for determining the NLRA\u2019s \u201cprotection for an employee who, while discussing employment issues, utters obscenities in the presence of customers.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">At about the same time, the General Counsel\u2019s Office began developing new guidance for evaluating an employee\u2019s use of social media that went in a more employee-friendly direction and that limited the ability of employers to issue rules regarding use of social media, even where employees were posting public criticisms of their employers and workplace.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> This new guidance built upon a. regularly-observed distinction between activity outside the workplace and confrontations in the immediate presence of coworkers or customers.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> In light of the General Counsel\u2019s new guidance, the Board has utilized the nine-factor \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test in recent social media cases.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">In the present case, after adopting the ALJ\u2019s factual findings, the Board analyzed Perez\u2019s Facebook post using the nine-factor \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test. While we are not convinced the amorphous \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test adequately balances an employer\u2019s interests,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Pier Sixty did riot object to the ALJ\u2019s use of the test in evaluating Perez\u2019s statements before the Board. For that reason, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>need not, and do not, address the validity of that test in this opinion.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Instead, Pier Sixty argues that the Board\u2019s decision \u2014 that \u201cPerez\u2019 comments were not so egregious as to exceed the Act\u2019s protection\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> \u2014 is not supported by \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d in the record. It is not entirely clear whether Pier Sixty is challenging the factual findings of the Board or its legal conclusions. Regardless of whether we are reviewing the factual findings under a \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard or the legal conclusions under a \u201cconsiderable deference\u201d standard, the Board\u2019s decision in this case is justified.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Several factors inform our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">First, even though Perez\u2019s message was dominated by vulgar attacks on McSwee-ney and his family, the \u201csubject matter\u201d of the message included workplace concerns \u2014 management\u2019s allegedly disrespectful treatment of employees, and the upcoming union election. Pier Sixty had demonstrated its hostility toward employees\u2019 union activities in the period immediately prior to the representation election and proximate to Perez\u2019s post. Pier Sixty had threatened to rescind benefits and/or fire employees who voted for unionization.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> It also had enforced a \u201cno talk\u201d rule on groups of employees, including Perez and Gonzalez, who were prevented by McSweeney from discussing the Union. Perez\u2019s Facebook post explicitly protested mistreatment by management and exhorted employees to \u201cVote YES for the UNION.\u201d <footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Thus, the Board could reasonably determine that Perez\u2019s outburst was not an idiosyncratic reaction to a manager\u2019s request but part of a tense debate over managerial mistreatment in the period before the representation election.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">Second, Pier Sixty consistently tolerated profanity among its workers. The ALJ found that Pier Sixty had not previously disciplined employees for widespread profanity in the workplace, including the words \u201cfuck\u201d and \u201cmotherfucker,\u201d among other expletives and racial slurs. The Board relied on evidence that, in the context of daily obscenities, Pier Sixty only issued five written warnings to employees for such an offense in the six years prior to Perez\u2019s discharge. And there was no evidence that Pier Sixty has ever discharged an employee solely for the use of offensive language. The ALJ specifically credited employee testimony that Chef DeMaiolo and McSweeney cursed at employees on a daily basis including screaming phrases such as \u201cWhat the fuck- are you doing?,\u201d \u201cMotherfucker,\u201d and \u201cAre you guys fucking stupid?\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> We recognize that one could draw a distinction between generalized seatology (or even cursing <em>at </em>someone), and, on the othqr hand, cursing someone\u2019s mother and family.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> But one could reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>ably decide, as the ALJ did in this case, that Perez\u2019s comments \u201cwere not a slur against McSweeney\u2019s family but, rather, an epithet directed to MeSweeney himself.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Under the circumstances presented here, it is striking that Perez- \u2014 who had been a server at Pier Sixty for thirteen years \u2014 was fired for profanities two days before the Union election when no employee had ever before been sanctioned (much less fired) for profanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Third, the \u201clocation\u201d of Perez\u2019s comments was an online forum that is a key medium of communication among coworkers and a tool for organization in the modern era. While a Facebook post may be visible to the whole world, including actual and potential customers, as Pier Sixty argues, Perez\u2019s outburst was not in the immediate presence of customers nor did it disrupt the catering event.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Furthermore, Perez asserts that he mistakenly thought that his Facebook page was private and took the post down three days later, upon learning that it was publicly accessible. We thus conclude, according appropriate deference to the Board\u2019s factual findings and interpretation of the NLRA, that the Board did not err in ruling that Perez\u2019s Facebook post, although vulgar and inappropriate, was not so egregious as to exceed the NLRA\u2019s protection. Nor was his Facebook post equivalent to a \u201cpublic outburst\u201d in the presence of customers and thus can reasonably be distinguished from other cases of \u201copprobrious conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">In sum, Pier Sixty has failed to meet its burden of showing that Perez\u2019s behavior was so egregious as to lose the protection of the NLRA under the Board\u2019s \u201ctotality-of-the-circumstances\u201d test. However, we note that this case seems to us to sit at the outer-bounds of protected, union-related comments, and any test for evaluating \u201copprobrious conduct\u201d must be sufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>sensitive to employers\u2019 legitimate disciplinary interests, as we have previously cautioned.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> We have considered all of Pier Sixty\u2019s objections to enforcement and have found them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">To summarize, we hold as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">(1) Pier Sixty has forfeited its challenge to the legality of Acting General Counsel Solomon\u2019s appointment by failing to raise it before the Board as required by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e). Since it has not argued the existence of an \u201cextraordinary circumstance,\u201d which would allow us to waive the ordinary rule against considering arguments not presented to the Board, we do not reach the merits of its FVRA challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">(2) The NLRB\u2019s petition for enforcement \u2014 urging that Pier Sixty violated Sections 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) of NLRA by discharging Hern\u00e1n Perez since Perez\u2019s conduct was not so \u201copprobrious\u201d as to lose the protection of the NLRA \u2014 is granted. Our conclusion rests heavily on the deference afforded to NLRB\u2019s interpretation of the NLRA and its factual findings, which, in the instant case, were informed by a six-day bench trial. We note, however, that Perez\u2019s conduct sits at the outer-bounds of protected, union-related comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we GRANT the Board\u2019s application for enforcement and DENY Pier Sixty\u2019s cross-petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-8\">. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3345 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b143-9\">.
