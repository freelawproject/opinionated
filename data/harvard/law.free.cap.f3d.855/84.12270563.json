The tortured corporate histories and shifting legal theories involved make it a messy case to distill. At its core, it is about more than 4,300 individuals (the \u201cAvoca Plaintiffs\u201d) who allege significant injuries from the operation of a wood-treatment plant in Avoca, Pennsylvania (the \u201cAvoca Plant\u201d) between 1956 and 1996. They originally brought their toxic-tort claims in Pennsylvania state court (the \u201cPA State Action\u201d) against several entities including Kerr-McGee Corporation (\u201cNew Kerr-McGee\u201d), but their suits were stayed when two of those entities, the owners/operators of the Avoca Plant (the \u201cTronox debtors\u201d or \u201cthe debtors\u201d), filed for bankruptcy in the Southern District of New York. The bankruptcy proceeding revealed a series of corporate transformations that ultimately yielded New Kerr-McGee. After the spinoff, New Kerr-McGee maintained control of the more lucrative oil and gas businesses and left the Tronox debtors with the immense environmental and tort liabilities arising from the previous operation of the Avoca Plant. These transactions were, as the bankruptcy court concluded, essentially fraudulent conveyances designed to place assets beyond the reach of the Tronox entities\u2019 creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-9\">In the course of the bankruptcy proceeding, the Tronox debtors instituted an adversary proceeding against New Kerr-McGee for fraudulent conveyance to recover assets that would satisfy the debtors\u2019 liabilities. Ultimately, New Kerr-McGee settled with the Tronox debtors for over $5 billion; of that sum, more than $600 million was designated for beneficiaries of the Tort Claims Trust, including the Avoca Plaintiffs. New Kerr-McGee sought peace with that payment and required as part of the settlement that the District Court\u2014the court tasked with approving the bankruptcy settlement\u2014would issue an injunction barring the litigation of claims that are derivative or duplicative of the Tronox debtors\u2019 claims against New Kerr-McGee (the \u201cInjunction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-10\">After the District Court approved the settlement and issued the Injunction, the Avoca Plaintiffs sought- to revive their toxic-tort claims in Pennsylvania state court, again naming New Kerr-McGee as a defendant. The Avoca Plaintiffs did not, however, alter their state-court complaint to allege direct claims against New Kerr-McGee to hold it responsible for its own alleged wrongdoing. Instead, they advanced indirect alter-ego and veil-piercing theories to hold New Kerr-McGee responsible for the conduct of the Tronox debtors. New Kerr-McGee moved in the District Court for an order enforcing the Injunction and for sanctions, asserting that the Injunction forecloses claims that arise from liabilities derived from or through the Tronox debtors that are also generalized and common to all creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>The District Court concluded that the claims are barred by the Injunction and, without imposing sanctions or finding contempt, ordered the Avoca Plaintiffs to dismiss with prejudice their state-court complaints. The Avoca Plaintiffs appealed and sought a stay pending appeal, which we granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">The Avoca Plaintiffs assert three bases for appellate jurisdiction\u201428 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291, 158(d), and 1292(a)(1)\u2014none of which persuade us. First, the District Court\u2019s order is not \u201cfinal\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, because it neither found contempt nor imposed sanctions. Second, the order is not a decision by the District Court on review of a bankruptcy court order, as required by \u00a7 158(d). Third, after an appropriate, under the circumstances, discussion of the merits, we conclude that we lack jurisdiction under \u00a7 1292(a)(1) because the District Court properly construed (and neither modified nor continued) the Injunction. In confirming the District Court\u2019s construction of the Injunction, we hold that the Avoca Plaintiffs\u2019 personal injury claims based on conduct of the Tronox debtors, and asserted against New Kerr-McGee on a variety of state-law indh-ect-liability theories, are generalized \u201cderivative\u201d claims that fall within the property of the bankruptcy estate. Accordingly, we lift the stay and DISMISS the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-9\">BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1034-10\">I. Corporate History op the Relevant Entities</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-11\">Critical to the District Court\u2019s decision below and ours here is the role and relationship of the relevant defendants in the PA State Action\u2014\u201cKerr-McGee Chemical,\u201d \u201cOld Kerr-McGee,\u201d and \u201cNew Kerr-McGee\u201d\u2014and the allegations against them. It gets confusing because both Old Kerr-McGee and New Kerr-McGee, at different times, have operated under the name \u201cKerr-McGee Corporation.\u201d The critical takeaway is that Kerr-McGee Chemical,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the previous operator of the Avoca Plant, and its former parent, Old Kerr-McGee,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ultimately became the Tronox debtors (Tronox LLC and Tronox Worldwide LLC, respectively). New Kerr-McGee,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a later corporate spinoff of Kerr-McGee Chemical and Old Kerr-McGee, did not exist until 2001 and was not a Tronox debtor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1035-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>The r\u00e9ason for the confusing history of corporate restructurings and name changes is that, starting in 2002, New Kerr-McGee began to sever its chemical business\u2014which included the Avoca Plant and was riddled with legacy tort and environmental liabilities\u2014from its more profitable oil and gas business. <em>See Tronox Inc. v. Kerr McGee Corp. (In re Tronox), </em>503 B.R. 239, 252-55, 259, 266 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2013). Upon completion of the spinoff in 2006, New Kerr-McGee was separated from the Tronox entities, including what were formerly Kerr-McGee Chemical and Old Kerr-McGee. This spinoff in essence allocated substantially all of the former companies\u2019 valuable assets to New Kerr-McGee and substantially all of the companies\u2019 costly liabilities to the Tronox debtors, which the debtors claimed left them Severely undercapitalized and became the basis of their fraudulent-conveyance claims in the adversary proceeding against. New Kerr-McGee in the bankruptcy. <em>Id. </em>More on that later.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-4\">II. The PA State Action</p>\n<p id=\"arc-dedup-2\">In 2005, the Avoca Plaintiffs sued Kerr-McGee Chemical, Old Kerr-McGee, and New Kerr-McGee<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in Pennsylvania state court asserting toxic-tort claims for hundreds of millions of dollars based on the operation of the Avoca Plant. A consolidated \u201cMaster Complaint\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> alleged that, from 1956 through 1996, operations at the Avoca Plant led to the \u201cintentional, negligent[,j and otherwise tortious release of dangerous chemicals\u201d into the environment, causing the Avoca Plaintiffs cancer and other illnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-10\">\u2022The Master Complaint alleged no direct liability of New Kerr-McGee; it failed to identify any act by New Kerr-McGee that contributed to the injuries of the Avoca Plaintiffs after its creation in 2001,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Instead, it alleged the direct liability of only Old Kerr-McGee for its actions as parent of Kerr-McGee Chemical during that entity\u2019s operation of the plant. The Master Complaint sought to impute the acts of the plant\u2019s prior corporate owners/operators to New Kerr-McGee based on various indirect-liability alter-ego/veil-piercing and successor-liability theories.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Specifically, the Master Complaint alleged that Old Kerr-McGee</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-11\">provided environmental policies, legal counsel, hydrological services and laboratory technical services in connection with the operation of the wood treatment plant [the Avoca Plant]. Furthermore, [Old Kerr-McGee] communicated with environmental agencies and approved and controlled environmental budgets and expenditures in connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>with the wood treatment plant. [Old Kerr-McGee] controlled the wood treatment plant\u2019s facility\u2019s environmental changes and monitoring and also directed the Plaintiffs\u2019 managers as to environmental policies and decisions, including emission controls, regulatory compliance issues, regulatory reporting and toxic waste handling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">J.A. 504-05 (Master Compl. \u00b6 21); <em>see also </em>Appellants\u2019 Br. 9 (explaining that paragraph 21 refers to the conduct of Old Kerr-McGee).'</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">III. The Tronox Bankruptcy and the Adversary- Proceeding</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-7\">In 2009, the Tronox debtors,' Tronox LLC and Tronox Worldwide LLC (f/k/a Kerr-McGee Chemical and Kerr-McGee Operating Corp. (i.e., Old Kerr-McGee), respectively), filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the Southern District of New York. Because the principal defendants in the PA State Action\u2014Kerr-McGee Chemical and Old Kerr-McGee\u2014were debtors in the Tronox bankruptcy, the PA State Action was stayed and remains stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-8\">In the bankruptcy proceeding, each, of the Avoca Plaintiffs, as claimant creditors, filed a proof of claim seeking compensation for the toxic torts at the heart of the PA State Action and reserving any claims against nondebtors. The United States, as a major creditor of the Tronox debtors, subsequently intervened. <em>Tronox Inc. v. Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (In re Tronox Inc.) (\u201cAnadarko\u201d), </em>No. 14-cv-5495, 2014 WL 5825308, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 10, 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-10\">In May 2009, the Tronox debtors initiated an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court against New Kerr-McGee, asserting fraudulent-transfer claims (the \u201cAdversary Proceeding\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In 2010, with the Adversary Proceeding still pending, the bankruptcy court approved the Tronox bankruptcy plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d). Because the potential recovery from that proceeding was an important estate asset, as part of the Plan, the Tronox debtors transferred their interest in the Adversary Proceeding to a specially formed \u201cAnadarko Litigation Trust\u201d (also referred to as the \u201cLitigation Trust\u201d). <em>See </em>J.A. 49 (Plan), 448-80 (Litigation Trust Agreement). The Plan made the Avoca Plaintiffs (among other claimants) beneficiaries of a \u201cTort Claims Trust,\u201d which would receive a specified share (12%) of any recovery from the Adversary Proceeding. <em>See </em>J.A. 48 (Plan), 272 (Tort Claims Trust Agreement). In return, the Avoca Plaintiffs (and the other claimants) agreed to release their creditor claims against the Tronox debtors and to be enjoined from pursuing certain claims against the Tronox debtors and other released parties, including New Kerr-McGee. <em>See </em>J.A. 48 (Plan), 68-69 (release and injunction), 89 \u00b6 1.9 (definition of the \u201cAna-darko Released Parties\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-11\">The Adversary Proceeding continued for years. The Anadarko Litigation Trust and the United States jointly pursued the Adversary Proceeding against New Kerr-McGee and its parent, Anadarko. The Avo-ca Plaintiffs were not silent partners in this endeavor. The Plan provided that \u201crepresentatives of the holders of Tort Claims will have certain agreed rights concerning the pursuit\u201d of the Adversary Pro-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>eeeding. J.A. 49. And participate the Avoca Plaintiffs did: among other things, two of their lawyers sat on the Tort Claims Trust\u2019s Advisory Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-4\">In December 2013, after trial over a four-month period, Bankruptcy Judge Gropper issued an opinion holding, <em>inter alia, </em>that New Kerr-McGee had \u201cacted with intent to \u2018hinder and delay1 [the Tro-nox debtors\u2019] creditors when they transferred out and then spun off the oil and gas assets, and that the [spinoff] transaction, which left the Debtors insolvent and undercapitalized, was not made for reasonably equivalent value.\u201d <em>In re Tronox, </em>503 B.R. at 249. However, Judge Gropper reserved decision and final judgment on damages, which he indicated would be between $5,15 billion and $14.16 billion. <em>See id. </em>at 336-37, 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">In April 2014, before a final judgment was entered, the parties settled the Adversary Proceeding for $5.15 billion (the \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See </em>J.A. 81-139. The Tort Claims Trust\u2019s share was more than $600 million.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Because no judgment had ever issued, Judge Gropper\u2019s liability findings never became final and binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">IV. The Injunction</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-7\">In exchange for New Kerr-McGee\u2019s payment of $5.15 billion, the parties agreed to a permanent injunction to insulate New Kerr-McGee from claims related to those the Adversary Proceeding\u2019s settlement extinguished. The District Court agreed and entered the following Injunction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1037-10\">(i) [A]ny Debtor(s), (ii) any creditor of any Debtor who filed or could have filed a claim in the Chapter 11 Cases, (iii) any other Person whose claim (A) in any way arises from or is related to the Adversary Proceeding, (B) is a Trust Derivative Claim, or (C) is duplicative of a Trust Derivative Claim, and (iv) any Person acting or purporting to act as an attorney for any of the preceding <em>is hereby permanently enjoined from asserting against any Anadarko Released Party </em>(I) any Trust Derivative Claims or (II) any claims that are duplicative of Trust Derivative Claims, whether or not held or controlled by the Litigation Trust, or whether or not the Litigation Trust could have asserted such claims against any Anadarko Released Party, The injunction herein shall not apply to or bar [eight classes of claims, including] ... any liability that an Anadarko Released Party might have that does not arise from or through a liability of a Debtor....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1037-11\"><em>Anadarko, </em>2014 WL 5825308, at *10 (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>J.A. 223-24.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-12\">The Avoca Plaintiffs did not comment on or object to the proposed order. No one appealed the Injunction; it became final in early 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-13\">V. Post-Injunction Litigation</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-14\">In September 2015, the Avoca Plaintiffs filed a motion in Pennsylvania state court to restore their toxic-tort case to the calendar (the \u201cAvoca Motion\u201d or the \u201cMotion\u201d). J.A. 231-56. Despite detailing the history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>of the PA State Action, the Tronox bankruptcy, and the Adversary Proceeding, the Avoca Motion says nothing as to the effect, if any, of those proceedings and the resulting Settlement Agreement and Injunction on their state-court claims. In fact, the Avoca Motion curiously neither mentions the Injunction nor seeks to amend the Master Complaint. It simply asks the Pennsylvania court to reactivate the state proceedings in light of the termination of the bankruptcy stay following the Adversary Proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-5\">The Avoca Plaintiffs\u2019 assertions against New Kerr-McGee\u2014derived primarily from Judge Gropper\u2019s prejudgment findings<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>\u2014 mimic the legal theories employed by the Litigation Trust in the Adversary Proceeding. The Motion argues that the Avoca Plaintiffs seek to hold New Kerr-McGee liable \u201cunder numerous theories including, but not limited to, alter ego/piercing of the corporate veil and successor liability.\u201d J.A. 243 \u00b659. There are no claims or allegations that New Kerr-McGee itself engaged in wrongful conduct that directly harmed the Avoca Plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-6\">New Kerr-McGee subsequently moved in the District Court to enforce the Injunction. The District Court granted New Kerr-McGee\u2019s motion, ordering the Avoca Plaintiffs to dismiss with prejudice their state-court action. <em>In re Tronox Inc., </em>549 B.R. 21 (S.D.N.Y. 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-7\">It is clear from the District Court\u2019s detailed decision that its job was not made any easier by the efforts of the Avoca Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel. As the District Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1038-8\">[T]he Avoca Plaintiffs\u2019 position as to which slices of their claims remain has been a moving target, as they have revised their theories at each opportunity. Although oral argument helped clarify their most recent position, the Avoca Plaintiffs did not clearly articulate which, if any, of the potential bases for holding [New Kerr-McGee] liable they agree are no longer tenable as a result of the release obtained as part of Tro-nox\u2019s bankruptcy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1038-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-12\">Ultimately, the court made two rulings: (1) the Avoca Plaintiffs\u2019 claims were extinguished by the Settlement Agreement; and (2) even if they were not, the claims are barred by the Injunction. The District Court and New Kerr-McGee characterize the rulings as alternative holdings, in that they equally resolve that <em>all </em>claims are somehow barred. <em>See id. </em>at 50 (\u201cEven if the Avoca Plaintiffs\u2019 claims were not otherwise unavailable as a matter of law, the Injunction separately bars any claim against the movant herein that they seek to assert.\u201d); Appellees\u2019 Br. 47-48 (urging us to affirm based on the District Court\u2019s \u201calternative holding\u201d that the claims were extinguished by the Avoca Plaintiffs\u2019 assent to and recovery from the settlement). In our view, however, our job on appeal is to first determine the reach of the Injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-15\">Relying on the Injunction\u2019s plain language and fundamental principles of bankruptcy law, the District Court interpreted the Injunction\u2014particularly the term \u201cTrust Derivative Claims\u201d\u2014to cover \u201caction[s] ... intended to increase the basket of assets for creditors regarding[ <em>inter alia, </em>the Avoca Plant], or based on prior ownership of a debtor....\u201d <em>In re Tronox </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number><em>Inc., </em>549 B.R. at 51. In other words, the District Court read the Injunction to bar \u201cclaims that were or could have been part of an adversary proceeding by [the Tronox debtors] against [New] Kerr-McGee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Judge Forrest then concluded that the claims the Avoca Plaintiffs currently allege in state court fall squarely within that definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-4\">Specifically, she reasoned that (a) the Avoca Plaintiffs could not assert any direct-liability claims against New Kerr-McGee for conduct during the Avoca Plant\u2019s operations from 1956 to 1996, since New Kerr-McGee did not exist until 2001, and (b) the Avoca Plaintiffs had not asserted any direct-liability claims against New Kerr-McGee for conduct after 2001. Thus, the only claims the Avoca Plaintiffs raised were indirect-liability claims based on alter-ego/veil-piercing theories\u2014attempts to impute to New Kerr-McGee the conduct of Old Kerr-McGee and Kerr-McGee Chemical. Read that way, the District Court found that the Avoca Plaintiffs\u2019 claims were \u201cgeneralized to all creditors because they could be equally asserted (if they were not barred by the release) by any creditor of the Tronox debtorfs] ... whose claim has been left partially unsatisfied by recovery efforts from the Tronox debtors themselves.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 53. For that reason, the claims were derivative and therefore property of the Tronox estate. <em>Id. </em>at 54. Concluding that the term \u201cTrust Derivative Claims,\u201d as defined in the Injunction, was coextensive with the meaning of derivative claims in the bankruptcy context, the District Court held that the Avoca Plaintiffs\u2019 claims were barred by the Injunction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1039-5\">The District Court finally concluded that it was within its discretion and power to enforce the Injunction, and enforcement served the interest of \u201cpreventing litigation the pursuit of which is violative of an injunction previously issued by this Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 55. In rejecting the Avoca Plaintiffs\u2019 request for the opportunity to replead in state court, the District Court noted that the Avoca Plaintiffs \u201chad ample opportunity to work out their theories and present their strongest possible claims,\u201d yet \u201chave provided no fact that would save their claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 55-56. The District Court also noted concern that the Avoca Plaintiffs\u2019 request to allow them to seek leave to amend in state court was \u201cin all events gamesmanship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56. That view was \u201cbolstered by the recent refusal of the Avoca Plaintiffs to dismiss their claims against the Tronox debtors\u2014parties as to whom they have no credible arguments that any claim survives.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1039-7\">Thus, the District Court ordered the Avoca Plaintiffs to dismiss with prejudice the PA State Action within seven days and to make no attempt to file any action alleging similar claims against New Kerr-McGee or any Tronox debtor in any other forum. <em>Id. </em>Although New Kerr-McGee had initially sought an order to show cause why the Avoca Plaintiffs and their counsel should not be held in contempt for violating the Injunction, the District Court deemed that request abandoned because, in part, New Kerr-McGee did not renew it in its reply brief or at oral argument. <em>Id. </em>at 38 n.ll.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-8\">VI. Proceedings in this Court</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-9\">Three days prior to the District Court\u2019s deadline for dismissal of the PA State Action, the Avoca Plaintiffs moved for an emergency stay in this Court. In its opposing papers, New Kerr-McGee did not move to dismiss, but argued that the Avoca Plaintiffs were unlikely to prevail on the merits of the appeal because we lack appellate jurisdiction. A judge of this Court granted a temporary stay pending conclusive disposition of the emergency motion by a motions panel, and directed the Avoca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Plaintiffs to file a reply to New Kerr-McGee\u2019s jurisdictional argument. After the Avoca Plaintiffs filed a reply, a full motions panel granted the stay pending appeal, referring \u201cthe question of whether this Court has proper jurisdiction over this matter ... to the merits panel.\u201d 2d Cir. Dkt. 64 (order granting stay pending appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-6\">Although New Kerr-McGee has yet to move to dismiss, it continues to argue that there is no jurisdictional hook for this appeal. Federal courts at all levels always begin their work with a simple question: Has Congress given us authority to hear and decide this matter? Statutory jurisdiction goes to the heart of a federal court\u2019s power, and federal courts have an \u201cindependent obligation to consider the presence or absence of subject matter jurisdiction <em>sua sponte.\u201d Joseph v. Leavitt, </em>465 F.3d 87, 89 (2d Cir. 2006) (citing <em>Travelers Ins. Co. v. Carpenter, </em>411 F.3d 323, 328 (2d Cir. 2005)). We therefore must conduct a jurisdictional inquiry notwithstanding New Kerr-McGee\u2019s curious reluctance to move to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds while continuing to point out the flimsiness of the Avoca Plaintiffs\u2019 jurisdictional predicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-7\">There are a couple relevant avenues to appellate jurisdiction here: 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (conferring appellate jurisdiction over \u201cfinal decisions\u201d of district courts) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (conferring appellate jurisdiction over, <em>inter alia, </em>orders \u201cgranting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions\u201d). New Kerr-McGee argues that neither section confers appellate jurisdiction over post-judgment orders that do nothing more than interpret and enforce a final injunction. It would be different, New Kerr-McGee urges, if the District Court had found contempt, imposed sanctions, or created new duties under the Injunction. Instead, New Kerr-McGee asserts, the District Court merely \u201creiterated the plain meaning of the Injunction and gave the Avoca Plaintiffs a grace period to comply.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Br. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-11\">The Avoca Plaintiffs counter that we have \u00a7 1291 jurisdiction because the District Court\u2019s order \u201cfinally determines the rights of the Avoca Plaintiffs,\u201d and \u201c[tjhere was nothing left to be determined.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Reply Br. 3-4.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Even if the order fails on finality, the Avoca Plaintiffs contend we still have jurisdiction under \u00a7 1292 because the District Court\u2019s order modified the Injunction by expanding the definition of \u201cTrust Derivative Claims\u201d in the Injunction to mean \u201call derivative claims.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Appellants\u2019 Reply Br. 7-8 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>New Kerr-MeGee has it right.

The District Court\u2019s Order Is Not \u201cFinal\u201d for Purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-5\">\u201cIt is a well-established rule of appellate jurisdiction that \u2018a final order is one that conclusively determines the rights of the parties to the litigation, leaving nothing for the district court to do but execute the order.\u2019 \u201d <em>Forschner Grp., Inc. v. Arrow Trading Co., </em>124 F.3d 402, 410 (2d Cir. 1997) (quoting <em>In re Fugazy Express, Inc., </em>982 F.2d 769, 775 (2d Cir. 1992)). Generally, orders finding a party in contempt but not imposing sanctions are not immediately appealable. <em>See id. </em>(\u201c[A]n order adjudging a party in contempt unaccompanied by sanctions is not final and therefore is not appealable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-6\">Our decision in <em>Wilder v. Bernstein, </em>49 F.3d 69 (2d Cir. 1995), and the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Thomas v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield </em>Ass\u2019n, 594 F.3d 814 (11th Cir. 2010), are instructive. In both, the district court interpreted the meaning of and directed compliance with its final order (a consent decree in <em>Wilder </em>and an anti-suit injunction in <em>Thomas), </em>but did not find contempt or impose sanctions. Specifically, in <em>Wilder, </em>the plaintiffs sued New York City asserting racial discrimination in foster-care policies. The parties entered into a consent decree in which the City agreed to certain changes in its practices. 49 F.3d at 70-71. The plaintiffs later sought contempt sanctions against the City based on its alleged failure to comply. The district court did not find the City in contempt or impose sanctions, but directed it to take \u201call appropriate steps\u201d to implement the consent decree. <em>Id. </em>at 71-72 (quoting <em>Wilder v. Bernstein, </em>153 F.R.D. 524, 535 (S.D.N.Y. 1994)). We dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, ruling that because \u201cthere ha[d] not been a finding of contempt, much less an assessment of sanctions, the order [was] not \u2018final.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72 (citing <em>Dove v. Atl. Capital Corp., </em>963 F,2d 15, 17-18 (2d Cir. 1992)). The Eleventh Circuit did the same in <em>Thomas, </em>raising the issue of jurisdiction <em>sua sponte </em>and concluding that the district court\u2019s order directing the plaintiff to withdraw his breach-of-contract complaint within twenty days was not final under \u00a7 1291, did not fall within the collateral order doctrine,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and did not grant or modify an injunction under \u00a7 1292(a)(1). <em>See Thomas, </em>594 F.3d at 818-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-10\">Here, as in <em>Wilder, </em>the District Court\u2019s order was issued in the context of a pending contempt motion but made no contempt finding, \u201cmuch less an assessment of sanctions.\u201d <em>See Wilder, </em>49 F.3d at 72. Therefore, it is not \u201cfinal\u201d as contemplated by \u00a7 1291. The District Court proceedings concerning compliance with the Injunction will not reach final adjudication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>until such time as the contempt issue is fully resolved. For present purposes, that will occur if the Avoca Plaintiffs refuse to comply and are sanctioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-5\">The only potential, yet ultimately inconsequential, distinction that the Avoca Plaintiffs raise between this case and <em>Wilder </em>and <em>Thomas </em>is that New Kerr-McGee somehow \u201cabandoned\u201d its request for a contempt finding or sanctions. Appellants\u2019 Stay Reply Br. 4 (citing <em>In re Tronox Inc., </em>549 B.R. at 38 n.11). In <em>Thomas, </em>they claim, the order was not final because \u201cit [did] not dispose of all of the issues raised in the motion.... The order <em>expressly contemplated further action </em>in the event that [the plaintiff] failed to withdraw his claim within 20 days. It stated ... \u2018the contempt motion shall be revisited by this Court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Thomas, </em>594 F.3d at 819). By contrast, here, the Avoca Plaintiffs argue, \u201cthe present Order expressly contemplates that it has finally adjudicated the Avoca Plaintiffs\u2019 rights, and that the motion is now finally \u2018closed.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). Thus, they claim that \u201c[a]ny notion of contempt proceedings, as stated, was then off the table, \u2018abandoned.\u2019\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1042-6\">The Avoca Plaintiffs miss the point. The District Court\u2019s order did two things, and two things only: (1) it interpreted the Injunction and Settlement Agreement to bar the Avoca Plaintiffs\u2019 state-court claims, and (2) it directed them to dismiss the state action\u2014i.e., it enforced the Injunction and Settlement Agreement by directing compliance therewith. There is nothing more final about the order here than the orders in <em>Wilder </em>and <em>Thomas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1042-9\">This result also makes good sense in light of \u201cthe historic federal policy against piecemeal appeals.\u201d <em>See Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Mackey, </em>351 U.S. 427, 438, 76 S.Ct. 895, 100 L.Ed. 1297 (1956). If \u00a7 1291 required us to entertain appeals every time a district court interpreted or issued an order enforcing a final injunction without more, we would risk being \u201cbesieged by successive appeals in injunctive proceedings.\u201d <em>Ass\u2019n of Cmty. Orgs. for Reform Now (ACORN) v. Ill. State Bd. of Elections, </em>75 F.3d 304, 306 (7th Cir. 1996). Even more, \u00a7 1292(a)(1)\u2014which provides for immediate appeal of certain injunction-related orders, but not interpretive or enforcement orders\u2014would be rendered, at least partially, superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-10\">II. The District Court\u2019s Order Is Not Appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(A)(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-11\">Section 1292(a)(1) allows interlocutory appeals from orders \u201cgranting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). The parties agree that the only relevant consideration here is whether the District Court\u2019s order somehow modified the Injunction.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Though the order did not pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>port to modify the Injunction, we do not simply take the District Court\u2019s word for it. Rather, we look to whether the order was, in fact, merely interpretive, and did \u201cnot change the meaning of\u2014that is, modify\u2014the ... injunction.\u201d <em>ACORN, </em>75 F.3d at 306. To determine if the Injunction has been modified, we have to understand if the District Court extended the Injunction beyond its original reach. That is, if Judge Forrest properly construed the Injunction to bar the Avoca Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, she did not modify it; but if she erred in her construction, she did modify it. <em>See Wilder, </em>49 F.3d at 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-4\">In distinguishing interpretation from modification, <em>Wilder </em>tells us to apply <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. O\u2019Rourke, </em>943 F.2d 180, 186 (2d Cir. 1991)); <em>see also EEOC v. Local 40, Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Bridge, Structural &amp; Ornamental Iron Workers, </em>76 F.3d 76, 79 n.2 (2d Cir. 1996) (citing <em>Wilder </em>while noting that \u201cwe must at least look through the door\u201d to the merits \u201cto see if we should open it\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). It is unclear, however, how searching that review should be. A plurality of our sister circuits have acknowledged that while \u201cthe scope of the injunction is to be determined by the independent judgment of [Courts of Appeals],\u201d the reviewing court must \u201capproach the question with the purpose of fulfilling the statutory goal of not \u2018letting piecemeal appeals, cloaked in the guise of jurisdictional inquiries, come in through the back door.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Philip Morris USA Inc., </em>686 F.3d 839, 844 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (quoting <em>Birmingham Fire Fighters Ass\u2019n 117 v. Jefferson Cty., </em>280 F.3d 1289, 1293 (11th Cir. 2002)), Those courts\u2014including the Seventh, Tenth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuits\u2014look to whether the district court\u2019s order constitutes an obvious misinterpretation of the injunction.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Counseling against too searching of a merits inquiry at the jurisdictional stage, those circuits have voiced similar concerns that \u201c[t]o plunge into the details would collapse the jurisdictional inquiry into a decision on the merits, thwarting the purpose of \u00a7 1292(a)(1).\u201d <em>Birmingham Fire Fighters, </em>280 F.3d at 1293.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-8\">Although we have never expressly adopted the limited approach, we have endorsed it by summary order. <em>Scipar, Inc. v. Simses, </em>354 Fed.Appx. 560, 562-63 (2d Cir. 2009) (citing <em>Wilder </em>and the decisions of the Seventh, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits). Such an approach makes sense, and is consistent with our case law, when evaluating the district court\u2019s interpretation of its own order\u2014that is, reviewing a district court\u2019s determination of what it meant when it employed language that is later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>subject to question. <em>See In re Bernard L. Madoff Inv. Sec.

Key Bank Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n (In re Casse), </em>198 F.3d 327, 333 (2d Cir. 1999)); <em>Truskoski v. ESPN, Inc., </em>60 F.3d 74, 77 (2d Cir. 1996) (per curiam) (reviewing with great deference a court\u2019s interpretation of its own order). But when, as here, the language the district court is interpreting is tied to a term defined by law (e.g., \u201cderivative claims\u201d as used in the bankruptcy context), the court\u2019s conclusion is a legal one and is reviewed <em>de novo. See In re DeTrano, </em>326 F.3d 319, 321 (2d Cir. 2003) (noting that in a typical bankruptcy appeal under'-\u00a7 158(d), \u201c[t]he bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error, and its conclusions of law are reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">To be clear, to the extent the District Court interpreted \u201cTrust Derivative Claims\u201d to mean all derivative claims within a bankruptcy court\u2019s jurisdiction, its interpretation is entitled to deference and will not constitute a modification unless it is an obvious or blatant misinterpretation. <em>See, e.g., Birmingham Fire Fighters, </em>280 F.3d at 1293. However, we review <em>de novo </em>the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the Avoca Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are in fact derivative claims within a bankruptcy court\u2019s jurisdiction.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The merits of New Kerr-McGee\u2019s enforcement claims are therefore unavoidably linked to the jurisdictional question. The result turns on whether the Avoca Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are in fact \u201cderiva-five\u201d as that term is used in the bankruptcy context\u2014i.e., whether the claims are property of the estate\u2014and whether the District Court obviously or blatantly misinterpreted the Injunction\u2019s definition of \u201cTrust Derivative Claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-8\">A.

In distinguishing derivative claims from particularized claims exclusive to individual creditors, labels are not conclusive, since plaintiffs often try, but are not permitted, to plead around a bankruptcy. <em>See id. </em>at 91-92. In other words, we are wary of putting form over substance. <em>See id. </em>at 89, 91-92.

If the claim \u201cis a general one, with no particularized injury arising from it, and if that claim could be brought by any creditor of the debtor, the trustee is the proper person to assert the claim, and the creditors are bound by the outcome of the trustee\u2019s action.\u201d <em>St. Paul, </em>884 F.2d at 701.

The bankruptcy of the Johns-Manville Corporation (\u201cMan-ville\u201d) produced a number of cases in this Court. In one of those cases, a distributor of Manville\u2019s products, alleging that it was a coinsured under Manville\u2019s insurance policies, challenged the bankruptcy court\u2019s authority to enter an injunction barring what the distributor argued were independent contract-based claims against the insurer. <em>MacArthur Co. v.

As with the claims in <em>Manville III, </em>we determined that the trustee\u2019s claims\u2014because they alleged that the third-party financial institutions \u25a0independently cause particularized harm to individual creditors\u2014were owned by the customers, and were therefore not derivative. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1046-10\"><em>Madoff. </em>Most recently, in <em>Madoff, </em>we considered whether claims by a creditor against a non-debtor were derivative of claims asserted and settled by the BLMIS trustee and therefore barred by the injunction that served as the model for the Injunction here. The trustee in <em>Madoff </em>asserted in an adversary proceeding claims for fraudulent transfer, avoidable preferences, and turnover against alleged Madoff co-conspirator Jeffrey Picower and other defendants, based on their alleged improper withdrawals of more than $6.7 billion from BLMIS. <em>Madoff, </em>740 F.3d at 85.

The case involved a pre-petition sale of assets by Emoral, a company that manufactured diacetyl, a chemical used in food flavoring that was the subject of many toxic-tort suits. <em>See id </em>After Em-oral filed for bankruptcy, the trustee brought an adversary proceeding against Aaroma, the buyer of Emoral\u2019s assets, alleging that the prepetition sale constituted a fraudulent transfer. <em>See id. </em>The parties reached a settlement and, like here, the trustee agreed to release Aaroma from any claims that were property of the Emo-ral estate. <em>See id. </em>At the hearing on the propriety of the settlement, however, the Diacetyl plaintiffs (with the agreement of a representative of the trustee) challenged the release, arguing that any successor-liability claims against Aaroma did not belong to the Emoral estate, and that the trustee was therefore without authority to release them. <em>See id. </em>The plaintiffs thereafter sued Aaroma arguing for successor liability, relying on the trustee\u2019s arguments that the claims were outside the estate. <em>See id. </em>The bankruptcy court agreed, the district court reversed and remanded to the bankruptcy court, and the Third Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s order. <em>See id. </em>at 878.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-9\">The Third Circuit majority framed the issue (in terms that could be used nearly verbatim here) as one that \u201crequire[d] [it] to determine whether personal injury causes of action arising from the alleged wrongful conduct of a debtor corporation, asserted against a third-party non-debtor corporation on a \u2018mere continuation\u2019 theory of successor liability under state law, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>properly characterized as \u2018generalized claims\u2019 constituting property of the bankruptcy estate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 876.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">The court answered that question in the affirmative. <em>Id. </em>at 882. The majority relied on our explication in <em>Si Paul </em>that, in analyzing \u201ccommon claims against the debtor\u2019s alter ego or others who have misused the debtor\u2019s property in some fashion,\u201d if a claim is \u201ca general one, with no particularized injury arising from it, and if that claim could be brought by any creditor of the debtor, the trustee is the proper person to assert the claim, and the creditors are bound by the outcome of the trustee\u2019s action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 879 (quoting <em>St. Paul, </em>884 F.2d at 701). In the majority\u2019s eyes, the plaintiffs \u201cfail[ed] to demonstrate how any of the factual allegations that would establish their cause of action based on successor liability are unique to them as compared to other creditors of Emoral,\u201d or \u201chow recovery on their successor liability cause of action would not benefit all creditors of Emoral given that Aaroma, as a mere continuation of Emoral, would succeed to all of Emoral\u2019s liabilities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 880. Thus, the majority held that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim was \u201cgeneral\u201d rather than \u201cindividualized,\u201d and therefore part of the bankruptcy estate. <em>Id. </em>The court emphasized that the \u201c[plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action against Aaroma would be based on facts generally available to any creditor, and recovery would serve to increase the pool of assets available to all creditors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 881.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-8\">In dissent, Judge Cowen focused on the nature of the initial toxic-tort injury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtXO\">Because the Diacetyl Plaintiffs\u2019 [claims] against Aaroma \u201ccould [not] be brought by any creditor of the debtor,\u201d they constitute individualized claims belonging to the Diacetyl Plaintiffs themselves\u2014and not to the debtor or the bankruptcy estate. Initially, it is uncontested that the underlying personal injury claims against Emoral are individualized in nature. In fact, personal injury and product liability causes of action under state law represent quintessential examples of an individualized claim, i.e., \u201ca \u2018personal\u2019 [claim that is] a legal or equitable interest only of the creditor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1048-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 883 (second and third alteration in original) (quoting <em>Bd. of Trs. of Teamsters Local 863 Pension Fund v. Foodtown, Inc., </em>296 F.3d 164, 170 (3d Cir. 2002)). In Judge Cowen\u2019s view, the majority\u2019s approach missed the point\u2014the critical question for him was whether the plaintiffs were suing for themselves or for the benefit of all, the former being individual property and the latter being estate property. <em>Id. </em>at 885-86 &amp; n.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-11\">As did the <em>Emoral </em>majority opinion, we disagree with the dissenting opinion\u2019s focus on the nature of the toxic-tort injury. That the plaintiffs in <em>Emoral </em>had an underlying harm specific to them did not put the claims automatically outside the estate. Indeed, every creditor in bankruptcy has an individual claim (set forth in a proof of claim) against the debtor, whether it be in tort (as here), contract, or otherwise. But often there are claims against third parties that wrongfully deplete the debtor\u2019s assets. Individual creditors may wish to bring claims against those third parties to seek compensation for harms done to them by the debtor and secondary harms done to them by the third parties in wrongfully diverting assets of the debtor that would be used to pay the claims of the individual creditor. The fact that an individual creditor may seek to do so does not make those secondary claims particular to the creditor, for it overlooks the obvious: Every creditor has a - similar claim for the diversion of assets of the debtor\u2019s estate. Those claims are general\u2014they are not tied to the harm done to the creditor by the debtor, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>rather are based on an injury to the debt- or\u2019s estate that creates a secondary harm to all creditors regardless of the nature of their underlying claim against the debtor.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-4\">The plaintiffs in <em>Emoral </em>would have courts allow an individual creditor to sue third-party successors of debtors for claims that are truly aimed at recovering estate assets. The exact same claim advanced by the trustee on behalf of the estate would be a win for all creditors of the estate, but a win by a single creditor would be a win by one to the detriment of the others. That \u201cis precisely the sort of result the Bankruptcy Code exists to forestall, by placing exclusive standing over estate claims in the bankruptcy trustee or plan administrator.\u201d <em>In re Coudert Bros. LLP, </em>No. 11-2785, 2012 WL 1267827, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 12, 2012). The Avoca Plaintiffs ask the same of us, and we will not allow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">ii. <em>The Avoca Plaintiffs\u2019 Claims Are Derivative</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">As an initial matter, it is undisputed that under either Pennsylvania or Delaware law the Adversary Proceeding could have included indirect-liability claims\u2014 based on imputation theories such as alter ego or veil piercing\u2014to the extent the claims qualify as \u201cgeneral.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>Accord In re Alper Holdings USA, Inc., </em>398 B.R. 736, 759 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (\u201c[U]nder Delaware law, a trustee possesses standing to bring\u2014and by logical extension, settle and release\u2014an alter ego claim on behalf of a creditor of the debtor, as long as the claim qualifies as a \u2018general\u2019 claim.\u201d); <em>In re Jamuna Real Estate, LLC, </em>365 B.R. 540, 562-63 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 2007) (allowing trustees to assert alter-ego and veil-piercing claims under Pennsylvania law); <em>Rosener v. Majestic Mgmt., Inc. (In re OODC, LLC), </em>321 B.R. 128, 136-37 (Bankr. D. Del. 2005) (holding similarly vis-\u00e1-vis successor liability and alter-ego claims under Delaware law). Thus, the question is whether the causes of action here qualify as \u201cgeneral\u201d claims. They do.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-9\">We start with what the Avoca Plaintiffs concede:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-10\">(1) They pursue claims against only New Kerr-McGee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-11\">(2) Any claims against the Tronox debtors were discharged by the bankruptcy plan;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-12\">(3) Tronox LLC succeeded the operator of the Avoca Plant and Tronox Worldwide LLC succeeded the parent of Tronox LLC;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-13\">(4) New Kerr-McGee (and its predecessor, Kerr-McGee Holdco, Inc., formed earlier in the same year) did not exist until 2001; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-14\">(5) Any claims against New Kerr-McGee for harm done to the Tronox estate are barred as Trust Derivative Claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1049-15\">With that as a baseline, we turn to what the claims <em>are </em>not. The Avoca Plaintiffs do not, and indeed could not, assert direct-liability claims that New Kerr-McGee breached an independent duty to them arising out of the operation of the Avoca Plant, since New Kerr-McGee did not exist until years after plant operations ceased. Of course, as the District Court acknowledged and New Kerr-McGee conceded, the Avoca Plaintiffs could have raised direct claims that, for instance, New Kerr-McGee instructed its subsidiaries not to clean up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>the toxic site or were negligent in their supervision of the cleanup. The harm in that instance would have been suffered directly and solely by the Avoca Plaintiffs by acts of New Kerr-McGee. As we held in <em>Manville III </em>and <em>JPMorgan, </em>those claims would be independent and particularized, belonging only to the Avoca Plaintiffs as individual creditors. The Avoca Plaintiffs, however, have never alleged, and until recently had conceded that they could not allege, facts to support a theory of direct liability against New Kerr-McGee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">At oral argument before this Court, counsel for the Avoca Plaintiffs stated \u201cthere is clearly the opportunity to have a direct claim here.\u201d For the first time, counsel mentioned a December 2002 letter from New Kerr-McGee to the Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) alerting the EPA to its ownership of the Avoca Plant and efforts to remediate. This post-2001 conduct, Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel now asserts, could have formed the basis for still unidentified and unspecified claims in a theoretical amended complaint. This painfully late assertion, unsupported by the record,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> bespeaks gamesmanship, but is best left to later review of the aspect of the District Court order that required dismissal <em>with prejudice. See infra, </em>at 111-13. For now, it suffices to note that the District Court did not conclude that any such claims, to the extent they exist and had been pleaded, would be barred by the Injunction, and we agree that they would not without expressing any view as to the merits of such claim. At bottom, New Kerr-McGee could not have engaged in torts prior to its existence, and the Avoca Plaintiffs have not put forth facts supporting a claim that New Kerr-McGee breached a duty to them after it came into existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-7\">Thus, the only claims the Avoca Plaintiffs assert are through alter-ego/veil-piercing theories that seek to impute the acts of the polluters to New Kerr-McGee. Indeed, the Avoca Plaintiffs tellingly summarize their state-court complaints to allege that \u201cNew [Kerr-McGee] is responsible for the acts of its subsidiary, which operated the plant,\u201d and \u201cfurther allege <em>direct </em>liability of [Old Kerr-McGee], which at the time was the parent company, for actions it took on its own.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. 9. Put another way, having conceded that they no longer intend to bring claims against the released Tronox debtors, the Plaintiffs admit that their sole claims against New Kerr-McGee are premised indirectly on the liability of those debtors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-8\">This is where it gets tricky. As we see it, there are two species of claims against New Kerr-McGee. The first, \u201cFraudulent-Transfer Actions,\u201d are indirect-liability claims alleging that New Kerr-McGee mismanaged and undercapitalized Old Kerr-McGee and Kerr-McGee Chemical' (ultimately, the Tronox debtors) such that they were left with insufficient assets to pay creditors after entering bankruptcy. <em>See </em>J.A. 242-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-9\">The second, \u201cPersonal Injury Actions,\u201d comprises indirect-liability claims that seek to hold New Kerr-McGee liable for the tortious acts of its former indirect subsidiaries in operating the Avoca Plant. <em>See </em>Appellants\u2019 Br. 31-32 (\u201cThe claims [against New Kerr-McGee] are related to actions that Old [Kerr-McGee] took at the Avoca plant that relate directly and specifically to the Avoca Plaintiffs and only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Avoca Plaintiffs\u201d)- This is the heart of the Avoca Plaintiffs\u2019 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-4\">The Fraudulent-Transfer Actions are easy: they are the paradigmatic example of claims general to all creditors and are therefore barred by the Injunction for the reasons stated by the District Court. <em>See In re Tronox Inc., </em>549 B.R. at 53 (\u201c[Cjlaims based on allegations such as these\u2014a general failure to adhere to corporate formalities and abuse of the corporate form\u2014are equally capable of increasing the basket of assets that could be used to satisfy any and all liabilities owed by the Tronox debtors.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">The Personal Injury Actions are tougher. The Avoca Plaintiffs attempt to particularize the Personal Injury Actions against New Kerr-McGee by personalizing the harm. But the Avoca Plaintiffs cannot and do not trace their harm to New Kerr-McGee. If they did, their claims would be particularized. Instead, the alleged liability of New Kerr-McGee arises not from its own conduct, but from its alleged existence as the alter ego and successor to the liabilities of the former parent of the actual alleged tortfeasor, Kerr-McGee Chemical.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The harm they allege to have suffered at the hands of the latter is specific to them, but the harm they allege to have suffered at the hands of New Kerr-McGee</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-7\">is the same harm general to all Tronox creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-8\">The whole point of channeling claims through bankruptcy is to avoid creditors getting ahead of others in line of preference and to promote an equitable distribution of debtor assets. <em>See Koch Ref. v. Farmers Union Cent. Exch., Inc., </em>831 F.2d 1339, 1343 (7th Cir. 1987) (\u201c[Historically one of the prime purposes of the bankruptcy law has been to bring about a ratable distribution among creditors of a bankrupt\u2019s assets; to protect the creditors from one another.\u201d (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Young v. Higbee Co., </em>324 U.S. 204, 210, 65 S.Ct. 594, 89 L.Ed. 890 (1945))). That is why, after a company files for bankruptcy, creditors lack standing to assert claims that are estate property. Instead, the trustee is conferred the right to recover for derivative, generalized claims; only the estate is charged with ensuring equitable distribution of estate assets and preventing individual creditors from pursuing their own interests and thus diminishing the res available to the rest of the creditors. Even more, it encourages, as it did here, orderly settlements\u2014an interest not taken lightly. <em>See In re PaineWebber Ltd. P\u2019ship Litig., </em>147 F.3d 132, 138 (2d Cir. 1998) (recognizing a \u201cstrong judicial policy in favor of settlements\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>The critical distinction between the underlying tort claim against the Tronox debtors and the alter-ego claim against New Kerr-McGee is that establishing the former would benefit only the Avoca Plaintiffs as individual creditors, whereas establishing the latter\u2014that New Kerr-McGee is the alter ego of the relevant Tronox debtors and should therefore be charged with all its liabilities\u2014would benefit all creditors of the Tronox debtors generally. <em>See Emoral, </em>740 F.3d at 880. The facts necessary to prove that the Tronox debtors committed the underlying torts may be particular to the Avoca Plaintiffs, but the facts necessary to impute that liability to New Kerr-McGee \u201cwould be ... generally available to any creditor, and recovery would serve to increase the pool of assets available to all creditors.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 881.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">The Avoca Plaintiffs\u2019 tactics prove the point. They seek to use Judge Gropper\u2019s findings against New Kerr-McGee in the adversary proceeding\u2014which involved generalized claims for fraudulent conveyance\u2014in their state action. If those generalized findings would benefit their individual-creditors case, then their claims are no less generalized than the fraudulent-conveyance claims in the Adversary Proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-6\">For those reasons, the District Court correctly classified the Avoca Plaintiffs\u2019 claims as generalized, derivative claims comprising estate property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-7\">B. The Claims Are \u201cTrust Derivative\u201d or \u201cDuplicative\u201d and Thus Barred by the Injunction</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-8\">Concluding that the claims are derivative and therefore properly within the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court solves only part of the puzzle. The parties argue over the specific coverage of the Injunction and whether it means all \u201cderivative claims\u201d or something less. As noted above, we owe deference to the District Court\u2019s interpretation of \u201cTrust Derivative Claims,\u201d considering the merits only to determine whether the District Court\u2019s obviously misinterpreted the Injunction to cover all claims within the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-10\">Applying that standard, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s order interpreted, but did not modify, the Injunction. We construe terms of an injunction according to the general interpretive principles of contract law. <em>Mastrovincenzo v. City of New York, </em>435 F.3d 78, 103 (2d Cir. 2006). Here, we must interpret the terms of the Settlement Agreement, which defines certain pertinent terms used in the Injunction, in accordance with New York law. New York law requires us to interpret the Settlement Agreement \u201cso as to give effect to the intention of the parties as expressed in the unequivocal language they have employed.\u201d <em>Terwilliger v. Terwilliger, </em>206 F.3d 240, 245 (2d Cir. 2000) (citing <em>Breed v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., </em>46 N.Y.2d 351, 355, 413 N.Y.S.2d 352, 385 N.E.2d 1280 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-11\">i. <em>What the Injunction Says</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1052-12\">The Injunction (set forth at Appendix B along with other relevant provisions of documents cross-referenced therein), read in conjunction with the Settlement Agreement, the confirmed bankruptcy plan, and trust documents, provides as follows: The Injunction bars the Tronox Debtors\u2019 creditors from asserting against any \u201cAnadarko Released Party\u201d any \u201cTrust Derivative Claims\u201d or any claims that are duplicative of \u201cTrust Derivative Claims,\u201d \u201cwhether or not held or controlled by the Litigation Trust, or whether or not the Litigation Trust could have asserted such claims against any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Anadarko Released Party.\u201d J.A. 224.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1053-4\">The Injunction mirrors the <em>Madoff </em>injunction, but goes further to define what claims those terms cover. <em>Compare Madoff, </em>740 F.3d at 87 (noting that the injunction bars \u201cany claim ... that is duplicative or derivative of the claims brought by the Trustee, or which could have been brought by the Trustee\u201d (emphasis omitted)), <em>with </em>J.A. 97-98 (spelling out what the terms encompass). To wit, the Settlement Agreement defines \u201cTrust Derivative Claims\u201d as any claims the Anadarko Litigation Trust asserted or could have asserted \u201cseeking relief or recovery <em>arising from harm to any Debtor or any Debtor\u2019s estate, </em>based on any legal'theory.\u201d J.A. 97 \u00b61.82 (emphasis added). It then goes on to list a variety of claims and theories that \u201cTrust Derivative Claims\u201d include\u2014namely, claims relating to New Kerr-McGee\u2019s relationship with Tronox debtors, and \u201cclaims and/or remedies\u201d alleging \u201cagency, joint venture, alter ego, corporate veil piercing,\u201d and \u201csuccessor liability.\u201d J.A. 97-98 \u00b6 1.82.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">The Injunction also clarifies the meaning of \u201cduplicative claims.\u201d It explains that claims can be duplicative <em>\u201cwhether or not </em>held or controlled by the Litigation Trust\u201d and <em>\u201cwhether or not </em>the Litigation Trust could have asserted\u201d them. J.A. 224 (emphases added). These are, in other words, claims that substantially overlap, but are not identical to, \u201cTrust Derivative Claims.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Fox v. Picard (In re </em>Madoff), 848 F.Supp.2d 469, 473-75, 481-82 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (holding that creditors\u2019 claims for conversion and unjust enrichment, among others, were duplicative of trustee\u2019s fraudulent-transfer claims), <em>affd </em>740 F.3d 81 (2d Cir. 2014). Finally, the Injunction specifies the claims it does not cover\u2014namely, claims alleging liability that New Kerr-McGee \u201cmight have that does not arise <em>from or through </em>a liability of a Debtor.\u201d J.A. 224 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-9\">These provisions provide the primary sources of contention. Aside from the now-rejected contention that their claims are not truly \u201cderivative,\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. 29-34, the Avoca Plaintiffs argue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-10\">(1) The District \u25a0 Court erred when it determined that the \u201cAnadarko Litigation Trust Agreement gave the Litigation Trust the power to institute any other actions that could have been brought by Tronox against [New Kerr-McGee],\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. 19-24;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-11\">(2) Their claims do not \u201carise from harm to\u201d the Tronox debtors or their estates, Appellants\u2019 Br. 24-29; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-12\">(3) The court could not prohibit them from filing other claims against New Kerr-McGee, and thus erred in ordering them to dismiss the PA State Action with prejudice, <em>see </em>Appellants\u2019 Br. 34-45.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1053-13\">None has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-14\">ii. <em>The Litigation Trust Had Power to Assert the Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1053-15\">The Avoca Plaintiffs also argue that the District Court' misread the trust documents to mean that the Litigation Trust had authority over- derivative claims like theirs that had not yet been asserted in the Adversary Proceeding. They point to a footnote set forth in the margin<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>the District Court explained that its conclusion that personal injury claims can be derivative was \u201cbuttressed\u201d by certain bankruptcy documents and the proceedings themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">The Avoca Plaintiffs, however, exaggerate the import of that footnote and read some of the trust documents too narrowly, rendering other language superfluous and generally making no sense. More importantly, for the reasons that follow, they are wrong\u2014the Litigation Trust had authority over pleaded and unpleaded claims.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1054-6\">The confirmed bankruptcy plan states that, pursuant to the Litigation Trust Agreement, the Tronox debtors would transfer to the Litigation Trust their \u201crights\u201d to the Adversary Proceeding. J.A. 49. The Litigation Trust Agreement \u201cirrevocably and absolutely\u201d transferred all of the debtors\u2019 \u201crights, title, and interests (whether legal, beneficial, or otherwise) to the Anadarko Litigation, <em>including </em>any and all claims therein.\u201d J.A. 452 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-7\">New Kerr-McGee argues that this language means that the agreement transferred more than pending claims. It asserts that the word \u201cincluding\u201d suggests that the \u201cclaims therein\u201d were only some of the rights and interests transferred to the trust\u2014other rights were derivative claims like the Avoca Plaintiffs\u2019 claims that the debtors had not specifically pleaded, as well as the procedural right to amend the adversary proceeding complaint to include such claims. In the absence of the other contextual documents, New Kerr-McGee\u2019s construction of the \u201cincluding\u201d clause would be a stretch\u2014one of multiple interpretations of equivocal language. Indeed, that language could just as easily be read to mean that the Tronox debtors were transferring all claims then asserted. But taking the documents together and applying a little common sense confirms their view.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-10\">As an initial matter, the very definition of \u201cTrust Derivative Claims\u201d lists a host of causes of actions that were not pleaded in the adversary-proceeding complaint. If the Avoca Plaintiffs were right, then almost none of the claims the Injunction purports to enjoin would actually be enjoined because the trustee had not yet pleaded them in the adversary proceeding. That makes little sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-11\">Moreover,' the bankruptcy court\u2019s confirmation order twice states that the Tronox debtors transferred then rights to the claims pending in the adversary proceeding \u201cand any claim or cause of action of Tronox related thereto.\u201d Suppl. App. 58 \u00b6 126, 55 \u00b6 131. Those pending and not-yet-asserted derivative claims went to the Litigation Trust. Likewise, the Litigation Trust was empowered to \u201cinstitute or continue actions which were or otherwise could have been brought by any Debtor that constitute Trust Property.\u201d J.A. 456. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>If the Avoca Plaintiffs were right that \u201cTrust Property\u201d included only then-asserted claims, the Litigation Trust would not need, and would in fact lack power, to \u201cinstitute\u201d actions that \u201cotherwise <em>could have been brought by any Debtor.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-4\">Finally, contemplating that others might challenge the Litigation Trust\u2019s authority, the Injunction specifically barred duplica-tive claims\u2014enjoining claims \u201cwhether or not held or controlled by the Litigation Trust, or whether or not the Litigation Trust could have asserted such claims.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> J.A. 224. The District Court correctly interpreted the Injunction to cover claims beyond those asserted in the Adversary Proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">iii. <em>The Claims \u201cArise from Harm\u201d to the Debtors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1055-6\">' The Avoca Plaintiffs take issue with the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the definition of \u201cTrust Derivative Claims,\u201d arguing that their.claims fall outside the definition because they \u201cseek redress for harms <em>to the Avoca Plaintiffs,\u201d </em>rather than \u201crelief from harm <em>to Tronox or the Tronox bankruptcy estate.\u201d </em>Appellants\u2019 Br. 17 (emphases added). Their reading is too cute, and fails for the same reason that the claims are derivative: any creditor\u2019s claim is for harm to itself, but the point of the Injunction was to bar claims that were brought or could have been brought in the Adversary Proceeding, and those claims arise from harm to the Tronox debtors. At bottom, the Avoca Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are that certain Tronox debtors harmed them, and that New Kerr-McGee harmed the Tronox debtors. In that sense, \u201cthe Avoca Plaintiffs\u2019 indirect-liability claims against New Kerr-McGee arise from two alleged harms\u2014-from harm to them and from harm to the Tronox debtors.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Br. 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-9\">Further, <em>Madoff </em>is a hurdle that the Avoca Plaintiffs\u2019 have failed to overcome. There, too, we confronted the same \u201carise[ ] from harm done to the estate\u201d language and deemed it to mean derivative claims. 740 F.3d at 89 (alteration in original). The Avoca Plaintiffs\u2019 attempts to distinguish this case from <em>Madoff </em>are unpersuasive. First, they argue that the <em>Madoff </em>injunction was broader than this Injunction^ because the <em>Madoff </em>trustee had greater authority than the Litigation Trust here. Even if that were true, the Avoca Plaintiffs are bound by the Injunction\u2019s language, to which they did not object. Second, they argue the two injunctions are different because the Injunction here bars \u201cTrust Derivative Claims,\u201d whereas the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number><em>Madoff </em>injunction excluded the word \u201cTrust\u201d and barred only \u201cderivative claims The addition of the word \u201cTrust,\u201d however, does not render the two Injunctions materially different. Rather, it is the definitions and not the titles which we compare, and those do not materially differ. A219-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-5\">Finally, the District Court noted\u2014and New Kerr-McGee asserts here\u2014that because the Injunction does not bar any liability that such released parties \u201cmight have that <em>does not </em>arise from or through a liability of a Debtor,\u201d the Injunction must bar claims that <em>do </em>arise from or through a liability of a Debtor. Just because the Injunction does not bar claims that do not arise from or through debtor liability does not mean that a harm that <em>does </em>arise from or through a liability of a debtor is necessarily barred; the claim still must be trust-derivative or -duplicative. That said, the inclusion of that language supports the notion that the Injunction was meant to bar all derivative or duplicative claims, nothing more. In other words, by providing that the Injunction does not bar any liability that such released parties \u201cmight have that <em>does not </em>arise from or through a liability of a Debtor,\u201d the Injunction was making clear that it covered derivative claims and did not cover non-derivative claims. Read against the backdrop of decades of derivative-claim jurisprudence, the language makes sense; it specifically avoids the appearance of a <em>Manville III </em>problem, where the Injunction could appear to go beyond the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court. <em>See Manville III, </em>517 F.3d at 65 (holding that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to enjoin claims against third-party insurer).</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-6\">The same was true in <em>Madoff. </em>Indeed, in issuing the Injunction, the District Court noted that, in <em>Madoff, </em>this Court \u201cupheld a permanent injunction that, like the one at issue here, was \u2018limited to third-party claims based on derivative or duplicative liability or claims that could have been brought by the Trustee against the ... releasees.\u2019 \u201d <em>Anadarko, </em>2014 WL 5825308, at *10 (quoting <em>Madoff, </em>740 F.3d at 89, 95). In making that pronouncement in <em>Madoff, </em>we held that the bankruptcy court did not exceed its jurisdiction in issuing the injunction. 740 F.3d at 89. The Injunction here does the same: it goes to the limit of the bankruptcy court\u2019s jurisdiction to bar derivative or duplicative claims, but no further.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-8\">For those reasons, the District Court acted well within its discretion in interpreting the language of the settlement when it found that the Avoca Plaintiffs\u2019 claims were barred by the Injunction. The District Court therefore did not expand the scope of the Injunction, and thus did not modify it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-9\">The Avoca Plaintiffs had an opportunity to seek recovery from the Tronox debtors in the bankruptcy proceeding, to participate in settlement negotiations, and to object to the Settlement Agreement and Injunction (and refuse recovery therefrom). Indeed, as PepsiCo did in <em>St. Paul, </em>the Avoca Plaintiffs, as unsecured creditors of the Tronox debtors, filed claims in the bankruptcy court against the debtors, were represented by the Litigation Trust, and had a voice through which to articulate their claims. <em>See St. Paul, </em>884 F.2d at 705. That voice sought assets from New Kerr-McGee in the Adversary Proceeding and settled those claims for a significant sum, from which the Avoca Plaintiffs recovered. The Avoca Plaintiffs cannot now get a second bite at the apple.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-10\">C. The District Court\u2019s Order to Dismiss the PA State Action With Prejudice Was Not an Abuse of Discretion</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-11\">The Avoca Plaintiffs argue that, even if their already-pleaded claims are barred as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>derivative, the District Court should have allowed them to amend their state-court complaints, and that by ordering them to dismiss with prejudice the District Court exceeded its jurisdiction and violated <em>Ma-doff. </em>Appellants\u2019 Br. 43-45. They are wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-4\">The District court \u201cplainly had jurisdiction to interpret and enforce its own prior order] ] [the Injunction]\u201d which it \u201cexplicitly retained jurisdiction to enforce.\u201d <em>See Travelers Indem., </em>557 U.S. at 151, 129 S.Ct. 2195. The court\u2019s choice of how to enforce the order is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See EEOC v. Local 580, Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Bridge, Structural &amp; Ornamental Ironworkers, Joint Apprentice-Journeyman Educ. Fund, </em>925 F.2d 588, 595 (2d Cir. 1991). A court can take \u201cany reasonable action ... to secure compliance,\u201d and the \u201cscope of a district court\u2019s equitable powers to remedy past wrongs is broad.\u201d <em>Berger v. Heckler, </em>771 F.2d 1556, 1568 (2d Cir. 1985) (quoting <em>Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., </em>402 U.S. 1, 15, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971); <em>Gates v. Collier, </em>616 F.2d 1268, 1271 (5th Cir. 1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-5\">The District Court held that all claims already pleaded were barred by the Injunction, and that, despite ample opportunities to do so, the Avoca Plaintiffs had failed to come up with a claim that would not be barred. <em>Madojf </em>does not require a district court to allow countless attempts to replead. At the point when we determined that there was \u201cconceivably some particularized conspiracy claim,\u201d <em>Madojf, </em>740 F.3d at 94, the lower courts had considered only whether specific claims in a filed complaint were barred, <em>see id. </em>at 87-88. The bankruptcy court and district court had not yet had the opportunity to consider what other claims, if any, were enjoined. That is why we left the issue of whether alternative, unpleaded claims might qualify as non-derivative for the District Court to consider in the first instance. <em>Id. </em>at 94. <em>Madojf </em>should not be read beyond its facts and posture as an invitatio\u00f1 for plaintiffs to limitlessly re-plead theories to circumvent the reach of an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-7\">The Avoca Plaintiffs have had more than enough time and opportunities\u2014in state court, the District Court, and in this Court\u2014to articulate \u00e1 claim that is not derivative. They have failed. Their briefs here and below have never mentioned any \u201cparticularized conspiracy claim\u201d or other type of direct claim against New Kerr-McGee. To date, they have only ever asserted that \u201cthey suffered personal injuries as a direct result of the conduct of [Old Kerr-McGee].\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. 41. As mentioned above, counsel for the Avoca Plaintiffs argued for the first time at oral argument that direct claims might exist based on a purported letter to the EPA saying that New Kerr-McGee would be handling the remediation. But even then counsel failed to articulate what the claim would be.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-8\">Lest the reader think the Avoca Plaintiffs were deprived of sufficient opportunities to conceive a direct claim, the Avoca Plaintiffs filed a post-argument Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(j) letter to supplement their challenge to the District Court\u2019s determination that they had no direct claims. In it, they articulate no direct claim, but argue only that Judge Forrest\u2019s determination that they lacked any <em>bona fide </em>direct claims against New Kerr-McGee violated the historical admonition against advisory opinions recently reiterated in <em>In re Motors Liquidation Co., </em>829 F.3d 135 (2d Cir. 2016). Unlike the bankruptcy court decision in <em>In re Motors, </em>which resolved an issue not before it and involved an entity not party to the litigation, <em>id. </em>at 150-52, Judge Forrest\u2019s opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>was not advisory. As explained above, she had jurisdiction to interpret and apply the Injunction, <em>see Travelers Indem., </em>557 U.S. at 151, 129 S.Ct. 2195, and to take any reasonable action to secure compliance therewith, <em>see Berger, </em>771 F.2d at 1568.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-5\">The frailty of the Avoca Plaintiffs\u2019 position is confirmed by the last sentence of their merits Reply Brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1058-6\">The Avoca Plaintiffs contend, however, that equity requires that the Court permit them to return to the [Pennsylvania state court] to obtain information in discovery that New [Kerr-McGee] should have provided previously, and that the Court permit them to continue with the \u201cslice\u201d of their claims that remain[s].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4Vc\">Appellants\u2019 Reply Br. 23. Of course they have not yet had discovery in state court, but that is not how claims are pleaded\u2014 plaintiffs do not get to file a complaint hoping that discovery will yield facts to give rise to claims that are not barred.

The Avoca Plaintiffs do not argue that the District Court\u2019s order falls within the small class of decisions excepted from the final-judgment rule under the collateral order doctrine, for good reason. The order is at the heart of the merits of the proceedings and therefore not collateral. Moreover, the order is not effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment; if the Avoca Plaintiffs refuse to dismiss the PA State Action and the District Court finds contempt or imposes sanctions, the Avoca Plaintiffs can appeal from that ruling. We note that because our jurisdictional analysis under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 requires an analysis of the merits of the District Court's interpretation of the Injunction, a subsequent appeal would have to overcome any preclu-sive effects of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1042-7\">. The Avoca Plaintiffs also argue briefly that the District Court\u2019s order does not merely interpret the Injunction, but \u201ccontinues\u201d it.

The nature of the Injunction and the district court\u2019s dual analysis of both the language of the Injunction (for which its views deserve deference) and the relationship of that language to legal standards (which present clear issues of law reviewed by us in the normal course) present an interesting twist to the jurisdictional inquiry but should not be seen as an invitation for \"piecemeal appeals [] cloaked in the guise of jurisdictional inquiries, [to] come in through the back door.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1293. Injunctions tied to the factual circumstances of the parties that do not employ a legal principle to measure their scope will fall under the more deferential standard of review noted above.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1045-4\">. Like Delaware corporate law (which New Kerr-McGee argues applies to the case before us) and Pennsylvania law (which the Avoca Plaintiffs argue applies to the case before us), <em>see infra </em>at 102, Ohio law allowed a subsidiary to pierce its own veil, <em>see St. Paul, </em>884 F.2d at 695.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1046-8\">. The Supreme Court reversed <em>Manville III </em>in part on narrow procedural grounds that did not upend our ruling that a bankruptcy court is without jurisdiction to enjoin claims against nondebtors that are not derivative of the debtor\u2019s wrongdoing. <em>Travelers Indem., </em>557 U.S. at 155, 129 S.Ct. 2195.

As best can be gleaned from an independent review of the record on appeal, there is no reference to the alleged 2002 letter. Indeed, the only references to letter exchanges with the EPA appear in the Avoca Motion, and relate only to Old Kerr-McGee\u2019s receipt of letters <em>from </em>the EPA in 1999 regarding an investigation into a different wood-treatment site than the Avoca Plant. <em>See </em>J.A. 1S4-55 \u00b6\u00b6 37-39.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">. Proving these claims against New Kerr-McGee requires establishing a chain of liability from the original tortfeasors to New Kerr-McGee. The Avoca Plaintiffs would first need a finding that the operator of the Avoca Plant, Tronox LLC (f/k/a Kerr-McGee Chemical) was liable for the underlying torts. Then they would need two veil-piercings or findings of alter-ego liability\u2014the first to get to Tronox Worldwide LLC (f/k/a Old Kerr-McGee), the former direct parent of Tronox LLC, and the second to get to New Kerr-McGee as the non-debtor ultimate parent. At each level of piercing, the Avoca Plaintiffs would have to show that \"there is fraud\u201d or the entity whose veil they seek to pierce was \"a mere instrumentality or alter ego of its owner.\u201d <em>Fletcher v. Atex, Inc., </em>68 F.3d 1451, 1457 (2d Cir. 1995) (quoting <em>Geyer v. Ingersoll Publ'ns Co., </em>621 A.2d 784, 793 (Del. Ch. 1992)); <em>see also Advanced Tel. Sys., Inc. v.

As noted above, the Avoca Plaintiffs do not dispute that they were creditors of Tronox or that New Kerr-McGee qualifies as an '\u2018Ana-darko Released Party.\u201d J.A. 89 \u00b6 1,9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b1053-7\">. The footnote reads:'</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-16\">This understanding is buttressed by the proceedings \u00bfnd litigation history that led to this Court's entiy of the Injunction, In particular, the Court's view is informed by the nature and scope of the Adversary Proceed-, ing and the Settlement Agreement. The Ad-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>versaiy Proceeding (and the resulting Settlement Agreement) encompassed any and all claims that the Tronox trustee could pursue against [New Kerr-McGee]. The Adversary Proceeding was brought by the Tro-nox estate (and then continued by the Ana-darko Litigation Trust) to recover funds transferred to [New Kerr-McGee]. through fraudulent intra-corporate shenanigans. The Anadarko Litigation Trust Agreement gave the Litigation Trust the power to institute any other actions that could have been brought by Tronox against [New Kerr-McGee], Thus, any claims that could be asserted by the Tronox trustee against the defendants in the Adversary Proceeding may properly fall within the scope of the Settlement Agreement and the Injunction,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"akc-dedup-1\"><em>In re Tronox Inc., </em>549 B.R. at 52 n.21 (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b1054-13\">. This is essentially a collateral attack on the Litigation Trust\u2019s authority, which could have been, but was not, brought at the time the Injunction was issued.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b1055-7\">. The Avoca Plaintiffs also argue that barring the claims violates the expectations of the parties to the settlement, because, through the Tort Claims Trust and its Advisory Committee, they explicitly rejected Anadarko and New Kerr-McGee's request for a broad release as to them as part of a settlement of the Adversary Proceeding. But, as the District Court explained, \"[a] belief that claims are retained is trumped by contractual language that clearly states they are not.\" <em>In re Tronox Inc., </em>549 B.R. at 54 (citing <em>Mastrovincenzo, </em>435 F.3d at 103). Moreover, this highlights a subtext to this whole case: it would be curious for New Kerr-McGee to have settled these claims without insulating themselves from additional litigation with the individual creditors, and if the Avoca Plaintiffs were able to pursue these claims based on the same allegations set forth in their proofs of claim in the Tronox bankruptcy, then for what harm were they entitled to the original recovery?</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-11\">The Avoca Plaintiffs further argue that New Kerr-McGee waived its right to contest its responsibility for policies at the Avoca Plant because it did not argue in the PA State Action that it was the wrong party in the years of litigation that preceded the Tronox bankruptcy. But New Kerr-McGee\u2019s behavior before the release of claims against the Tro-nox debtors does not indicate how New Kerr-McGee would have operated after the Injunction issued and it was the sole remaining defendant. <em>See </em>J.A. 751.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b1058-32\">. The Avoca Plaintiffs finally argue that the issue of whether the claims are extinguished by the Settlement Agreement\u2014the purported \u2018\u2018alternative holding\u201d that New Kerr-McGee urges as a fallback\u2014is an issue that ought to be resolved by the state court on any claims that survive the Injunction. But because no claims survive the Injunction, and there are none that can be properly pleaded by amendment, the issue of whether the claims have been extinguished is of no moment. In any event, because we dismiss for want of appellate jurisdiction, the propriety of the extin-guishment ruling may conceivably be litigated at a later date on appeal from a contempt ruling or otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
