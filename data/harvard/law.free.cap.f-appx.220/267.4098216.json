Teagle argues, for the first time on appeal, that the district court erred by failing to adequately articulate its reasons for imposing a non-Guidelines sentence. He also contends that his sentence was unreasonable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Teagle fails to demonstrate any error, plain or otherwise, with regard to the rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>sonableness of the non-Guidelines sentence imposed by the district court. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 434-36 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707-10 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Teagle argues, for the first time on appeal, that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under \u00a7 922(g)(1) because there was no evidence that his possession of the firearms was in or affected interstate commerce. He concedes that his argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied </em>534 U.S. 1150, 122 S.Ct. 1113, 151 L.Ed.2d 1007 (2002), but raises it for possible review by the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Also, for the first time on appeal, Teagle argues that the district court erred by applying the Sentencing Guidelines as advisory. He concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Austin, </em>432 F.3d 598 (5th Cir.2005), but raises it to preserve it for possible review with the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b293-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
