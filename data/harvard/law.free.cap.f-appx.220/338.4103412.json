Although Rodriguez\u2019s motion was filed pursuant to Rule 41(g), the criminal proceeding against Rodriguez had concluded when he brought this action. Accordingly, we treat the Rule 41(g) motion as a \u00a7 1331 action, seeking the return of property, and treat the district court\u2019s denial of that motion as a grant of summary judgment in favor of the Government. <em>See Clymore v. United States, </em>217 F.3d 370, 373 (5th Cir.2000). We review de novo the district court\u2019s determination that the action was barred by limitations. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b365-19\">The six-year statute of limitations in \u00a7 2401(a) governs civil actions for return of property. <em>United States v. Wright, </em>361 F.3d 288, 290 (5th Cir.2004). Under federal law, a cause of action accrues \u201cwhen the plaintiff is in possession of the \u2018critical facts that he has been hurt and who has inflicted the injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gartrell v. Gaylor, </em>981 F.2d 254, 257 (5th Cir.1993) (citations omitted). Rodriguez does not dispute that he was aware of the purported seizure of items from 895 Elizabeth Street, San Benito, Texas, as of 1989 and also knew of the purported seizure of items located in the safety deposit box as of 1992. He necessarily would have been aware, as of 1989 and 1992, of the lack of notice that any forfeiture had been initiated as to the property.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> Rodriguez\u2019s 2005 motion for return of property was untimely. <em>See Gartrell, </em>981 F.2d at 257; <em>see Polanco v. Drug Enforcement Administration, </em>158 F.3d 647, 654 (2d Cir.1998) (holding that a cause of action for return of property forfeited without sufficient notice accrued at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>the earliest of the following: 1) at the close of the forfeiture proceedings; or 2) if no forfeiture proceedings were conducted, at the end of the five-year limitations period for the Government to bring a forfeiture action). Although equitable tolling applies to \u00a7 2401(a)\u2019s limitations period, <em>Clymore, </em>217 F.3d at 374, we decline to apply it under the circumstances of this case because the record does not reflect that Rodriguez exercised due diligence. <em>See Baldwin County Welcome Ctr. v. Brown, </em>466 U.S. 147, 151, 104 S.Ct. 1723, 80 L.Ed.2d 196 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">If the Government does not have the property, the only relief possible for Rodriguez would be in the form of money damages. <em>See Armendariz-Mata v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, DEA </em>82 F.3d 679, 682 (5th Cir.1996). Assuming, without deciding, that Rodriguez had a cause of action under <em>Bivens,</em><footnotemark><em>***</em></footnotemark><em> </em>any such action is time-barred. <em>See Pena v. United States, </em>157 F.3d 984, 987 (5th Cir.1998) (observing that Pena\u2019s motion for the return of seized property presented the facts necessary for a <em>Bivens </em>action); Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code \u00a7 16.003(a) (providing applicable two-year limitations period).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b365-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
