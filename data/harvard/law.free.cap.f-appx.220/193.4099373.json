Although the district court did not have the benefit of <em>Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Ry. v. White, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006), we have reviewed the record in light of that recent authority and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>See Brown v. AGY Holding Corp., </em>No. 1:04-cv-22347RBH (D.S.C. Apr. 3, 2006). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-27\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
