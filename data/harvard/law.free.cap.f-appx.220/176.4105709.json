On appeal, Wilson challenges his sentence on three grounds. He contends that: (1) the district court used the wrong standard in fashioning his sentence; (2) the district court erred in declining to grant his motion for a downward departure based on his intent to help the U.S. military; and (3) his sentence is unreasonable because it is a custodial, rather than a non-custodial, sentence. Because the district court fully complied with its procedural obligations in imposing the sentence and Wilson has not met his burden of demonstrating that his sentence is unreasonable, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Wilson\u2019s guilty plea was based on his construction of hand grenades at his home. Wilson had not registered his explosive devices with the Secretary of the Treasury, paid tax on their manufacture or obtained approval to register the explosives. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5822 (2000) (approval, registration and tax requirements). At sentencing, Wilson acknowledged that he knew it was illegal to develop the devices without registration and approval, but hoped that once he perfected the design, he would still be able to secure a patent, produce and sell the weapons to the military to further the war effort in Iraq. Wilson\u2019s Guidelines range was 37 to 46 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">Wilson requested a downward departure and a non-custodial sentence based on two factors identified in <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d), lesser harms, \u00a7 5K2.11, and diminished capacity, \u00a7 5K2.13. The court imposed a downward variance sentence of 30 months\u2019 imprisonment based on the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2006). The court identified several factors that it concluded justified a sentence outside the Guidelines range: (1) the likelihood of recidivism was minimal; (2) the defendant\u2019s family obligations and his wife\u2019s mental condition; (3) the defendant\u2019s mental condition; and (4) a 30-month sentence would be sufficient deterrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">In imposing a sentence after <em>Booker.,</em><footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the district court must first correctly determine, after making appropriate findings of fact, the applicable Guidelines range. See <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). Next, the court must \u201cdetermine whether a sentence within that range ... serves the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) and, if not, select a sentence [within statutory limits] that does serve those factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). The district court must articulate the reasons for the sentence imposed, particularly explaining any departure or variance from the Guidelines range. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(c) (West Supp.2006); <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546 <em>&amp; </em>n. 5. The explanation of a variance sentence must be tied to the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) and must be accompanied by findings of fact as necessary. <em>See Green, </em>436 F.3d at 455-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-15\">This court reviews the sentence for reasonableness, considering \u201cthe extent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>which the sentence ... comports with the various, and sometimes competing, goals of \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). When we review a sentence outside the advisory Guidelines range \u2014 whether as a product of a departure or a variance \u2014 we consider whether the district court acted reasonably both with respect to its decision to impose such a sentence and with respect to the extent of the divergence from the Guidelines range. <em>See id. </em>at 433-34 (variance sentence); <em>United States v. Hairston, </em>96 F.3d 102, 106 (4th Cir.1996) (departure sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Wilson contends that the district court used an incorrect standard when it fashioned a sentence based on \u201creasonableness\u201d rather than a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to accomplish the goals of \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He cites to <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>445 F.3d 366, 370 (4th. Cir.2006), in which this court recited the reasonableness standard. However, this court did not suggest in <em>Davenport </em>that a district court may not use the term \u201creasonable\u201d in describing a defendant\u2019s sentence. Nor does <em>Davenport </em>stand for the proposition that in order to withstand appellate review, a district court must specifically articulate the language of the statute \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary.\u201d Wilson\u2019s argument is one of semantics and because the district court followed the appropriate procedure in imposing the sentence, considered the relevant factors, and adequately explained its reasoning, we reject it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Wilson also challenges the court\u2019s decision denying his motion for a downward departure based on USSG \u00a7 5K2.11 (lesser harms). He claims the court\u2019s refusal to depart was based on a mistaken belief that it lacked authority to do so. While a district court\u2019s mistaken view that it lacked the authority to depart may constitute reversible error, <em>see United States v. Bayerle, </em>898 F.2d 28, 30-31 (4th Cir.1990), our review of the sentencing proceeding confirms the integrity of the court\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">The district court fully considered Wilson\u2019s motion for a downward departure based on- the argument that his patriotic motives warranted a reduced sentence, but determined that, regardless of Wilson\u2019s motives, the interest of the public in punishing and deterring the type of dangerous illegal conduct Wilson had committed was not diminished. This analysis is consistent with USSG \u00a7 5K2.11. p.s., which explains that while a departure on the basis of lesser harms may be appropriate where a defendant commits a crime \u201cin order to avoid a perceived greater harm,\u201d a sentencing reduction is inappropriate \u201c[wjhere the interest in punishment or deterrence is not reduced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">USSG \u00a7 5K2.11 p.s., also permits a reduced sentence if the conduct does not \u201ccause or threaten the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the law proscribing the offense at issue.\u201d The policy statement cites, as an example, a case in which a war veteran possesses a grenade as a \u201ctrophy.\u201d Arguing for the application of this exception, Wilson relies on <em>United States v. White Buffalo, </em>10 F.3d 575, 576-77 (8th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Cir.1993), in which the defendant was convicted of possession of a sawed-off shotgun and a downward departure was affirmed. In that case, the defendant lived in a rural area and shortened a rifle to enable him to crawl under a chicken shack to dispose of predators.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">We conclude, however, that Wilson\u2019s conduct did not warrant application of the portion of USSG \u00a7 5K2.11 which the court relied on in <em>White Buffalo. </em>Here, although Wilson may have hoped to assist the government and military, his conduct still caused exactly the harm, the unregulated possession and manufacture of explosives, that the statute seeks to prevent. As the district court determined, Wilson\u2019s motives do not diminish society\u2019s interest in punishment and deterrence of the conduct in which he engaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Finally, Wilson argues that his sentence is unreasonable because a non-eustodial sentence would be sufficient to serve the purposes of sentencing. He contends that the court failed to properly consider the \u201ccircumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d in accordance with \u00a7 3553(a)(1), and failed to accord sufficient weight to his mental health history. However, this factor is the stated basis for the court\u2019s imposition of a non-Guidelines sentence, and one of the factors listed as justification for the sentence is the \u201cdefendant\u2019s mental condition.\u201d Thus, the court properly considered and relied on the relevant factors under \u00a7 3553(a) in imposing the sentence and Wilson has not established that the sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Accordingly, we affirm Wilson\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b203-10\">. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b204-6\">.

Wilson also argues that this court\u2019s presumption of reasonableness to sentences within the Guidelines range is unconstitutional. In view of the fact that Wilson\u2019s sentence is below the Guidelines range, this argument affords him no benefit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
