Salgado sought a reduction in \u201cactual prison time\u201d amounting to her immediate re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>lease from prison. The district court denied her petition on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Salgado was released from prison while the instant appeal was pending. An appeal is not moot simply because a \u00a7 2241 petitioner is no longer in custody. <em>Brown v. Resor, </em>407 F.2d 281, 283 (5th Cir.1969). However, an action is moot when the court cannot grant the relief requested by the moving party. <em>See Bailey v. Southerland, </em>821 F.2d 277, 278 (5th Cir.1987) (holding that an appeal from the denial of a \u00a7 2241 application was moot because \u201c[t]he main thrust\u201d of Bailey\u2019s application was to be released from confinement, and \u201c[b]ecause Bailey was released ... this court [could] no longer provide him with that relief\u2019); <em>see also Willy v. Administrative Review Board, </em>423 F.3d 483, 494 n. 50 (5th Cir.2005) (\u201cIf an event occurs that prevents us from granting \u2018any effectual relief whatever\u2019 to a prevailing party, the controversy is moot, and the appeal must be dismissed.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Salgado admits that there were no errors at her sentencing. Rather, the main thrust of Salgado\u2019s petition is to be released from her confinement based on purported errors that occurred after she was sentenced. <em>See Bailey, </em>821 F.2d at 278. Salgado\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b282-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
