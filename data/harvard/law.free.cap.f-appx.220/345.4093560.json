Clark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>argues that his sentence of 71 months of imprisonment, which was at the top of the applicable advisory sentencing guideline range, is unreasonable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) because it was greater than necessary to achieve the goals of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Clark\u2019s sentence was within a properly calculated advisory guideline range and is presumed reasonable. <em>See United, States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Little explanation of a sentence is required when a district court expressly imposes a sentence within the advisory guideline range. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). Clark has failed to demonstrate that his properly calculated Guidelines sentence was unreasonable, and he is therefore not entitled to relief. <em>See Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b371-35\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
