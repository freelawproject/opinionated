Camp filed this lawsuit, raising federal Privacy Act and state law claims. After review, we affirm in part and reverse in part the district court\u2019s dismissal of Camp\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A2v\">A. The Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-14\">On July 5, 2006, Camp filed this lawsuit against defendants-appellees Betty B. Ca-son, the Probate Judge for Carroll County, and Bill Hitchens, the Commissioner of the Georgia Department of Public Safety, in their official capacities. We outline the allegations in Camp\u2019s complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-15\">In June 2006, Camp submitted a renewal application for a GFL to the Carroll County Probate Court. Camp provided all information requested on the application form, except for his SSN. When the Probate Clerk requested Camp\u2019s SSN, Camp refused. The Probate Court would not process Camp\u2019s renewal application unless he disclosed his SSN. The Department of Public Safety is responsible for this statewide GFL application form. <em>See </em>Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-ll-129(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-16\">Camp\u2019s complaint asserts that defendants violated his rights in two distinct ways: (1) by not granting his GFL renewal because he refused to disclose his SSN, in violation of Section 7(a)(1) of the Privacy Act;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) by using an application form that does not indicate whether the disclosure of an individual\u2019s SSN is mandatory or voluntary, by what statutory or other authority such number is solicited, and what uses will be made of it, in violation of Section 7(b) of the Privacy Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>plaint also alleges that defendants violated the Georgia firearms statute, Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-ll-129(a), by requiring him to disclose nonpertinent information about his employment on the GPL application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">Camp\u2019s complaint requests \u201cdeclaratory and prospective injunctive relief,\u201d including, <em>inter alia: </em>(1) an order directing defendants to process Camp\u2019s GFL application without his SSN; (2) a declaratory judgment that the GFL application form violates the Privacy Act and that defendants violated Camp\u2019s rights under the Privacy Act, the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Georgia Constitution; (3) a declaratory judgment that employment information is neither pertinent nor relevant to a GFL application under Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16 \u2014 11\u2014129(a); (4) an injunction prohibiting defendants from requiring an individual\u2019s SSN or an individual\u2019s employment information as a precondition to obtaining a GFL; (5) an injunction requiring defendants to conform the GFL application form to Section 7(b) of the Privacy Act; (6) expungement of Camp\u2019s SSN and employment information from all of defendants\u2019 records; and (7) costs and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">B. Plaintiffs Motion for TRO</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">With his July 5, 2006 complaint, Camp filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (\u201cTRO\u201d) or preliminary injunction compelling defendants to accept his application and renew his GFL. On July 11, 2006, the district court entered a two-sentence order summarily granting Camp\u2019s TRO motion, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-8\">This action is currently before the court on the plaintiffs motion for temporary restraining order [Doe. No. 2], After considering the written pleadings filed by the parties and conducting a hearing on this matter, the court GRANTS the plaintiffs motion for temporary restraining order [Doc. No. 2] as follows: after the completion by the plaintiff of an application for the renewal of his [GFL] and for a temporary renewal license pursuant [to Ga.Code Ann.] \u00a7 16-11-129 with the exception of the disclosure of his [SSN], the Probate Court of Carroll County shall accept and process the plaintiffs applications regardless of the omission of the plaintiffs [SSN].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-13\">The district court\u2019s order did not address any of Camp\u2019s Privacy Act claims or state law claims. It did not address Camp\u2019s claims about the illegalities in the GFL application form or any of the other declaratory or injunctive relief requested by Camp. The district court simply ordered defendants to process and accept Camp\u2019s application for a GFL without his SSN.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-14\">Defendants complied, processed Camp\u2019s application, and issued his renewed GFL.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-15\">C. Defendants\u2019 Motions to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-16\">Defendants then filed motions to dismiss, arguing that the case was now entirely moot because Camp had his GFL. Defendant Hitchens also argued that the case was moot because the Department of Public Safety had revised the GFL application form to make an applicant\u2019s SSN and employment information optional. Hitchens attached a copy of the revised application form to his motion to dismiss. The revised application states: (1) <em>\u201cSSN </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number><em>Optional, but will help prevent misidentification\u201d; </em>and (2) <em>\u201cEmployment information Optional, but will be helpful for contacting </em>applicant.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">Camp responded, arguing that defendants continue to violate the Privacy Act, and that he had not received any of the other declaratory and injunctive relief requested in his complaint. For example, Camp stressed that the amended form still violates the Privacy Act\u2019s requirement that a government agency requesting a SSN \u201cshall inform ... by what statutory or other authority such number is solicited, and what uses will be made of it.\u201d Privacy Act of 1974, Pub.L. No. 93-579, \u00a7 7(b), 88 Stat. 1896, 1909 (codified as amended at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a (note)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">After defendants replied (still arguing mootness), Camp filed a surreply, to which he attached the affidavits of two Georgia residents, Norman W. Edgar and Todd N. Nims. Edgar and Nims averred that they applied for GFLs after the purported changes to the GFL application but they were nevertheless required to provide their SSNs and employment information.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">On September 11, 2006, the district court granted defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss, stating that Camp\u2019s claims were \u201crendered moot by events occurring after the commencement of this lawsuit.\u201d The district court\u2019s order acknowledged Hitch-ens\u2019s submission of the revised GFL form, but specifically stated that \u201cmootness in the present case does not depend on the Department\u2019s decision to amend the GFL application that was the subject of this litigation. It depends, instead, upon the fact that [the] Probate Court of Carroll County processed [Camp\u2019s] renewal application\u201d without requiring his SSN. The district court concluded that it could not offer additional \u201cmeaningful relief\u201d to Camp because he had already \u201creceived the primary benefit sought in the complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-11\">Camp then moved for attorney\u2019s fees, arguing that he was the \u201cprevailing party\u201d under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 by virtue of the district court\u2019s TRO. The district court denied Camp\u2019s motion. Camp timely appealed the dismissal order and the separate attorney\u2019s fees order.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-13\">Pursuant to Article III of the Constitution, federal courts only have jurisdiction over \u201ccases\u201d and \u201ccontroversies.\u201d <em>See Nat\u2019l Adver. Co. v. City of Miami, </em>402 F.3d 1329, 1332 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1318, 164 L.Ed.2d 48 (2006). If a lawsuit is rendered moot by subsequent developments, it cannot present a live Article III case or controversy. <em>See id. </em>\u201c[A] case is moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.\u201d <em>Mingkid v. U.S. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number><em>Att\u2019y Gen., </em>468 F.3d 763, 768 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation marks and citations omitted). \u201cPut another way, a case is moot when it no longer presents a live controversy with respect to which the court can give meaningful relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks, alteration, and citations omitted). Mootness can occur by virtue of a change in circumstances or a change in the law. <em>See Coral Springs St. Sys., Inc. v. City of Sunrise, </em>371 F.3d 1320, 1328 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cThe case or controversy requirement must be met throughout the entirety of the proceedings.\u201d <em>ACLU v. Florida Bar, </em>999 F.2d 1486, 1490 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">A. Camp\u2019s Privacy Act Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">For sure, Camp got a renewed GFL, but defendants\u2019 refusal to process his GFL application was only one of his claims. Camp\u2019s complaint made substantive claims and requested additional meaningful relief <em>beyond </em>his request that defendants process his current GFL application without his SSN. For example, Camp\u2019s complaint on its face seeks prospective relief, such as: (1) a declaratory judgment that the GFL application form violates the Privacy Act; (2) an injunction prohibiting defendants from requiring a GFL applicant\u2019s SSN; and (3) an injunction requiring defendants to conform the GFL application form to Section 7(b) of the Privacy Act. The district court wholly failed to address any of Camp\u2019s substantive claims about the application form and process itself. Thus, the district court incorrectly concluded that it could not grant Camp additional meaningful relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">Moreover, the complaint alleges that Camp already held a GFL and was seeking a <em>renewal </em>GFL at the time his application was denied in 2006. Camp, as a repeat applicant for GFLs, has a concrete, legally cognizable interest in the GFL application process, and he has alleged that both the application form and process violate the Privacy Act. Because GFLs are valid for only five years, <em>see </em>Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-11-129, Camp will have to continually renew his license and fill out the GFL application form. Thus, there is a sufficient imminence of future harm. <em>See Elend v. Basham, </em>471 F.3d 1199, 1208 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">Defendant Hitchens also argues that the Department of Public Safety\u2019s revisions to its GFL application form rendered Camp\u2019s prospective claims moot. We disagree. First, as outlined earlier, the district court declared the case moot only because Camp received a GFL, not because of the revised form. Second, Camp submitted two affidavits by other GFL applicants that rebut the contention that a revised GFL application form and process are actually in effect. Given that Hitchens submitted the revised application form with his motion to dismiss, Camp\u2019s two affidavits in reply thereto, if anything, create a material fact issue as to whether the original form remains in circulation or has been replaced. Accordingly, Hitchens\u2019s revised form does not moot the case either.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-10\">Third, even if we assume that only a revised GFL application form is now used, Camp\u2019s complaint still alleges, and he has consistently argued, that the GFL application (in whatever form) violates Section 7(b) of the Privacy Act. Although the revised form makes SSN disclosure optional, Section 7(b) of the Privacy Act provides that any Federal, State, or local government agency that requests an individual to disclose his SSN shall inform that individual not only \u201cwhether that disclosure is mandatory or voluntary,\u201d but also \u201cby what statutory or other authority such number is solicited, and what uses will be made of it.\u201d 88 Stat. at 1909. Camp thus argues that the revised form continues to violate Section 7(b) because it does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>disclose the authority for making the optional SSN request or all uses contemplated for the SSNs. Thus, Camp\u2019s Privacy Act claims are not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">B. State Law Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">Likewise, we conclude that the district court erred in concluding that Camp\u2019s state law claim for prospective relief \u2014 enjoining defendants from requiring employment information \u2014 was rendered moot by Camp\u2019s receipt of a GFL. Camp\u2019s complaint alleges that to apply for a GFL, he had to supply his employment information, in violation of Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-11-129. Section 16-11-129 provides that GFL application forms \u201cshall be designed to elicit information from the applicant pertinent to his or her eligibility under this Code section, including citizenship, <em>but shall not require data which is nonpertinent or irrelevant </em>....\u201d Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16 \u2014 11\u2014 129(a) (emphasis added). Camp alleges that his employment information is non-pertinent or irrelevant and that the request for that information thus violates the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">The district court never addressed this claim, and Camp, as a repeat GFL applicant, has a concrete interest in the GFL application form and process.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, to the extent that the revised form might moot this claim, there is a factual dispute as to whether the revised form has actually been implemented. Thus, the district court also erred in dismissing Camp\u2019s state law claim as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">C. Expungement</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-8\">Camp\u2019s complaint also seeks an injunction directing defendants to \u201cexpunge, delete, and remove\u201d all of their records containing his SSN and employment information. In its dismissal order, the district court stated that Camp\u2019s request for ex-pungement did not save the case from mootness, \u201cbecause there is no basis in the complaint for providing [Camp] with the relief he seeks. Nothing in the complaint indicates that [Camp] ever provided this information to the defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-13\">As to expungement of Camp\u2019s SSN, we agree with the district court. Nothing in the complaint alleges that Camp ever provided his SSN to defendants. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Camp\u2019s request for expungement of his SSN.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-14\">As to expungement of his employment information, Camp\u2019s complaint alleges: (1) that the Department of Public Safety\u2019s official GFL application form \u201cdemands employment information\u201d; (2) that the Carroll County Probate Court also \u201cdemands employment information\u201d; and (3) that Camp, in applying for his GFL in June 2006, refused to provide his SSN but complied \u201cwith all other requests of the Carroll County Probate Court and the application.\u201d While Camp\u2019s request for ex-pungement of his employment information could have been more eloquently articulated, it satisfies the liberal notice pleading standard. <em>See Fin. Sec. Assurance, Inc. v. Stephens, Inc., </em>450 F.3d 1257, 1262 (11th Cir.2006). Accordingly, we conclude that the district court erred in ruling that Camp\u2019s complaint fails to state a claim for expungement of his employment information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-15\">D. Costs and Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-16\">Finally, Camp\u2019s complaint requests costs and attorney\u2019s fees. Given that the district court erroneously dismissed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>remainder of Camp\u2019s complaint as moot, we conclude that consideration of Camp\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees appeal is premature. <em>See Clark Advertising Agency, Inc. v. Tice, </em>490 F.2d 884, 840 (5th Cir.1974) (\u201cWe find [the] claim for attorney\u2019s fees ... premature. There will be time enough to face this issue once the judgment is final....\u201d). For example, on remand, if Camp obtains additional relief, he may choose to seek additional attorney\u2019s fees. On remand, the district court may choose to revisit its November 9, 2006, attorney\u2019s fees order. Thus, for reasons of judicial economy and to avoid creating piecemeal attorney\u2019s fees litigation, we will defer review of the district court\u2019s November 9, 2006, attorney\u2019s fees order until another day. We express no opinion regarding the district court\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">We reverse the district court\u2019s September 11, 2006 order dismissing Camp\u2019s complaint as moot and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We affirm the district court\u2019s September 11, 2006 order only to the extent it dismissed Camp\u2019s request for expungement of his SSN. Additionally, we dismiss Camp\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees order without prejudice to Camp\u2019s right to re-appeal the order upon re-entry of final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">No. 06-15404 AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED; No. 06-16425 DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1004-10\">. In reviewing the district court\u2019s order on defendants' motions to dismiss, we accept as true all factual allegations in Camp's complaint. <em>See Owens v. Samkle Auto., Inc., </em>425 F.3d 1318, 1320 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1004-11\">. Section 7(a)(1) of the Privacy Act provides that ''[i]t shall be unlawful for any Federal, State, or local government agency to deny to any individual any right, benefit, or privilege provided by law because of such individual\u2019s refusal to disclose his social security account number.\u201d Privacy Act of 1974, Pub.L. No. 93-579, \u00a7 7(a)(1), 88 Stat. 1896, 1909 (codified as amended at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a (note)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1004-18\">.

The order states that the district court granted the motion ''[ajfter considering the written pleadings filed by the parties and <em>conducting a hearing,\" </em>but the district court\u2019s docket sheet does not have an entry of any hearing, and there is no transcript of a hearing in the record. Thus, we look to only the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1005-18\">.

According to Hitchens\u2019s motion to dismiss, the application form was revised within two weeks after Camp filed his lawsuit.

We review questions of mootness de novo. <em>See Coral Springs St. Sys., Inc. v. City of Sunrise, </em>371 F.3d 1320, 1328 (11th Cir.2004).

It may be that the district court concluded that because Camp\u2019s Privacy Act claims were moot, it no longer had supplemental jurisdiction over Camp\u2019s state law claim.
