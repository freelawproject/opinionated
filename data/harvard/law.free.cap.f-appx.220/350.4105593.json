Azhdaroldini argues her motion for reconsideration should have been granted because (1) it was improper for the BIA to simply adopt the immigration judge\u2019s decision denying her motion to reopen without making its own independent judgment regarding the merits and (2) the BIA\u2019s decision was decided by only a one-member panel. We deem these arguments merit-less because the BIA\u2019s independent review does <em>not </em>preclude it from adopting or affirming a decision of the immigration judge, where, as in this ease, the BIA is in agreement with the reasoning and result of the immigration judge\u2019s decision. <em>See Matter of Burbano, </em>20 I &amp; N Dec. 872, 873-74 (BIA 1994). Moreover, the immigration regulations authorize a single BIA member to issue a decision on the merits of a case affirming the decision of the immigration judge. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-15\">Azhdaroldini additionally argues that there was sufficient information before the immigration judge from which a finding could have been made that she did not receive adequate notice of her removal proceeding. The evidence presented to the immigration judge in the motion to reopen, namely the counsel\u2019s letter and her mother\u2019s green card, do not indicate that Azhdaroldini did not receive her notice to appear. We hold, therefore, that the denial of Azhdaroldini\u2019s motion for reconsideration was not an abuse of discretion because she did not identify a change in the law, a misapplication of the law, or an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>aspect of the case that the BIA overlooked. <em>See Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 301 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b377-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
