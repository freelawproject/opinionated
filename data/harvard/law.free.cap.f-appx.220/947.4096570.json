On appeal, Mena-Hidalgo argues that the court should have applied a minor-role reduction, asserting that he was merely \u201clabeled as the captain\u201d of the go-fast boat and that he and his codefendants all performed the same tasks. Specifically, he contends that the district court failed to consider that he had no role in planning the operation and that he had no interest in the drugs or in the amount of money paid to the couriers. Mena-Hidalgo also argues that his sentence of 204 months\u2019 imprisonment is unreasonable considering his criminal history, educational background, acceptance of responsibility, and cooperation with authorities. He further asserts that his sentence is unreasonable because it is substantially disparate from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>the sentences imposed upon his codefendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">I. Minor-Role Reduction</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">Pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 264, 125 S.Ct. 738, 767, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Sentencing Guidelines are no longer mandatory. Although the Guidelines are merely advisory, a district court must calculate the advisory sentencing range correctly, and must consider it when determining a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178-79 (11th Cir.2005). <em>Booker </em>does not alter our previously established standards of review of the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines. <em>See id. </em>\u201cThis Court has long and repeatedly held that a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a finding of fact to be reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc). </em>The Sentencing Guidelines permit a court to decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by two levels if it finds that the defendant was a \u201cminor participant\u201d in the criminal activity. U.S.S.G \u00a7 3B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">Section 3B1.2 permits an adjustment to the Guideline range for a defendant who is substantially less culpable than the average participant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.3). A defendant is a minor participant if he is less culpable than most other participants, but his role cannot be described as minimal. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.5). In determining whether a mitigating-role reduction is warranted, a district court \u201cshould be informed by two principles discerned from the Guidelines: first, the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which [he] has been held accountable at sentencing, and, second, [his] role as compared to that of other participants in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940. However, \u201ca district court is not required to make any specific findings other than the ultimate determination of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe defendant bears the burden of proving his minor role by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>291 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-10\">In looking at relevant conduct, \u201cthe district court must assess whether the defendant is a minor or minimal participant in relation to the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant in calculating [his] base offense level.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 941. \u201cOnly if the defendant can establish that [he] played a relatively minor role in the conduct for which [he] has already been held accountable \u2014 not a minor role in any larger criminal conspiracy \u2014 should the district court grant a downward adjustment for minor role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-11\">The district court can also assess a defendant\u2019s relative culpability vis-a-vis \u201cother participants in the relevant conduct.\u201d The district court may only consider participants who are \u201cidentifiable or discernable from the evidence,\u201d and \u201cwho were involved in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant.\u201d Furthermore, \u201c[t]he fact that a defendant\u2019s role may be less than that of other participants engaged in the relevant conduct may not be dispositive of [the] role in the offense, since it is possible that none are minor ... participants.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b975-12\">The record indicates that Mena-Hidalgo acted as the captain of the go-fast boat and was accountable for directing the transportation of 1,200 kilograms of cocaine from Colombia to the Florida Keys. Mena-Hidalgo did not point to any evidence in the record that establishes that his responsibilities aboard the boat were less vital to the enterprise than those of the other crew members. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number><em>States v. De La Cruz, </em>443 F.3d 830, 832 (11th Cir.2006). Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in determining that Mena-Hidalgo\u2019s relevant conduct did not warrant a minor-role reduction, and we affirm as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">II. Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">We review a defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence, in its entirety, for unreasonableness in light of the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United, States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005). The factor in \u00a7 3553(a) that discusses disparity in sentencing provides, \u201cThe court, in determining the particular sentence to be imposed, shall consider ... the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). Additional factors in \u00a7 3553(a) include: \u201c(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment; (4) the need to protect the public; and (5) the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1328-29 (11th Cir.2005) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). \u201c[Njothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1329. Instead, indications in the record that the district court considered facts and circumstances falling within \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s factors will suffice. <em>Id. </em>at 1329-30. We have held that \u201c[disparity between the sentences imposed on codefendants is generally not an appropriate basis for relief on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Regueiro, </em>240 F.3d 1321, 1325-26 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-8\">Here, the district court imposed a reasonable sentence because it considered the sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a) along with the parties\u2019 arguments and it correctly applied the Guidelines. <em>See Crawford, </em>407 F.3d at 1178-79. The court specifically stated that it considered the level of Mena-Hidalgo\u2019s participation in the offense, along with the fact that he lied to the court about his involvement in other drug smuggling operations, in imposing a sentence of 204 months\u2019 imprisonment, at the high-end of the Guideline range. Mena-Hidalgo\u2019s argument that his sentence is unreasonable because it is substantially disparate from the sentences of his codefendants is without merit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The record indicates that Mena-Hidalgo admitted that he was the captain of the go-fast boat, which resulted in a higher base offense level, and thus, a higher advisory sentencing range than his codefendants. Moreover, Mena-Hidalgo did not receive the benefit of a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 motion to reduce his sentence, unlike other codefendants who gave substantial assistance to the government. To the contrary, Mena-Hidalgo persisted in lying to the court about his participation in other drug trafficking operations, admitting his previous conduct only after the court heard testimony from a codefendant who also took part in those operations. Accordingly, Mena-Hidalgo\u2019s sentence of 204 months\u2019 imprisonment within the Guideline range of 168 to 210 months is reasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b976-6\">. We decline to address whether the language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) refers to disparity among codefendants or nationwide because Mena-Hidalgo\u2019s argument fails under either interpretation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
