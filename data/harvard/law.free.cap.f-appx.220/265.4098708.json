Vigers challenges his sentences for conspiracy to interfere with commerce by robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371, 2, and interference with commerce by robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951(a), 2. (He does <em>not </em>contest his sentence for using a firearm during a crime of violence.)</p>\n<p id=\"b292-14\">Vigers contends the district court\u2019s Guideline\u2019s \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(4)(B) offense-level enhancement, applicable if a person was \u201cphysically restrained to facilitate the commission of the offense or to facilitate escape\u201d, was reversible error because his physically restraining victims during a robbery of the Lucky Peacock Casino was neither alleged in the indictment nor admitted to in his guilty plea\u2019s factual basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-15\">Notwithstanding Vigers\u2019 maintaining in his reply brief that this contention was raised in district court, it is, instead, raised for the first time on appeal. Accordingly, our review is only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-35, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Under such review, Vigers must show a clear or obvious error that affected his substantial rights. <em>E.g., United States v. Castillo, </em>386 F.3d 632, 636 (5th Cir.2004). Even then, we retain discretion to correct the error; ordinarily, we will <em>not </em>do so unless it \u201caffects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings\u201d. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-16\">Even after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) , a presentence investigation report (PSR) is presumed to be sufficiently reliable such that a district court may properly rely on it during sentencing. <em>See United States v. Arviso-Mata, </em>442 F.3d 382, 385 n. 10 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 829 (2006) ; <em>see also United States v. Ramirez, </em>367 F.3d 274, 277 (5th Cir.2004). The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating information relied upon by the district court in sentencing to be materially untrue. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>76 F.3d 82, 84 (5th Cir.1996). If the defendant fails to offer rebuttal evidence to refute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>information in the PSR, the sentencing court is free to adopt that information without further inquiry. <em>See United States v. Vital, </em>68 F.3d 114, 120 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The district court did <em>not </em>err in attributing the physical restraint of robbery victims at the casino to Vigers. The PSR provided: two of Vigers\u2019 co-conspirators remembered him being personally involved in the robbery; and victims of that robbery were physically restrained. Vigers offered no evidence to rebut the facts contained in the PSR. Moreover, because the robbery was within the scope of the conspiracy to which Vigers pleaded guilty, even if he did not personally restrain the victims, his co-conspirators physically restraining the victims could be attributed to him, as such action was foreseeable given the nature of the offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B) (in the case of a jointly-undertaken criminal activity, a defendant\u2019s offense level shall be determined based upon \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity\u201d); <em>United States v. Burton, </em>126 F.3d 666, 678 (5th Cir.1997). Accordingly, there was no error, plain or otherwise, with respect to the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Vigers\u2019 contention regarding the reasonableness of his sentences has <em>not </em>been adequately briefed and is, therefore, considered abandoned. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Thames, </em>214 F.3d 608, 612 n. 3 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b292-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
