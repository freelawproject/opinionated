Jackson also asserts that the district court should have considered that, although Jackson did violate the terms of his supervised release, he did not commit new substantive offenses. In addition, Jackson notes that his underlying violation for possession with intent to distribute cocaine base was his first offense; and he argues that alternative sanctions could have provided adequate punishment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">Jackson was sentenced for violating the terms of his supervised release after the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); so we review his sentence for reasonableness in the light of the factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). Under section 3553(a), a district court should consider, among other things, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for adequate deterrence and protection of the public, policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, provision for the medical and educational needs of the defendant, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">We conclude that Jackson\u2019s sentence was reasonable. His sentence was not above the statutory maximum of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Although Jackson\u2019s sentence exceeded significantly the advisory sentencing range set out in the Chapter 7 policy statements, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a), the district court was not required to sentence Jackson within that range. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>224 F.3d 1237, 1242 (11th Cir.2000) (explaining that a district court must consider, but is not bound by, the policy statements of Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines in imposing sentence upon revocation of supervised re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>lease). Even before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker, </em>when application of the sentencing ranges provided by the Guidelines was considered to be mandatory, the Chapter 7 policy statements on revocation of supervised release were non-binding recommendations. <em>See United States v. Hofierka, </em>83 F.3d 357, 361 (11th Cir.1996) (\u201c[T]he Chapter 7 sentencing range is a mere policy statement and not a guideline (in the sense of binding courts).... \u201d). Sentencing courts were \u2014 and are \u2014 required to consider these policy statements; but they are not bound to follow them. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">In addition, after Jackson admitted in 2003 to violating the terms of his supervised release \u2014 including by testing positive for marijuana use and failing to follow his probation officer\u2019s instructions \u2014 the district court gave Jackson another opportunity to comply with the terms of his supervised release, which Jackson failed to do. During Jackson\u2019s revocation hearings, the district court heard Jackson\u2019s arguments about his educational background and work history. In sentencing Jackson, the district court explained that it considered the Chapter 7 policy statements and determined that Jackson\u2019s advisory Guidelines range was inadequate. The district court also noted Jackson\u2019s ongoing substance abuse. The district court was not required to state on the record that it explicitly considered each of the section 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the section 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the section 3553(a) factors\u201d). Nothing in the record convinces us the sentence was unreasonable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b967-16\">. In July 2003, Jackson's probation officer alleged that Jackson violated the terms of his supervised release by (1) failing to report to the probation office as directed, (2) failing to submit a monthly report, (3) failing to follow the probation officer\u2019s instructions, including reporting to the Georgia Department of Labor and making job contacts, (4) failing to work regularly at a lawful occupation, (5) failing to notify the probation officer of a change in residence, (6) using a controlled substance because Jackson\u2019s urine specimen tested positive for marijuana use, and (7) failing to participate in an approved substance abuse treatment program. At a September 2003 revocation hearing, where Jackson admitted to violating the terms of his supervised release, the district court continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>Jackson\u2019s case for six months and explained to Jackson that he had to participate in drag testing and follow the instructions of his probation officer. In March 2004, Jackson\u2019s probation officer alleged that Jackson continued failing to (1) report to the probation office, (2) submit a monthly report, (3) follow the probation officer\u2019s instructions, including providing the probation office with weekly job contact sheets, and (4) work regularly at a lawful occupation. At his second revocation hearing, Jackson admitted to violating his supervised release conditions as alleged by the probation officer; and the district court sentenced Jackson to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b968-6\">. The parties do not dispute that the statutory maximum sentence in this case was 60 months\u2019 imprisonment, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3), or that the advisory sentencing range \u2014 provided by the policy statements from Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines \u2014 was three to nine months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a) (providing this sentencing range for Grade C supervised release violations and a criminal history category of I). Therefore, Jackson\u2019s 60-month sentence was above the Chapter 7 Guidelines range but did not exceed the statutory maximum. Although Jackson objected to the district court sentencing him outside of the Guidelines range, Jackson does not argue on appeal that the district court abused its discretion in sentencing him above the Chapter 7 Guidelines range; therefore, this argument is abandoned. <em>See United States v. Silva, </em>443 F.3d 795, 798 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining that we review the district court\u2019s decision to exceed the advisory Chapter 7 Guidelines range for abuse of discretion); <em>United States v. Ford, </em>270 F.3d 1346, 1347 (11th Cir.2001) (noting the \"well established rule ... that issues and contentions not timely raised in the briefs are deemed abandoned\u201d). We consider only Jackson\u2019s challenge to the reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b969-6\">. To the extent that Jackson argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the government\u2019s agreement with his 60-month sentence conflicts with the government\u2019s earlier decision \u2014 as part of Jackson\u2019s sentencing for his underlying offense \u2014 to file a motion for downward departure based on Jackson\u2019s substantial assistance, we reject this claim as without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
