California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Campino-Palacios\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED. Campino-Palacios\u2019s \u201cMotion to Continue and Preserve His Rights to Appeal and to Request the Court to Appoint a New Attorney to Continue his Appeal Process\u201d is DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-23\">Although we affirm Campino-Palacios\u2019s sentence, we note that his judgment contains a clerical error. The district court\u2019s written judgment, while correctly indicating that Campino-Palacios pled guilty to count two of the indictment, nevertheless described the offense of conviction as the possession with intent to distribute count, which was actually count one of the indict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>ment. Therefore, although we affirm Campino-Palacios\u2019s sentence, we VACATE and REMAND for the limited purpose of correcting the clerical error in his judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
