As the district court correctly concluded, Hammack does not meet the standard under <em>In re Jones, </em>226 F.3d 328, 333-34 (4th Cir.2000); thus, he was not entitled to proceed under \u00a7 2241.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm the denial of relief. Further, we grant Hammack leave to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal, but deny Hammack\u2019s pending motion for the appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b245-14\">The district court also construed the petition as a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), and dismissed it as successive. Because the district court did not have jurisdiction under \u00a7 2255 to consider the validity of Hammack\u2019s sentence on his convictions arising out of the Western District of Virginia, we decline to consider this case under \u00a7 2255.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
