Newsome was found to have violated conditions of his supervised release, the district court revoked his supervised release and sentenced him to twelve months and one day in prison. Newsome appealed. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">We review sentences imposed upon the revocation of supervised release to determine whether the sentence is \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>See United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433 (4th Cir.2006). Newsome\u2019s sentence was nearly nine months below the guidelines sentencing range of 21-24 months, and the court stated a proper basis for its conclusion that Newsome be sentenced to twelve months and one day of imprisonment. The court considered that Newsome was the primary caretaker for his teenage son, however, noted Newsome\u2019s repeated criminal conduct and his failure to notify his probation officer of being arrested. Because Newsome\u2019s sentence was neither procedurally nor substantively unreasonable, we find that his sentence is not plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s determination. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately set forth in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
