At resentencing,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the district court applied a two-level firearm enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), because Trammell\u2019s co-conspirators used firearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking conspiracy, and that use was reasonably foreseeable to Trammell. Subsequently, Trammell was released from prison and now is serving his term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-20\">Although Trammell contends in his brief that this case is moot, the government disagrees because the record contains no indication that the district court would necessarily deny a motion for early <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>termination of supervised release, if we determine in this appeal that Trammell\u2019s sentence was excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we agree with the government that the sentencing issue raised in Trammell\u2019s appeal is not moot because Trammell is still serving a term of supervised release, which the district court could modify or terminate if Trammell is successful in this appeal. <em>See Dawson v. Scott, </em>50 F.3d 884, 886 n. 2 (11th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Page, </em>69 F.3d 482, 487 n. 4 (11th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Castro-Rocha, </em>323 F.3d 846, 847 n. 1 (10th Cir.2003). Because we conclude that this case is not moot, we must address the merits of Trammell\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">\u201cThe district court\u2019s interpretation of the sentencing guidelines is subject to de novo review on appeal, while its factual findings must be accepted unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Jordi, </em>418 F.3d 1212, 1214 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 812, 163 L.Ed.2d 639 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">The record in this ease demonstrates that at resentencing, the district court agreed with the government\u2019s contention that co-conspirator McCauley\u2019s conviction for using and carrying a firearm during and in connection with a drug trafficking crime was sufficient to warrant the two-point enhancement against Trammel pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). Specifically, the district court found that the facts presented at trial met this court\u2019s requirements for the enhancement because (1) McCauley was a co-conspirator; (2) McCauley\u2019s possession of a firearm was in furtherance of the conspiracy; (3) Trammell was a member of the conspiracy at the time of possession; and (4) McCauley\u2019s possession was reasonably foreseeable by Trammell. <em>United States v. Trammell, </em>385 F.Supp.2d 1215, 1227-28 (M.D.Ala.2005) (citing <em>United States v. Gallo, </em>195 F.3d 1278, 1284 (11th Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-10\">We conclude from the record that Trammell has not presented any facts that could undermine the district court\u2019s finding that a preponderance of the evidence supported the enhancement, a factual finding that must be accepted unless clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Jordi, </em>418 F.3d at 1214. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b972-12\">. In an earlier appeal, we affirmed Trammell\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>United. States v. Trammell, </em>107 F.3d 23 (11th Cir.1997). In a subsequent section 2255 motion, however, Trammell successfully argued that his counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge on appeal the quantity of cocaine attributable to him at sentencing, and for failing to challenge the timeliness of the government\u2019s notice of its intent to rely upon prior felony drug convictions for enhancement purposes. As a result, Trammell\u2019s sentences as to the conspiracy and distribution counts (counts 1 and 24) were vacated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
