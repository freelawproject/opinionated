He has filed three motions to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, four habeas petitions under \u00a7 2241, and five applications under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b) for authorization to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion (C.A. Nos. 99-3080, 99-3854, 00-4343, 04-2718, 06-2046). On June 5, 2006, Herrold filed his current habeas action essentially asserting the same claims he put forth in the earlier \u00a7 2244 petition. On June 30, 2006, the district court dismissed Herrold\u2019s petition. Herrold filed a timely appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-24\">We agree that Herrold\u2019s petition merited a dismissal. A federal prisoner\u2019s challenge to the legality of his conviction and his sentence must usually be raised in a \u00a7 2255 motion, except where the remedy under \u00a7 2255 would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d and the prisoner can properly resort to a \u00a7 2241 challenge. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 \u00b6 5; <em>see also In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 249 (3d Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>230 F.3d 643, 648 (3d Cir.2000)(eiting <em>United States ex rel. Leguillou v. Davis, </em>212 F.2d 681, 684 (3d Cir.1954)). The exception identified in <em>In re Dorsainvil </em>is simply inapplicable to Herrold\u2019s claims, and he may not seek relief under \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-25\">Because Herrold\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition was properly dismissed and no substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>question is presented by this appeal, we will grant appellee\u2019s motion for summary affirmance and will affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>See </em>Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b172-20\">. In 1993, Herrold was sentenced in the Middle District of Pennsylvania to 331 months for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 924(e)(1), and 60-months to run consecutively for using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). This Court affirmed his conviction, C.A. No. 93-7097, and the Supreme Court denied certiorari.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b172-28\">. We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
