For the following reasons, we will likewise dismiss Agieri\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-23\">A specific account of the facts underlying Agieri\u2019s allegations \u2014 to the extent such facts can be divined from his complaint \u2014 is unnecessary. Put simply, Agi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>eri alleged impropriety on the part of Judge Thomas Vanaskie in connection with an alleged visit paid to Algieri\u2019s home by two U.S. Marshals. Our review shows that it is beyond question that Algieri\u2019s claims \u201crely on an \u2018indisputably meritless legal theory\u2019 or a \u2018clearly baseless\u2019 or \u2018fantastic or delusional\u2019 factual scenario.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Horn, </em>318 F.3d 523, 530 (3d Cir.2003) (citing <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 327-28, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989)). Thus, the district court\u2019s order dismissing the complaint was plainly correct. We also note, as evidenced by a cadre of exhibits attached to Algieri\u2019s complaint, that the complaint under review is just one in a series of similar ad hominem attacks directed at judges who fail to rule in Algieri\u2019s favor in various cases in which he is, or has been, involved. We will not facilitate the continuation of such conduct in this court. Given the above discussion, we agree with the district court that there was no need to provide Algieri an opportunity to further amend his complaint because any amendment would have ultimately proven futile. <em>See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 108 (3d Cir.2002) (noting that amendment \u201cmust be permitted ... unless it would be inequitable or futile\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Accordingly, this appeal will be dismissed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-24\">.
