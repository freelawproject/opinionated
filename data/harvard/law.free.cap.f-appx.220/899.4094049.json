Earl argues that the district court erred in finding he violated the terms of his supervised release because it lacked credible evidence to support its finding that he shot Eddie Savage. Earl also argues that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence by failing to consider the 18 U.S.C \u00a7 3553(a) factors. After reviewing the parties\u2019 arguments and the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-27\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b925-28\">On February 23, 2006, Earl began serving three years of supervised release for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>conviction for possession of an unregistered firearm. Among other things, the conditions of his release included that he neither (1) commit another crime, (2) illegally possess a controlled substance, nor (3) possess a firearm. On May 24, 2006, his probation officer filed a petition to revoke Earl\u2019s supervised release, alleging the violation of seven conditions. Following a revocation hearing, the district court found by an \u201coverwhelming preponderance\u201d that Earl had violated the conditions of his release by shooting Savage and testing positive for narcotics and alcohol. The district court noted that the statutory maximum was 24 months\u2019 imprisonment and the guideline range was 12 to 18 months. The government requested the statutory maximum, arguing that Earl shot Savage in retaliation, caused bodily injury, and violated all the conditions alleged in probation\u2019s petition. Earl offered no specific objections, he only submitted that \u201cwe respectfully disagree.\u201d Counsel however did attack Savage\u2019s credibility and argue for a sentence within the guidelines. The district court stated that a guideline sentence was insufficient and sentenced Earl to the statutory maximum, 24 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">II. Standards of Review</p>\n<p id=\"AWfd\">\u201cA district court\u2019s revocation of supervised release is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>26 F.3d 110, 112 (11th Cir.1994). However, we review for plain error those issues in which timely objections were not made in the district court. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). We review the district court\u2019s decision to exceed the advisory sentencing range in Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Silva, </em>443 F.3d 795, 798 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). We review the sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">Earl argues that the government failed to prove his violation of release conditions by a preponderance of evidence. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), the court may revoke supervised release if the court \u201cfinds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of [his] supervised release.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). The district court found that Earl violated his conditions by shooting Savage and using illicit drugs. The district court heard three witnesses, including Savage, link Earl to Savage\u2019s shooting. Earl now argues that one witness presented unreliable hearsay, however he did not object on this basis at the district court. Although the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply in supervised release revocation proceedings, defendants are entitled to certain minimal due process requirements, including the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses. <em>Frazier, </em>26 F.3d at 114. To admit hearsay, the district court must engage in a balancing test, and find that the hearsay is reliable. <em>Id. </em>In the present case, even assuming the district court erred by admitting hearsay, such an error was harmless. The government produced two other witnesses that linked Earl to Savage\u2019s shooting. Furthermore, the government also presented uncontested urinalysis test results to demonstrate Earl\u2019s repeated use of narcotics in violation of his release conditions, and the district court could revoke Earl\u2019s supervised release for violating any one condition. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion by revoking Earl\u2019s supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">Next, Earl argues that the district court\u2019s sentence was unreasonable because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>it failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. He further argues that the record demonstrates a sentence outside the guideline range was unreasonable. Reasonableness review is deferential, and Earl bears the burden of establishing the sentence is unreasonable in light of both the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). While the district was required to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it is not required to discuss them on the record. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). The district court did state that it considered the guideline range inadequate to impose punishment because of the \u201cdegree of danger and risk involved.\u201d It also discussed the nature of the violation, and stated the correct guideline range and statutory maximum. In addition, it heard the government arguments regarding the seriousness of the offense. So although the district court did not explicitly discuss each factor, the record does demonstrate a consideration of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Furthermore, \u201c[w]e have consistently held that the policy statements of chapter 7 are merely advisory ...\u201d <em>Silva, </em>443 F.3d at 799. These policy statements include the recommended ranges of imprisonment applicable upon revocation. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4. \u201cIt is enough that there is some indication that the district court was aware of and considered them.\u201d <em>United States v. Aguillard, 217 </em>F.3d 1319, 1320 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam). Here the district court stated the guideline range and gave reasons for rejecting it. Thus, given the violent and dangerous manner in which Earl violated his release and the evidence of multiple violations, the district court did not abuse its discretion in exceeding the guideline range and Earl has failed to establish that a 24-month sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in revoking Earl\u2019s supervised release or in exceeding the guideline range. Furthermore, the district court imposed a reasonable sentence. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
