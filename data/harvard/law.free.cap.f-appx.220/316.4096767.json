California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Landeros filed no response to his attorney\u2019s motion. Our independent review of the record and counsel\u2019s brief discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal except that the district court\u2019s written judgment fails to reflect the dismissal of count four (bringing an unauthorized alien to the United States for purpose of commercial advantage or private gain in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(2)(B)(ii)), which the district court dismissed on the Government\u2019s motion at Landeros\u2019s sentencing hearing. \u201c[A] simple remand to correct such clerical error is proper.\u201d <em>United States v. Powell, </em>354 F.3d 362, 372 (5th Cir.2003); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 36. Accordingly, we DENY counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw, but we pretermit further briefing, AFFIRM Landeros\u2019s conviction and sentence, and REMAND to the district court with an instruction to correct the judgment to reflect dismissal of count four against Landeros.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b343-10\">\u00ae Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
