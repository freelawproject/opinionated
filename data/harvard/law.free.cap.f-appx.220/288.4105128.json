He now appeals his 355-month sentence, arguing that the sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">The district court properly calculated Landry\u2019s advisory range of 235 to 293 months of imprisonment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(a)(2). The district court then upwardly departed two levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2, comment, (n.6) based on Landry\u2019s admission that he had inappropriately fondled a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">\u201cAn upward departure by a district court is not an abuse of discretion if the court\u2019s reasons for departing 1) advance the objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2) and 2) are justified by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2954, 165 L.Ed.2d 975 (2006). The upward departure meets those criteria. The extent of the departure, approximately 20 percent greater than Landry\u2019s 293 month guidelines maximum, is also reasonable. <em>See e.g., United States v. Smith, </em>417 F.3d 483, 492-93 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 713, 163 L.Ed.2d 543 (2005). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b315-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
