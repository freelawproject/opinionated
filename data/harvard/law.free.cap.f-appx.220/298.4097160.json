Rojas-Gines argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). His constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>AlmendarezTorres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Although Rojas-Gines contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.Bd 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Rojas-Gines properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here solely to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Rojas-Gines also argues that the written judgment of conviction does not accurately reflect the offense to which he pleaded guilty. As the Government concedes, the written judgment describes Rojas-Gines\u2019s offense as attempted reentry of a deported alien, but the record shows that RojasGines pleaded guilty to being an alien unlawfully found in the United States after deportation. This error is a clerical error subject to correction pursuant to Fed. R.Crim.P. 36. <em>See United States v. Sapp, </em>439 F.2d 817, 820 (5th Cir.1971). Accordingly, we affirm Rojas-Gines\u2019s conviction and sentence and remand this case to the district court for correction of the clerical error in the judgment pursuant to Rule 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">AFFIRMED; REMANDED FOR CORRECTION OF CLERICAL ERROR IN JUDGMENT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b324-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
