This court ordinarily declines to entertain original habeas corpus petitions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000), and this case provides no reason to depart from the general rule. Because the interests of justice would not be served by transferring a case that should be dismissed to the district court, we dismiss the petition. <em>Cf. </em>Fed. R.App. P. 22(a). Accordingly, we deny Carter\u2019s petition. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-14\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
