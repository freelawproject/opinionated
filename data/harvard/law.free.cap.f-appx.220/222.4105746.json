Miller\u2019s attorney filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but raising the issues of whether the district court erred in calculating the amount of loss, and whether the Government breached the plea agreement by failing to move for a downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-17\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s factual findings at sentencing for clear error, and its related legal conclusions, including the application of the Sentencing Guidelines, de novo. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir.1989). Here, the district court\u2019s calculation of loss is a factual determination reviewed for clear error. <em>See United States v. Brooks, </em>111 F.3d 365, 373 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-18\">At sentencing, the district court makes a \u201creasonable estimate of the loss, given the available information.\u201d <em>United States v. Miller, </em>316 F.3d 495, 503 (4th Cir.2003); USSG \u00a7 2B1.1, comment, (n.2 (Q). Enhancements under \u00a7 2B1.1 (b) are determined by the amount of loss suffered as a result of the fraud. The amount of loss is the greater of the actual loss or the intended loss. USSG \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.2(A)). \u201cIntended loss\u201d is defined as \u201cthe pecuniary harm that was intended to result from the offense ... and ... includes intended pecuniary harm that would have been impossible or unlikely to occur.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2B1.1, comment, (n. 2(A)(ii)). Consequently, the intended loss amount may be used, \u201ceven if this exceeds the amount of loss actually possible, or likely to occur, as a result of the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>316 F.3d at 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-19\">The district court made a reasonable determination regarding the amount of loss resulting from the conspiracy\u2019s scheme to fraudulently obtain artificially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>high mortgages for three pieces of real estate. These findings are well documented in the presentence report and Miller did not object to the amounts. Miller has not made an affirmative showing that the findings in the presentence report are unreliable or inaccurate. <em>See United States v. Randall, </em>171 F.3d 195, 210-11 (4th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Love, </em>134 F.3d 595, 606 (4th Cir.1998). Accordingly, the district court was entitled to adopt the presentence report as its own findings. <em>United States v. Terry, </em>916 F.2d 157, 162 (4th Cir.1990). Therefore, the district court did not err in calculating the amount of loss attributable to Miller, and thus did not commit clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Miller suggests that the Government breached the plea agreement by failing to move at sentencing for a downward departure, based upon Miller\u2019s cooperation. We review this claim for clear error. <em>United States v. Conner, </em>930 F.2d 1073, 1076-77 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Absent an express provision in a plea agreement, which is not present here, a criminal defendant does not have a constitutional right to a motion for downward departure pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5K1.1. <em>United States v. Francois, </em>889 F.2d 1341, 1344 (4th Cir.1989); <em>see United States v. Wallace, </em>22 F.3d 84, 87 (4th Cir.1994). Additionally, there was no evidence that the Government\u2019s refusal to make the motion was based upon an unconstitutional motive. <em>United States v. LeRose, </em>219 F.3d 335, 341-42 (4th Cir.2000) (citing <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992)). Therefore, no error resulted from the Government\u2019s failure to move for a reduction in Miller\u2019s sentence based upon substantial assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Miller\u2019s conviction and sentence. The court requires that counsel inform Miller, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Miller requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from further representation. Any such motion filed by counsel must state that a copy thereof was served on Miller. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
