On July 31, the district court sentenced appellant to prison for a term of seventy months. The sentence was at the low end of the Guidelines sentence range<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He now appeals his sentence, contending that his sentence is unreasonable because (1) the court should not have considered his arrest record in arriving at his criminal history category, and (2) it failed properly to consider the sentencing purposes set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We are not persuaded and, accordingly, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-20\">Appellant\u2019s first point is meritless; the district court did not consider appellant\u2019s arrest record in determining his criminal history category. The court did refer to appellant\u2019s arrest record but only in commenting on the fact that \u201cnothing seem[ed] to get [appellant\u2019s] attention.\u201d As for appellant\u2019s second point, the record indicates that the court fully considered several of the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing purposes in fashioning the sentence, including: the nature of the offense; appellant\u2019s history and characteristics; the need for the sentence imposed; the kinds of sentences available; and the Guidelines sentence range. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(4); <em>see United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1357 (11th Cir.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>2006). In addition, the court properly rejected appellant\u2019s argument that a lower sentence should be imposed based on the sentencing disparity created by the existence of fast-track programs in other federal judicial districts. <em>See United States v. Arevalo-Juarez, </em>464 F.3d 1246, 1251 (11th Cir.2006); \u00a7 3553(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b962-15\">. The sentence range prescribed by the Guidelines for appellant\u2019s offense and appellant\u2019s criminal history category of V called for a sentence of imprisonment of between 70 to 87 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
