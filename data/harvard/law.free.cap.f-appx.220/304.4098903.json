Involved were a physician, several pharmacists, and numerous associates. Craft\u2019s appeal of his conviction focuses entirely on the contention that his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination \u2014 specifically, his right not to testify and not to have the jury infer anything negative therefrom \u2014 were violated when one among numerous cooperating government witnesses answered a question posed on cross examination in a way that could have been taken by the jury as implicating Craft\u2019s eventual failure to testify. Further, the asking of that question by defense counsel and counsel\u2019s failure to object and to seek a mistrial following the witness\u2019s response underpin Craft\u2019s second claim on appeal, ineffective assistance of counsel. Concluding that the witness\u2019s re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>sponse to defense counsel\u2019s question on cross examination, in context and in light of the totality of the circumstances of the trial and all the evidence, does not rise to the level of reversible error or constitute actionable ineffective assistance of counsel, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">I. Facts and Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">After Craft was successful in obtaining a trial severance, his case was heard by a jury. The trial lasted seven days, during which the government adduced massive documentary and testimonial evidence of the multi-year prescription drug conspiracy and Craft\u2019s substantial role in it, viz., obtaining large numbers of bogus prescriptions, purchasing the controlled substances prescribed from co-conspirator pharmacists, and distributing huge quantities through illicit sales to his \u201ccustomers.\u201d In the course of the government\u2019s case, the prosecution adduced extensive testimony from, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) Callie Herpin, M.D., the principal physician in the conspiracy, who testified that Craft was among the largest purchasers of fraudulent prescriptions written by her; (2) Etta Mae Williams, Dr. Herpin\u2019s office manager, who also testified about Craft\u2019s role as a substantial purchaser of prescriptions written by Dr. Herpin; and (3) Darryl Armstrong, a pharmacist who testified about filling Herpin\u2019s prescriptions for Craft and about Craft\u2019s interaction with Armstrong and others. It suffices that the combined testimony of Herpin, Williams, and Armstrong \u2014 augmented by considerable documentary evidence and testimony from other witnesses \u2014 constructed a case against Craft that is only trivialized by referring to it as overwhelming.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">It is against that backdrop and context that Craft complains about the answer given by Armstrong to a question posed by Craft\u2019s attorney during cross examination. In an apparent effort either to impeach Armstrong or weaken the probative value of his adverse testimony \u2014 or possibly set the stage for favorable testimony by subsequent witnesses \u2014 Craft\u2019s counsel posed the following questions and Armstrong provided the following answers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">Q. So \u2014 and wouldn\u2019t you agree with me that the only person that could corroborate what you said about these conversations with John Wiley and Paul Henry and Mr. Craft is you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-9\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-10\">Q. No?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-11\">A. Mr. Craft could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-12\">Q. Mr. Craft and who else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-13\">A. John Wiley, Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-14\">Q. John Wiley. And how about Paul Henry?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-15\">A. Paul Henry, yes, Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-16\">Q. So they would be good witnesses, wouldn\u2019t they, to what they saw and heard; right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-17\">A. Yes. All three of them, yes, Sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-18\">Even though Mr. Armstrong\u2019s answers do not expressly or directly comment on the defendant\u2019s eventual failure to testify, and contain no pejorative comment about that, there is no question that, given Mr. Armstrong\u2019s identification of Mr. Craft as one who could corroborate or dispute the conversation at issue and Mr. Craft\u2019s ultimate failure to take the stand, this was at least implicitly a comment on such failure. And we speculate that, given a chance, defense counsel, with hindsight, would likely rephrase the question in a way that only Mr. Wiley and Mr. Henry \u2014 and not Mr. Craft \u2014 could be identified by Armstrong as potential corroborators.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-19\">In that context we further observe that counsel\u2019s question and Armstrong\u2019s response occurred in the course of a lengthy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>and continuing cross examination. Counsel\u2019s failure to object likely served to downplay any untoward implication from Craft\u2019s eventual failure to take the stand. Likewise, counsel\u2019s continuing the flow of questioning without objecting to Armstrong\u2019s answer, and following it with references to Wiley and Henry, likely minimized any possible negative effect, and possibly prevented recognition by the jury of the implication of Craft\u2019s remaining silent. Thus, among other things, counsel\u2019s failing to object and proceeding without interruption could well have been an intentional tactic to keep any effect of Armstrong\u2019s answer below the jury\u2019s radar.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Furthermore, the able and experienced district judge who conducted the trial correctly instructed the jury, at the end of trial and thus well after Armstrong\u2019s response, that \u201cno inference whatsoever may be drawn from the election of a defendant not to testify.\u201d And, finally, the absence of objection establishes our standard of review on appeal as plain error; not only that, but also \u201cinvited error\u201d inasmuch as the inference in Armstrong\u2019s answer was in response to a question posed by defense counsel. We review invited error for manifest injustice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Similarly, when we review for plain error, we must find that there is an error that is plain and obvious and that affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, even when we find these elements present, we do not exercise our discretion to correct such error unless it \u201cseriously affectfs] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">Having carefully reviewed the trial record in this case, particularly the exchange between Armstrong and defense counsel, the instructions to the jury, and all the testimony and documentary evidence adduced by the government, we are satisfied beyond cavil that any implication conceivably recognized by the jury regarding Craft\u2019s failure to testify is <em>de minimis </em>in the absolute, and completely harmless in the context of all the facts and circumstances. The incident complained of does not approach the level of manifest injustice. Any possible effect that Armstrong\u2019s answer could have had on the jury, which observed the demeanor of all the government\u2019s witnesses, heard all that they had to say, and weighed all the evidence against Craft, eschews any possibility of contributing to the guilty verdict in any meaningful way. In sum, the error complained of by Craft constitutes no reversible error, whether plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-13\">As noted, Craft also asks us to reverse his conviction and grant a new trial on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. And, also as noted, his assertion is grounded in (1) the question his defense counsel posed to Armstrong, which opened the door and invited Armstrong to identify Craft as one who could\u2014 but ultimately did not \u2014 corroborate the discussions at issue, and (2) counsel\u2019s failure to object to that answer and seek a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-14\">As the government has acknowledged in its brief on appeal, we seldom \u201centertain ineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct appeal when they have not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>raised before the trial court, as the trial court is the proper place to develop the record necessary for their resolution.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nevertheless, Craft\u2019s claim on appeal that his counsel was thus ineffective places this case in the small minority of those in which such a claim may be disposed of on direct appeal without requiring that it be considered first by the district court or await habeas review.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">We consider claims of ineffective representation of counsel, in violation of the Sixth Amendment under the oft-repeated rubric of <em>Strickland v. Washington</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em>: </em>The complaining defendant has the burden of proving both prongs of the <em>Strickland </em>test, viz., (1) that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient when measured against the level of performance expected of competent criminal defense counsel, and (2) that the deficiency was so extreme as to produce prejudice and thereby deprive the defendant of a fair trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Not only must Craft overcome the <em>Strickland </em>presumption that his attorney performed within a broad range of reasonable assistance, but he must also show a reasonable probability that \u201cbut for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Based on essentially the same considerations that led us to determine that counsel\u2019s question and Armstrong\u2019s response did not rise to the level of manifest injustice or seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of these proceedings, we also reject Craft\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. As the two-pronged test of <em>Strickland </em>is conjunctive, Craft\u2019s failure to bear his burden on either prong is fatal. In the interest of brevity, therefore, we assume without granting that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and proceed to test such presumed deficiency for prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">At the risk of redundancy, we reiterate that in Armstrong\u2019s response to counsel\u2019s question, who could corroborate Armstrong\u2019s testimony about certain conversations, he identified Craft as one who could. In an obvious effort to minimize any possible damage from the implications of that unexpected response, counsel moved right along and elicited names of two others who could so testify. Counsel\u2019s election to refrain from objecting contemporaneously avoided highlighting and overemphasizing possible implications of Armstrong\u2019s answer in the Fifth Amendment context; and the district court\u2019s instructions at the end of the trial, remote as it was from Armstrong\u2019s testimony, left the jury with the rule fresh in mind that no inference could be made from Craft\u2019s failure to testify. Although the unfortunate answer on cross produced error <em>vel non, </em>the enormity of the prosecution\u2019s case against Craft bars any possible conclusion of prejudice. Even if we were to assume that the jury was able to connect the dots, recognize that Armstrong\u2019s response to counsel\u2019s question somehow implicated Craft\u2019s ultimate failure to take the stand, <em>and </em>read anything negative into that, it would have so paled in comparison to the overwhelming evidence against Craft as to be insusceptible of rising to the level of <em>Strickland </em>prejudice. This plenteous record eon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>vinces us that Craft was not prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">We hold that any inferences the jury might have drawn from Armstrong\u2019s response to counsel\u2019s question fall far short of manifest injustice and could not have seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of Craft\u2019s trial. Neither was his attorney\u2019s performance prejudicial to Craft in the sense of <em>Strickland </em>and thus did not deprive him of his Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel. We reject Craft\u2019s contentions that the implied comment of Armstrong\u2019s response on the failure to testify or his lawyer\u2019s failure to object and seek a mistrial entitle him to a reversal of his conviction and a new trial. Accordingly, Craft\u2019s conviction and sentence are, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b331-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
