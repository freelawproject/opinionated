To the extent that Kong seeks to appeal the Board\u2019s refusal to exercise its authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte, we lack jurisdiction to review this decision. <em>See Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 518 (2d Cir.2006) (collecting cases). As to Kong\u2019s claim that the Board abused its discretion in denying the motion to reopen because of changed circumstances, we have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2006); <em>Stewart v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 587, 595 (4th Cir.1999). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-19\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
