Cowger, Michael Gill, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Northern District of Texas, Dallas, TX, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b319-17\">Obriant Webb, Seagoville, TX, pro se.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b319-19\">Before SMITH, WIENER, and OWEN, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b319-20\">PER CURIAM: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b319-21\">Obriant Webb, appearing <em>pro se, </em>appeals his conviction of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. Webb first contends that the district court lacked jurisdiction, asserting that the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas is not an Article III district court created by Congress; that Texas is not a State of the United States; that the indictment was not signed by the clerk of court attesting to its return in open court; that he was not arrested within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States; and that his Fourth Amendment and Fifth Amendment rights were violated by the purported lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-22\">Webb\u2019s jurisdictional arguments are frivolous. United States district courts have jurisdiction over federal offenses, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231; the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas is a district court of the United States, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 124, 132; and Texas is plainly a state of the United States within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States, see <em>United States v. 1,078.27 Acres of Land, </em>446 F.2d 1030, 1039 (5th Cir.1971). Webb\u2019s contentions based on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 23 are without merit. As for the indictment, the ree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>ord plainly shows that it was signed by the clerk of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Webb\u2019s additional assertions that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 535 limits the federal investigatory power to offenses by federal employees, and that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 883 requires an administrative hearing before referral of a drug offense for prosecution, are based on misreadings of the plain language of those statutes, both of which use the permissive word \u201cmay.\u201d Their provisions are not mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">We reject Webb\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Given the frivolous nature of Webb\u2019s arguments, counsel\u2019s failure to make those arguments did not constitute ineffective assistance. <em>See United States v. Kimler, </em>167 F.3d 889, 893 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Clark v. Collins, </em>19 F.3d 959, 966 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Because Webb\u2019s appeal presents no legal points arguable on their merits, it is frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, we grant the government\u2019s motion for summary dismissal, and we dismiss the appeal as frivolous. The government\u2019s alternative requests for summary affirmance and an extension of time to file a brief are denied as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">MOTION FOR SUMMARY DISMISSAL GRANTED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; ALTERNATIVE REQUESTS FOR SUMMARY AFFIR-MANCE AND EXTENSION OF TIME DENIED AS UNNECESSARY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b319-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
