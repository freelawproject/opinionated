Because it was filed more than 10 days after the entry of judgment, the \u201cMotion for Rule 60 Reconsideration of Dismissal\u201d was essentially a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion for relief from judgment. <em>See Harcon Barge Co. v. D &amp; G Boat Rentals, Inc., </em>784 F.2d 665, 667 (5th Cir.1986) (en banc). Also, because Hummel filed his motion more than 10 days after the May 20, 2005, entry of the judgment of dismissal, his notice of appeal is effective only as to the denial of the rule 60 motion, and the underlying judgment is not before this court. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), 4(a)(4)(A); <em>Ed</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number><em>wards v. City of Houston, </em>78 F.3d 983, 995 (5th Cir.l996)(en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">A Rule 60 motion is not a substitute for appeal from the underlying judgment. <em>Travelers Ins. Co. v. Liljeberg Enter., Inc., </em>38 F.3d 1404, 1408 (5th Cir.1994). Denial of a rule 60(b) motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>It is not enough that the granting of relief might have been permissible, or even warranted. \u201c[D\u2019Jenial must have been so unwarranted as to constitute an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Seven Elves, Inc. v. Eskenazi, </em>635 F.2d 396, 402 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Hummel has not remotely made such a showing in his appellate briefs. His appeal is wholly without merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Accordingly, his appeal is DISMISSED. The dismissal of the instant appeal as frivolous and the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint for failure to state a claim each count as a \u201cstrike\u201d under the three-strikes provision of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Hummel is thus cautioned that, once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b327-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
