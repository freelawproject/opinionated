She contends she did not validly waive her right to a jury trial, despite that she executed a waiver in accordance with Fed. R.Crim. P. 23(a) and makes no claim of prejudice. By executing the waiver, and absent a claim of prejudice, she is presumed validly to have waived her right to a jury trial. <em>See United States v. Tobias, </em>662 F.2d 381, 387 (5th Cir.1981). Moreover, Rule 23 \u201cis a formulation of the constitutional guaranty of trial by jury,\u201d and its waiver provision \u201cembodies existing practice, the constitutionality of which has been upheld.\u201d Fed. R.Crim. P. 23(a) advisory committee\u2019s notes (1944). Madden therefore shows no constitutional or other reversible error in connection with her waiver of a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Madden contends that the warrant-less search of her vehicle was not supported by probable cause because the informant who led police to her was not shown to be reliable. The informant identified Madden by name and by photograph, and he provided credible and detailed information about her, including her history of selling methamphetamine to him, where she lived, her father\u2019s place of business, and what vehicles she drove. As police observed, the informant initiated two telephone conversations with Madden to arrange to buy methamphetamine from her. Police corroborated information about her vehicle, and the informant accurately predicted her arrival at the set location in the vehicle she was driving. Under the totality of the circumstances, the information given by the informant provided probable cause to stop and search Madden\u2019s vehicle. <em>See United States v. Delano, </em>912 F.2d 766, 767-68 (5th Cir.1990) (finding probable cause on similar information); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>792 F.2d 536, 539 (5th Cir.1986) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">Madden contends that her admission to police that there was methamphetamine in her vehicle should not have been admitted, because it was either the fruit of an illegal stop or obtained in violation of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Because the information provided by the informant established probable cause or at least reasonable suspicion for the stop, Madden\u2019s admission was not the fruit of an illegal stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">Madden\u2019s statement was not obtained in violation of <em>Miranda. </em>Police had only just stopped her at the meeting site, and a detective had explained that police were conducting a drug investigation and had reason to believe she possessed methamphetamine, when she blurted out that there was methamphetamine in a bag inside her vehicle. She was not in custody. <em>See United States v. Bengivenga, </em>845 F.2d 593, 596 (5th Cir.1988) (en banc). <em>Miranda </em>therefore did not apply. <em>See United States v. Courtney, </em>463 F.3d 333, 336 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">In addition, Madden was not being interrogated. Nothing in the record suggests that the officers expected her to blurt out that she was carrying illegal drugs before being arrested, Mirandized, or questioned further. <em>See Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980); <em>United States v. Saveli, </em>546 F.2d 43, 46 (5th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">Madden contends that the district court should have departed downward to cancel out her two-level sentence increase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>based on the crime\u2019s proximity to two schools and a playground. She argues that police entrapped her into appearing at that location. To the extent this is a legal question concerning the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n. 14), we have jurisdiction to review the decision. Note 14 to \u00a7 2D1.1 does not apply because, by its own terms, note 14 provides for a potential downward departure \u201cin a reverse sting (an operation in which a government agent sells or negotiates to sell a controlled substance to a defendant). \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n. 14).\u201d This was not a reverse sting, because the government was not acting as the seller. Moreover, the evidence shows no sentence entrapment, but rather that the site for the meeting was chosen by Madden and the informant, without police input, because it was convenient for Madden.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b317-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
