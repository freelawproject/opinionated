After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">Fajardo was the captain of a \u201cgo-fast\u201d boat that departed Columbia with 2,272 kilograms of cocaine and was spotted and boarded by the United States Coast Guard. Fajardo pled guilty to the two offenses mentioned above.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">Fajardo\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) recommended a base offense level of 38, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l), because his offenses involved 150 kilograms or more of cocaine. The PSI also recommended a two-level increase, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c), because Fajardo was the captain of the vessel; a two-level \u201csafety-valve\u201d reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(7); and a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, resulting in a total offense level of 35. With a level 35 and a criminal history category of I, the PSI recommended an advisory guidelines range of 168 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment. Fajardo made no objections to the PSI\u2019s guidelines calculations or to the facts of his offense conduct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b948-10\">At the sentencing hearing, Fajardo argued for a sentence below the advisory guidelines range, noting that he was a low-level operator, had no ownership interest in the drugs, was impoverished and had undertaken the mission in order to support his children. The district court noted that among the many Colombian defendants sentenced, poverty was a uniform factor, but that the damage caused by cocaine use in the United States could not be ignored. The district court noted the significant amount of drugs involved and that, had the guidelines not capped the base offense level at' 150 kilograms of cocaine, Fajardo might have faced a much higher imprisonment range, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-11\">I think it is for our purposes here adequate to say that ... at least one reasonable sentence is that one within the guidelines. I might point out that if my recollection is correct that the guidelines stop counting at 150 kilograms. Not that weight is the only factor, or even the most important one, but if you made some projections outward as to what a ton or two of cocaine might justify if 150 kilograms justifies what it justifies, Mr. Fajardo is not so bad off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-12\">I realize that is not the only or dispositive consideration, but, as I have said elsewhere again, I am not sure anybody actually \u2014 that Congress [in] enacting the statute, or the Sentencing Commission in promulgating its matrix, considered the punishment for a ton or two of high purity cocaine. It is probably fortunate for the defendant that they didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-13\">I am satisfied that the guidelines sentence here is responsive as any other sentence to the factors arrayed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b949-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>Fajardo argued that the Sentencing Commission had considered whether to add higher offense levels for higher quantities of cocaine, had chosen not to and, accordingly, the district court should not extrapolate in that direction. In response, the district court stated that it was not extrapolating, would not extrapolate and that \u201c[i]t was quite much the point that [an extrapolation] was not forthcoming.\u201d The district court noted that there were many factors that would pull in both directions in a case like this one and that the quantity of drugs was one that would pull upward if applied, but that the district court was not applying it. <em>As </em>other factors, the district court again noted both the need for Fajardo to support his children and the effects of cocaine on children in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">Considering the advisory guidelines and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a) factors, the district court sentenced Fajardo to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment, at the low end of the advisory guidelines range. Fajardo filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">On appeal, Fajardo argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court considered an impermissible factor, namely what Fajardo\u2019s guidelines range would have been had the Sentencing Commission included additional offense levels for cocaine quantities above 150 kilograms.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court, in determining a reasonable sentence, must correctly calculate the advisory guidelines range and then consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We review a defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence for reasonableness in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[A] sentence can be unreasonable, regardless of length, if the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence was substantially affected by its consideration of impermissible factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1361 (11th Cir.2006) (footnote omitted). \u201c[T]he party challenging the sentence bears the initial burden of establishing that the district court considered an impermissible factor at sentencing.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">Fajardo fails to meet this initial burden. The district court did mention that Fajardo could be considered fortunate because the highest offense level under the guidelines was for 150 kilograms of cocaine, while Fajardo was responsible for 2,272 kilograms of cocaine. However, the severity of the offense is a permissible \u00a7 3553(a) factor. In any event, the district court stated explicitly that it was not \u201cextrapolating\u201d from Fajardo\u2019s excess drug quantity in arriving at Fajardo\u2019s sentence. As the district court also noted, it is plainly evident that the district court did not increase Fajardo\u2019s sentence based on the excess cocaine involved in his offense because Fajardo\u2019s sentence was not only within, but at the low end of, the advisory guidelines range. Therefore, the factor Fajardo claims is impermissible and requires reversal in fact was not considered by the district court in determining Fajardo\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-12\">Alternatively, Fajardo argues that, even if the district court did not consider an impermissible factor, the length of his sentence is unreasonable. We review the reasonableness of the length of a sentence \u201cin light of the facts and circumstances of the defendant\u2019s case reflecting the sentencing considerations in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>at 1363. Because the weight accorded the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is committed to the sound discretion of the district court, our review is deferential and we \u201cwill not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, \u201cwe will remand for resentencing if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">Here, we cannot say that Fajardo has shown that his 168-month sentence is unreasonable. The district court noted that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the advisory guidelines range. The district court also considered Fajardo\u2019s arguments in mitigation, including his poverty, his family obligations and his role in the conspiracy. On appeal, Fajardo emphasizes that his codefendants were sentenced to lesser imprisonment terms. However, Fajardo is not similarly situated to his codefendants because he was the captain of the go-fast boat. Under the facts and circumstances presented, we are not left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in sentencing Fajardo to a 168-month sentence, at the low end of the advisory guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b948-8\">.
