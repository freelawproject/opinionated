Defendants Howe and Bodenschatz are defaulted, and these appellants filed pleas of non-assumpsit and non-joint liability, duly verified. The plaintiff without objection testified that she deposited with Arnold Bros., Baker &amp; Co. the amount written in ink in a pass-book which she produced and offered in evidence. The entries in this book show a credit to plaintiff of $720.12, and that the deposits were to draw four per cent interest, compounded semi-annually, and that these deposits were made and received subject to the following, among other conditions, viz.:</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b665-7\" pgmap=\"665\">\u201cWe may allow moneys to be withdrawn or paid on account of savings deposits at any time during business' hours. But, because it is necessary to loan out our funds to enable us to pay interest, and as time to get in the same may sometimes be desirable, we therefore reserve the right, and make it a condition on all savings deposits, to demand and have sixty days previous notice in writing as a condition of payment on all sums exceeding one hundred dollars, and thirty days notice on smaller sums, whenever, in our opinion, the same may be deemed advisable; and all savings deposits shall be made and received subject to these conditions.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b665-8\" pgmap=\"665(29) 666(93)\">The record shows that at the time the bank failed, in August, 1896, appellee \u201casked\u201d for the money deposited by her, but never received it. This suit was commenced December 9, 1&amp;96. The existence of the partnership between the defendants was shown. The jury returned a verdict for plaintiff for $751. Appellants moved to set aside the verdict and for a new trial, but their motion was overruled and judgment entered on the verdict. There were no objections or exceptions taken to any of the proceedings prior to the overruling of the said motion, and the only question that can arise on this appeal is the correctness of the action of the court in denying that motion and entering judgment.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b666-5\" pgmap=\"666\">Eschenburg &amp; Whitfield and Samson &amp; Wilcox, attorneys for appellants.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b666-6\" pgmap=\"666\">Henry H.

By it the bankers \u201c reserve the right * * * to demand and have sixty days previous notice, in writing * * * whenever, in our (the bankers) opinion the same may be deemed advisable.\u201d There is no testimony tending to show that appellants\u2019 firm, or any one for it, exercised this reserved right and demanded the specified notice or deemed it advisable so to do. The giving of sixty days notice by the depositor was not a necessary prerequisite or condition of payment unless or until the bank exercised its reserved right to, and did, demand such notice. Hot having done so, the claim of appellee was due at any time. This suit was not prematurely brought.</p> <p id=\"b666-10\" pgmap=\"666\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
