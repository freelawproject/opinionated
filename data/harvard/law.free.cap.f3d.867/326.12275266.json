(the \u201cPension Fund\u201d), violated the anti-cutback provisions of the' Employee Retirement Income Security Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cERISA\u201d). We conclude that the amendment did ' not violate ERISA\u2019s anti-cutback rule, and we therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">The facts are largely undisputed and are summarized here in the light most favorable to Morrone.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">Morrone is a stagehand and a member of Local One of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (the \u201cUnion\u201d). He participates in a \u201cdefined benefit plan\u201d (the \u201cPlan\u201d), <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(35), offered by the Pension Fund and is thus a \u201cparticipant\u201d in the parlance of ERISA, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(7). From 1970 until 1996, Morrone earned benefits under the Plan; in 1997, he stopped working Union jobs and therefore stopped earning benefits; and in 2012, he resumed earning benefits when he returned to Union work. The principal question presented is whether a 1999 amendment to the Plan violated ERISA\u2019s anti-cutback rule,. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1064(g), which prohibits a pension fund from reducing or. eliminating certain earned benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-15\">* Among other benefits, the Plan provides participants with a \u201cNormal Pension\u201d\u2014a monthly benefit, payable beginning at age sixty-five. The Normal Pension is based on two related concepts: pension credits and accrual rates. Under the Plan, 'a participant accrues a \u201cpension credit\u201d for each calendar year in which he earns a minimum threshold amount of income from \u201cCovered Employment,\u201d <em>ie,, </em>qualifying work for an employer who is covered by the Union\u2019s collective bargaining agreements and who contributes to the Plan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Plan\u2019s Board of Trustees (the \u201cBoard\u201d) sets an \u201caccrual rate\u201d for each pension credit, expressed in terms of dollars per month. Not-all pension credits are assigned the same accrual rate. Typically, the Board sets accrual rates for pension credits earned in more recent years higher than those earned in earlier years. Furthermore, when the Plan\u2019s investments perform well the Board occasionally exercises its discretion to raise retroactively the accrual rates for past years of pension credit. The monthly amount of a participant\u2019s Normal Pension is the sum of the products of each pension credit and its corresponding accrual rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-16\">To illustrate, take a hypothetical case where a participant earned pension credits from 1988 until 2013 and then retired. Under the most recent version of the Plan, pension credits earned from 1961 to 1990 have an accrual rate of $75 per month apd pension credits earned from 1991 to 2014 have an accrual rate of $100 per month. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Accordingly, upon retirement, such a hypothetical participant\u2019s monthly benefit would be $2,525\u2014comprised of three pension credits (for Covered Employment from 1988 to 1990) at $75 per month plus twenty-three pension credits (for Covered Employment from 1991 to and including 2013) at $100 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">The example presumes that the participant is entitled to <em>current </em>accrual rates for all of the pension credits that he earned from 1988 to 2013. This is because in the hypothetical the participant left Covered Employment just once (upon retirement) and, under the terms of the Plan, unless an exception applies, a participant is entitled to the accrual rates \u201cin effect at the time [he] ultimately separates from Covered Employment.\u201d J. App. 413. Morrone calls this feature of the Plan a \u201cliving pension.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Of course, stagehands like Morrone often leave and then later return to Covered Employment. This practice led to the possibility that a participant could leave Covered Employment, wait until the Board retroactively increased accrual rates, and then return to Covered Employment for just a year to qualify for the higher rates. And so the Plan included rules governing how a participant could bridge a hiatus in Covered Employment and reactivate his living pension. The crux of the parties\u2019 dispute here is whether Morrone may do so under the rule in effect when he first left Covered Employment in 1996 or whether he must satisfy a stricter rule under a 1999 amendment to the Plan. The two rules are discussed, in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Before 1994, the Plan contained the so-called \u201cParity Rule.\u201d That rule provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">If a Participant does not earn [pension credit] based upon Covered Employment in two or more consecutive calendar years (the \u201chiatus period\u201d) and thereafter retires without having resumed work in Covered Employment and earning at least as many years of [pension credit] after such resumption as the number of consecutive years in such hiatus period, the amount of benefit to which such Participant will be entitled will be based upon the monthly benefit accrual rate in force immediately prior to the start of such hiatus period but subject to the minimum pension benefit amount in force on the effective date of the award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">J. App. 285. Simply put, under the Parity Rule a worker with a break in Covered Employment of two or more years in length could bridge that gap and reactivate his living pension as to pension credits earned before the break by working in Covered Employment for at least as many years after the break as the length of the break itself. For example, a worker who takes a three-year hiatus could reactivate the living pension by returning to Covered Employment for three years. A worker who, like Morrone, takes a fifteen-year hiatus would have to return to Covered Employment for fifteen years to reactivate the living pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">In 1994, the Plan was amended to include the so-called \u201cFive Year Rule.\u201d That rule provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-11\">A Participant who returns to Covered Employment [after a hiatus] and earns at least five consecutive years of [pension credit] shall be entitled to a pension amount determined under the terms of the Plan and benefit levels in effect at the time the Participant ultimately separates from Covered Employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">J. App. 413. Under the Five Year Rule, .a worker who takes a three-year hiatus must return to Covered Employment for five years to reactivate the living pension for pension credits earned pre-hiatus. Likewise, a worker who, like Morrone, takes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>fifteen-year hiatus must return to Covered Employment for just five years to do so (as opposed to fifteen years under the Parity Rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">As noted, Morrone accrued pension credits under the Plan from 1970 until 1996 and then went on a fifteen-year hiatus. When Morrone left Covered Employment in 1996, the operative version of the Plan contained the Five Year Rule; the accrual rate for the pension credits earned from 1970 to 1990 was $50 per month; and the accrual rate for the pension credits earned from 1991 to 1996 was $70 per month. By amendment dated January 1, 1999 (the \u201c1999 Amendment\u201d), the Plan removed the Five Year Rule and reinstated the Parity Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Morrone returned to Covered Employment in 2012, and, by then, the Board had raised accrual rates for pension credits earned from 1970 to 1990 to $75 per month and for pension credits earned since 1990 to $100 per month. On January 14, 2013, Morrone wrote the Plan director to request an estimate of the monthly benefits he would receive should he retire in 2017. After a protracted back and forth with the director not relevant to this appeal, the estimate Morrone received applied the Parity Rule: Pension credits that he earned from 1970 to 1990 were assigned a $50 per month accrual rate (the rate in effect in 1996, when he began his hiatus); those earned from 1991 to 1996 were valued at $70 per month (also the 1996 rate); and those earned since 2012 were valued at $100 per month (the current rate), for a total monthly benefit of $1,770.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The director determined that because Morrone had taken a fifteen-year hiatus and would have returned to Covered Employment for only six years as of 2017, he was not entitled to the current accrual rate for the pension credits he earned before his hiatus.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">Morrone filed an appeal with the Board, seeking current accrual rates for all of his pension credits arid not just those he earned since returning to Covered Employment in 2012. The difference is indeed material. Applying the Five Year Rule would give Morrone an extra $705 per month or $8,460 per year above the estimate provided by the Plan director. The Board denied Morrone\u2019s appeal and his subsequent request to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">On October 14, 2014, having exhausted his administrative remedies, Morrone filed this action below against the Pension Fund, seeking declaratory relief to clarify his rights to future pension benefits under ERISA. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) (providing that a civil action may be brought by a participant \u201cto clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan\u201d). Specifically, Morrone alleged that the 1999 Amendment reinstating the Parity Rule was an illegal reduction of accrued benefits or retirement-type subsidies under ERISA\u2019s \u201canti-cutback rule.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1054(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on April 24, 2015. On February 10, 2016, the district court granted the Pension Fund\u2019s motion and denied Morrone\u2019s motion. It concluded that \u201cthe 1999 [Ajmendment did not reduce \u2018a retirement-type subsidy ... with respect to benefits attributable to service before the amendment,\u2019 \u201d as prohibited by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1054(g), \u201cbecause the benefits Morrone contests are attributable to service <em>after </em>the amendment.\u201d <em>Morrone v. Pension Fund of Local No. 1, I.A.T.S.E., </em>No. 14 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Civ. 8197, 2016 WL 554844, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 10, 2016). Moreover, the district court held that the 1999 Amendment also did not decrease an \u201caccrued benefit\u201d because it merely \u201cmodified the conditions under which Morrone could accrue additional benefits in the future; it did not modify the benefits Morrone had already accrued in the past.\u201d <em>Id, </em>Accordingly, the district court entered judgment in favor of the Pension Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The questions presented are whether, by removing the Five Year Rule and reinstating the Parity Rule, the 1999 Amendment impermissibly reduced (1) an \u201caccrued benefit\u201d or (2) a \u201cretirement-type subsidy,\u201d in violation of ERISA\u2019s anti-cutback provision. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1054(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">I.

ERISA\u2019s Anti-Cutback Rule</p>\n<p id=\"A84\">ERISA was enacted \u201cto ensure that employees will not be left empty-handed once employers have guaranteed them certain benefits.\u201d <em>Lockheed Corp. v. Spink, </em>517 U.S. 882, 887, 116 S.Ct. 1783, 135 L.Ed.2d 153 (1996). Its purpose is to \u201cmak[e] sure that .if a -worker, has been promised a defined pension benefit upon retirement\u2014and if he has fulfilled whatever conditions are required to obtain a vested benefit\u2014he , actually will receive it.\u201d <em>Nachman Corp. v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., </em>446 U.S. 359, 375, 100 S.Ct. 1723, 64 L.Ed.2d 354 (1980). The statute\u2019s so-called \u201cqnti-cutback rule\u201d is \u201ccrucial\u201d to this purpose. <em>Cen. Laborers\u2019 Pension Fund v. Heinz, </em>541 U.S. 739, 744, 124 S.Ct. 2230, 159 L.Ed.2d 46 (2004). In fact, Congress amended the ,rule with the Retirement Equity Act of 1984 to clarify that it protects accrued benefits, as well as early retirement benefits, retirement-type subsidies, and optional forms of benefits. <em>See id. </em>at 744,124 S.Ct. 2230; 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1054(g)(1)-(2). As amended, the anti-cutback rule provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-11\">(g) Decrease of accrued benefits through amendment of plan</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6NW\">(1) The accrued benefit of a participant under a plan may not be decreased by an amendment of the plan [except in certain circumstances not present here].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-14\">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), a plan amendment which has the effect of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-15\">(A) eliminating or reducing an early retirement benefit or a retirement-type subsidy (as defined- in regular tions), or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATI\">(B) eliminating an optional form of benefit,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-18\">with respect to benefits attributable to service before the amendment shall be treated as reducing accrued benefits. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>In the case of a retirement-type subsidy, the preceding sentence shall apply only with respect to a participant who satisfies, (either before or after the amendment) the preamendment conditions for the subsidy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1054(g)(l)-(2). Examining the statute\u2019s text reveals that the anti-cutback rule has two important features.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">First, the rule principally protects those benefits that a participant has earned, rather than those that he might earn in the future. <em>See Heinz, </em>541'U.S. at 747, 124 S.Ct. 2230 (\u201cSo far as the IRS regulations [that interpret \u00a7 1054(g) ] are concerned ... the \u25a0 anti-cutback provision flatly prohibits plans from attaching new conditions to benefits that an employee has <em>already earned.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). This is because, except for \u201cthe case of a retirement-type subsidy\u201d (which we will discuss below), the plain text of the statute prohibits only an amendment which (1) decreases an <em>\u201caccrued </em>benefit\u201d or (2) \u201celiminat[es] or reduc[es] an early retirement benefit ... or ... an optional form of benefit ... with respect to benefits attributable to service <em>before the amendment.\u201d </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1054(g)(l)-(2) (emphases added). Accordingly, save changes that impact retirement-type subsidies, \u201cemployers are perfectly free to modify the deal they are offering their employees, as long as the change goes to the terms of compensation for continued, <em>future </em>employment.\u201d <em>Heinz, </em>541 U.S. at 747, 124 S.Ct. 2230 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Second, the rule privileges substance over form. <em>See id. </em>at 744-45, 124 S.Ct. 2230. Again, the plain text of the statute focuses on \u201cthe <em>effect </em>of\u2019 a plan amendment, <em>ie., </em>whether it decreases, eliminates, or reduces benefits or subsidies. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1054(g)(2) (emphasis added). This focus on the \u201ceffect\" of plan amendments means that a court must consider whether, \u201cin any practical sense, [the] change of terms could [ ] be viewed as shrinking the value of [a participant\u2019s] p\u00e9rision rights and reducing his promised benefits.\u201d <em>Heinz, </em>541 U.S. at 745,124'S.Ct. 2230. For example, in <em>Central Laborers\u2019 Pension Fund v. Heinz, </em>the Supreme Court rejected any formal distinction between, on the one hand, \u201cplacing materially greater restrictions on the receipt of [a] benefit,\u201d and on the other, \u201ca decrease in the size of the monthly benefit payment\u201d itself because, \u201cas a matter of common sense, a participant\u2019s benefits cannot be understood -without reference to the conditions imposed on receiving those benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 744, 124 S.Ct. 2230 (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). At bottom, \u201c[t]he real question is whether ... at the moment the new [amendment] is imposed, the accrued benefit [or retirement-type subsidy] becomes less valuable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 746, 124 S.Ct. 2230.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">II. Application</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">With these principles in mind, we turn to Morrone\u2019s arguments on appeal that the 1999 Amendment violated the anti-cutback rule. We consider whether the- 1999 Amendment decreased, first, Morrone\u2019s accrued benefits, and, second, a retirement-type subsidy. .</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">A. Accrued Benefits</p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">Morrone argues that the 1999 Amendment impermissibly reduced his accrued benefits. First, he contends that applying the Parity Rule instead of the Five Year Rule plainly decreased his accrued benefits because it reduced the- accrual, rates for the pension- credits he earned from 1970 to 1996. Second, he avers that the \u201cright\u201d to reactivate the living pension feature under the Five Year Rule is <em>itself </em>a benefit that he accrued by working in Covered Employment from 1994 to 1996, when the Five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Year Rule was in effect. Both of these arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Morrone\u2019s first argument is inconsistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s instruction in <em>Heinz </em>that, \u201c[i]n a given case,\u201d a court must evaluate the effect of a plan amendment \u201cat the moment the new condition is imposed.\u201d 541 U.S. at 746, 124 S.Ct. 2230. As noted above, Morrone accrued pension credits by earning the requisite amount of income from Covered Employment in each year from 1970 to 1996. It is therefore undisputed that, in 1999, when the Plan was amended, he was entitled to receive pension benefits based on his service from 1970 to 1996\u2014those pension credits were unquestionably an \u201caccrued\u201d portion of Morrone\u2019s benefit. The parties dispute what accrual rates Morrone was entitled to receive for these accrued pension credits. Under Morrone\u2019s interpretation,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the terms of the Plan before the 1999 Amendment provided that the \u201cpension to which a Participant is entitled shall be determined under the terms of the Plan and [the accrual rates] in effect at the time the Participant separates from Covered Employment,\u201d ie., in 1996, unless he satisfies the Five Year Rule, in which case he \u201cshall be entitled to ... [the accrual rates] in effect at the time [he] ultimately separates from Covered Employment,\u201d ie., in 2017. J. App. 413 (Article II, Section 16).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Morrone separated from Covered Employment in 1996. In 1999, when the Plan was amended, Morrone had neither returned to Covered Employment, nor had he earned at least five consecutive years of pension credit thereafter. As a result, he was entitled to the accrual rates in effect in 1996, when he separated from Covered Employment and began his fifteen-year hiatus. In other words, in 1999, even under the version of the Plan that Morrone prefers\u2014the one containing the Five Year Rule\u2014Morrone had earned only the accrual rates in effect in 1996. Thus, in accordance with <em>Heinz, </em>the 1999 Amendment did not violate the anti-cutback rule because Morrone\u2019s \u201caccrued benefit [did not] become[] less valuable\u201d \u201cat the moment the [1999 Amendment was] imposed.\u201d 541 U.S. at 746, 124 S.Ct. 2230. Indeed, Mor-rone will receive exactly the benefits he was entitled to receive under the pre-1999 Amendment-version of the Plan, namely, the accrual rates in effect in 1996 for the pension credits he earned from 1970 to 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Morrone\u2019s second argument is that the \u201cright\u201d to reactivate his living pension under the Five Year Rule is <em>itself </em>a benefit that he accrued by working in Covered Employment from 1994 to 1996. This argument is belied by the text of the statute. As is relevant to this appeal, ERISA provides that \u201c[t]he term \u2019accrued benefit\u2019 means ... in the case of a defined benefit plan, the individual\u2019s accrued benefit [1] determined under the plan and ... [2] expressed in the form of an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(23)(A). Morrone fails to show how his purported \u201cright\u201d under the Five Year Rule satisfies either prong of this definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">As to the first prong, the Supreme Court has noted that ERISA \u201crather circularly defines \u2018accrued benefit\u2019 as \u2018the individual\u2019s accrued benefit determined under the plan.\u2019\u201d <em>Heinz, </em>541 U.S. at 744, 124 S.Ct. 2230 (quoting 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(23)(A)). Faced with this circularity in <em>Heinz, </em>the Supreme Court examined the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>terms of the plan before it to determine if a benefit was impermissibly reduced in violation of the anti-cutback rule. <em>See id. </em>at 744-45, 124 S.Ct. 2230. Likewise, the Sixth Circuit has \u201cpostulated that rather than give a comprehensive definition of \u2018accrued benefits,\u2019 Congress chose to leave the responsibility of delineating the bounds of the term to \u2018the employer and the employee through the agreed-upon <em>terms </em>of the plan document.\u2019 \u201d <em>Deschamps v. Bridgestone Ams., Inc. Salaried Emps. Ret. Plan, </em>840 F.3d 267, 279-80 (6th Cir. 2016) (quoting <em>Thornton v. Graphic Commc\u2019ns Conf. of the Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters Supplemental Ret. &amp; Disability Fund, </em>566 F.3d 597, 608 (6th Cir. 2009)). In light of this delegation of responsibility, the Sixth Circuit reasoned that it should \u201clook to the terms of the Plan in ascertaining which, if any, benefits ... accrued prior to the [challenged] amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 280. Accordingly, we do the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Here, the version of the Plan in effect before the 1999 Amendment does not define the term \u201caccrued benefit.\u201d But it does provide that the \u201cterm \u2018Pension Credit\u2019 shall mean the years of [pension credit] for service in Covered Employment which are accumulated and maintained for Employees in accordance with the provisions of Article III of this Pension Plan.\u201d J, App. 395. Article III, in turn, articulates the rules governing the accrual of pension credits, vesting rights, breaks in service, and other events that impact a participant\u2019s status under the Plan, including hiatuses from Covered Employment. Moreover, as noted previously, the Plan states that a participant\u2019s monthly Normal Pension benefit is the sum of the products of each pension credit and its corresponding accrual rate. None of these provisions, however, supports Morrone\u2019s contention that the ability to qualify for current accrual rates under the Five Year Rule <em>or </em>the Parity Rule constitutes a \u201cbenefit\u201d that he accrues under the Plan. Rather, we agree with the district court that the Five Year Rule and the Parity Rule are <em>\u201cconditions </em>under which Morrone could accrue <em>additional </em>benefits in the future\u201d; they are riot \u201caccrued benefits\u201d themselves. <em>Mor-rone, </em>2016 WL 554844, at *2.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">As to the second prong, the statute defines \u201caccrued benefit\u201d in part as one capable of being \u201cexpressed in the form of an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(23)(A). Indeed, ERISA\u2019s benefit accrual requirements provide that an \u201caccrued benefit under a defined benefit plan must be valued in terms of the annuity that it will yield at normal retirement age.\u201d <em>Esden v. Bank of Boston, </em>229 F.3d 154, 163 (2d Cir. 2000) (construing 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1054(c)(3)). Morrone has made no attempt to show that his \u201cright\u201d to reactivate his living pension under the Five Year Rule or the Parity Rule is capable of being valued in that way. And we are doubtful that he could make such a showing, which would require speculative assumptions about, <em>inter alia, </em>the likelihood that the Board would raise accrual rates in the future, the amount of any such increase, the years of pension credit to which the increases would redound, and the likelihood that any given participant would accrue the requisite years of pension credit after his hiatus. In other words, we reject Morrone\u2019s contention \u201cthat we should take a broad view of accrued benefits that would include a <em>right </em>to have his benefit calculated as if\u2019 the Five Year Rule were still in effect. <em>Arndt v. Sec. Bank S.S.B. Emps. Pension Plan, </em>182 F.3d 538, 541 (7th Cir. 1999) (rejecting a similar argument with respect to disability benefits).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">For these reasons, we conclude that, even if the Plan conferred on participants a \u201cright\u201d to reactivate the \u201cliving pension\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>feature after a hiatus in Covered Employment, such right, does not constitute an \u201caccrued benefit\u201d as that term is defined in ERISA. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(23)(A). Accordingly, the 1999 Amendment did not violate \u00a7 1054(g)(1) of the anti-cutback rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">B. Retirement-Type Subsidy</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Morrone next argues that the higher accrual rates, he seeks constitute a \u201cretirement-type subsidy\u201d and, consequently, he should be permitted to satisfy \u201cthe pream-endment conditions for the subsidy,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1054(g)(2), by earning five pension credits under the Five Year Rule rather than the fifteen required by the Parity Rule. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The anti-cutback rule protects retirement-type subsidies \u201conly with respect to a participant who satisfies (either before or after the amendment) the preamendment conditions for the subsidy.\u201d <em>Id, </em>We have read this \u201cprovision as straightforwardly applying to participants ... who qualified for the subsidy before the [challenged] amendment or who could do so afterwards\u201d under the terms of the plan before the amendment. <em>Alcantara v. Bakery &amp; Confectionery Union &amp; Indus. Int\u2019l Pension Fund Pension Plan, </em>751 F.3d 71, 77 (2d Cir. 2014). Furthermore, because \u201can amendment placing materially greater restrictions on the receipt of [a] benefit reduces the benefit just as surely as a decrease in the size of the monthly benefit payment,\u201d <em>Heinz, </em>541 U.S. at 744, 124 S.Ct, 2230 (internal quotation marks omitted), the Plan may not lawfully apply the Parity Rule in place of the Five Year Rule if the higher accrual rates that Mor-rone seeks constitute a \u201cretirement-type subsidy,\u201d <em>see, </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1054(g)(2). We conclude they do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">ERISA does not define \u201cretirement-type subsidy.\u201d Instead, Congress delegated authority to the Treasury Department to define .the term. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1054(g)(2) (prohibiting \u201ca. plan ame.ndment which has the effect of ... eliminating or reducing ... a retirement-type subsidy <em>(as defined in regulations)\u201d </em>(emphasis added)); <em>Bellas v. CBS, Inc., </em>221 F.3d 517, ;524 (3d Cir. 2000) (\u201cCongress contemplated that the Treasury Department would promulgate regulations setting forth the definition of retirement-type subsidy.\u201d). The Treasury Department did not exercise that authority until 2005 when, acting through the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), it promulgated- regulations defining \u201cretirement-type subsidy.\u201d <em>See </em>Section 411(d)(6) Protected Benefits, 70 Fed. Reg. 47,109 (Aug. 12, 2005). By their terms, those IRS regulations apply to plan amendments adopted on or after August 12, 2005 and thus do not apply to the 1999 Amendment, <em>See </em>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.411(d)\u20143(j) (2016). Nonetheless, both Morrone and the Pension Fund rely on the regulations as persuasive authority and therefore we consider them here. The regulations define \u201cretirement-type subsidy\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-9\">The term <em>retirement-type subsidy </em>means the <em>excess, </em>if any, of the actuarial present value of a retirement-type benefit over the actuarial present value of the accrued benefit commencing at normal retirement age or at actual commencement date, if later, with both such actuarial present values determined as of the date the retiremenNtype benefit commences. Examples of retirement-type subsidies include a subsidized early retirement benefit and a subsidized qualified joint and survivor annuity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.411(d)-3(g)(6)(iv) (first emphasis in original and second emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">A fundamental concept encompassed by this definition is that a retirement-type subsidy is an \"amount <em>in addition to. </em>or <em>in excess of </em>a participant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>normal retirement benefit. In that regard, the regulation accords with the ordinary meaning of the word \u201csubsidy\u201d as used in this context, ie., \u201ca payment of an amount <em>in excess of </em>the usual charge for a service.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged </em>2279 (1968) (emphasis added). It also comports with relevant legislative history. In describing the scope of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1064(g)(2), the Senate Report on the bill that would become the Retirement Equity Act of 1984 makes clear'that a \u201cbenefit subsidy\u201d is <em>\u201cthe excess of </em>the value of a benefit over the actuarial equivalent of the normal retirement benefit.\u201d S. Rep. No. 98-575, at 28 (1984) (emphasis added). Decisions of our sister circuits are also in accord. For example, the Third Circuit has \u201cdefined a retirement-type subsidy to be <em>the excess in value of </em>a benefit over the actuarial equivalent of the normal retirement benefit.\u201d <em>Bellas, </em>221 F.3d at 525 (emphasis added). In sum, the ordinary meaning of the word \u201csubsidy,\u201d the legislative history, existing case law, and IRS regulations lead us to conclude that an essential characteristic of a retirement-type subsidy is that it is an amount in excess of a participant\u2019s normal retirement benefit. Accordingly, if the higher accrual rates that Morrone seeks are not in excess of or in addition to his normal retirement benefit, then they are not a \u201cretirement-type subsidy\u201d ' protected by \u00a7 1054(g)(2) of the anti-cutback rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Turning to the text of the Plan, we conclude that, even under Morrone\u2019s preferred interpretation, the higher accrual rates that he seeks would constitute his normal retirement benefit and not an amount in excess of it. Therefore, those higher accrual rates are not a retirement-type subsidy. To recap, Article II, Section 16, entitled \u201cApplication of Benefit Increases,\u201d provides that \u201c[tjhe pension to which a Participant is entitled, shall be determined under the terms of the Plan and benefit levels in effect at the time the Participant separates from Covered Employment.\u201d J. App. 413. Article III, Section 11, entitled \u201cProtracted Absence of Participant from Covered Employment,\u201d contains the Parity Rule: A worker with a hiatus in Covered Employment of two or more years in length is entitled to \u201cthe monthly benefit accrual rate in force immediately prior to the start of\u2019 .the hiatus, unless he returns , to Covered Employment for at least as many years as the length of the hiatus itself. J. App. 431. Morrone argues, however, that the Five Year Rule is a \u201cpreamendment condition\u201d to his receipt of the higher accrual rates in effect when he plans to retire in 2017, and thus he should be permitted to qualify for those higher rates under the Five Year Rule in accordance with 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1054(g)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Morrone is correct that the accrual rates he seeks via application of the Five Year Rule are greater than, those he is entitled to receive under the Parity Rule. But those higher accrual rates are not an amount <em>in excess of </em>his normal retirement benefit. Under the terms of the Plan, they <em>would constitute </em>his normal retirement benefit if he satisfied the Plan\u2019s conditions for receiving, them. That is because,' regardless of whether the Five Year Rule or the Parity Rule applies, the Plan states that \u201cthe monthly amount of [Morrone\u2019s] Normal Pension will be determined by\u201d calculating the sum of the products of each pension credit he earned- and its corresponding accrual rate, as determined in accordance with the text of the Plan. J. App. 401; <em>see also </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(22) (defining \u201cnormal retirement benefit,\u201d in relevant part, as \u201cthe benefit under the plan commencing at .normal retirement age\u201d). Accordingly, the 1999 Amendment did not place greater restrictions on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>receipt of a retirement-type subsidy. Instead, it merely changed the conditions under which Morrone could earn a larger normal retirement benefit in the future. Thus, the 1999 Amendment is not prohibited by \u00a7 1054(g)(2) of the anti-cutback rule because it does not reduce a retirement-type subsidy.</p>\n<p id=\"pApY\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Congress enacted robust protections for pensioners by expanding the anti-cutback rule in 1984. The rule specifically protects pensioners\u2019 accrued benefits, early retirement benefits, retirement-type subsidies, and optional forms of benefits. But, contrary to Morrone\u2019s arguments on appeal, the anti-cutback rule does not command that a pensioner\u2019s benefits be determined under the version of the plan that is most generous to him. Employers remain \u201cperfectly free to modify the deal they are offering their employees, as long as the change goes to the terms of compensation for continued, future employment.\u201d <em>Heinz, </em>541 U.S. at 747, 124 S.Ct. 2230. That is exactly what happened in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">To summarize, we conclude that the 1999 Amendment did not decrease Mor-rone\u2019s accrued benefits. Moreover, the higher benefit accrual rates that Morrone demands are not a \u201cretirement-type subsidy\u201d\u2014rather, they would constitute his normal retirement benefit if he satisfied the conditions to receiving them, namely, the Parity Rule. Accordingly, we conclude that the 1999 Amendment did not violate ERISA\u2019s anti-cutback rule, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1054(g). We have considered Morrone\u2019s remaining arguments and conclude they are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">We therefore AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b355-7\">. The estimate presumed Morrone would earn pension credits through the year 2014, rather than 2017.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b358-6\">. The Pension Fund offers a conflicting interpretation of the preamendment version of the Plan, arguing that, even if the Five Year Rule applies, it does not benefit Morrone. But we need not reach this argument because, as we shall see, even if Morrone\u2019s interpretation is correct, there was no reduction of his accrued benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
