This cause was at issue and depositions had been taken on both sides under commissions returnable to the March Term, 1819. The depositions were returned and published, within six days next before the Term. The Chancellor, in consequence of sickness, did not attend at that Term, and the cause was continued to the ensuing July Term. At the July Term, a petition verified by affidavit was presented on behalf of the complainant, by Mr. Cooper, his solicitor, setting forth that the petitioner \u201c had several \u201c material witnesses (as he was advised and verily believed) \u201c to examine in the cause, whose testimony he had dis- \u201c covered since the last Term, and without the benefit of \u201c whose testimony he could not safely proceed to a hear- \u201c ing.\u201d He, therefore, prayed leave to make a further examination of witnesses, on the interrogatories before filed in the cause.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b80-11\"><em>T. Clayton </em>and <em>Robinson, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Au\">Rust objected, upon the ground that the petitioner had not sworn that <em>neither he nor his </em>solicitor, had seen, read or knew the contents of the depositions taken in the cause.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number><em>Cooper, </em>for the complainant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkV\">said, that when the depositions were published, prior to the last Term, they knew nothing of the testimony which the complainant has since discovered, and that even if the Chancellor had been here at the last term, this motion could not have been made. That he (the solicitor) had read the depositions but had taken no note or abstract of them.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b81-5\"><em>Robinson </em>said, that he had an abstract of the depositions.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b81-6\">Ridgely, Chancellor.</author>\n<p id=\"Aeh\">According to our Terms and mode of doing business, the English rules do not always apply or suit us. But even in England this matter seems to be discretionary. Here, if the party cannot have an examination of these witnesses, injustice may be done; for, if he did not know of, and had not discovered,this testimony before publication, he could not have made the affidavit; but the discovery being made since the last Term and after the publication, it is now the first opportunity that he has to apply. However, the affidavit states nothing respecting the complainant\u2019s or his counsel\u2019s knowledge of the depositions ; and, therefore, it is not sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Afterwards, the complainant filed an affidavit, in which he said that he had not \u201cseen, heard, or read the depositions \u201c taken in the cause, nor is he informed of the contents \u201c thereof.\u201d Mr. Cooper, the counsel, swore that he \u201c had \u201c read the depositions buthad not any copies of them.\u201d The chancellor held this affidavit not sufficient; that it should state that he had not taken any notes or abstracts of them, nor any copies.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
