Pending this action, on the 17th of April 1797, an agreement was entered into and filed in the suit, between Luke Shields, the surviving administrator of Luke Shields,deceased, Fretwell M. W right, one of the executors of P. F.

T. 1809, when Peery, one of the referees, being dead, three new referees were agreed upon in writing filed in the suit. These referees afterwards met, and in Nov. 1816, made a report awarding a balance of $802.06 as due to Shields\u2019 administrators; but this award was set aside for an informality, and no further proceeding was had at law. It appears that Peter F. Wright, the sheriff, by whom Little\u2019s real estate had been sold, being under the impres.sion that Henry Neill was bound under the agreement first above stated for the whole of the Shields judgment, had suffered the balance of the proceeds to go into the hands of the subsequent judgment creditors, Thos. and S. R. Fisher and Warder &amp; Co. Luke Shields\u2019 administrators were not parties to the agreement and knew nothing of it until its existence was disclosed, pending their action against the sheriff\u2019s executors. Under these circumstances, they abandoned the action at law, and filed this bill in equity for a discovery and for a decree charging Neill as trustee of the lands purchased by him to the amount due on their judgment, pursuant to his agreement with the subsequent judgment creditors and with John Little\u2019s executor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-5\">The defence taken by the answer of Henry Neill\u2019s executor was, that it was the true object and construction of the agreement,that Neill should purchase the land agreed for, and, after paying his judgment, should apply the balance to that of Shields, it being then not doubted that the land would be bid up to a figure sufficient to cover both these judgments; that an agreement to apply to the Shields judgment more than the balance of the purchase money would have been without consideration ; that Shields' administrators were not joined in the agreement, for the reason that they were to be left free to collect any deficiency upon their judgment after applying the balance of purchase money; and that in accordance with this view of the arrangement, Neill had, on receiving his deed,given to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>the sheriff his note for the balance of the purchase money, the \u00a371. 2. 4-1-.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-5\">Henry Fisher, whose administrator, d. b. n.,was made a party defendant in this cause, was one of the original administrators of John Little, deceased.

Further, Neill never agreed to pay the whole of Shields\u2019 debt. The note given by him to the sheriff (for \u00a372. 2. 4\u00bd) corresponds with the balance of the purchase money, and shows that Neill\u2019s liability was limited to this balance. But again, there was no privity between Neill and the administrators of Shields. They are strangers to the contract. They paid no consideration and have no interest in it. Their interest is in the balance of the money arising from the sales, after satisfying Neill\u2019s judgment, and their remedy is against the sheriff\u2019s executors.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b50-7\">Ridgely, Chancellor</author>\n<p id=\"AFq\">upon examination, at some length, of the agreement of February 1\u00d3, 1787, concluded that Neill was bound by it to pay the whole debt' of Shields ; and proceeding to consider whether the administrators had, in equity, any remedy under the agreement against Neill\u2019s executor, the Chancellor said :</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">The defendant, Shankland, contends that the administrator of Shields, and that Wright, the sheriff, were not parties to the agreement of 10th of February 1787; and, therefore, that there is no privity between the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>plain ant and the defendant; and, consequently, that the complainant cannot prosecute this suit on the said agreement against Neill\u2019s representative; that if the complain ant.had any cause of action, it was against Wright, the sheriff, and his executors, for the money levied under the <em>Venditioni Exponas, </em>upon which the land was sold; and that his remedy was at law, both according to the rules of the common law, and the provision of the Act of the Genera] Assembly entitled \u201c An act for establishing Courts of Law and Equity within this Government.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">That Shields\u2019 representatives had a remedy at law against the sheriff for the balance of the sales of the land of John Little, after the payment of Neill\u2019s judgment, is too plain a proposition to be denied. Neill bad recovered the first judgment, Shields\u2019 administrators the second; and consequently after the payment of Neill, the whole real estate of John Little was bound for this judgment of Shields\u2019 administrators. And at law, the Sheriff was liable for having applied any part of the purchase money arising from Little\u2019s real estate to the Messrs. Fisher or to Warden, in preference to Shields\u2019 administrators; but it would be monstrous in a court of equity to allow Neill to make such a defence in violation of his agreement of February 1787; and that too, after he has received the full benefit of that agreement. What would be the consequence ? It would be this\u2014Shields administrators must sue the sheriff; the sheriff must sue the Messrs. Fisher; and they must enforce at law the agreement of 1787 against Neill. Thus, a circuity of action must be produced, and justice could not be done. Such a course would be manifestly unjust; because,as nothing could be recovered at law, more than the nominal sums given for the several parcels of the land, the full amount of Shields\u2019 judgment, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Heill agreed to pay, and which was part of the consideration for the five hundred acres of land, would be fraudulently withheld by Heill. He would thus take advantage of his own wrong; and that too, after he had agreed to be purchaser and had substituted himself as paymaster for the full amount, instead of the sheriff, to Shields\u2019 administrators. How,the truequestion is,whether Shields\u2019 administrators, not being parties to the agreement of 1787, can compel Heill, or his representative, to execute that agreement. At law, it is certain that they cannot, because they were not parties to the contract; and if equity will not afford a remedy, their case is hopeless.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">In speaking of privity, it may be necessary to take a very slight view of Hses at Common Law, as connected with this subject. To the execution of a Use two things were absolutely necessary,\u2014confidence in the person and privity of estate. All who came in, in privity of estate, <em>or with notice, </em>or without consideration, are bound by it. And in 1 <em>Co. Rep. </em>122. <em>b., </em>it is said that although a stranger purchased land from a feoffee to uses <em>for a valuable consideration, </em>yet <em>if he had notice </em>of the former uses, he would be compelled to execute them. According to 2 <em>Com. Dig. Title Chancery, </em>627. (4. c) ; <em>Title Notice </em>(4. <em>c. </em>1), notice of a trust makes a person privy; as, a person with notice of a trust, judgment,mortgage or other incumbrance, shall be affected by it. Sec. 1 <em>Eq. Ca. Ab. </em>332 : 2 <em>Com. Dig. </em>627, 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">How, it is evident that Heill had complete notice of this judgment of Shield\u2019s administrators; that he engaged to pay it; that he purchased the land subject to this judgment : and that the advantage or convenience which he derived from being allowed to purchase as he did was a sufficient consideration in equity. The question then occurs, whether Shields\u2019 administrators have any remedy in equity. The counsel for the complainant cited the case of <em>Dutton vs. Dutton, </em>2 <em>Eq. Ca. Ab. </em>739. <em>p. </em>4. There, D, having more than \u00a33,000 per annum, married M, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>plaintiff, who had \u00a310,000 portion, and settled \u00a31,000 per annum upon her for her jointure ; and the greatest part of D\u2019s estate was settled upon the first and every other son in tail-male successively,as is usual in marriage settlements. D, ran greatly in debt, and J, his eldest son, being of full age, D, on calculating his debts and estate, agreed with J to convey all his estate to him, and J covenanted to pay all D\u2019s debts and allow him \u00a3500, per annum as a rent charge for his life ; and further (upon which the question arose) <em>thatJ should, indemnify D from, all his debts, and from the charges and expenses for the maintenance of the said, M, she being then separated by consent. </em>M brought a bill against D and J, to have an allowance for her maintenance, &amp;c., Lord Chancellor Cowper ordered M to be allowed \u00a3200 per annum. He said that by this covenant to indemnify D from maintaining M, his wife, J had taken upon himself the charge of maintaining her, and, as to this purpose, stands in D\u2019s place, who is bound to give his wife an allowance, if he voluntarily separates from her; and he said that he took J in this case to be in the nature of a trustee for the wife, so far as a reasonable allowance for her maintenance was concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">It is not easy to distinguish, in principle, the difference between the right of the wife in this \"case of <em>Dutton vs. Dutton, </em>and the right of Shields\u2019 administrators to sue in equity. In both cases the covenantors made an engagement for the benefit of a person not a party to the covenant, and as they both received a sufficient consideration it is quite as reasonable that ifeill should be considered in the nature of a trustee for Shields\u2019 administrators, so far as to pay the judgment, as that J should be a trustee for the maintenance of the wife. The counsel for the complainant cited also <em>Lechmere vs. Carlisle </em>3 <em>P. Wms. </em>211, to this effect, that every <em>cestui que trust, </em>whether a volunteer or not, or be the limitation under which he claims with or without a consideration, is entitled to the aid of a court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>equity,to avail himself of the benefit of a trust, (p. 222;) and that the forbearance of the trustees shall not prejudice him, (p. 215.) In these cases the principle seems to be fully established, that the person for whose benefit a trust is created may compel the performance, although he may be no party to the contract. It is to be observed that Shields\u2019 administrators were not mere volunteers. They had a lien,prior to Neill\u2019s engagement,on the land of John Little, which Neill, for his own accommodation, agreed to satisfy. I might refer to cases of marriage <em>settlements,'\u2014Osgood vs. Strode. </em>2 P. <em>Wms. </em>245 : <em>Vernon vs. </em>Vernon, 2 P. <em>Wms. </em>594 : <em>Goring vs. Nash, 8 Atk. </em>186,\u2014where persons, not parties to the articles and from whom no consideration flowed, were permitted to enforce their specific execution. It is true, the principles of these cases do not strictly apply to this ; but they prove that equity will not compel a person to sue upon a covenant, in the name of trustees, when circuity of action may be prevented, and when equity can afford a more adequate remedy to the person for whose benefit the covenant was made, by his suing in his own name ; and that it is not an objection that the party claiming under a covenant is a volunteer, and that the consideration did not move from him, if the party making the articles had a sufficient consideration. In the Supreme Court of the United States, 5 <em>Cranch, </em>322, <em>Riddle Co., vs. Mandeville and Jameson, </em>it was decided that equity will decree the payment to be <em>immediately m&amp;de </em>by the person <em>ultimately </em>responsible, <em>to the person who is actually entitled, to receive the money. </em>That was a suit brought in equity by the holder of a promissory note, to recover its amount against a remote endorser. In a suit between the same parties, that Court had previously determined that the plaintiff was without remedy at law. Although there were some particular circumstances in that case, yet the' Court, in the opinion delivered by Chief Justice Marshall, laid down the law broadly, that equity will make that party <em>immediately </em>liable, who is <em>ultimately </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number><em>liable at law. </em>There, as well as in this case, the plaintiff had no remedy at law. This doctrine is confirmed in a subsequent case in the same court, 7 <em>Cranch, </em>69, <em>Russel vs. Clark's Executors, </em>as well as the doctrine that notice of a trust makes theperson having such notice a trustee. The latter point is first mentioned by the Court (p. 97) thus; \u201c it also \u201c appears, that in September 1796, Robert Murray &amp; Co., \u201c assigned to Loomis and Tillinghurst certain personalities \u201c in trust. This assignment was surrendered to Clark \u201c (the plaintiff) and Nightingale (his deceased partner) \u201c in consideration of notes to a large amount, in which \u201c Loomis and Tillinghurst were bound for Robert Murray \u201c &amp; Co. It appears that Clark and Nightingale <em>are other- </em>\u201c <em>wise secured with respect to these notes. </em>At least, there is \u201c reason to believe that they are secure. Clark and Night- \u201c ingale having taken this assignment, with notice of the <em>\u201c </em>trust, take it clothed with the trust. They are trustees \u201c for the same uses, and to the same extent with Loomis \u201c and Tillinghurst. A paper appears in the cause which \u201c purports to be the assignment to Loomis and Tilling- \u201c hurst. The assignment is in trust; first, to repay t-hem- \u201c selves any sums which they may pay on account of cer- \u201c tain undertakings made by them for Robert Murray &amp; \u201c Co.; and secondly, in trust to pay to Joseph and Wm. \u201c Russell, all such monies as they shall be liable to pay, as \u201c guaranty as aforesaid, to Nathaniel Russell upon bills, \u201c &amp;e., reciting the bills for which this suit is instituted. \u201c It is settled in this court, that the person for whose ben- \u201c efita trust is created, who is to be the ultimate receiver <em>\u201c </em>of the money, may sustain a suit in equity to have it \u201c paid directly to himself. This trust being to pay Joseph \u201c and Wm. Russell a sum which they are liable to pay to \u201c Nathaniel Russell, and being created in such terms that \u201c the money is certainly payable to them, the purposes of \u201c equity will be best effected by decreeing it, in a case like \u201c the present, to be paid directly to Nathaniel Russell. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>\u201c Indeed, the court ought not to decree a payment to \u201c Joseph and Wm. Russell without security that the debt \u201c to Nathaniel Russell shall be satisfied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">This case pointedly supports the complainant in sustaining his suit to recover money.directly to himself, of which he was to be the ultimate receiver. And it may be remarked that the plaintiff, Nathaniel Russell, was not a party to the assignment made to Loomis and Tillinghurst; neither was it a trust to pay <em>immediately </em>to him any money, but only \u201c to pay to Joseph and Wm. Russell all such \u201c monies as they shall be liable to pay as guaranty as \u201c aforesaid to Nathaniel Russell (the complainant) upon \u201c bills.\u201d There, the trust was for the indemnity of J. and W. Russell <em>on account of such monies as they shall be liable to pay to Nathaniel Bussell. </em>But as the trust was ultimately for the benefit of Nathaniel Russell, although he was no direct party to the assignment (or deed of trust,) it was the opinion of the Court that the purposes of equity would be best effected by decreeing a payment of the money directly to him. In the case before us, Neill promises to make a direct payment to Shields\u2019 administrators; and on this agreement, I have no hesitation, upon the above authorities, and upon the reason and justice of the demand, to decree payment to Shields\u2019 administrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Afterwards the amount due on the judgment of Luke Shields\u2019 administrators against John Little\u2019s executor was ascertained, and a decree for its payment entered against the executor of Henry Neill, deceased.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b51-6\">lst.
