Upon an affidavit of service and of a breach of the injunction, an attachment for contempt issued, under which the defendant was brought into court. Being examined on interrogatories, he denied the contempt, unequiv oeally negativing every interrogatory.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b76-13\"><em>Me Lane, </em>for the prosecutor,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Apz\">then moved for a commission to prove the contempt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>The Chancellor suggested a doubt whether, after the defendant had purged himself of the contempt, witnesses could be examined to prove it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b77-5\">Mr. <em>McLane </em>stated that witnesses had heretofore been examined in other cases at the bar of this Court; and he read from 1 <em>Harrison\u2019s Ch. Pr. </em>201-2, that a commission may be taken out to prove a contempt.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b77-6\">The Chancellor.</author>\n<p id=\"AW3\">The examination of witnesses heretofore has been by consent. However, let a commission go, <em>at the peril of the party prosecuting. </em>The defendant, Small, is allowed to go at large, without any bond not to depart (1 <em>Harrison\u2019s Ch. P. </em>202), so that the sheriff may have it in his power to bring him in at the next Term on this same writ, he still being supposed to be in the custody of the sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Note.\u2014In this case, at the suggestion of the Chancellor, the title of the interrogatories were amended so as to stand in the name of <em>the State of Delaware vs. Stogdon Small.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">In a previous case of attachment for contempt, viz : Tatem and Canby vs. Joshua Gilpin and Thomas Gilpin, in which the interrogatories were entitled in the name of fie parties (Ridgely\u2019s notes, 1817, p. 229) the Chancellor makes this note, viz : \u201c Quere.\u2014Is the title of these interrogatories right ? Ought they not to have <em>been,\u2014The State vs. Joshua Gilpin and Thomas Gilpin. </em>Motions and affidavits for attachments in <em>civil suits </em>are proceedings on the civil side of the Court, <em>until the attachments issue </em>and are to be entitled with the names of the parties. Bnt as soon as the attachments issue the proceedings are <em>on the criminal side. United States vs. </em>Wayne, <em>Wallace\u2019s C. C. Rep. </em>134. See <em>Tidd\u2019s Prac. </em>142 : 3 <em>T. R. </em>133, 263 : 2 <em>T. R. </em>643 : 6 <em>T. R. </em>640: 7 <em>T. R. </em>439, the cases cited in Wallace.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
