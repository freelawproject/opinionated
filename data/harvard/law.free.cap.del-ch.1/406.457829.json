The real estate was afterwards sold and conveyed to Parker Askew. The widow again intermarried with John Stilley, and was divorced from him, <em>a mensa et thora, </em>by an Act of Assembly, passed Feb., 1812. While so divorced, on the 18th of March, 1816,the complainant executed a release of the annuity to Parker Askew, as the holder of the real estate charged with its payment. After the execution of such release the real estate was conveyed to Amor Grubb, the present defendant. This bill was filed to raise the arrears of the annuity out of the real estate. The answer relied upon the release as a defence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-5\">The cause came before the Chancellor, at the Sept. T., 1888, for a hearing upon the bill, answer, exhibits and depositions. The sole question raised at the hearing was as to the validity and effect of the release. A copy of it is not found among the papers in the case.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b415-6\"><em>JR. H. Bayard, </em>for the complainant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b415-7\">The release is not a sufficient defence. In the <em>first </em>place, it applies only to the widow\u2019s dower, and not to the annuity given in lieu of dower. But, <em>second, </em>the complainant was at the time a <em>feme covert, </em>the wife of John Stilley, and was not competentto execute a release. The effect of a divorce is not to dissolve the bond of matrimony and to restore the wife to the capacities of a <em>feme sole, </em>but is only a separation from bed and board, and leaves her under the legal disabilities of marriage. 4 <em>Burns Ecc.

With respect to the construction of the paper there can be no doubt. The complainant had no right of dower to be released. She bad made her election of the annuity by becoming administratrix <em>c. t. a. </em>The bill itself alleges her acceptance of the annuity and the present claim stands on that ground. The paper executed to Parker Askew, could, as a release of the land, legally apply to nothing but the annuity. <em>Clancy on Mar. Wom. </em>47, 48, <em>436. Reeves on Dom. Rel. </em>145. 1 <em>Bro.
