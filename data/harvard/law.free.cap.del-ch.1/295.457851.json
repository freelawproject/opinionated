The bill also prayed that the defendant might be decreed to account for the value of the ore which he had already raised and taken away from the land. A preliminary injunction was ordered, according to the prayer of the bill, pending which a petition on behalf of the complainant was presented to the Chancellor, praying that a writ of <em>ne exeat </em>should issue against the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-5\">The petition set forth the substance of the bill, the order for an injunction and the service thereof, as well as the service of a subpoena to answer; and then proceeded to allege as follows, viz: \u201c that the defendant, Judge, as \u201c this petitioner has been informed and doth believe, hath \u201c not, since the service on him of said writ of injunction, \u201c taken away any ore from said land. But the said Thomas \u201c L. Judge has lately made over, sold, and conveyed away \u201c all his store goods, teams and other property, in Sussex \u201c county; and the said Thomas L. Judge, in order to \u201c defeat your petitioner of the sum due to him on account \u201c of the ore before raised and taken away by the defendant \u201c from your petitioner\u2019s land as aforesaid, for an account \u201c of which your petitioner has prayed in his bill aforesaid, \u201c and in order to defeat your petitioner in said suit in \u201c Chancery, and of the costs therein, he the said Thomas \u201c L. Judge, threatens and intends to quit and leave the \u201c State of Delaware, and to withdraw himself out of the \u201cjurisdiction of this Honorable Court. And your peti- \u201c tioner and the aforesaid Greenberry Blades do believe \u201c that the sum due from said Thomas L. Judge to your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>\u201c petitioner, for and on account of the ore by him taken \u201c away as aforesaid,doth amount to three thousand dollars \u201c and upwards.

The affidavit of the threats by dedefendant to leave the State was made directly, and not upon information and belief only: and it was, therefore, within the rule of the decisions. <em>Roddam vs. Hetherington, </em>5 <em>Ves. Jr. </em>91 n: <em>Oldham vs. Oldham, </em>7 Ves. <em>Jr. </em>410 : <em>Etches vs. Lance, </em>7 <em>Ves. Jr. </em>417 : <em>Hannay vs. McEntire, </em>11 <em>Ves. Jr. </em>54 : <em>Jones vs. Alephsin </em>16 Ves. <em>Jr. </em>470. With respect to the indebtedness, as the claim of the complainant rested in account, and was peculiarly within the defendant\u2019s own knowledge, the Chancellor considered it sufficient that the deponents had sworn to their belief that the defendant was indebted in a sum certain, viz : $3000. <em>Rico vs. Gaultier, </em>3 <em>Atk. </em>501 : <em>Russell vs. Ashby, </em>5 Ves. <em>Jr. </em>96.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">It was ordered, that a writ of <em>ne exeat </em>issue, and that the defendant be held to give security to the amount of $3,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">See <em>Clayton, et al., vs. </em>Mitchell, ante, p. 32.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
