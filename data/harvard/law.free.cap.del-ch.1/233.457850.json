Henry Hook, one of the original tenants in common, died intestate, leaving to survive him a widow, named Ann, who afterwards intermarried with James Hanson ; also leaving two children, his heirs at law. The widow of Henry Hook, together with her husband, James <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Hanson, joined in the petition for partition, no assignment of dower having been yet made to her.

Code, Chap. </em>86, <em>See. </em>22, as amended by Act of Jan. 18, 1867; 13 Laws of Del., 150. By this Act, in order that the title under a sale in partition may be clear of curtesy and dower in an undivided share, and that a corresponding interest in the purchase money may, by the decree for distribution, be secured in lieu of the curtesy or dower, the husband or wife entitled is required to be a party to the proceeding. The Act of 1867 was declaratory of a practice\u2019already in force,\u2014having grown out of the statutes providing for the sale of lands in proceedings for partition, which could not be divided without detriment to the parties interested.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b244-9\">The Chancellor,</author>\n<p id=\"AVV\">upon consideration, declined to make the order, as prayed for, and afterwards assigned the following as his reasons :</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">By the last will of John Hook, his children, Agnes and Henry, became tenants in common, Agnes in one-third, and Henry in two-thirds, of the land devisedl Agnes married William Burgess, and having survived him died intestate, leaving three' children,William, Henry and Sarah now the wife of Josiah Bunker. Henry died intestate leaving a widow, Ann, now the wife of James Hanson, and two children, Jane, the wife of Samuel McVay and Henrietta Ann.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">The object of the petition is to assign to William Burgess, Henry Burgess and Josiah Bunker and Sarah his wife, their third part of the land to be held by them in common; and to assign to James Hanson and Ann his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>wife, who was the widow of Henry Hook, and to Samuel McVay and wife and Henrietta Ann Hook the other two-thirds, to be held by them in common, according to their respective interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The objection that I have is, that James Hanson and Ann his wife do not hold any part of the land. Ann is entitled to dower in Henry Hook\u2019s two-thirds part, but until the dower shall be assigned to her she does not hold the land; and even supposing she should, on the assignment of dower, become tenant in common for her life, yet until the assignment she cannot in any character be a party to the partition.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The following authorities seem to be explicit. In <em>Co. Lit. </em>34 <em>a, </em>it is said \u201c and so it is, when the wife of one \u201c tenant in common demands a third part of a moiety, yet \u201c after judgment she cannot enter until the sheriff deliver \u201c to her the third part, albeit the delivery of the sheriff \u2018 \u201c shall reduce it to no more certainty than it was.\u201d Again, in the same place, it is said, \u201c for as concerning dower at <em>\u201c </em>common law, there must be an assignment, either by the <em>\u201c </em>sheriff (as hath been said), by the King\u2019s writ, or else by \u201c the heir or other tenant of the land by consent and agree- \u201c ment between them.\u201d In these passages, Lord Coke is commenting on the 39th Sec. <em>of </em>Littleton,where it is said, that on an endowment at the church door the widow may enter without other assignment, but as to dower at common law, he means to say, there must be an assignment before she can enter. See <em>Co. Lit. </em>37 <em>a, b, Sec. </em>43, 44 : 3 <em>Lev. </em>84 : 2 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>127, <em>Dower, B : </em>3 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>189, <em>Joint tenants and tenants in common.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The word <em>tenet </em>in a writ doth always imply a tenant of the freehold And, therefore, if one parcener maketh a lease for years, yet a writ of partition will lie; but if one or more make a lease for life, a writ of partition doth not lie between them; for that <em>non tenent insimul et pro indiviso, </em>they do not hold the freehold together, and the writ of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>partition must be against the tenant of the freehold. And so, if one be disseised by the other, no writ of partition lies; and so, if one make a lease for life, the writ shall not be against her, but against her lessee; but if one make a lease for years, the other may have a writ of partition against her, <em>Co. Lit. </em>167, <em>a, b, </em>175-6: 16 <em>Vin. Abr. 225,pl. </em>2.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">In <em>Mundy vs. Mundy, </em>2 <em>Ves. Jr. </em>122-124, the Lord Chancellor asks, \u201c cannot a dowress come here, as a coparcener can come, .for a partition ?\u201d And afterwards, page 125, from the remark on <em>Smith vs. Angel, Farresley\u2019s Rep. </em>40, it would seem that dower being assigned the widow becomes seised, and the partition would lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Partition between tenants in common and joint tenants by Stat. 31, Hen. VIII, was extended by Stat. 32,Hen. VIII, to limited interests for life or years; and the same right exists in equity by bill as at law by writ <em>(Baring vs. Nash, </em>1 <em>V. &amp; B. </em>551), and the owner of the inheritance of the share of t\u00e9nant for years need not be a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">As soon as the dower is assigned and the widow enters, she is a tenant, or holds her undivided dower, and.by the equity of the statute 32 Hen. VIII c. 32, and of our Acts of Assembly, partition may be made between her and the tenant in common</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">I have met with no case in the books of such a petition. But a wi\u2019it of partition lies against the tenant by the curtesy, because he continueth the estate of eo-pareen'ary; and so he shall have a writ of partition upon the Stat. 32 Hen. VIII c. 32; for although he is not joint tenant nor tenant in common, yet he is in equal mischief as another tenant for life and is also within the equity of the statute. <em>Co. Lit. </em>175, <em>a, b. </em>Upon the same principle a tenant in dower should have partition. She, as to her dower, continues the estate, and the words, as well as the reason and equity of the statute, comprehend her equally with a tenant by the curtesy, or any other tenant for . life. The only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>difference between her and the tenant by the curtesy is, that he continues the estate in the whole land, she in a third only. But I cannot perceive how that should create any difference; for their estates are the same although the portions of land differ. And Coke on Littleton says that her estate lies in the whole land, and that her dower must be assigned in common, for that she cannot have it otherwise than as her husband had it.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Suppose the heirs of both tenants in common to have partition without her dower being assigned, and without making her a party:\u2014she might still proceed against all of them for her dower, for she derives her title from her husband, who held the land in common with Agnes.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">After her dower is assigned to her in common, without metes and bounds, she must obtain her particular part by metes and bounds, or she can never enjoy it in severalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">If she were to release her dower to the heirs of Henry Hook, then they and the heirs of Agnes might prefer a petition and have partition made without noticing her, or if the tenants in common should have partition without any release, and without noticing her, and she should acquiesce and agree with the heirs of Hook, I do not perceive any objection; but for the security of all parties an agreement in writing should be made by all of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">The difficulty which presents itself on the present petition is, that as her dower has not been assigned she can make no entry, and does not hold the land and cannot be a party in the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">In Sussex county a similar case occured in 1820. Paul Waples held one-fourth of six hundred and eighty acres, and John Smith Waples held three-fourths, as tenants in common. John Smith Waples died intestate, leaving a widow and five children. A petition was presented to the Orphans\u2019 Court to assign to the widow of John Smith Waples her dower, without metes and bounds. This was done. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>After confirmation of this assignment of dower, a decree for partition was made in chancery, and the share which the widow held as her dower was assigned to her by metes and bounds, as if she had been one of the tenants in common. This was the first case of the kind, and the only one until this petition of the Hook family. When Mr. Wells, who was counsel in the Waples case, brought the subject to my attention, I confess it was new to <em>me; </em>but on looking into the books and considering the reason of it, and that it came within the spirit of the Statute of 32 Hen. VIH, and of our own Acts of Assembly, I did not hesitate to give my sanction to that proceeding. But in the present case, the dower of the widow <em>of </em>Henry Hook, dec\u2019d, not having been assigned, a partition cannot be decreed upon this petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The petition was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">At the next term of the Court a new petition was preferred for partition among the tenants in common under the will of John Hook, dec\u2019d, in which James Hanson and Ann his wife, the widow of Henry Hook, dec\u2019d, were not joined as parties. Upon this petition a decree was granted by the Chancellor, under which a partition was duly made and confirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
