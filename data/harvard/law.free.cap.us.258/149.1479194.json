D. 1920, to run, locate and designate the boundary line between the State of Minnesota and the State of Wisconsin, in and through Lower Saint Louis Bay, Upper Saint Louis Bay and the Saint Louis River, from Upper Saint Louis Bay to the falls in said river, which report is in words and figures, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">\u201c To the Honorable Chief Justice and the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">We, Samuel S. Gannett, Washington, D. C.; William B. Patton, Duluth, Minn., and John G. D. Mack, Madison, Wisconsin, Commissioners appointed, under decree of the court rendered October 11th, 1920, \u2018to run, locate and designate the boundary line between the State of Minnesota and the State of Wisconsin, in and through Lower St. Louis Bay, Upper St. Louis Bay and the St. Louis River, from Upper St. Louis Bay to-the \u201cFalls\u201d in the said river'/ have the honor to submit the following report, with accompanying maps, which maps are marked Exhibit No. 1, entitled, Supreme Court of the United States, October Term, 1920, No. 13, Original, <em>Tracing of Parts of Original Map of St. Louis Bay and St. Louis River, Made under Direction of Captain George G. Meade, T. E. 1861, Showing Boundary Line Between Minnesota and Wisconsin as Surveyed in Accordance with Terms of Above Decree in 1921, </em>and Exhibit No. 2, entitled, Supreme Court of the United States, October Term, 1920, No. 13, Original, <em>Map Showing Boundary Line Between Minnesota and Wisconsin Through St. Louis Bay and up St. Louis River to the Falls as Surveyed in Accordance with Terrhs of Above Decree in 1921.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">The Commissioners held their first meeting on October 29th, 1920, in suite 612, Palladio Building, in the City of Duluth, Minnesota, and organized by electing Samuel S. Gannett, Chairman.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Meade Chart.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">In carrying out the decree of the court, that the <em>\u2018 </em>boundary line must be ascertained upon a consideration of the situation existing in 1846, and accurately described by the Meade Chart/ the Commission made a careful study of the Meade Chart, filed as Minnesota\u2019s Exhibit No. 1, and found that the scale of said chart, 1: 32000, was too small for practical use in determining a line which could be laid out and properly monumented; and that the triangulation points of the original Meade survey, shown on the original Meade Map (the location of which was absolutely essential in transferring to the ground points determined on the map), were omitted from the chart.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Meade Map.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">An attempt was then made to use the photographic copies of the original Meade map, being Wisconsin\u2019s Exhibits Nos. 46C and 46D, but it was found that the process of production had caused unequal shrinkage in the several sheets composing the map, and that no accurate scalings could be made therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">Under instructions of the Commission, Mr. S. S. Gannett went to the office of the U. S. Lake Survey, in the City of Detroit, Michigan, the repository of the original Meade map, and under his personal supervision, caused an accurate tracing to be made of so much of the said Meade map, and the soundings and triangulation points shown thereon, as pertains to the case un&lt;ier considera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>tion. An accurate copy of this tracing, showing in addition the boundary line, as fixed on said map by the Commission, is filed herewith as Exhibit No. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Triangulation Points.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">The triangulation points, heretofore noted as being platted on the original Meade map by triangles, and shown in red ink on the aforesaid tracing, are located, in the records of the Lake Survey, by rectangular coordinates referred to the primary triangulation station of the \u00dc. S. Lake Survey, known as Minnesota Point North Base, drawn in red ink on aforesaid tracing, and described hereinafter in detail under the heading, ' Descriptions and Geographic Positions of Triangulation and Reference Points.\u2019 Commissioner Gannett secured an accurate copy of said coordinates from the official records of the U. S. Lake Survey, and they are correctly given in Table No. 1, attached to this report.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">The original Meade trianghlation points have' not been in existence for some years, but the Corps of Engineers, U. S. Army, in later surveys of the St. Louis Bays and River, has established new triangulation points and referred the same by rectangular coordinates to aforesaid \u2018 Minnesota Point North Base.\u2019 An accurate copy of the official coordinates of these later triangulation points was also secured by Commissioner Gannett, and a true copy of same is hereto attached and marked Table No. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">With these coordinates, it is possible to accurately relocate the original Meade triangulation points, or to show the new ones on the Meade map in their true positions; and the last mentioned points are thus shown on Exhibit No. 1, being marked by triangles in black ink.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">Having -the existing, or new, triangulation points platted in their true positions on the Meade map, it is possible to \u2018 tie in \u2019 by scale any points or lines on said map to these triangulation points, and to transfer said points <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>or lines to the ground by similar measurements from said triangulation points. ^</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">Office Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">With this information at hand, the Commission laid down on the tracing of the original Meade map, Exhibit No. 1, the boundary line between the States of Minnesota and Wisconsin, in accordance with the decree of the court, namely:. \u2018From a point midway between Rice\u2019s Point and Connor\u2019s Point, through the middle of Lower St. Louis Bay, to and wiih .the deep channel leading to Upper St. Louis Bay, and to a point, therein immediately south of the southern extremity of Grassy Point, thence westward along the most direct course, through water not less than eight feet deep eastward of Fisherman\u2019s Island, as indicated by the red trace A-B-C on Minnesota\u2019s Exhibit No. 1, approximately one mile to the deep channel and immediately west of the bar therein, thence with such channel north and west of Big Island upstream to the \u201c Falls.\u201d \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The center of the pivot pier of the Inter-State Bridge was found to be the point midway between Rice\u2019s Point and Connor\u2019s Point, and was designated by the Commission as Station No. O. From this point, as a beginning, a series of straight lines was laid out to conform with the decree of the court, special care being taken to have the lines over water not less than eight feet deep as shown by the Meade map, and the angle points between said lines numbered consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">From such of these angle points as were convenient,' \u2018ties\u2019 were scaled to the best situated triangulation points on the map, and by means of rectangular eoordL nates from each angle point on the lines between the \u2018 ties,\u2019 to triangulation points, the lengths and angles of deviation of the several lines were calculated, and closed polygons formed. These polygons were then checked as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>to closure by the method of latitudes and departures, and any errors found were balanced so as to secure closure. By this means your Commissioners were enabled, with a close approach to accuracy, to determine the lengths and angles of deviation of the several lines composing the projected boundary line.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The lengths and angles thus determiiied and the \u2018 ties \u2019 to the'several triangulation points, were used as preliminary field notes by the surveying party employed to \u2018 run out the boundary line and to locate same by proper monuments, courses and distances.-\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Boundary Line Above Fond Du Lac.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Eor that portion of the St. Louis River beyond Fond Du Lac, and extending to the \u2018 Falls,\u2019 and which is not shown on the Meade Chart or map, the Commission established the center line of the river, as a medial line between the shore lines, as-surveyed by the Commission, and designated said medial line as the boundary line.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">The Survey.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">As the boundary fine, except in a few instances, runs over water from 8 feet, to over 20 feet in depth, the most convenient time for surveying it was after ice had formed to a safe thickness. The winter -proved to be mild and the ice conditions unfavorable, adding greatly to the danger and difficulty of the work, and increasing the time necessary to finish it.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">The surveying party was organized-early in January, 1921, and the necessary equipment' was rented or purchased. Starting at Station 0, heretofore described, the approximate, position of- the \u00bfboundary , line was laid out on the ice, in the bay and river, from, the preliminary field notes, \"and. the \u2018 ties \u2019 to the triangulation points, \u2022 measured. Such discrepancies, due to the curvature of the. earth, or to errors in scaling from the map, as were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>shown by measuring the \u2018 ties/ were allowed for and distributed in the angles and distances of all the lines back to the preceding \u2018 tie.\u2019 If any important discrepancy was discovered, the lines involved were re-run before any adjustments were made. From the final field notes of the adjusted survey, a description of the boundary line by courses and distances was obtained, and is incorporated herein. This work was completed March 19, 1921.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Detailed Description of Boundary Line.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">[Here follow lengthy and detailed descriptions of the boundary line, as determined, the monuments, and of triangulation and reference points, with geographic positions, which are omitted by the Reporter as not being of general interest. Persons interested in these may consult the original decree in the clerk\u2019s office, obtain certified copies, or consult the copies forwarded to the Governors of the two States.]</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Map of Boundary Line.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">The Commission has prepared, and transmits herewith as Exhibit No. 2, a map of St. Louis Bays and River on the scale of 1: 24000, showing their present conditions, improvements along the harbor front, the U. S. Government Harbor Lines and channels, and the relative position of the boundary line. There are also shown as sub-maps, on larger scale, improved or partly improved properties which are crossed by the boundary line; also detailed drawings of the concrete monuments as constructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">Tables.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">The rectangular coordinates, referred to Minnesota Point North Base, of all monuments, reference point [s] and line points are shown in Tables Nos. 2, 4 and 5, hereto attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-11\">The geographic positions of the angle points in the boundary line are shown in Table No. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Instruments.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The instrument used in making the survey was a-Transit Theodolite with 6%-inch circle and reading to 10 seconds of arc. The measurements were made on the surface of the ice with a steel tape 300 feet in length, under a tension of twenty pounds, and corrected to temperature of 62\u00b0 F.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The Commission employed as assistants the following named persons, namely:</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Gordon F.
