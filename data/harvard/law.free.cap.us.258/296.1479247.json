They insist that the absence of knowledge by the Senate of Wallace\u2019s removal was conceded by the Government in both the Court of Claims and here. What the Government brief in this court said was that it did not appear that the Senate was advised. But appellant\u2019s counsel produce evidence from the record in the Court of Claims upon which they ask that the case be remanded to the Court of Claims to make a finding on this point. ' Let us concede for the sake of the argument, without deciding, that it is properly a matter of evidence <em>de hors </em>the record, and of a finding thereon. The chief item of evidence on which the motion is based is a statement in the record below that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">\u201c On or be'fore February 21, 1918, it was the practice of the Adjutant General\u2019s office to nominate an officer <em>vice </em>the particular officer whose promotion or separation from the.,service caused the vacancy; and that, after February 21, 19\u00cd8, the practice of indicating the specific vacancy was discontinued on the recommendation of the Executive Clerk of the Senate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">The contention of the defendant on this showing is that the Senate adopted the practice of confirming appointments to vacancies made, by the President witho\u00fat investigation into the cause of the vacancies because of the exigencies of war and the great number of appointments. We do not see that if such facts were found, it would alter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>our necessary conclusion. The \u25a0 Senate in confirming nominations is not exercising a judicial but an executive function. It does not have to give a hearing or make an investigation before lawful action, and if it chooses to accept the President\u2019s nomination as assurance that there is a- vacancy to which the appointment proposed can be made, and acts on that assurance, the legal effect of the confirmation is not affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Petition for rehearing and the motion to remand are denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
