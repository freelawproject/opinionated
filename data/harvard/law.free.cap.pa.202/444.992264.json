This ruling is the subject of the only assignment of error now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The agreement was not within the usury laws. It was not for interest properly so-called, but for a share of profits. The money was not a loan from creditor to debtor, but a contribution to the partnership capital and was all the time at the risk of the business. The agreement was a mere method of division of profits to reach a satisfactory adjustment between partners having unequal interests in the firm. If it had stipulated that Gilmore should first have one tenth or any other fixed proportion of the profits and then the rest should be divided, the effect would be the same. As said in Scott v. Kennedy, 201 Pa. 462, \u201c whether the sum to be paid was fixed in advance or left to be determined by a fixed percentage is unimportant as long as it was a share of the profits only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
