Prior to the filing of the bill there had been negotiations between the parties for tbe price to be paid for the use of the wall by tbe defendant. The negotiations had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>conducted with the mutual understanding that the wall was a party wall, and these negotiations terminated in an agreement for the payment of $1,951.98, subject to be enlarged or diminished by measurement. This sum was paid to plaintiff.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AHg\">April 21, 1902:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-4\">The court in an opinion by McCarthy, J., dismissed the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was decree dismissing bill.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b352-6\"><em>John Gr.

If the wall was not strictly a party wall, by common consent of the parties it had been so treated. The negotiations for the price to be paid for its use were with the mutual understanding that it was a party wall, and they terminated in an agreement on a sum, subject to be enlarged or diminished by a measurement, which was paid by the defendant. As there was not a final adjustment of the matter of compensation, it would have been better that the decree should have reserved any right the plaintiff may have in that regard. To avoid any question in the future, the decree is amended so that the dismissal of the bill is without prejudice to the right of the plaintiffs to recover whatever may be due them, and as so amended the decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
