In such a case the papers and affidavits cannot be considered as equivalent to a warrant of attorney, and as the legal plaintiff is not in a position to give such a warrant, the court will order the proceedings to be stayed on a rule to file a warrant of attorney.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b98-8\"><em>Warrant of attorney </em>\u2014 Action\u2014Act <em>of April </em>14, 1834, <em>P.

Fisler, with S. N. Brognard and George E. Cummings, executed to Mary S. Leech, Henry S. Leech, and David C. Leech, trustees under the will of William F. Leech, deceased, their joint bond for $50,000 conditioned for the payment of $25,000 at the expiration of three years from the date thereof, and the said Jacob G. Fisler executed and delivered to the said trustees his mortgage for securing payment of the said $25,000 upon certain premises situated in Plymouth township, county of Montgomery, state of Pennsylvania.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-5\">On May 1, 1891, Jacob G. Fisler conveyed the premises to A. J. Reach and Benjamin F. Shibe, the defendants, in consideration of the sum of $10,000, \u201c under and subject to \u201d the payment of the mortgage debt. Subsequently default was made in payment of the interest, and upon foreclosure, the land was sold by the sheriff for a sum insufficient to pay the mortgage debt. The present -action was brought in the name of Fisler to use of Leech et al. against Reach and Shibe. After the action was instituted, the defendants obtained a rule on plaintiff\u2019s counsel to file his warrant of attorney. Instead of doing so he filed a number of affidavits and letters showing that the suit was originally brought with plaintiff\u2019s consent, but that upon being applied to for the warrant of attorney, plaintiff declined to give it because he had parted with his interest. The defendant then obtained a rule to strike off the papers and affidavits alleged to constitute a warrant of attorney, proceedings to stay in the meanwhile. The court made this rule absolute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the order of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b99-7\"><em>John Hampton Barnes, </em>with him <em>Henry Freedley, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFyd\">The plaintiff in this case is a mere legal plaintiff without any interest in the event of the suit beyond having his own liability to the use plaintiffs extinguished by enforcing the liability of the defendants, assumed by them in purchasing the property covered by the lien of the mortgage.

Peterson, 1 Clark, 482; Swartz\u2019s App., 119 Pa. 208.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"A9Q\">Mr. Justice Fell,</author>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">Fisler mortgaged a tract of land to Leech, the appellant, and afterwards conveyed the land to Reach, the appellee, \u201c under and subject to \u201d the payment of the mortgage debt. Judgment was obtained on the mortgage, and the iand was sold by the sheriff for a sum insufficient to pay the mortgage debt. This action was brought in the name of Fisler to the use of Leech to recover the deficiency from the grantee, Reach. It was brought with the knowledge and consent of Fisler, who after-wards parted with whatever interest he had in the action. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney was ruled to file a warrant of attorney, but was unable to obtain one as Fisler had sold his interest. He filed letters and affidavits which showed that he had been authorized by Fisler to bring the action. The court held that the papers filed were insufficient and ordered a stay of proceedings. The questions raised by the appeal are: first, whether the use plaintiff could use the name of the legal plaintiff without his consent; second, if a warrant of attorney from the legal plaintiff were necessary to a continuance of the action, were the papers filed sufficient to constitute such a warrant ?</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">The action was to enforce a contract between the legal plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>tiff and his grantee, alleged to arise from a conveyance of land under and subject to the payment of a mortgage given by the former. The contract, if any, was in relief of the grantor, because of his obligation as mortgagor, and it enured to the benefit of no other person. He was the party with whom it was made, and he alone could maintain an action on it. The Act of June 12, 1878, P. L. 205, provides that the grantee of real estate subject to a ground rent, mortgage, or other incumbrance, shall not be personally liable for the payment of such ground rent, mortgage or other incumbrance, unless by agreement in writing he shall have expressly assurped a personal liability therefor; that the words \u201cunderand subject to the payment of such ground rent, mortgage, or other incumbrance \u201d shall not alone be construed to make such grantee liable; and that the right to enforce such a liability shall not enure to any one other than the person with whom such an agreement was made. That an action may be maintained by a mortgagee in his own right is in direct contradiction of the act. It is equally clear that he has no right to sue in the name of the grantor without his consent. In Blood to use v. Crew-Levick Co., 177 Pa. 606, and Old Colony Trust Co. v. Allentown, etc., Rapid Transit Co., 192 Pa. 596, the actions were prosecuted in the name of the legal plaintiffs, and no question of the authority to do so was raised, and in both there was an express agreement in addition to the \u201c under and subject to\u201d clause in the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The letters and affidavits filed do not constitute a sufficient warrant of attorney. They show only that the action was commenced with the consent of the legal plaintiff, and that when called on to give a warrant of attorney he was unable to do so for the reason that he had assigned his claim to another, who alone had the right to continue the action. The Act of April 14, 1884, P. L. 354, requires every attorney, if called on to do so, to \u201c file his warrant of attorney in the office of the prothonotary or clerk of the court in which such action shall be depending.\u201d This statutory requirement is not met by proof that the action was originally brought with the consent of the plaintiff. The act requires a specific form of proof to be filed in order that the right may be clearly and indisputably shown, and this requirement cannot be dispensed with.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
