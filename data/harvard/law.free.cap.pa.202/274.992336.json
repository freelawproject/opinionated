As evidence going to the jury to prove the negligence of the company before the accident.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-8\">The Court: If it was a part of the transaction that this conversation was had, it may be given in evidence, but we think that counsel for the plaintiff should ascertain how long after the time of the accident this conversation was had before asking the question. Exception noted. Bill sealed for the plaintiff. Do you offer that as part of the transaction, the conversation occurring immediately after the accident ? Fix when the time of this conversation he had with his superior occurred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-9\">\u201c Q.

We object to this question as suggesting to the witness what to say. It is a leading question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-11\">The Court: If a declaration of this superior officer is a part of the transaction, we think it ought to be admitted, and that is the reason we suggested to you that you should inquire when this conversation occurred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-12\">Mr. Hinckley: I will ask this question then:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-13\">\u201c Q.

Those declarations are not part of the res gestae. But if the declarations that you propose to prove are part of the res gestae, then we think that they are evidence, and you can inquire from the witness how long after this accident occurred those statements were made by his superior. We have indicated what we believe to be the rule, and have suggested to you that you should inquire as to the time when this conversation was had between the superior officer and himself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-4\">Mr. Hinckley: Your honor will see that I will have to ask whether the conversation did occur.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-5\">Mr. Scarlet: Do you pretend to say that you don\u2019t know this?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-6\">Mr. Hinckley: I can\u2019t tell you the precise moment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-7\">The Court: We think, judge, you should ascertain the time from the witness privately.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-8\">Mr. Hinckley: Counsel for plaintiff having shown by the witness upon the stand that at the time of the accident he had no instructions from his superior officer, as to what to do with the steam connections of the boiler with the steam main in case of a furnace that was drawn and not working; propose to show by the witness upon the stand that after the accident it was necessary to shut down the mill and clean the d\u00e9bris and replace the destroyed furnace, and that in consequence the mill was closed down some two or three weeks, and that upon resuming work, the first work that was done after the accident, instruction was given by his superior officer, the master mechanic, that hereafter in all cases where a furnace was drawn that the steam connections should be closed and the boiler disconnected from the steam main. This all for the purpose of showing the negligence in the company in not having given such orders prior; one of the allegations of the plaintiff being that this accident occurred from want of such orders and from want of the disconnection of the boiler from the steam main.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-9\">Mr.Scarlet: Defendant\u2019s objection is that, if, as counsel stated, this offer is part of the res gestae, we object to it as incompetent and irrelevant. And secondly, that it is not shown nor pretended to be shown that the witness upon the stand was not a competent and careful water tender and knew what was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>to be done in cases of that kind, without any instructions whatever from any other person, prior to the accident.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-3\">The Court: The declarations made by the superior officer of the witness upon the stand when he resumed work three or four weeks after the accident occurred, we do not admit as part of the res geste.

I will give the form to the stenographer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-7\">It having been shown by plaintiffs\u2019 proof, that the ordinarily safe and prudent thing to have done in case a furnace was shut down, was to cut off the steam connection, and the witness having shown that the waterman in charge of the boiler in question (together with other boilers) had received no orders from his superior as to what to do in such case, and that he had not cut off the steam connection at the time of the explosion; it is proposed now to show by the witness that after the explosion there were required a week or two to clean up the d\u00e9bris and repair the machinery, and that as soon as the mill was again started, after the accident, defendant company issued orders to the waterman that in all cases where a furnace was shut down for repairs the steam connection should be cut off, as plaintiffs\u2019 proof shows should have been done at the time of the accident. This for the purpose of showing a recognition by defendant company of negligence in not having done so before.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-8\">Mr. Scarlet: It is objected by the defendant that it is not shown, that the witness, proposed to be asked the question, upon the stand, was incompetent in any way to know what to do under circumstances of that kind, and that, therefore, without proof of negligence on the part of the company in hiring an incompetent person to take charge of the water of the mill, this testimony would be irrelevant and incompetent, and would not go to prove the specific act of negligence of the defendant for which this action is brought, and which it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to prove as being the cause of the accident; and it further being shown by the plaintiff in the cause that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>not the cause of the accident, but that an entirely different theory of negligence is asserted, to wit: that the accident occurred by reason of the fact that the boiler broke, with which the action of the waterman or of the fireman or of any one else had no connection whatever; and being an entirely different and distinct cause of the explosion, it is therefore incompetent and not in support of the plaintiff\u2019s theory.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-4\">The Court: We believe that the proposed offer, if admitted, would tend to show declarations made a couple of weeks after the accident or explosion, by a servant of the company, and for the purpose stated in the offer we do not believe it is admissible in evidence, it being no part of the res gestee.

The point to which the evidence would go under the plaintiff\u2019s proof so far would be that the defect in the boiler was a latent defect, only discoverable by the tests to which they subjected it, and not such tests as under the law the defendant company was bound to make; that the defendant company having had this boiler in use for a number of years and operating it up until that time without any damage whatever, was not bound to know even upon the theory of the plaintiff expressed by a so-called expert, was not bound to know that that was negligence in any way at all; and the different hanging of the boiler subsequent to the accident would be no recognition upon the part of the defendant company that it knew or ought to have known the specific negligence which it is incumbent upon them to prove and of the company to have notice of; and it is irrelevant and incompetent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-4\">The Court: We feel obliged to sustain the objection and overrule the offer.

Offers were then made to prove that after the accident a boiler used to replace the one that exploded was supported in a different manner, and that an employee in charge of the boilers in the mill received instructions from the defendant company thereafter to disconnect boilers from the steam main when the fires were drawn. The distinct purpose of these offers was to show a recognition by the defendant of its negligence in not having properly supported and managed the boiler, and the overruling of them raises the question whether evidence of precautions taken after the alleged negligent act is admissible for the purpose of showing antecedent negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">The reception of this kind of testimony is undoubtedly sanctioned by some of our cases, but in most of these cases the tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>timony introduced was not of sufficient importance to require a reversal, or there was some ground for its introduction other than that it tended to show antecedent negligence. In none of the cases has the subject been discussed, and it can scarcely be said that this court has ever been deliberately committed to the proposition that evidence of precautions taken or repairs made after an accident is admissible as tending in itself to prove prior negligence. The first case that appears to sustain this proposition is Penna. Railroad Co. v. Henderson, 51 Pa. 315, decided in 1866. A drover in charge of live stock which was being carried by the railroad company on a branch road reached a junction where he was to take the cars on the main line. He was directed to go to a platform between the tracks and wait for his train, which was slowing up. While waiting by the side of the train until it should stop, he was struck by an express train, which passed on the other track. The platform was six feet wide, and the cars overlapped it so as to leave only two feet and a half of clear space in which to stand. It was said in the opinion, in disposing of one of the specifications of error, that it was clearly proper for the plaintiff to show that immediately after the accident the agent of the railroad telegraphed the general superintendent stating the situation of the platform and that he thought it ought to be removed, and that it was removed the next day. The main question considered in the opinion was whether the company could by contract with a passenger relieve itself from liability for its negligence, and this question was discussed at length. In view of the manifest and gross negligence of the company in so locating a platform that it would be a death trap, the court may have been of opinion that the admission of this testimony did not call for a reversal or that the testimony was competent as showing the declarations and acts of the officers of the company immediately connected with the accident. It was treated both in the argument of the case and in the opinion as a matter of minor importance and merely incidental to the main question involved in the case. The statement however in the opinion that the testimony was \u201c clearly proper,\u201d gave rise to what has been considered a rule on the subject in this state. A like statement was made in the opinion in West Chester Railroad Co. v. McElwee, 67 Pa. 311, another case in which the negligence of the defendant was so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>manifest that proof of subsequent alterations could not make it more apparent. In McKee v. Bidwell, 74 Pa. 218, attention was called to the cases of Railroad Co. v. Henderson and Railroad v. McElwee, but the reversal was on the ground that the question of the plaintiff\u2019s negligence should have been submitted to the jury. Penna. Telegraph Co. v. Varnau, 15 Atl. Repr. (Pa.) 624, may be classed with these cases, and Pittsburg Southern Railway Co. v. Taylor, 104 Pa. 306, Sweeny v. Barrett, 151 Pa. 600, Derk v. Northern Central Railway Co., 164 Pa. 243, and Card v. Columbia Township, 191 Pa. 254, merely recognize the existence of the rule, but predicate nothing of it. In Lederman v. Penna. Railroad Co., 165 Pa. 118, there was a special reason for the admission of the testimony to show that safety gates had been erected after the accident. The jury had been on the ground and had seen them, and it was proper in rebuttal to show that they were not there when the accident happened. In Gavigan v. Atlantic Refining Co., 186 Pa. 604, care was taken not to sanction the rule, and in Hager v. Wharton Township, 200 Pa. 281, doubt as to its correctness was expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">No judgment appears to have been affirmed where the admission of such testimony was of vital importance at the trial, and in the later cases the rule has been recognized with reluctance and doubt suggested as to its validity. The time has come when we should distinctly say that we do not approve the rule, and that the cases which may be considered as announcing and sustaining it are to that extent overruled. The admission of such testimony cannot be defended on principle. It is not more likely to show that there was negligence before the accident than that the occurrence of the accident first suggested the use of methods or appliances not before thought of; it applies to conduct before an accident a standard of duty determined by after-acquired knowledge; it punishes a prudent and well-meaning defendant who guards against the recurrence of an accident he had no reason to anticipate, or who out of a considerate regard for the safety of others exercises a higher degree of care than the law requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">While the authorities on this question in other jurisdictions are not harmonious, the trend of decision is most decidedly against the admission of such testimony, and in some jurisdictions, notably Minnesota, where the testimony was formerly ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>mitted, the rule has been changed. In Hart v. Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Co., 21 L. T. (N. S.) 261, it was said by Bramwell, B.: \u201c There are matters of considerable importance involved in this particular case. One of them is that people do not furnish evidence against themselves simply by adopting a new plan in order to prevent the recurrence of an accident. I think that a proposition to the contrary would be barbarous. It would be as I have often had occasion to tell juries to hold that because the world gets wiser as it gets older, therefore it was foolish before.\u201d The rule of exclusion was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Columbia and Puget Sound Railroad Company v. Hawthorne, 141 U. S. 202; 12 Sup. Ct. Repr. 691; and Mr. Justice Guay said in delivering the opinion of the court: \u201cUpon this question there has been some difference of opinion in the courts of the several states. But it is now settled upon much consideration, by the decisions of the highest courts in most of the states in which the question has arisen that the evidence is incompetent, because the taking of such precautions against the future is not to be considered as an admission of responsibility for the past. It has no legitimate tendency to prove that the defendant had been negligent before the accident happened, and it is calculated to distract the minds of the jury from the real issue and to create a prejudice against the defendant.\u201d A leading case on the subject is Morse v. Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis Ry. Co., 30 Minn. 465; 16 N. W. Repr. 358, which overrules a number of previous decisions of that court. In the opinion by Mitchell, J., it is said: \u201c But on mature reflection we have concluded that evidence of this kind ought not to be admitted under any circumstances, and that the rule heretofore adopted by this court is in principle wrong, not for the reason given in some courts that the acts of the employees in making such repairs are not admissible against their principals, but upon the broader ground that such acts offer no legitimate basis for construing an act as an admission of previous neglect of duty.\u201d To the same effect are the decisions in nearly every state in which the subject has been considered. Among the multitude of cases some of the more recent are: Clapper v. Waterford, 131 N. Y. 382; Whelton v. West End St. Railway Co., 172 Mass. 555; Hodges v. Percival, 132 Ill. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>53; Howe v. Medaris, 183 Ill. 288; Terre Haute, etc., R. R. Co. v. Clem, 123 Ind. 15; Sievers v. Peters Box &amp; Lumber Co., 151 Ind. 642; Town of Waterbury v. Waterbury Traction Co., 50 Atl. Repr. (Conn.) 3; Green v. Ashland Water Co., 101 Wis. 258; Beard v. Guild, 107 Iowa, 476; Aldrich v. Concord, etc., R. R. Co., 67 N. H. 250; Alcorn v. Chicago, etc., Railroad Co., 108 Mo. 81; Louisville, etc., R. R. Co. v. Malone, 109 Ala. 509; Anson v. Evans, 19 Colo. 274; Gulf, etc., Ry. Co. v. Compton, 75 Tex. 667; Sappenfield v. Main Street, etc., Railroad Co., 91 Cal. 48; Giffin v. City of Lewiston, 55 Pac. Repr. (Idaho) 545; Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. Wyatt, 104 Tenn. 432; Standard Oil Co. v. Tierney, 17 S. W. Repr. (Ky.) 1025; Louisville, etc., Railroad Co. v. Bowen, 39 S. W. Repr. (Ky.) 31; Noble v. St. Joseph, etc., St. Ry. Co., 98 Mich. 249. With these decisions we are in entire accord. The cases are however to be distinguished from a class with which they are sometimes confounded, in which evidence of acts of repair or construction is received to prove dominion or control.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">The only remaining question raised by the specifications that need be considered is whether there was error in the instruction that the plaintiffs could not recover without affirmative proof of negligence that caused the explosion. If we assume that proof of the fact of the explosion of the boiler, resulting in injury to a person not connected with the defendant\u2019s works, made out a prima facie case which called for explanation by the defendant, and in the absence of it would sustain a verdict on the ground of negligence, the only burden cast on the defendant was to show that due care had been exercised. In the exceptional cases in which the maxim, res ipsa loquatur, applies, the burden on the defendant is not that of satisfactorily accounting for the accident, but of showing freedom from fault: Stearns v. Ontario Spinning Co., 184 Pa. 519; East End Oil Co. v. Penna. Torpedo Co., 190 Pa. 350. The plaintiffs did not rest on proof of the explosion and leave the duty of explanation with the defendant. In order to establish a basis for a theory advanced by experts they proved the circumstances under which the explosion took place, and all the facts connected with the operation and management of the boiler, and on these proofs the case was submitted to the jury. This testimony not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>only failed to show negligence, but it affirmatively showed that ordinary care had been exercised, and rebutted any presumption that might be said to arise from the mere fact of the explosion.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
