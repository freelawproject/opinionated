He assigns error to the court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and to the overruling of his demurrer to the indictments charging violations of ORS 163.673 and ORS 163.670.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">At 7:45 a.m., on January 27,1989, Deputy Stephens, U.S. Marshall Barr and 4 other officers executed a warrant for the arrest of defendant for a federal narcotics violation. The officers considered it a high risk operation. Stephens knocked on the door of defendant\u2019s residence and yelled, \u201cPolice, arrest warrant.\u201d Barr tried the door knob and, finding it locked, kicked in the glass door. Deputy Eastham entered first, followed by Stephens and Barr. All of them were carrying weapons. Outside, two other officers guarded the other doors to the house. The officers found defendant and his wife in the doorway between their bedroom and the kitchen. Defendant was naked, and his wife wore only a robe. Eastham pointed his pistol at the couple and ordered them to lie on the floor. Both were then handcuffed with their hands behind their backs, facing the floor. Barr told defendant that he had a federal warrant for his arrest, but did not present it and did not give <em>Miranda </em>warnings to either defendant or his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Stephens and Deputies Downing and Chilcote conducted a \u201csecurity sweep\u201d of the house, the attic crawlspace and outbuildings for weapons and other persons. Stephens saw some rifles on the closet wall in a spare room and seized them. At some point while defendant\u2019s wife was still on the floor, Barr shouted \u201cFuck you\u201d at her, apparently in response to her question about her cat. Defendant and his wife answered questions about the location of other firearms. About 20 minutes after the initial entry and the discovery and seizure of numerous weapons, defendant was allowed to dress and was then taken to the police car.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Barr moved defendant\u2019s wife, still handcuffed, to the sofa and explained that he had no warrant for her arrest. Without advising her of her rights, he asked if there were any other weapons. She said that she thought that her husband had a gun in the car that was parked in front of the house and, when the officers asked whether they could search the car, she said, \u201cSure.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Barr went to the squad car and told defendant that his wife had granted permission to \u201clook through\u201d the car for a weapon. Defendant told him that there was a .45 pistol under the front seat. Barr looked there but could not find it. He told that to defendant, who said that it was \u201cthere somewhere.\u201d Barr returned and conducted a more intensive search, during which he found two metal suitcases and a cloth satchel about the size of a briefcase. He opened the metal cases and found only camera equipment. He then opened the satchel and found a black plastic box, variously described as being 8 x 12 x 2 inches or 5 x 7 x 2 inches. Barr testified that, although the box did not look like a weapon container, he thought that it could have contained the gun, so he opened it. In it, he found proof sheets of photographs of a child under 18, a few of which revealed her genitals and anus. Those pictures formed the basis for two of defendant\u2019s convictions. Stephens and Eastham read defendant his <em>Miranda </em>rights as they drove him to the county jail; Chilcote, Downing and Barr remained with defendant\u2019s wife as defendant was driven away.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">During the ensuing investigation, the photographed child\u2019s statement was taken, and a warrant was obtained for the search of defendant\u2019s residence for other pictures. When the officers executed the warrant, they did not find any other pictures but did find methamphetamine in the bedroom, the spare room and the garage shop. That evidence was the basis for defendant\u2019s unlawful possession conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Defendant moved to suppress the fruits of the search of his car and all of the evidence seized pursuant to the search warrant that was based on that evidence, contending that it was \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d He also filed a demurrer, contending that ORS 163.673 and ORS 163.670, under which he was charged, are unconstitutionally vague and overbroad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>under Oregon Constitution, Article I, section 8,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> violate Article I, sections 20 and 21,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by unlawfully delegating legislative power to the court and jury, and also violate his rights under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the federal constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court overruled the demurrer and denied the motion to suppress. If defendant\u2019s demurrer should have been sustained, the charges under ORS 163.673 and ORS 163.670 should have been dismissed. Accordingly, we consider that question first.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">ORS 163.673 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">\u201c (1) A person commits the crime of dealing in depictions of a child\u2019s sexual conduct if the person knowingly:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">\u201c(a) Develops, duplicates, publishes, prints, disseminates, exchanges, displays, finances, attempts to finance, or sells any photographs or other visual recording that depicts a child under 18 years of age in an act of sexually explicit conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">ORS 163.670 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct if the person employs, authorizes, permits, compels or induces a child under 18 years of age to participate or engage in sexually explicit conduct for any person to observe or to record in a photograph or other visual recording.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>ORS 163.665 provided,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-4\">\u201c \u2018Sexually explicit conduct\u2019 means actual or simulated * * * (6) <em>Lewd exhibition </em>of genitals or anus.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">We consider state constitutional questions before reaching federal questions. <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>295 Or 260, 262, 666 P2d 1316 (1983). Defendant\u2019s primary argument is that the phrase \u201clewd exhibition\u201d is unconstitutionally vague. Although the indictment charging defendant with violating ORS 163.670 does not allege what \u201csexually explicit conduct\u201d he induced the child to engage in, the charges under ORS 163.673 do allege conduct: \u201clewd exhibition of the genitals and anus.\u201d Defendant demurred to both indictments, and the state has not distinguished between them in responding. Apparently, the state concedes that the \u201csexually explicit conduct\u201d involved in both charges is the same and presents the same question concerning vagueness. Accordingly, we will treat them that way.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\"> To withstand a vagueness challenge, the terms of a criminal statute \u201cmust be sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it of [sic] what conduct on their part will render them liable in penalties.\u201d <em>State v. Graves, </em>299 Or 189, 195, 700 P2d 244 (1985); <em>State v. Knobel, </em>97 Or App 559, 563, 777 P2d 985, <em>rev den </em>309 Or 522 (1989). Terms need not be defined so precisely that, in every instance, a person can predict that a specific act or course of conduct will fall within the statute\u2019s prohibitions. <em>State v. Graves, supra, </em>299 Or at 195; <em>State v. Hendrix, </em>107 Or App 734, 741, 813 P2d 1115 (1991). A person need only be able to have \u201ca reasonable degree of common understanding\u2019 \u2019 of what is forbidden by the statute. <em>Cascade Fireworks v. State of Oregon, 86 </em>Or App 355, 358, 738 P2d 1013 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">When reviewing an assertion of vagueness, it is this court\u2019s duty to construe the statute to salvage its constitutionality, if possible. <em>State v. Cantwell, </em>66 Or App 848, 853, 676 P2d 353, <em>rev den </em>297 or 124 (1984). We start from the premise that, \u201cin performing its law-making role, the legislature intends to act within constitutional bounds.\u201d <em>State v. Cornell/Pinnel, </em>304 Or 27, 31, 741 P2d 501 (1987). Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>\u201clewd\u201d is not expressly defined in ORS 163.670 or ORS 163.673, it is a commonly used word that \u201chas an unmistakable meaningwhichis very well and generally understood.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 53 CJS, \u201cLewdness,\u201d \u00a7 1; <em>see also Dictionary of Criminology </em>127-28 (1965). Indeed, there is a large body of case law recognizing that the term \u201clewd,\u201d when used in a criminal statute to define an offense, connotes an unlawful indulgence in lust or an eagerness for sexual indulgence. <em>People v. Babb, </em>103 Cal App 2d 326, 330, 229 P2d 843, 846 (1951); <em>State v. Trombley, </em>3 Conn Cir 28 206 A2d 482, 484 (1964); <em>State v. Jones, </em>2 Conn Cir 698, 205 A2d 507, 509 (1964); <em>Chesebrough v. State, </em>255 So 2d 675, 677-78 (Fla 1971); <em>Buchanon v. State, </em>111 So 2d 51, 57 (Fla 1959); <em>State v. Brenner, </em>132 NJL 607, 609, 41 A2d 532, 534 (1945).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">Recourse to a dictionary also serves to inform a person of the meaning of \u201clewd.\u201d Although the various dictionary definitions may not be identical, they contain sufficient common elements that indicate with reasonable certainty the nature and character of the conduct forbidden by ORS 163.670 and ORS 163.673.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> An examination of the definitions discloses that \u201clewd\u201d refers to sexually motivated conduct; specifically, it imports the excitement of lust or sexual desire and signifies gross indecency in sexual behavior. <em>See Webster\u2019s New World </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number><em>Dictionary </em>812 (2d College ed 1986); <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>817 (5th ed 1979); <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1301 (unabridged 1971).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We interpret the phrase \u201clewd exhibition of the genitals or anus\u201d in ORS 163.670 and ORS 163.673 to mean exhibition with the intent of stimulating the lust or sexual desires of the person who views it.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">In <em>Palm Gardens, Inc. v. OLCC, </em>15 Or App 20, 31, 514 P2d 888 (1973), we held that the term \u201clewd,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Although <em>Palm Gardens </em>was an administrative law case, the statute there was upheld \u201cunder standards governing review of <em>penal </em>laws challenged for vagueness.\u201d <em>Korgan v. OLCC, </em>72 Or App 31, 36, 695 P2d 81, <em>rev den </em>299 Or 443 (1985). (Emphasis supplied.) Therefore, its holding is persuasive that the phrase \u201clewd exhibition\u201d is not unconstitutionally vague.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>1 \u2018through its long use in the criminal law, * * * indicates with sufficient specificity the proscribed conduct so that men of ordinary understanding can govern their activities, and, consequently it is not unconstitutionally vague.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Defendant also contends that ORS 163.670 and ORS 163.673 are overbroad. The crux of his argument is that, \u201cbecause \u2018lewd exhibition\u2019 has <em>no definition, no standard for application, and no consistent </em>use\u201d (emphasis supplied), ORS 163.670 and ORS 163.673 necessarily proscribe conduct that is protected by Article I, section 8. However, a constitutional claim that a statute is defective because it fails to define and communicate its coverage is a claim of vagueness, not over-breadth. <em>State v. Robertson, </em>293 Or 402, 408-10, 649 P2d 569 (1982). Defendant essentially asserts that the statutes are overbroad because they are vague. He has failed to discern that \u201c[v]agueness and overbreadth * * * are not two alternative or cumulative epithets for the same shortcoming.\u201d 293 Or at 407. A statute that is overbroad</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\">\u201cis not vague, or need not be. Its vice is not failure to communicate. Its vice may be clarity. For a law is overbroad to the extent that it announces a prohibition that reaches conduct which may not be prohibited.\u201d <em>State v. </em>Blocker, 291 Or 255, 261, 630 P2d 824 (1981).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Because we have determined that the phrase \u201clewd exhibition\u201d is not unconstitutionally vague, and because defendant has failed to demonstrate any other way in which ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>163.670 and ORS 163.673 condemn conduct that is shielded by Article I, section 8, we reject his contention that the statutes are overbroad.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">For the same reasons, ORS 163.670 and ORS 163.673 are not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad under the United States Constitution. <em>See Osborne v. Ohio, </em>495 US 103, 110 S Ct 1691, 109 L Ed 2d 98 (1990); <em>New York v. Ferber, </em>458 US 747, 102 S Ct 3348, 73 L Ed 2d 1113 (1982).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">With respect to all of the charges, defendant assigns error to the court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. In denying the motion, the court concluded that neither defendant nor his wife voluntarily consented to the search of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>car, but held that the search was justified as a safety measure and by exigent circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"> Defendant contends, first, that any authority to search the car given by him or his wife was preceded by police illegality in failing to advise them of their rights and in seizing a police scanner without a warrant. Although those facts do not necessitate suppression of the evidence obtained in the ensuing search, they are relevant to a determination of whether the consents were voluntary. <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>290 Or 493, 624 P2d 99 (1981). The state has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the consents were voluntary. <em>State v. Stevens, </em>311 Or 119, 137, 806 P2d 92 (1991); Or Const, Art I, \u00a7\u00a7 9, 12. The burden of proving voluntariness does not become greater because the consents followed illegal police conduct, but remains at a preponderance of the evidence standard. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>120 Or App 151, 155, 851 P2d 1160 (1993). However, it will be more difficult to surmount the preponderance hurdle, \u201cbecause there is already appreciable evidence that weighs against a finding of voluntariness.\u201d <em>State v. Johnson, supra, </em>120 Or App at 155. Here, the trial court did not impose a higher burden on the state. The critical inquiry in this case is whether, under the totality of the circumstances, defendant\u2019s and his wife\u2019s consents to search were products of their own free will and not the result of coercion, express or implied. <em>State v. Ledbetter, </em>95 Or App 187, 190, 768 P2d 431 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The trial court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">\u201cThe Court is satisfied that, you know, that this was a very coercive situation. There was the nature of the entry that had occurred, the fact that the entry and the individuals there were part of the police \u2014 the Sheriffs office tactical team. The \u2014 that they had seized the weapons in the spare bedroom without asking for any consent and the factor that the police were still obviously very concerned about their own safety and the location of any other weapons in the area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">\u201cAnd as deputy Chilcote testified that Ms. Meyer would, appeared to be somewhat coward [sic] by the situation and Officer Stephens testified, you know, that she was rattled or unnerved, but seemed to settle down some later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-8\">\u201cI further find that at the time the discussion concerning * * * the search of the Jeep occurred that she was still in handcuffs. Although she had been told that she was not going <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>to be arrested, there was no indication that she had had any prior experience with law enforcement officers that would allow a person to be in a more objective, or calmer situation when dealing with police officers and have some greater recognition of her \u2014 of the rights that she did have and the manner in which they could be enforced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-4\">\u201cAnd I\u2019m satisfied that she could very reasonably believe that if she did not consent that they were going to search the vehicle anyway. And, therefore, I am satisfied that Ms. Meyer\u2019s consent was * * * more the product of that coercive, at most, fear and that it was not freely and voluntarily given and that the State cannot rely upon her consent for the search of that vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Those findings are supported by the evidence, and we are bound by them. <em>Ball v. Gladden, </em>250 Or 485, 443 P2d 621 (1968). The findings support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the wife\u2019s consent to search was not freely and voluntarily given, with which we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\"> The officers did not ask defendant for his consent to search the car. The trial court found that Barr <em>told </em>defendant that his wife had given them permission to search for a weapon and that defendant responded by indicating where the weapon would be \u2014under the front seat. The state argues that his failure to object to the search amounted to an implied consent. The trial court, however, found that defendant\u2019s response was based on the belief that his wife had already consented to the search and held that, because the state could not rely on her consent, it could not rely on defendant\u2019s response when he was told about it. We agree. <em>State v. Freund, </em>102 Or App 647, 796 P2d 656 (1990). It also held that, because the police knew that defendant was an ex-convict, they could not have asked him about a gun in the car without first advising him of his rights, which they did not do until they were driving him to jail. The court was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The state contends, nevertheless, that, even without consent, the search was justified as a safety measure. <em>State v. Bates, </em>304 Or 519, 524, 747 P2d 991 (1987). The trial court agreed. The state points out that defendant was in a police car next to defendant\u2019s car. However, he was handcuffed and at least one officer was with him. There is <em>no </em>evidence that he posed a threat to their safety. It also argues that defendant\u2019s wife might have gone for the gun after she was released and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>might have tried to free her husband. It is clear, however, that defendant was driven away before his wife was released; three officers remained with her after defendant had been driven away. The state also contends that the officers might have been shot by her after they released her and went to their car. Although courts should not uncharitably second-guess an officer\u2019s judgment, <em>State v. Bates, supra, </em>304 Or at 524, we do not believe that there is any evidence in this record to support a finding that defendant\u2019s wife posed a threat of serious physical injury to the officers. Although she may have been uncooperative immediately after the officers entered her home, she did cooperate after the situation had calmed down by telling them where they might find guns, including the possibility of finding one in the car. She also allowed them to search her purse for identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">A similar safety argument was made in <em>State v. Jones, </em>103 Or App 316, 797 P2d 385 (1990). The defendant had been arrested on an outstanding warrant for driving while suspended. A search incident to the arrest produced a sawed-off rifle from defendant\u2019s pant leg and a metal Sucrets box from his pocket. In the box were razor blades and bundles of heroin and cocaine. The search of the box was held to be unlawful because, \u2018 \u2018once it was in [the officer\u2019s] possession, he no longer had reason to believe that it posed a threat to him.\u201d 103 Or App at 319. Similarly in this case, the metal box could have been withheld from defendant and his wife if it was believed to contain the gun for which the officers were searching. Any threat that the box might have posed and, accordingly, any authority to act for officer safety, dissipated as soon as the box was in the control of the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Finally, the state contends, and the trial court held, that the search of the box was justified by probable cause and exigent circumstances. Although Barr had probable cause to believe that a pistol was in the car \u201csomewhere,\u201d there is no evidence that he had probable cause to believe that it was in the box. He testified that the box <em>could </em>have contained one. The state argues, however, that nothing in the record suggests that the weight of the box was inconsistent with its containing a gun. The burden was on the state to prove that the weight of the box gave the officer probable cause to believe that there was a gun in it.

That observation made by the <em>Henry </em>court does not lend credence to the dissent\u2019s position.

The court did not, however, suggest or even hint that those terms were themselves vague, indefinite or unclear.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b368-6\"> The dissent\u2019s extensive analysis under Article I, section 8, although probing and insightful, has no place in the analysis of this case. Essentially, the dissent has rewritten defendant\u2019s brief for him. Defendant does not cite any of the cases on which the dissent relies nor does he make any arguments that even remotely resemble those manufactured by the dissent. Contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertion, the mere fact that defendant makes the conclusory statement that ORS 163.670 and ORS 163.673 violate Article I, section 8, will not trigger application of the established analytical framework for determining the constitutionality of a statute challenged under that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Defendant does not contend that ORS 163.670 and ORS 163.673 violate Article I, section 8, on their face. He argues only that the trial court erred in holding that the statutes are not unconstitutionally overbroad under Article I, section 8. However, as mentioned in the text, his overbreadth argument is, in actuality, a vagueness argument under Article I, sections 20 and 21. <em>State v. Graves, supra, </em>299 Or at 195; <em>State v. Robertson, supra, </em>293 Or at 407. Consequently, the protections afforded by Article I, section 8, are not implicated and, therefore, are not at issue. Although defendant makes a blanket assertion that ORS 163.670 and ORS 163.673 proscribe conduct that is protected by Article I, section 8, he does not present <em>any </em>argument supporting that claim and we will not, and should not, craft one for him. ORAP 5.45(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">It is worth noting that the charges brought against defendant did not involve conduct that could be classified as expressive or communicative in nature. Under ORS 163.670, the indictment charged him with employing, authorizing, permitting, and inducing a child to engage in sexually explicit conduct for another person to photograph. The indictment under ORS 163.673 accused defendant of developing and duplicating a photograph depicting a child engaged in sexually explicit conduct. Such behavior is not intended to express an idea or opinon and, therefore, does not fall within the protective parameters of Article I, section 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b368-9\"> In <em>Osborne, </em>the United States Supreme Court upheld an Ohio statute that was construed by the Supreme Court of Ohio to prohibit \u201cthe possession or viewing of material or performance of a minor who is in a state of nudity, where such nudity constitutes a <em>lewd exhibition </em>or involves a graphic focus on the genitals * * *.\u201d 495 US at 113.

Because defendant should not be retried under those indictments, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">The indictments charged defendant with violating ORS 163.673 and ORS 163.670. Defendant contends that those statutes violate Article I, section 8, of the Oregon Constitution because they forbid expression and are unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The state acknowledges that the dispute centers on the definition of \u201csexually explicit conduct\u201d in ORS 163.665(2)(f):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-9\">\u201c \u2018Sexually explicit conduct\u2019 means actual or simulated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-10\">\u201c(f) Lewd exhibition of the genitals or anus.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-11\">However, the state contends that ORS 163.670 and ORS 163.673, which incorporate that definition, do not restrict protected expression and are not vague or overbroad. Although ORS 163.665(2) describes various forms of sexually explicit conduct, the parties agree that this case involves only that form described in ORS 163.665(2)(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>The majority decides that the statutes are not vague or overbroad and rejects defendant\u2019s Article I, section 8 challenge. Those holdings are erroneous because they are unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">The majority opinion is notable for its failure to follow over a decade of decisions from the Oregon Supreme Court requiring that we follow a precise analytical framework in assessing the constitutionality of a statute challenged under Article I, section 8. <em>See Moser v. Frohnmayer, </em>315 Or 372, 845 P2d 1284 (1993); <em>State v. Plowman, </em>314 Or 157, 163, 838 P2d 558 (1992); <em>Oregon State Police Assn. v. State of Oregon, </em>308 Or 531, 783 P2d 7 (1989), <em>cert den </em>498 US 810 (1990); <em>City of Portland v. Tidyman, </em>306 Or 174, 759 P2d 242 (1988) (\u201cadult business\u201d ordinance); <em>State v. Henry, </em>302 Or 510, 732 P2d 9 (1987); <em>State v.

That analysis requires us to determine at the outset whether the government enactment on its face restrains speech, within the meaning of Article I, section 8. <em>State v. Moyle, supra, </em>299 Or at 695. If the law restrains the free expression of opinion, we must inquire whether the restraint was well established in law when the American guarantees of free speech were adopted and is one that those guarantees demonstrably were not intended to abolish. <em>State v. Henry, supra, </em>302 Or at 514. If the government demonstrates that the law falls wholly within an historical exception, it will not, on its face, violate Article I, section 8. <em>State v. Robertson, supra, </em>293 Or at 412. However, that enactment will be scrutinized for possible overbreadth, and may be narrowly construed, if possible, to confine it to the constitutional limits intended by the lawmakers. <em>State v. Moyle, supra, </em>299 Or at 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">A law that does not fall within an historical exception must be analyzed to determine whether the focus of it, as written, is on an identifiable, serious and imminent effect or harm that may be forbidden, rather than on communication itself. <em>See Oregon State Police Assn. v. State of Oregon, supra, </em>308 Or at 536. If the statute identifies in its text the actual harm it forbids, rather than prohibiting the use of words, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>then it does not violate Article I, section 8, on its face. <em>See State v. Ray, </em>302 Or 595, 598, 733 P2d 28 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">If a statute is directed only against causing the forbidden effects, a person accused of causing those effects by language or gestures could assert either that the law is unconstitutional as applied to his particular expression or that it is unconstitutionally vague, <em>i.e., </em>that it is drawn in terms that fail to give notice to potential defendants of the conduct that is prohibited and delegates uncontrolled discretion to the judge or jury to punish or withhold punishment. <em>See State v. Moyle, supra, </em>299 Or at 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Defendant\u2019s contention that the statutes violate Article I, section 8, triggers the application of this established framework for evaluating whether a law violates that provision. <em>State v. Plowman, </em>314 Or 157, 163, 838 P2d 558 (1992). He asserted in his demurrer claims that ORS 163.665(6) is unconstitutionally vague and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">\u201c[proscribing the free depiction of nudity by photographs also violates Defendant\u2019s Article I, Section 8 rights under the Oregon Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">On appeal, he again asserts his claims that \u201cthe statutes from which the indictments were drawn are unconstitutionally both vague and overbroad and flatly violative of Oregon\u2019s Article I, section 8.\u201d The majority cannot evade the required methodology by claiming that defendant failed to invoke his rights under Article I, section 8. Even if he had only asserted claims of vagueness and overbreadth, we would be required to decide whether the challenged laws pass muster under the <em>State v. Robertson </em>framework. In <em>State v. Garcias, </em>296 Or 688, 695, 679 P2d 1354 (1984), the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\">\u201cBefore we address defendants\u2019 claims of overbreadth and vagueness we must consider first whether this law could be enacted at all in light of [Article I, section 8].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">The majority should apply, not ignore, the required method of analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">I turn to the merits. ORS 163.673(l)(a) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-12\">\u201c (1) A person commits the crime of dealing in depictions of sexual conduct involving a child if the person knowingly:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>\u201c(a) Develops, duplicates, publishes, prints, disseminates, exchanges, displays, finances, attempts to finance, or sells any photograph, motion picture, videotape or other visual recording of sexually explicit conduct involving a child***\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">Under the <em>State v. Robertson </em>methodology, ORS 163.673 (l)(a) forbids expression. Photographs or video recordings are constitutionally protected forms of speech and printing, and they do not lose their protection because they convey a sexually explicit content. <em>See City of Portland v. Tidyman, supra, </em>306 Or at 191 (adult bookstore ordinance held an. unconstitutional infringement of the right of free speech and printing under Article I, section 8); <em>State v. Henry, supra, </em>302 Or at 525. In view of the restrictions in the text on publication, printing and dissemination of photographs and video recordings, it is difficult to imagine a clearer prior restraint on the creation or free exchange of pictorial communication. The State made no showing at trial or on appeal, that the statute satisfied the \u201chistorical exception\u201d doctrine. <em>State v. Henry </em>militates against a conclusion that this statute has survived the adoption of the American constitutional guarantees of free speech. 302 Or at 520. By following the required methodology, I conclude that Article I, section 8 deprived the legislature of power to enact ORS 163.673(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">ORS 163.670 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">\u201cA person commits the crime of using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct if the person employs, authorizes, permits, compels or induces a child to participate or engage in sexually explicit conduct for any person to observe or to record in a photograph, motion picture, videotape or other visual recording.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Although the legislature can reasonably regulate the nuisance aspect of <em>adult </em>sexually explicit photography and video recordings in the interest of children, it cannot do so by restricting the speech aspect of those activities. <em>City of Portland v. Tidyman, supra, </em>306 Or at 193. (Jones, J., specially concurring). This statute forbids using children in sexually explicit conduct but only if the activity is connected to the creation or observation of a visual recording. It does not forbid an identifiable effect without restricting communication itself. <em>Oregon State Police Assn. v. State of Oregon, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number><em>supra, </em>308 Or at 536. The statute could be drafted to regulate the perceived nuisance aspects of this form of pictorial communication to protect minors, but it does not address that proper objective in its present form.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Even if the challenged statutes could be viewed as restrictions on a forbidden effect that make no reference to expression, they are unconstitutionally vague because they regulate communication only if it is \u201clewd.\u201d <em>See State v. Graves, </em>299 Or 189, 195, 700 P2d 244 (1985), which holds that vague criminal laws offend Article I, sections 20 and 21, of the Oregon Constitution. <em>See also State v. Spencer, </em>289 Or 225, 231, 611 P2d 1147 (1980), which implies that vagueness in a law concerning speech also violates Article I, section 8, and holds that that defect may be raised by demurrer without considering \u201cwhat the conduct is in the individual case.\u201d 289 Or at 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">In <em>State v. Henry, </em>78 Or App 392, 717 P2d 189 (1986), <em>aff\u2019d on other grounds, </em>302 Or 510, 732 P2d 9 (1987), this court held that a statute that forbade distribution of \u201cobscene\u201d materials was unconstitutionally vague. Our opinion, with which the Supreme Court expressly did not disagree, 302 Or at 513, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">\u201cBecause ORS 167.087(2) must be used by judges, juries and potential defendants to assess the criminality of particular conduct, we hold that its definitions are not sufficiently precise to determine whether particular sexually explicit material is legally obscene. It is not acceptable, as a matter of state constitutional law, that the precise course of the line dividing obscene expression from protected expression be uncertain and that a person who chooses to disseminate sexually explicit materials must bear the risk of that uncertainty. The constitutional right to communicate freely on \u2018any subject whatever\u2019 guaranteed by Article I, section 8, requires more than the statute provides by way of guidance. A person who trades in sexually explicit materials cannot discern that his wares are legally obscene under the statute; a trial judge is left with no legal standard to apply; and jurors are required to determine what is or is not obscene on the basis of their personal ideas of contemporary state standards.\u201d 78 Or App at 405.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>In <em>State v.

Those definitions are an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to \u00bfjudge or jury, permitting a judge or jury to decide what the law will be, hinging on a case-by-case adjudication. In a law censoring speech such an indeterminate test is intolerable. <em>State v. Henry, </em>302 Or 510, 513, 732 P2d 9 (1987).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-5\"><em>State v.

That is not acceptable when constitutionally protected freedom of expression hangs in the balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">The majority relies on two of our cases and a host of dictionary definitions for its conclusion that \u201clewd\u201d is not unconstitutionally vague. The variety of the dictionary definitions demonstrates that the meaning of \u201clewd\u201d is subjective and far from unmistakable. We should not attempt to contrive a definition for an amorphous term in a criminal statute that impinges on expression. Policymaking of that kind is the legislature\u2019s task.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">The short answer to the majority\u2019s citation of <em>Palm Gardens, Inc. v. OLCC, </em>15 Or App 20, 514 P2d 888 (1973), <em>rev </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number><em>den </em>(1974) and <em>Korgan v. OLCC, </em>72 Or App 31, 695 P2d 81, <em>rev den </em>299 Or 443 (1985), is that those cases pre-date <em>Henry </em>and <em>Ray </em>and do not reflect the Supreme Court\u2019s current analysis of vague terms that forbid expression. Furthermore, assuming arguendo that \u201clewd\u201d is an acceptable term controlling statutory interpretation by an administrative agency, it does not adequately separate permitted from prohibited expression for criminal law enforcement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Defendant\u2019s demurrer should have been sustained in CA A61964 and CA A61965. Accordingly, I dissent from the majority\u2019s ruling on the demurrer.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b378-5\"> The following passage in <em>State v. </em>Blair, 287 Or 519, 524, 601 P2d 766 (1979), is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">\u201cThis is not the place to suggest how to write a valid statute or whether the foregoing elements would suffice, and we intend no such implication. We mention them only to point out that in enacting ORS 166.065(1) the Legislative Assembly expressed a policy of protecting persons against imposition of annoyance and alarm, but it did not face up to the difficult question of exactly how far and against what kind of conduct it intended to extend that protection. A policy so expressed may well be adequate guidance for an administrative agency, but it is not adequate for criminal law enforcement.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
