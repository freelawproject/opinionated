He\u2019s gotta die.\u201d Then, he hit his father on the head with a hammer. On August 8, 1986, petitioner was found guilty except for insanity<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of his father\u2019s murder. The circuit court placed him under the jurisdiction of the Psychiatric Security Review Board (PSRB) and committed him to the Oregon State Hospital. <em>See </em>ORS 161.327.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Early in 1991, petitioner asked PSRB to conduct a hearing to determine whether he was still affected by a mental disease or defect and whether he should be granted a conditional release from the state hospital.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> PSRB scheduled the hearing for June 10. Before the hearing, petitioner\u2019s attorney wrote a letter to PSRB \u201crequesting the appointment of an independent psychiatrist or psychologist to examine-[petitioner] * * * pursuant to ORS 161.346 and OAR 859-50-095(4).\u201d The letter did not explain why petitioner desired an examination by an independent psychiatrist or psychologist. PSRB\u2019s executive director responded by letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">\u201cOn March 1, 1991 the Board [reviewed] the above request. At that time the Board denied this request. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>However, you may submit additional information stating the purpose of the evaluation in this case. The matter could then be brought to the Board for administrative review.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Petitioner never provided additional information in support of his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">After the hearing, PSRB issued an order on June 17, in which it found that petitioner was still affected by a mental disease or defect and that he posed a substantial danger to others. It concluded that he was not a proper subject for a conditional release, and it ordered his continued commitment to the state hospital. Petitioner sought our review of that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">PSRB issued an amended order on March 30, 1992, in which it found that petitioner was affected by a psychotic disorder NOS (not otherwise specified).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Again, it found that he was dangerous, and it continued his commitment. Petitioner sought our review of the amended order, and we granted his motion to consolidate our review of the two orders that PSRB issued with respect to the June 10,1991, hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>In late 1991, petitioner requested a second hearing to determine whether he was still affected by a mental disease or defect and whether his commitment should continue. Before that hearing, he filed a motion requesting that PSRB appoint a psychiatrist or psychologist to examine him at the state\u2019s expense. Petitioner\u2019s attorney submitted an affidavit in support of the motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-4\">\u201cI am informed and on such information believe that [petitioner] is presently fit for discharge or conditional release under the criteria'set forth in ORS 161.341(4);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">\u201c[An] independent examination of his mental state is essential, particularly given the \u2018soft\u2019 diagnoses presently in the record[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">PSRB denied the motion by letter on October 24. In that letter, PSRB\u2019s executive director explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">\u201c[PSRB] met and administratively reviewed your motion and affidavit for appointment of an independent psychologist or psychiatrist to examine [petitioner] in preparation for his upcoming hearing before the Board. After due consideration, the Board decided to deny this request.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">PSRB conducted the hearing on October 28, 1991, and issued an order on November 18,1991. In its order, PSRB found that petitioner was still affected by a psychiatric disorder NOS in remission and that he continued to be a substantial danger to others, and it continued his commitment. We affirmed that order without opinion. 115 Or App 757,838 P2d 1119 (1992). Petitioner filed a petition for Supreme Court review of that decision. ORAP 9.05. We treat the petition as one for reconsideration, ORAP 9.15(1), and allow it. For opinion purposes only, we consolidate both cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">In both cases, petitioner made three assignments of error. We address only his contentions that PSRB erred by denying his requests to authorize funds for an examination by an independent psychiatrist or psychologist. We affirm the orders that relate to the June 10, 1991, hearing, and we reverse and remand to PSRB for further proceedings related to the October 28, 1991, hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">Petitioner was found guilty of murdering his father. Because he was found to be insane at the time he committed the offense, the court placed him under PSRB\u2019s jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>and committed him to the state hospital. ORS 161.327. Unlike a person who is sentenced to a prison term, a person who has been committed to the state hospital may, once every six months, petition for a discharge or conditional release. ORS 161.34K5).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"> An indigent person who seeks a discharge or conditional release is entitled to \u201csuitable legal counsel possessing skills and experience commensurate with the nature and complexity of the case.\u201d ORS 161.346(6)(d). A statutory right to counsel includes a right to adequate counsel. <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Geist, </em>310 Or 176, 185, 796 P2d 1193 (1990). Concomitant with petitioner\u2019s right to counsel is his right to \u201creasonable expenses * * * in respect to the hearing.\u201d ORS 161.346(11). Petitioner contends that an examination by an independent psychiatrist or psychologist constitutes a reasonable expense, because \u201cit is difficult, if not impossible, for counsel to be effective without access to an expert witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">PRSB \u2019 s own rules provide a framework for exercising its discretion when responding to a petitioner\u2019s request for it to appoint a psychiatrist or a psychologist. OAR 859-50-095 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">\u201c[PSRB] may appoint a psychiatrist or licensed psychologist to examine the person [who has applied for discharge or conditional release] and submit a report to [PSRB], including an opinion as to the mental condition of the person, whether the person presents a substantial danger to others and whether the person could be adequately controlled on conditional release with treatment and supervision:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-8\">\u201c(4) The attorney for the patient may file a written request for [PSRB] to appoint a psychiatrist or licensed psychologist to examine the patient. [PSRB] shall approve or deny the request, <em>taking into consideration the budget of [PSRB] available for such examinations and the reasons for the request.'''' </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUN\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Petitioner does not contend that PSRB exceeded its authority by promulgating OAR 859-50-095.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In fact, he cited subsection (4) of that rule in support of his request for the appointment of a psychiatrist or psychologist before the first hearing. Accordingly, we limit our inquiry to whether petitioner and PSRB satisfied their respective burdens under that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">In order for PSRB to perform its balancing duty under OAR 859-50-095(4), a petitioner must provide a written request for the appointment of a psychiatrist or psychologist. That request must include a statement of the petitioner\u2019s \u201creasons for the request.\u201d That requirement imposes a burden on the petitioner to demonstrate the need for an independent examination. <em>Cf. State v. Langley, </em>314 Or 247, 253, 839 P2d 692 (1992) (criminal defendant\u2019s burden to justify expert witness expenses).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">When petitioner\u2019s attorney wrote to PSRB before the first hearing, he did not explain why he was requesting the appointment of an independent psychiatrist or psychologist. PSRB responded by indicating that \u201cyou may submit additional information stating the purpose of the evaluation.\u201d Petitioner did not. He failed to provide PSRB with information that could have enabled it to make an informed decision whether to grant his request. Because petitioner did not satisfy his burden to demonstrate his need for an independent examination, PSRB did not err by denying his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">However, in the motion that he filed before the second hearing, petitioner\u2019s attorney did explain his need for an independent examination. He explained, in his affidavit, that he believed that petitioner was fit for discharge or conditional release. He emphasized the \u201csoft\u201d diagnoses in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>the record.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although his reasons might have been more elaborately stated, he clearly indicated his belief that the evidence favoring petitioner\u2019s continued commitment was weak. His characterization of the diagnoses as \u201csoft\u201d was borne out by the testimony of petitioner\u2019s treating psychiatrist at the second hearing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Petitioner sufficiently demonstrated his need for an examination by an independent psychiatrist or psychologist before the second hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Our next inquiry is whether PSRB properly exercised its discretion when it denied his request. OAR 859-50-095(4) provides the framework for PSRB\u2019s exercise of discretion when deciding whether to appoint a psychiatrist or psychologist. PSRB was required to follow its own rule. <em>Accident Prevention Div. v. Asana, </em>110 Or App 103, 107, 821 P2d 432 (1991). We cannot determine whether PSRB weighed the legitimacy of petitioner\u2019s proffered reasons against its budget constraints, because PSRB summarily denied his request without any explanation. Its executive director simply wrote to petitioner\u2019s attorney and indicated, \u201cAfter due consideration, the Board decided to deny this request. \u2019 \u2019 That letter was insufficient to allow us to determine whether PSRB exercised or abused its discretion, because it was not accompanied by a reasoned explanation for its decision. Requiring PSRB to explain its decision would be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">\u201ccompletely consistent with the legislative policy embodied in the Administrative Procedure Act (and throughout the statutes) that decisions by administrative agencies shall be principled and fair, rather than <em>ad hoc </em>and unstructured.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number><em>Anderson v. Board of Parole, </em>303 Or 618, 636, 740 P2d 760 (1987) (Gillette, J., dissenting).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">We vacate PSRB\u2019s order in case number CA A73105 and remand with instructions to reassess petitioner\u2019s motion and to explain, on the record, the reasons for its decision. If PRSB grants petitioner\u2019s motion, it shall, after petitioner is examined by the independent psychiatrist or psychologist, conduct another hearing to determine whether petitioner is still affected by a mental disease or defect and whether he should be granted a conditional release. If PSRB denies petitioner\u2019s motion, it shall reinstate its November 18, 1991, order.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">CA A71148 and CA A75266 affirmed. CA A73105, reconsideration allowed; this court\u2019s memorandum opinion of October 14,1992, withdrawn; PSRB order of November 18, 1992, vacated; remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b487-7\"> ORS 161.295 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-8\">\u201c(1) A person is guilty except for insanity if, as a result of mental disease or defect at the time of engaging in criminal conduct, the person lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality of the conduct or to conform the conduct to the requirements of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-9\">\u201c(2) As used in [this chapter], the terms \u2018mental disease or defect\u2019 do not include an abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise antisocial conduct, nor do they include any abnormality constituting solely a personality disorder.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b487-10\"> ORS 161.341(4) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-11\">\u201cAny person who has been committed to a state hospital designated by the Mental Health and Developmental Disability Services Division for custody, care and treatment or another person acting on the person\u2019s behalf may apply to TPSRB] for an order of discharge or conditional release upon the grounds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-12\">\u201c(a) That the person is no longer affected by mental disease or defect;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-13\">\u201c(b) If so affected, that the person no longer presents a substantial danger to others; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-14\">\u201c(c) That the person continues to be affected by a mental disease or defect and would continue to be a danger to others without treatment, but that the person can be adequately controlled and given proper care and treatment if placed on conditional release.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b488-7\"> The American Psychiatric Association <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders </em>211 (3d ed 1987), explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\">\u201c[A psychiatric disorder not otherwise specified is a disorder] in which there are psychotic symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, incoherence, marked loosening of associations, catatonic excitement or stupor, or grossly disorganized behavior) that do not meet the criteria for any other nonorganic psychotic disorder.
