In 1991, the legislature amended ORS 137.540(2) to allow jail time as a condition of probation, and made its application retroactive to misdemeanors committed after November 1,1989. In <em>State v. Harding, </em>116 Or App 29, 840 P2d 113 (1992), we held that the application of ORS 137.540(2) to offenses that had been committed after November 1,1989, but before June 10,1991, the effective date of the statute, violated the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws. We therefore remand for resentencing on the two convictions for misdemeanors committed after November 1, 1989. We have considered and reject defendant\u2019s other assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">On counts VI and VII in 90CR0219, condition of probation ordering jail time vacated and remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b569-7\"> The cases were consolidated for trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b569-8\"> The other two convictions were on the basis of misconduct that occurred before November 1,1989.
