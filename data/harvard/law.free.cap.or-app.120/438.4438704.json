ORAP 9.15(1). We allow the petition and adhere to our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The state challenges our holding that vacated compensatory fines to the three rape victims of defendant\u2019s crimes. It argues that we incorrectly interpreted the compensatory fine statute, ORS 137.101,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in concluding that only a victim who has suffered \u201cpecuniary damages\u201d is entitled to a compensatory fine. Under the state\u2019s interpretation, although there was no evidence that established pecuniary loss to the victims, the fact that the victims \u2018 \u2018may well have\u201d a remedy by civil action authorizes a compensatory fine under ORS 137.101(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">In <em>State v. </em>Barkley, 315 Or 420, 846 P2d 390 (1993), the Supreme Court discussed ORS 137.101. The court disagreed with our conclusion that the victim had to have suffered a direct physical injury for payment of a compensatory fine. However, it also held that there are \u201ctwo other hurdles * * * to be cleared before a sentencing court orders a compensatory fine in a particular case.\u201d 315 Or at 437. The person injured has to have a remedy by civil action, and the court must determine that the person has suffered \u201cpecuniary damages\u201d as defined by ORS 137.103(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>The state does not explain why <em>Barkley </em>does not require that pecuniary damages be shown here. In the light of the Supreme Court\u2019s clear statement that such a loss is one of the \u201churdles\u201d before imposition of a compensatory fine, we adhere to our holding that the fines here must be vacated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">Reconsideration allowed; opinion adhered to.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b482-7\"> ORS 137.101(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">\u201c(1) Whenever the court imposes a fine as penalty for the commission of a crime resulting in injury for which the person injured by the act constituting the crime has a remedy by civil action, unless the issue of punitive damages has been previously decided on a civil case arising out of the same act and transaction, the court may order that the defendant pay any portion of the fine separately to the clerk of the court as compensatory fines in the case. The clerk shall pay over to the injured victim or victims, as directed in the court\u2019s order, moneys paid to the court as compensatory fines under this subsection. This section shall be liberally construed in favor of victims.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b482-9\"> ORS 137.103(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-10\">\u201c \u2018Pecuniary damages\u2019 means all special damages, but not general damages, which a person could recover against the defendant in a civil action arising out of the facts or events constituting the defendant\u2019s criminal activities and shall include, but not be limited to, the money equivalent of property taken, destroyed, broken or otherwise harmed, and losses such as medical expenses and costs of psychological treatment or counseling.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b483-5\"> We reject the state\u2019s argument that we should vacate only the portion ordering the fines to be compensatory.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
