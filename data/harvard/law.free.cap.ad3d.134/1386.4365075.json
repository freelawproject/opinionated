As an initial matter, we note that it is undisputed that the paternal grandmother has standing to seek visitation pursuant to Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 72 (1) because the children\u2019s father is deceased (see <em>Matter of E.S. v </em>P.D., 8 NY3d 150, 157 [2007]; <em>see generally Matter of Wilson v McGlinchey, </em>2 NY3d 375, 380 [2004]). We agree with the Attorney for the Children that Family Court properly determined that visitation with the paternal grandmother is in the children\u2019s best interests (see <em>Matter of Varney v McKee, </em>44 AD3d 1178, 1179 [2007]). We agree with the mother, however, that the court abused its discretion in awarding the paternal grandmother excessive visitation that \u201cdeprived the mother of significant quality time with the children\u201d <em>(Matter of Dubiel v Schaefer, </em>108 AD3d 1093, 1095 [2013] [internal quotation marks omitted]; see <em>Cesario v Cesario, </em>168 AD2d 911, 911 [1990]). We therefore modify the order accordingly. Present\u2014Centra, J.P., Peradotto, Carni, Lindley and DeJoseph, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
