On appeal, Fisher\u2019s counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), challenging the sufficiency of the evidence and the denial of Fisher\u2019s request for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>lower sentence. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Fisher\u2019s conviction is supported by the testimony of police officers that a gun was found protruding from beneath the driver\u2019s seat of the car Fisher was driving when he was stopped for a traffic violation, the testimony of a passenger that the gun belonged to Fisher, and the parties\u2019 stipulations about Fisher\u2019s status as a convicted felon and the gun\u2019s travel in interstate commerce. <em>See United States v. Montano, </em>506 F.3d 1128, 1133 (8th Cir.2007) (this court does not review questions involving credibility of witnesses; jury is free to believe testimony of any witness in its entirety); <em>United States v. Walker, </em>393 F.3d 842, 846-47 (8th Cir.2005) (to convict defendant under \u00a7 922(g)(1), government had to prove he had previously been convicted of crime punishable by prison term exceeding one year, and defendant knowingly possessed firearm which had been in or affected interstate commerce); <em>cf. United States v. Tindall, </em>455 F.3d 885, 887 (8th Cir.2006) (evidence sufficient where gun was found under passenger seat and defendant was driver and sole occupant of vehicle).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">As for Fisher\u2019s sentence, because nothing in the record indicates that the district court was unaware of its authority to depart, or that the court\u2019s refusal to do so was based upon an unconstitutional motive, the denial of Fisher\u2019s motion for a downward departure based on his overstated criminal history is unreviewable. <em>See United States v. Morell, </em>429 F.3d 1161, 1164 (8th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Frokjer, </em>415 F.3d 865, 874-75 (8th Cir. 2005). We also conclude that Fisher\u2019s sentence is not unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>518 F.3d 613, 616-17 (8th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">We have independently reviewed the record under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and have found no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b467-33\">. The Honorable Michael J. Davis, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
