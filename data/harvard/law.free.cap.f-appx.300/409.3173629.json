Because substantial evidence supports the DEA\u2019s determination, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Jeffrey Street, a state-licensed pharmacist, opened a Medicine Shoppe pharmacy in Jonesborough, Tennessee in 1994. The pharmacy obtained its federally required certif\u00edcate of registration from the DEA to dispense controlled substances that same year, and Street has owned and operated the pharmacy ever since.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">In 1995, the DEA investigated a physician in the area, Dr. Royce Blackmon, who appeared to be issuing improper prescriptions on a large scale. DEA investigators discovered that Medicine Shoppe had filled an \u201cabnormal\u201d number of Blackmon\u2019s prescriptions, JA 213, which Blackmon often issued \u201cwithout even seeing the patient\u201d and which he told his patients to fill at Medicine Shoppe, JA 11 (internal quotation marks omitted). Two years later, investigators found that Medicine Shoppe, unlike most pharmacies in the area, continued to fill many of Blackmon\u2019s prescriptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">All of this prompted the DEA to investigate Medicine Shoppe. The agency audited the pharmacy in 1999, 2001 and 2002, and in each year it found serious discrepancies between the pharmacy\u2019s records and its on-hand inventory. Medicine Shoppe dispensed controlled substances under suspicious circumstances hundreds of times: It filled prescriptions that exceeded safe limits for specific drugs or combinations, that duplicated or conflicted with other prescriptions the pharmacy had filled for the patient (often issued by other physicians) or that were inconsistent with the issuing doctor\u2019s area of practice. In most of these cases, the pharmacy did not verify the prescription with the issuing doctor first.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">Based on these findings, the DEA ordered Medicine Shoppe to show cause why its registration to dispense controlled substances should not be revoked. In a 96-page order, the Deputy Administrator concluded that Medicine Shoppe\u2019s poor record-keeping, its questionable dispensing practices and its failure to acknowledge its errors or reform its ways warranted revoking its registration (and denying its pending application for renewal). <em>Medicine Shoppe\u2014J</em>onesborough; <em>Revocation of Registration, </em>73 Fed.Reg. 364 (DEA Jan. 2, 2008). Medicine Shoppe petitioned us to review and overturn the DEA\u2019s order. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 877.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">We review the Deputy Administrator\u2019s factual findings for substantial evidence, <em>id,., </em>but we cannot reject his reasoning or discretionary determinations unless they are \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A); <em>Hoxie v. DEA, </em>419 F.3d 477, 482 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-12\">Under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 <em>et seq., </em>a pharmacy may dispense controlled substances only after it has obtained a valid federal registration, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 822(a)(2). The Deputy Administrator may revoke a registration if it determines that the pharmacy \u201chas committed such acts as would render [its] registration ... inconsistent with the public interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 824(a)(4); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 0.100, 0.104. The statute identifies five factors the agency must consider \u201c[i]n determining the public interest\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-14\">(1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>(2) The [registrant\u2019s] experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">(3) The [registrant\u2019s] conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">(4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">(5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 823(f). Although the Deputy Administrator must consider each factor, he need not make findings as to each one and can \u201cgive each factor the weight [he] determines is appropriate.\u201d <em>Hoxie, </em>419 F.3d at 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">In this case, the Deputy Administrator determined that Medicine Shoppe\u2019s failure to maintain adequate required records, its alarming (and unlawful) drug-dispensing practices and its refusal even to acknowledge its poor performance demonstrated that its continued registration was at odds with the public interest. Substantial evidence, we conclude, supports this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\"><em>First, </em>Medicine Shoppe fell short of meeting its duty to maintain accurate records of the controlled substances it dispensed. The CSA requires all prescription-dispensing entities to conduct a biennial inventory of all of the controlled substances it has on-hand and to \u201cmaintain, on a current basis, a complete and accurate record of each [controlled] substance\u201d that it has \u201creceived, sold, delivered, or otherwise disposed of.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 827(a)(1), (3); <em>see also </em>21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1304.21. These records must \u201cinclud[e] the name and address of the person to whom [a drug] was dispensed, the date of dispensing, the number of units or volume dispensed, and the written or typewritten name or initials of the individual who dispensed or administered the substance on behalf of the dispenser.\u201d 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1304.22(c). Records relating to Schedule I and II drugs must be separated from the pharmacy\u2019s other files, while records for other controlled substances must remain \u201creadily retrievable\u201d from the pharmacy\u2019s regular records. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1304.04(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-12\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that Medicine Shoppe\u2019s record-keeping did not satisfy these standards. The 1999, 2001 and 2002 audits all showed substantial shortages and overages in various prescription drugs. The pharmacy disputed the findings of each of the agency\u2019s audits, identifying errors and omissions in each one, but each time its own independent audits confirmed discrepancies involving thousands of dosage units. Small discrepancies, to be sure \u2014 in the neighborhood of 50 dosage units \u2014 are not uncommon. But many of Medicine Shoppe\u2019s tallies missed the mark by a wide margin: Its records for more than half of the drugs examined in its own 1999 audit were off by more than 50 units, in some cases misstating the inventory on hand by more than 100%.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-13\">The Deputy Administrator also found unpersuasive Medicine Shoppe\u2019s \u201chuman error\u201d defense. JA 18 (internal quotation marks omitted). In his testimony, Street chalked up most of the missing and extra drugs to run-of-the-mine mistakes: He or his staff may have mixed up pills containing the same drug in different concentrations or confused a name-brand drug with its generic equivalent, simply \u201cpull[ing] the wrong one off the shelf.\u201d JA 18. But as the Deputy Administrator noted, proof to corroborate Street\u2019s account should have been easy to produce \u2014 as Medicine Shoppe could have tested this hypothesis in its own independent audits \u2014 and yet the pharmacy declined to do so. Even if these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>recurring mistakes reflected no more than human error, the Deputy Administrator explained, they nonetheless posed \u201calarming\u201d risks; dispensing the right drug in the wrong strength \u201ccan have serious consequences for the health of patients.\u201d JA 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">That leaves Medicine Shoppe\u2019s fall-back assertion that, whatever caused the discrepancies, they did not reflect any \u201cdeliberate diversion\u201d of controlled substances. Br. at 18. But this too, the Deputy Administrator correctly concluded, adds nothing to the equation. In imposing the record-keeping requirements, the statute and regulations say nothing about deliberate diversion, much less about making it a prerequisite for finding a pharmacy failed to meet its obligations. Medicine Shoppe\u2019s only evidence on this point, at any rate, was meager at best. <em>See </em>JA 19, 95 n. 57 (attributing no weight to Street\u2019s testimony that neither he nor his employees deliberately diverted drugs, noting that Street never bothered to investigate his employees\u2019 behavior); JA 20, 21 &amp; n. 16, 95 (discounting testimony of Medicine Shoppe\u2019s putative expert concerning the deliberate-diversion issue as he failed to account for several shortages shown in the pharmacy\u2019s independent audits).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\"><em>Second, </em>the pharmacy frequently doled out drugs in an irresponsible and unlawful manner. The CSA forbids a pharmacy to dispense a Schedule II, III or IV controlled substance without a prescription, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 829(a)-(b), which \u201cmust be issued for a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of his professional practice,\u201d 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1306.04(a). Although the main \u201cresponsibility for the proper prescribing and dispensing of controlled substances is upon the prescribing practitioner,\u201d DEA regulations place a \u201ccorresponding responsibility\u201d on the \u201cpharmacist who fills the prescription.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">The DEA\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation is \u201ccontrolling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u201d <em>Auer v. Robbins, </em>519 U.S. 452, 461, 117 S.Ct. 905, 137 L.Ed.2d 79 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). The agency has long interpreted this \u201ccorresponding responsibility\u201d to \u201cmeant ] ... that a pharmacist is obligated to refuse to fill a prescription if he knows or has reason to know that the prescription was not written for a legitimate medical purpose.\u201d <em>MedicAid Pharmacy, </em>55 Fed.Reg. 30,043, 30,044 (DEA July 24, 1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). The regulation thus requires \u201cpharmacists [to] use common sense and professional judgment,\u201d which includes paying attention to the \u201cnumber of prescriptions issued, the number of dosage units prescribed, the duration and pattern of the alleged treatment,\u201d the number of doctors writing prescriptions and whether the drugs prescribed have a high rate of abuse. <em>Ralph J. Bertolino Pharmacy, Inc., </em>55 Fed.Reg. 4,729, 4,730 (DEA Feb. 9, 1990). \u201cWhen [pharmacists\u2019] suspicions are aroused as reasonable professionals,\u201d they must at least verify the prescription\u2019s propriety, and if not satisfied by the answer they must \u201crefuse to dispense.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Henry, </em>727 F.2d 1373,1378-79 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">Tennessee law also places a responsibility on pharmacists to prevent improper prescriptions from being filled. In accordance with the State\u2019s regulations, a pharmacist must undertake a \u201creasonable review of a patient\u2019s record prior to dispensing each medical or prescription order\u201d by examining several enumerated aspects of the patient\u2019s profile before releasing the drugs. Tenn. Comp. R. &amp; Regs. 1140-3-.01(3)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>The record is replete with evidence that Medicine Shoppe fell asleep at the wheel in honoring prescriptions no reasonable pharmacist would fill without further inquiry. For starters, the pharmacy at one stage processed more than one hundred prescriptions every other day written by a veterinarian whose state license and DEA registration were expired, that were issued in the names of several different patients and that were brought to the pharmacy by the veterinarian\u2019s brother. (The patients, it turned out, were all alter-egos of the veterinarian who was abusing the drugs himself.) As the ALJ and the Deputy Administrator recognized, this pattern \u201ceasily could have indicated diversion of controlled substances,\u201d and \u201c[y]et Mr. Street filled these prescriptions without further investigation.\u201d JA 73 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The Deputy Administrator also identified a dozen patients to whom Medicine Shoppe dispensed drugs despite obvious warning signs of \u201cdoctor shopping\u201d and other dangers. JA 81 n. 52. Though the details differ, all of these transactions were variations on a common theme: Street or a substitute pharmacist filled prescriptions that were issued to the same patient by numerous prescribers (sometimes as many as two dozen) or that involved excessive (and potentially toxic) quantities of drugs, two or more conflicting drugs or remedies outside the prescriber\u2019s ordinary area of practice. The pharmacy, for example, filled prescriptions for one patient issued by 21 different prescribers for an array of identical, overlapping or incompatible drugs, resulting in quantities and combinations that the government\u2019s experts concluded would be \u201ctoxic\u201d and potentially \u201cdevastating for the patient,\u201d JA 34 (internal quotation marks omitted). It filled prescriptions for a different patient for hydrocodone and acetaminophen at \u201ctwice the acceptable limits,\u201d JA 30 (internal quotation marks omitted), and for a third patient it dispensed a drug despite written warnings on the package of harmful interactions with another drug the same patient was taking. And for two other patients, it repeatedly filled prescriptions issued by a dentist for large quantities of high-strength cough syrup.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Street, it is true, offered at least partial explanations for all but one of these patients. But as the Deputy Administrator explained, even accepting Street\u2019s testimony as credible, his accounts were inadequate. His explanations as to ten patients were incomplete because they addressed some but not all of the suspicious transactions. As for the other two, Street\u2019s explanations were unpersuasive: One instance involved a patient receiving such a large, unsafe amount of drugs that not even verifying the prescriptions with the issuing practitioner (as Street said he did) could justify filling them, and in the other case Street apparently ignored a drug\u2019s written warnings \u2014 inexcusable under any standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Each case, in short, should have raised red flags at Medicine Shoppe. By filling these prescriptions anyway, the Deputy Administrator reasonably concluded, the pharmacy not only violated its duties under federal (and state) law to ensure that only proper prescriptions were filled but also put public health and safety at risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\"><em>Third, </em>instead of owning up to its mistakes and making amends, Medicine Shoppe remained largely in denial. As the Deputy Administrator concluded, the pharmacy refused \u201ceven [to] acknowledge[ ] that it ha[d] serious recordkeeping problems, let alone that it committed numerous violations of federal law in dispensing controlled substances.\u201d JA 98. Nor did it provide evidence of meaningful remedial measures it had taken to prevent similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>problems in the future. Street, it is true, offered abstract assurances that, since the audits, the staff has been \u201ca lot more careful\u201d and is in \u201cgeneral just trying to ... practice by a higher standard.\u201d ALJ Hr\u2019g Tr. 152, May 24, 2005. But the only specific corrective steps he described \u2014 fixing data-entry errors in its database and being \u201cmore careful on [its] counting\u201d\u2014 relate only to its record-keeping failures and do nothing to redress its irresponsible dispensing practices. Whether willfully or naively blind to its blunders, in short, Medicine Shoppe failed to \u201cpresent! ] sufficient mitigating evidence to assure the [Deputy] Administrator that [it] can be entrusted with the responsibility carried by [its] registration.\u201d JA 97 (internal quotation marks omitted, first and third alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">In resisting the Deputy Administrator\u2019s assessment as both unsupported by substantial evidence and arbitrary and capricious, Medicine Shoppe points out that he did not respect the findings made by the ALJ who heard and saw the witnesses testify. Giving much greater weight to the mitigating evidence \u2014 including Street\u2019s efforts to assist the DEA during audits, his (partial) attempts to verify prescriptions, the knowledge he demonstrated at the hearing of specific patients\u2019 circumstances and his other \u201caffirmative action[s] to preclude the diversion of controlled substances,\u201d such as reporting forged prescriptions to authorities, JA 286 \u2014 the ALJ determined that allowing Medicine Shoppe to continue dispensing drugs would not pose unacceptable risks to the public interest. The answer, the ALJ believed, was more monitoring, not revoking Medicine Shoppe\u2019s registration. Because the Deputy Administrator did not accept all of the ALJ\u2019s findings and the ALJ\u2019s ultimate conclusion, the pharmacy argues that we must reject the agency\u2019s decision for want of substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">But disagreement between an agency and an ALJ does not rewrite the rules of substantial-evidence review. <em>See Universal Camera Coup. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 496, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951); <em>NLRB v. Local 334, Laborers Int\u2019l Union, </em>481 F.3d 875, 879 (6th Cir.2007). So long as the Deputy Administrator does not \u201cignoren\u201d the ALJ\u2019s decision but instead \u201ctake[s] the ALJ\u2019s findings into consideration,\u201d no stricter standard applies, and we simply must examine those findings with the rest of the record. <em>Morall v. DEA, </em>412 F.3d 165, 179 (D.C.Cir.2005). A conflict between the two decisions, to be sure, may render the evidence underlying the Deputy Administrator\u2019s decision \u201cless substantial,\u201d <em>Universal Camera, </em>340 U.S. at 496, 71 S.Ct. 456, but only to the extent the case turns on questions of credibility that make the ALJ\u2019s face-to-face assessment of relevant testimony material. Yet, as explained above, many of the Deputy Administrator\u2019s conclusions depended not on what witnesses said but what they did <em>not </em>say and the dispensings they failed to explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Although the Deputy Administrator took issue with some of the ALJ\u2019s findings, he explained why, noting in most instances the ALJ\u2019s failure to consider contrary evidence. Medicine Shoppe in the end has not met its burden of showing either that the Deputy Administrator failed to \u201cexamine the relevant data\u201d or that his decision does not \u201creflect a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u201d <em>Hoxie, </em>419 F.3d at 482 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">For these reasons, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
