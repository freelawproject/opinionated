We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Nagoulko v. INS, </em>338 F.3d 1012, 1015 (9th Cir.2003), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">The agency denied Palit\u2019s asylum application as time barred. Palit does not challenge this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of withholding of removal because Palit\u2019s experiences do not constitute past persecution, <em>see id. </em>at 1016-18, and Palit has not demonstrated any basis for past persecution under <em>Hernandez-Ortiz v. Gonzales, </em>496 F.3d 1042, 1045-46 (9th Cir.2007). In addition, even if the disfavored group analysis set forth in <em>Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922, 927-29 (9th Cir. 2004) applies in the context of withholding of removal, Palit failed to establish that it was more likely than not that he will be persecuted if he returns to Indonesia. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s determination that Palit is not entitled to CAT relief because he failed to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if he returns to Indonesia. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b593-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
