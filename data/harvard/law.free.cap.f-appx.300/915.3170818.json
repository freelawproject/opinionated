(\u201cPramil\u201d). <em>Pramil S.R.L. v. Farah, </em>No. 92032341, 2008 WL 853844 (T.T.A.B. Jan. 29, 2008) <em>(\u201cBoard Decision </em>\u201d). Because we are not persuaded by Farah\u2019s allegations of error, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b942-17\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b942-18\">On May 30, 2000, Farah filed an application to register the mark OMIC PLUS for use in connection with certain cosmetics, and, on May 1, 2001, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued him registration No. 2,447,970 for this mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-19\">On October 25, 2001, Pramil petitioned for cancellation of this registration. Specifically, Pramil alleged that it had priority of use for the mark OMIC (also in connection with cosmetics) and that there was a likelihood of confusion between its mark (OMIC) and the registered mark (OMIC PLUS). <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(d) (prohibiting registration of a mark where the mark so resembles another mark, which is registered or was \u201cpreviously used in the United States by another and not abandoned,\u201d that there is a likelihood of confusion between the two). In support of its petition, Pramil submitted several invoices, sample packaging of its OMIC product, and the deposition testimony of Jacob Aini, the corporate secretary and buyer for I.C.E. Marketing, Inc., the exclusive distributor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>of Pramil\u2019s products in the United States. <em>Board Decision </em>at 2. Farah, on the other hand, failed to timely submit any evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 2 n. 1. As a result, for the purposes of this proceeding, Farah\u2019s priority date is the filing date of his registration application (i.e., May 30, 2000). <em>Id. </em>at 3-4. The parties submitted briefs, requested oral argument, and awaited the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Meanwhile, on March 13, 2006, Farah\u2019s exclusive licensee, Gapardis Health and Beauty, Inc. (\u201cGapardis\u201d), filed an infringement action against Pramil and Pram\u00fc\u2019s U.S. distributor, International Beauty Exchange, Inc. (\u201cIBE\u201d), in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida alleging, inter alia, infringement of the registered mark OMIC PLUS. <em>Gapardis Health &amp; Beauty, Inc. v. Pramil S.R.L., </em>No. 06-CV-20619, 2006 WL 1207562 (S.D. Fla. filed Mar. 13, 2006). While Gapardis and IBE later settled, Pramil failed to respond to the complaint, resulting in the entry of a default judgment. The district court permanently enjoined Pramil from using the mark OMIC PLUS and awarded damages to Gapardis.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">On June 16, 2007, after completion of the civil proceedings, Farah filed a motion for summary judgment with the Board, alleging that the court\u2019s injunction eliminated Pramil\u2019s basis for standing and that its judgment collaterally estopped Pramil from asserting the grounds for cancellation. The Board denied this motion on July 26, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">On January 29, 2008, the Board found that Pramil established priority of use and likelihood of confusion and, as a result, granted the cancellation of Farah\u2019s registration. <em>Board Decision </em>at 9, 18. Farah appealed the Board\u2019s decision, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">\u201cWe apply a limited standard of review to Board decisions, reviewing legal determinations de novo and factual findings for substantial evidence.\u201d <em>In re Bose Corp., </em>476 F.3d 1331,1334 (Fed.Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">On appeal, Farah argues that the Board erred in various ways. First, Farah alleges that the district court\u2019s judgments prevent Pramil from maintaining its cancellation petition because: (1) Pramil lacked standing in the cancellation proceeding once the district court entered the permanent injunction and (2) the district court\u2019s default judgment against Pramil collaterally estopped Pramil from asserting the grounds for cancellation. Next, Farah argues that Pramil failed to carry its burden of proof on two aspects of its cancellation petition \u2014 (3) priority of use and (4) continuous use of its mark. We address each of these four allegations in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b943-12\">First, Farah argues that Pramil lacked standing to petition for the cancellation of Farah\u2019s trademark after the district court entered a permanent injunction against Pramil. Because this order enjoins Pramil from using the mark OMIC PLUS (or colorable imitations thereof), Farah asserts that Pramil \u201clacks any rights in its claimed mark OMIC, and thus it is not likely to be damaged by the continued registration of [Farah\u2019s] mark.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-13\">\u201cA petition to cancel a registration of a mark\u201d may be filed \u201cby any person who believes that he is or will be damaged ... by the registration of a mark....\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1064. To establish standing to file such a petition, Pramil need only plead and prove facts showing a \u201creal interest\u201d in the proceedings and a \u201creasonable\u201d basis for its belief of damage. <em>See Ritchie v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number><em>Simpson, </em>170 F.3d 1092, 1095 (Fed.Cir. 1999); <em>Int\u2019l Order of Job\u2019s Daughters v. Lindeburg &amp; Co., </em>727 F.2d 1087, 1092 (Fed.Cir.1984). This is not a rigorous requirement, as standing \u201crequires only that the party seeking cancellation believe that it is likely to be damaged by the registration.\u201d <em>Cunningham v. Laser Golf Corp., </em>222 F.3d 943, 945 (Fed.Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Applying this standard, the Board found that Pramil had sufficiently demonstrated its standing to file the instant petition. <em>Board Decision </em>at 3. Specifically, the Board held that PramiTs \u201cuse of the OMIC mark in connection with cosmetics is sufficient to establish petitioner\u2019s direct commercial interest in its mark and its standing to petition to cancel respondent\u2019s mark for OMIC PLUS for cosmetics.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">In response to Farah\u2019s argument that the injunction eliminated Pramil\u2019s standing, the Board noted that the injunction does not specifically prohibit Pramil from using its OMIC mark. Rather, the injunction simply orders Pramil not to use the OMIC PLUS mark or \u201cany reproduction, or counterfeit, or copy or colorable imitation\u201d of this mark. <em>Gapardis Health &amp; Beauty, Inc. v. Pramil S.R.L., </em>No. 06-CV-20619 (S.D.Fla. May 23, 2007) (order granting permanent injunction). While that court may later determine that OMIC is a reproduction, counterfeit, copy, or colorable imitation of OMIC PLUS, it has not yet done so. <em>See id. </em>(retaining jurisdiction over enforcement of the injunction). Moreover, contrary to Farah\u2019s allegations, the scope of the district court\u2019s injunction is not altered by the fact that Pramil alleged (and the Board found) a \u201clikelihood of confusion\u201d between OMIC PLUS and OMIC. Thus, we see no error in the Board\u2019s conclusion that Pramil had standing to file the cancellation petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">Next, Farah argues that the district court\u2019s default judgment against Pramil collaterally estopped Pramil from pursuing the instant cancellation. Like the Board, we are not persuaded by this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">\u201c[Cjollateral estoppel may be employed to preclude the relitigation of issues only when those issues were \u2018actually litigated\u2019 in a prior law suit.\u201d <em>Lee ex rel. Lee v. United States, </em>124 F.3d 1291, 1295 (Fed. Cir.1997). \u201cWhen judgment is issued as the result of a default, however, the underlying issues have not been actually litigated. For that reason, a default judgment cannot serve to preclude the litigation of issues under the doctrine of collateral estoppel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1296; <em>see </em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 27 cmt. e (1982) (\u201cIn the case of a judgment entered by confession, consent, or default, none of the issues is actually litigated.\u201d). Thus, the district court\u2019s default judgment does not collaterally estop Pramil in the cancellation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">Farah also appears to present some arguments directed to res judicata (i.e., claim preclusion) in addition to collateral estoppel (i.e., issue preclusion). This court, however, has already decided that \u201can earlier infringement action does not bar, under the doctrine of claim preclusion, a later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>petition for cancellation.\u201d <em>Jet, Inc. v. Sewage Aeration Sys., </em>223 F.3d 1360, 1365 (Fed.Cir.2000). Thus, we also reject these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">Farah next argues that Pramil failed to carry its burden of proof on priority of use, an element of Pramil\u2019s ground for cancellation. While Farah acknowledges that Pramil\u2019s testimony and invoices show a sale of OMIC products before Fa-rah\u2019s priority date, Farah argues that Pramil needed to establish two additional elements: (1) Pramil applied its mark to the goods themselves and (2) the goods were sold to the public. Again, we are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">\u201cThe term \u2018use in commerce\u2019 means the bona fide use of a mark in the ordinary course of trade.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127. For goods, a mark is \u201cuse[d] in commerce,\u201d when: (1) \u201cit is placed in any manner on the goods or them containers or the displays associated therewith or on the tags or labels affixed thereto, or if the nature of the goods makes such placement impracticable, then on documents associated with the goods or their sale,\u201d and (2) \u201cthe goods are sold or transported in commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This statute does not require Pramil to make either of the specific showings alleged by Farah.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">The Board found that Pramil established its prior use with evidence showing that 6000 units of Pramil\u2019s OMIC product were sold in 1994 \u2014 six years prior to Farah\u2019s priority date \u2014 to a company in Florida. <em>Board Decision </em>at 4-5. Pramil\u2019s witness testified that these products were marked \u201cOMIC.\u201d The Board also noted that the invoice identifies the products with the OMIC mark and that Pramil\u2019s current product packaging clearly displays this mark. <em>Id. </em>at 4-5, 7. Moreover, the Board found \u201cno evidence or testimony\u201d to indicate that Pramil failed to label its products with the mark. <em>Id. </em>at 7. As Farah fails to identify any evidence to the contrary, we conclude that the Board\u2019s factual finding was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b945-11\">Finally, Farah alleges that Pramil failed to prove its continuous use of the mark. Farah asserts that Pramil\u2019s evidence only showed use of the mark from 1994 to 1996 and from 2000 to 2004. Because Pramil allegedly failed to explain the four-year gap between 1996 and 2000, Farah asserts that Pramil failed to carry its burden to establish continuous use of its mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-12\">As the Board noted, however, abandonment \u201cis a defense to [Pramil\u2019s] evidence of prior use, and therefore [Farah] bears the burden of proof.\u201d <em>Board Decision </em>at 9 (citing <em>W. Fla. Seafood, Inc. v. Jet Rests., Inc., </em>31 F.3d 1122, 1128-29 (Fed.Cir. 1994)). The Board found that Pramil\u2019s witness: (1) explained the four-year evidentiary gap (specifically, he testified that the invoices represented merely a random sampling over the course of ten years), and (2) testified that Pramil\u2019s use of the mark has been continuous since 1994, with no interruption or cessation. <em>Id. </em>at 10. Because Farah provided no evidence to the contrary, the Board concluded that Farah failed to prove its abandonment defense. <em>Id. </em>at 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-13\">On appeal, Farah appears to contend that it need not present any evidence because Pramil\u2019s \u201c[n]onuse for three consecutive years [is] prima facie evidence of abandonment,\u201d quoting the definition of abandonment provided by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127. The Board, however, did not actually find <em>any </em>nonuse of Pramil\u2019s mark, crediting instead the witness\u2019s testimony that Pramil\u2019s use of the mark has been continuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">Because the Board\u2019s factual findings are based on substantial evidence and its analysis contains no error of law, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b944-6\">. Farah also briefly argues that its registration of \u201cOMIC\u201d on June 3, 2008, negates Pramil's standing. However, we fail to see\u2014 and Farah fails to explain \u2014 how a second registration can \"negate\u201d a petitioner\u2019s standing to challenge a first registration. Specifically, we are not persuaded that this new registration undermines the Board's finding that Pramil has standing due to its \"use of the OMIC mark in connection with cosmetics.\u201d <em>Board Decision </em>at 3. Moreover, to the degree that Farah attempts to rely on facts underlying this registration (e.g., the asserted date of first use in commerce), Farah should have presented those facts to the Board in the first instance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
