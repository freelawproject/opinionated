Moreno also argues that the IJ\u2019s denial of his request for withholding of removal was erroneous to the extent that it was based on an adverse credibility determination that was not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">Moreno first argues that although he filed his asylum application more than one year after his arrival in the United States, he has shown both exceptional and changed circumstances that excuse his late filing. An asylum application must be \u201cfiled within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). An untimely application may be considered if the alien can demonstrate the \u201cexistence of changed circumstances which materially affect\u201d his eligibility or \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d relating to the delay in filing his application. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). The statute further provides that \u201cNo court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination\u201d made pursuant to \u00a7 1158(a)(2). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1158(a)(3). We have held that this language precludes federal court review of determinations regarding the timeliness of an asylum application or the changed or extraordinary circumstances exceptions. <em>Fahim v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1218 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-13\">Notwithstanding this prohibition, Moreno argues that in accordance with the Real ID Act, which gave federal courts jurisdiction to review \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law\u201d arising from some previously non-reviewable, discretionary rulings, we should review the determination with regard to the exceptions to the one-year asylum filing deadline. <em>Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 957 (11th Cir.2005). However, the \u201ctimeliness of an asylum application is not a constitutional claim or question of law covered by the Real ID Act\u2019s changes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, the REAL ID Act governs only those applications filed after May 11, 2005, and thus is inapplicable here since Moreno filed his original asylum application with the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) in 2002, prior to the passage of the REAL ID Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-14\">Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review Moreno\u2019s claim that the BIA erred in rejecting his asylum claim by its determination that the claim was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Next, Moreno argues that he qualifies for withholding of removal as it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted if returned to Colombia because of his union participation and political involvement in the Liberal Party and that the IJ erred by finding that he was not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Upon a petition for review of a decision of the BIA, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Where the BIA has issued its own order, but has adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning and findings, we review both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s decisions. <em>Id. </em>Here, the BIA\u2019s order relied upon the IJ\u2019s findings as to Moreno\u2019s credibility so we review both decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">When considering a petition to review a BIA final order, we review the BIA\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence test. <em>Id. </em>at 1283. We also review the IJ\u2019s credibility determinations under the substantial evidence test. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). Under the substantial evidence test, we must affirm the IJ\u2019s or BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284 (quotation omitted). \u201cTo reverse a factual finding, [we] must find not only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but that it compels one.\u201d <em>Farquharson v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>246 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir.2001). The fact that evidence in the record may also support a conclusion contrary to the administrative findings is not enough to justify a reversal. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">An applicant\u2019s testimony, if credible, may carry the burden of proof for asylum or withholding of removal without corroboration. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.13(a); 208.16(b). \u201cConversely, an adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. \u201c[A]n adverse credibility determination does not alleviate the [BIA]\u2019s duty to consider other evidence produced by an asylum applicant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cFurther, the [BIA] must offer specific, cogent reasons for an adverse credibility finding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cOnce an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the [BIA]\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[We] may not substitute [our] judgment for that of the [BIA] with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1286.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">Upon our review of the record evidence and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the BIA did not err in affirming the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination because substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s decision. The IJ\u2019s decision is based on several separate and distinct findings of inconsistencies, ambiguities, and contradictions between Moreno\u2019s testimony and his written application regarding (1) details of his employment, including his job positions, rates of pay and dates of employment; (2) his labor union and political party involvement; (3) whether his passport was stolen; (4) the alteration of his voter registration card; (5) the authenticity of his labor union\u2019s periodical, La Esco<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>ba; and (6) his explanation for his delay in filing for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Therefore, the adverse credibility determination justified the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding of removal, especially as much of Moreno\u2019s supporting evidence was implicated and discussed. Accordingly, we dismiss Moreno\u2019s petition for review as to the timeliness of his asylum claim and deny his petition as to his request for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b710-10\">. Valencia did not raise in his brief to this Court any challenge to the BIA's affirmance of the IJ\u2019s denial of his CAT claim. Thus, we deem him to have abandoned this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b711-8\">. Although Congress amended the law regarding credibility determinations with passage of the REAL ID Act, as we previously discussed, those changes do not apply to Moreno\u2019s application. <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1231 (11th Cir.2006) (discussing REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 302, \u00a7 101(h)(2)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
