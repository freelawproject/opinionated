BATCHELDER, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b371-12\">At issue in this appeal is whether the district court\u2019s judgment staying federal court proceedings pending the outcome of the appellants\u2019 state court proceedings is either a final appealable order or an interlocutory order from which we have jurisdiction to hear an immediate appeal. Because it is neither, we have no jurisdiction to decide the present appeal and, therefore, DISMISS this appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-17\">Plaintiff-appellant Elizabeth Clark<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is the owner and director of Copper Care, Inc., a Kentucky corporation (formerly) licensed \u201cto operate as a foster-care agency, approve foster homes, place children in approved locations, and oversee and assist in adoptions.\u201d Three Kentucky state agencies oversee these services \u2014 the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, the Southeastern Kentucky Division of Regulated Childcare, and the Kentucky Office of the Inspector General \u2014 and the 24 defendants-appellees are all employees of these three agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-18\">After an investigation culminated in an \u201cemergency action\u201d to suspend Copper Care\u2019s license, an administrative law judge (ALJ) upheld that action on May 24, 2005. On June 29, 2006 \u2014 following a hearing\u2014 that same ALJ upheld the agencies\u2019 recommendation to revoke Copper Care\u2019s license permanently. On October 6, 2006, the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services approved the ALJ\u2019s recommendation and permanently revoked Copper Care\u2019s license. Copper Care appealed to the Madison County (Kentucky) Circuit Court on November 1, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-19\">Meanwhile, on February 7, 2006 \u2014 while the state\u2019s administrative proceedings were still ongoing \u2014 Ms. Clark filed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>present lawsuit in federal court, claiming that the defendants had discriminated against her because she is black. Ms. Clark asserted seven specific causes of action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-4\">1. <em>Unlawful Search: </em>i.e., certain defendants \u201cauthorized, directly participated in[,] approved, or failed to curtail the unreasonable searches and seizures\u201d of Ms. Clark\u2019s Copper Care offices, all of which was in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">2. <em>Selective Enforcement: </em>i.e., the defendants selectively enforced Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services regulations, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, by \u201cmanufacturing or creating alleged violations of [health and safety] regulations that were not enforced when committed by non African-Americans and/or entities that ha[d] not filed complaints against Defendants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">3. <em>Retaliation: </em>i.e., the defendants retaliated against Ms. Clark, in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, by \u201ccreating violations of regulations, conducting unreasonable searches and seizures, [and] suspending and enforcing an emergency suspension of [her] license.\u201d The retaliation was due to her (1) refusing to assist the defendants in them attempt to obtain federal funds by fraud, by \u201cplacing facts on Copper Care\u2019s letterhead that did not occur,\u201d and (2) \u201csuccessfully] litigating] [against them] before [ ] the United States Department of Human Services, Office of Civil Rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">4. <em>Fourteenth Amendment Violation: </em>i.e., \u201cAll Defendants\u2019 actions [as alleged in the previous paragraphs] are in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-9\">5. <em>Discrimination: </em>i.e., the defendants interfered with Ms. Clark\u2019s \u201cright to enforce contracts and to petition for redress of grievance\u201d on the basis of her race, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-10\">6. <em>Conspiracy: </em>i.e., the defendants conspired to deny Ms. Clark \u201cthe equal protection of the laws ... and ... and of contractual rights\u201d on the basis of her race, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-12\">7. <em>Neglect: </em>i.e., certain defendants, who \u201cknew of the wrongs conspired to be done in violation of section 1981, 1983, and 1985,\u201d and who had \u201cthe power to prevent ... the commission of\u2019 those wrongs, \u201cneglected and refused to do so, in violation of 42 U.S.C. [\u00a7] 1986.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-14\">Based on these seven causes of action, Ms. Clark sought a broad declaratory judgment, four separate injunctions, and $10 million in damages, asking, among other things, that the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-15\">A. Declare the defendants\u2019 actions unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-16\">B. Enjoin defendants from \u201cinterfering with the license of Copper Care or otherwise suspending the operation of Copper Care.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-17\">C. Enjoin defendants from issuing noncompliance letters \u201cwithout specifically stating the action that is in noncompliance and without stating specifically what action will bring Plaintiffs into compliance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-18\">D. Enjoin the defendants \u201cfrom taking further retaliatory measures against Plaintiffs in any form or fashion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-19\">E. Enjoin the defendants \u201cfrom proceeding further in the \u2018emergency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>license suspension\u2019 proceeding in State Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\">F. Award five million dollars in compensatory damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">G. Award five million dollars in punitive damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">H. Award costs and attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">I. Award \u201cany and all other appropriate relief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing Eleventh Amendment immunity from damages claims for official-capacity conduct, expiration of the statute of limitations for many of the claims, and <em>Younger </em>abstention<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with regard to the ongoing license-suspension proceeding. The defendants also sought dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), but the district court rejected that argument. Similarly, the defendants argued that they are entitled to qualified immunity, but the district court deferred ruling on that argument and it is not presently before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">On March 29, 2007, the district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion in part\u2014 dismissing some of the claims and holding other claims in abeyance. The court dismissed all damages claims against the defendants in their official capacities, on the basis of Eleventh Amendment immunity. The court also dismissed all claims based on events alleged to have occurred prior to February 7, 2005, holding that the statute of limitations had expired on those claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After these dismissals, the court was left with Ms. Clark\u2019s requests for: (1) declaratory judgment; (2) the four injunctions; (3) damages from the defendants in their individual capacities for events alleged to have occurred after February 7, 2005; and (4) costs and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-14\">The court then embarked on a somewhat lengthy discussion of <em>Younger </em>abstention, which concluded with the following disposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-15\">Having determined that this case is an appropriate one for <em>Younger </em>abstention, this Court then has the discretion to dismiss the case without prejudice or hold the case in abeyance pending the outcome of the state proceedings. Because the statute of limitations has now run on Plaintiffs\u2019 claims regarding licensure, this Court will stay these proceedings rather than dismiss them without prejudice. If there are any claims remaining following a final decision in the state courts, Plaintiffs will be able to raise them at that time based on the state court record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-16\">It is clear that two of the requested remedies (set out above as \u201cB\u201d and \u201cE\u201d) could not survive the state court proceedings, but it is equally clear that the others might, particularly the damages claims against the defendants in their individual capacities (and their corresponding qualified immunity arguments). So, the district court held that after the state court had reached a final decision on the administrative license revocation, it would consider\u2014 in light of the state court record \u2014 Ms. Clark\u2019s four remaining requests, for: (1) declaratory judgment; (2) two injunctions; (3) damages from the individual deten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>dants for the post-February 7, 2005 allegations; and (4) costs and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Ms. Clark appealed and the defendants moved this court to dismiss, arguing that the district court\u2019s order was not final and, hence, this court had no appellate jurisdiction. A motions panel denied the motion, finding that \u201c[t]he abstention-based stay issued by the district court puts the plaintiffs \u2018effectively out of court,\u2019 and the order is appealable as a final order.\u201d <em>Clark v. Adams, </em>No. 07-5539, Order (6th Cir. Sept. 14, 2007) (citing <em>Moses H. Cone Mem\u2019l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., </em>460 U.S. 1, 10, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983), <em>Idlewild Bon Voyage Liquor Corp. v. Epstein, </em>370 U.S. 713, 715 n. 2, 82 S.Ct. 1294, 8 L.Ed.2d 794 (1962), and <em>Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>517 U.S. 706, 713, 116 S.Ct. 1712, 135 L.Ed.2d 1 (1996)). But, the present (merits) panel reconsidered the issue of our appellate jurisdiction and, at oral argument, we instructed the parties to submit additional briefing on this issue. Both sides submitted letter briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\u201cThe courts of appeals ... shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all <em>final </em>decisions of the district courts of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (emphasis added). \u201cA final decision is one which ends the litigation on the merits and leaves the court nothing to do but execute the judgment. ... Conversely, a stay of proceedings is generally considered interlocutory.\u201d <em>M &amp; C Corp. v. Erwin Behr GmbH &amp; Co., </em>143 F.3d 1033, 1036 (6th Cir.1998). Moreover, \u201c[wjhen an action presents more than one claim for relief ... the court may direct entry of a final judgment as to one or more, but fewer than all, claims ... only if the court expressly determines that there is no just reason for delay.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(b). \u201cOtherwise, any order ... that adjudicates fewer than all the claims ... does not end the action as to any of the claims ... and may be revised at any time before the entry of a judgment adjudicating all the claims and all the parties\u2019 rights and liabilities.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">In the present case, the district court clearly did <em>not </em>\u201cend[ ] the litigation on the merits and leave[ ] ... nothing to do but execute the judgment,\u201d <em>M &amp; C Corp., </em>143 F.3d at 1036, but rather, it stayed or continued its proceedings until the state had entered a final decision on Ms. Clark\u2019s administrative appeal of her license-revocation. The district court specified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-9\">[T]his Court will stay these proceedings rather than dismiss them without prejudice. If there are any claims remaining following a final decision in the state courts, Plaintiffs will be able to raise them at that time based on the state court record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">Furthermore:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-11\">Defendants\u2019 motion to abstain from further proceedings in this matter pursuant to <em>Younger v. Harris </em>is GRANTED. These proceedings are STAYED and will be held in abeyance pending the outcome of Plaintiffs\u2019 state court proceedings regarding licensure[J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVG\">Such a stay \u201cis generally considered interlocutory.\u201d <em>See M &amp; C Corp., </em>143 F.3d at 1036.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">In the \u201cStatement of the Basis for Subject Matter Jurisdiction\u201d portion of her appellate brief, Ms. Clark asserted: \u201cPursuant to Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, this Court has jurisdiction to hear this appeal <em>from a final order </em>of the District Court granting Defendants\u2019 Motion <em>to Stay Proceedings.\u201d </em>Apt.\u2019s Br. at 1 (emphasis added). As Ms. Clark did not view this as an interlocutory appeal, she did not offer any theory that would provide jurisdiction for us to hear it as an interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-13\">While this appeal was pending before this court, the defendant-appellees moved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>to dismiss it for lack of appellate jurisdiction, arguing that \u201c[t]his is an interlocutory appeal that has not been certified pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) or Fed. R.CivJP. 54(b).\u201d In her response to that motion, Ms. Clark insisted that the order was indeed \u201cfinal\u201d because \u201cthe district court ha[d] nothing else to consider until the completion of the state proceedings.\u201d Alternatively, she argued that this was a proper interlocutory appeal because it presented \u201ca controlling question of law,\u201d that being a \u201cdetermination that [she] was the victim of racial discrimination.\u201d Ms. Clark theorized that it was indeed a question of law, despite appearances to the contrary, inasmuch as \u201cthe particular facts in this ease have not been previously addressed by the Sixth Circuit.\u201d In their reply motion, the defendants cited <em>Summers v. Leis, </em>368 F.3d 881, 889 (6th Cir.2004), in which we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\">The district court\u2019s failure to dismiss the entire action pursuant to <em>Younger </em>does not qualify as a final decision under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, nor does it fit within the collateral order exception to that statute. Additionally, the district court\u2019s decision does not qualify as an interlocutory order as defined in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The motions panel denied the defendantappellees\u2019 motion, but in so doing did not apply Ms. Clark\u2019s reasoning. Instead, the motions panel relied on <em>Moses H. Cone, </em>460 U.S. at 10, 103 S.Ct. 927, <em>Idlewild, </em>370 U.S. at 715 n. 2, 82 S.Ct. 1294, and <em>Quackenbush, </em>517 U.S. at 713,116 S.Ct. 1712, for the proposition that \u201can order that stays a federal action in deference to pending state court proceedings is appealable if the plaintiff is \u2018effectively out of court.\u2019 \u201d The motions panel then concluded that \u201c[t]he abstention-based stay issued by the district court puts the plaintiffs \u2018effectively out of court,\u2019 and the order is appealable as a final order.\u201d That decision, however, is clearly incorrect, both legally and factually.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">Legally, the motion panel\u2019s conclusion is incorrect because <em>Moses H. Cone, Idlewild, </em>and <em>Quaekenbush </em>all involve abstention-as-deference, whereas the present case involves abstention-as-continuance. <em>See, e.g., Growe v. Emison, </em>507 U.S. 25, 32 n. 1,113 S.Ct. 1075,122 L.Ed.2d 388 (1993) (explaining that courts should use the word \u201cdeference,\u201d rather than \u201cabstention,\u201d when they actually mean deference). Thus, when considered in the present circumstances, their reasoning and holdings are inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">In <em>Moses H. Cone, </em>460 U.S. at 8, 103 S.Ct. 927, the plaintiffs \u2014 invoking diversity jurisdiction \u2014 filed suit in federal court to compel arbitration of a contract dispute, but the district court stayed the action under <em>Colorado River </em>abstention,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> pending the completion of a state-court action in which the defendants had already filed for a declaratory judgment on that same contract dispute. The Supreme Court, relying on <em>Idlewild, </em>370 U.S. at 715, 82 S.Ct. 1294, held that the abstention-based stay order was appealable under \u00a7 1291 because it put the litigants \u201ceffectively out of court.\u201d The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-11\">A district court stay pursuant to <em>Pullman </em>abstention is entered with the expectation that the federal litigation will resume in the event that the plaintiff does not obtain relief in state court on state-law grounds. Here, by contrast [i.e., under <em>Colorado River </em>abstention and the circumstances of this case], the District Court predicated its stay order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>on its conclusion that the federal and state, actions involved the identical issue of arbitrability of the claims of Mercury Construction Corp. against the Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital. That issue of arbitrability was the only substantive issue present in the federal suit. Hence, a stay of the federal suit pending resolution of the state suit meant that there would be no further litigation in the federal forum; the state court\u2019s judgment on the issue would be <em>res judicata. </em>Thus, here, even more surely than in <em>Idlewild, </em>Mercury was effectively out of court. Hence, as the Court of Appeals held, this stay order amounts to a dismissal of the suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><em>Moses H. Cone, </em>460 U.S. at 10, 103 S.Ct. 927 (footnotes, citations, and quotation marks omitted). To recap: the stay was final (and appealable) because \u201cthis stay amounts to a dismissal of the suit,\u201d because \u201cthe state court\u2019s judgment on the [only substantive issue in the federal suit] would be <em>res judicata.\u201d </em>That is surely not the situation in the present case, in which there are numerous issues and few, if any, will be subject to <em>res judicata </em>from the state court\u2019s decision on administrative revocation. The <em>Moses H. Cone </em>Court recognized the uniqueness of its situation and reiterated the premise of <em>Idleivild:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP3\">Of course ... <em>Idlewild </em>does not disturb the usual rule that a stay is not ordinarily a final decision for purposes of \u00a7 1291, since most stays do not put the plaintiff \u2018effectively out of court.\u2019 <em>Idlewild\u2019s </em>reasoning is limited to cases where (under <em>Colorado River, </em>abstention, or a closely similar doctrine) the object of the stay is to require all or an essential part of the federal suit to be litigated in a state forum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 10 n. 11, 103 S.Ct. 927 (citation omitted). This is the part of <em>Moses H. Cone </em>(and <em>Idlewild) </em>that is pertinent to the particular circumstances of the present case, and the motions-panel decision is contrary to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">In <em>Quackenbush, </em>517 U.S. at 709, 116 S.Ct. 1712, the California State Insurance Commissioner sued Allstate Insurance Company in state court, seeking contract and tort damages. Allstate removed the action to federal court on diversity grounds and moved to compel arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, <em>et seq. </em>The Commissioner sought remand to state court on the basis of <em>Burford </em>abstention,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> arguing that resolution of the case might interfere with California\u2019s regulation of its insurance industry. \u201cThe District Court concluded this case was an appropriate one for the exercise of <em>Burford </em>abstention [and] did not stay its hand pending the California courts\u2019 resolution of the setoff issue, but instead remanded the entire case to state court. The District Court entered this remand order without ruling on Allstate\u2019s motion to compel arbitration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 710, 116 S.Ct. 1712.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">On appeal, the Supreme Court relied on <em>Moses H. Cone </em>and <em>Idlewild </em>to conclude that the abstention order was final and appealable. <em>Id. </em>at 713, 116 S.Ct. 1712. The <em>Quackenbush </em>Court explained that the district court\u2019s decision was \u201cin all relevant respects indistinguishable from the stay order we found to be appealable in <em>Moses H. Cone,\u201d </em>reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-9\">No less than an order staying a federal court action pending adjudication of the dispute in state court, it puts the litigants in this case \u2018effectively out of court,\u2019 and its effect is precisely to sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>render jurisdiction of a federal suit to a state court. Indeed, the remand order is clearly more \u2018final\u2019 than a stay order in this sense. When a district court remands a case to a state court, the district court disassociates itself from the case entirely, retaining nothing of the matter on the federal court\u2019s docket.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABQ\"><em>Id. </em>at 714, 116 S.Ct. 1712 (citations and certain quotation marks omitted). To recap: remand puts the litigants out of federal court entirely. That is surely not the situation in the present case, in which there are clearly issues that remain to be decided by the federal court after resolution of the state court case.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">So, the motions-panel decision is legally insupportable, inasmuch as its cited authorities do not support its proposition under these circumstances. Furthermore, it is factually incorrect, as the stay issued by the district court does <em>not </em>put the plaintiffs \u201ceffectively out of court.\u201d More to the point, the district court\u2019s stay order is not final and we have no jurisdiction to review it. The only question remaining is the continuing effect of the (incorrect) motions-panel decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The law in this circuit is clear that \u201cthat the law of the case doctrine does not foreclose reconsideration of subject-matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Amen v. Dearborn, </em>718 F.2d 789, 794 (6th Cir.1983); <em>Edwards v. UPS, Inc., </em>99 Fed.Appx. 658, 660 (6th Cir.2004). Indeed, every circuit to consider this issue has ruled the same way. <em>See, e.g., Council Tree Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. F.C.C., </em>503 F.3d 284, 292 (3d Cir.2007) (\u201cthe law of the case doctrine does not bar a merits panel from revisiting a motions panel\u2019s assumption of subject matter jurisdiction\u201d); <em>Crystal Clear Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Sw. Bell Tel. Co., </em>415 F.3d 1171, 1176 n. 3 (10th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Arevalo, </em>408 F.3d 1233, 1237 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201ca merits panel should reconsider jurisdictional issues even if previously decided by a motions panel\u201d); <em>Sammie Bonner Constr. Co. v. W. Star Trucks Sales, Inc., </em>330 F.3d 1308, 1311 (11th Cir.2003); <em>CNF Constr., Inc. v. Donohoe Constr. Co., </em>57 F.3d 395, 397 n. 1 (4th Cir.1995) (citing cases for the proposition that \u201cthe doctrine of \u2018law of the case\u2019 does not prevent this Court from revisiting a prior ruling of a motion panel on the Court\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d); <em>Ass\u2019n of Inv.
