Fernandez argues that Amendment 709 to the Sentencing Guidelines would reduce his sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-25\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir. 2003). However, in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) context, \u201cwe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). We also \u201creview <em>de novo </em>questions of statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>United States v. Maupin, </em>520 F.3d 1304,1306 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Section 3582(c)(2), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-5\">[I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). For a district court to have authority, pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), to reduce a sentence based on an amendment to the guidelines, two initial conditions must be met. First, the sentencing range must be lowered by the amendment. <em>See United States v. Pope, </em>58 F.3d 1567, 1568-69,1572 (11th Cm.1995) (ordering the district court to reinstate the original sentence on remand because the statutory-minimum sentence applied, and thus, the sentencing range was not lowered by the amendment). Second, the amendment must be listed as retroactively applicable in \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>United States v. Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d 905, 909 (11th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Amendment 709, which became effective on November 1, 2007, addresses \u201ctwo areas of the Chapter Four criminal history rules: the counting of multiple prior sentences and the use of misdemeanor and petty offenses in determining a defendant\u2019s criminal history score.\u201d U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 709, Reason for Amendment. With regard to the counting of multiple prior sentences, if the prior sentences were separated by an intervening arrest, they are to be counted separately. If the prior sentences were not separated by an intervening arrest, they are to be counted separately \u201cunless the sentences (1) were for offenses that were named in the same charging document, or (2) were imposed on the same day.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(a), a defendant receives three criminal history points \u201cfor each prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(a) (2007). Section 4A1.2(a)(2), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-9\">If the defendant has multiple prior sen-' tences, determine whether those sentences are counted separately or as a single sentence. Prior sentences always are counted separately if the sentences were imposed for offenses that were separated by an intervening arrest (i.e., the defendant is arrested for the first offense prior to committing the second offense). If there is no intervening arrest, prior sentences are counted separately unless (A) the sentences resulted from offenses contained in the same charging instrument; or (B) the sentences were imposed on the same day. Count any prior sentence covered by (A) or (B) as a single sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2) (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">We need not address whether the amendment is retroactive because even if it were, the changes would not benefit Fernandez. Fernandez\u2019s arguments focus on the grouping of his murder and arson offenses. When Fernandez was originally sentenced in 1992, his murder and arson convictions were grouped together, and he received a total of three criminal history points for them. If Amendment 709 were applied, the murder and arson convictions would still be grouped together because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>they were not separated by an intervening arrest and he received the sentences on the same day. Because the longest sentence for his murder and arson convictions was over a year and a month, he would still receive three criminal history points for them. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(a). Because Amendment 709 would not lower Fernandez\u2019s sentencing range, the district court did not have discretion to lower his sentence. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
