Blaukat, </em>453 F.3d 1108, 1112 (8th Cir.2006), we conclude that summary judgment was properly granted on the basis of qualified immunity, <em>see Holt v. Dunn, </em>741 F.2d 169, 170 (8th Cir. 1984) (per curiam) (\u201cqualified immunity protects court reporters who act pursuant to their lawful authority and follow in good faith the instructions or rules of the court\u201d); <em>see also Smith v. Tandy, </em>897 F.2d 355, 355-56 (8th Cir.1990) (per curiam) (upholding district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on grounds of qualified immunity in suit against, inter alia, court reporter for omissions in trial transcript).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-18\">The judgment is affirmed, and Jackson\u2019s motion for oral argument is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b470-15\">.
