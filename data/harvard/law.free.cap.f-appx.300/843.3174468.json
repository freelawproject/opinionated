Copeland alleged that the Housing Authority violated the Due Process Clause and deprived her of constitutionally protected property rights when it terminated her housing benefits. The court granted summary judgment against her based on <em>res judicata. </em>Copeland contends that <em>res judicata </em>does not bar her claims because they were not addressed in earlier, related state court actions. She also challenges the district court\u2019s denial of her motions for rehearing and to appoint counsel, as well as its denial of her pending motions as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">This is Copeland\u2019s third lawsuit against the Housing Authority and Schwartz based on the termination of her Section 8 housing benefits. Copeland\u2019s troubles began on June 20, 2003 when her landlord terminated her lease because Copeland had violated of the terms of the lease by allowing her son to move in with her in her one-bedroom apartment. Later, she was evicted from the apartment by court order in December 2003, but the eviction order was based solely on her failure to pay her portion of the rent for the previous five months. Copeland\u2019s failure to pay rent was a \u201cserious violation of her lease\u201d under the Housing Authority regulations, <em>see </em>24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552(b)(2), and the regulations mandated that her Section 8 benefits be terminated. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Copeland filed her first lawsuit against the Housing Authority and Schwartz in Florida state court on September 29, 2004 alleging violations of various regulations of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and claiming that her benefits were improperly terminated. Specifically, she contended that her failure to pay rent was not a \u201cserious violation of her lease\u201d because her lease had been terminated before she stopped paying rent. After a hearing, the state court granted summary judgment for the Housing Authority and Schwartz. The state appellate court affirmed that ruling without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Copeland filed a second lawsuit against the Housing Authority and Schwartz in Florida state court on September 18, 2006, this time under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. In that suit, she essentially argued that she had been deprived of constitutionally protected property rights and that the Housing Authority violated federal housing regulations when it terminated her benefits. The defendants filed separate motions to dismiss, which the court granted with prejudice. Copeland initially appealed that decision, but later voluntarily dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">Copeland filed the present lawsuit in federal district court contending that under \u00a7 1983 the termination of her housing benefits deprived her of a constitutionally protected property right and violated due process.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>' The district court ruled that Copeland\u2019s claim was barred by <em>res judicata </em>and entered summary judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court order barring a claim on the basis of res <em>judicata. See Ragsdale v. Rubbermaid, Inc., </em>193 F.3d 1235, 1238 (11th Cir.1999) (citation omitted). \u201cRes judicata bars the filing of claims which were raised or could have been raised in an earlier proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). When the earlier proceeding is a state court judgment, we rely on that state\u2019s law to determine whether the later action is barred by <em>res judicata. See Kizzire v. Baptist Health Sys., Inc., </em>441 F.3d 1306, 1308 (11th Cir.2006). This case involves earlier judgments by Florida state courts, and thus Florida state preclusion law applies. Florida law provides that a party is precluded from raising any issue that was or could have been raised in an earlier suit that (1) involved same parties; (2) was on the same cause of action; and (3) was decided on the merits. <em>See Fla. Dep\u2019t Transp. v. Juliano, </em>801 So.2d 101,105 (Fla.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>Here these requirements are met, and Copeland is barred from relitigating her claim for housing benefits. Her current lawsuit involves the same parties in the same capacity as in her earlier suits. Just as in her two earlier lawsuits, Copeland\u2019s current one alleges the same facts to support her contention that her benefits were improperly terminated. She also seeks the same relief: reinstatement of her benefits and monetary damages. Moreover, she raised nearly identical \u00a7 1983 claims in her second state court lawsuit. Under Florida law claims are considered to be part of the same cause of action if the facts essential to the maintenance of both actions are the same. <em>See Gordon v. Gordon, </em>59 So.2d 40, 44 (Fla.1952). Although Copeland\u2019s current lawsuit under \u00a7 1983 has the gloss of alleging new constitutional violations, it is the same cause of action as her earlier lawsuits for the purposes of <em>res judicata. </em>To the extent that there are any distinctions, her claims are still precluded as \u201cissues that could have been raised\u201d in her earlier lawsuits. <em>See Juliano, </em>801 So.2d at 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">Finally, both earlier judgments were on the merits. In the first lawsuit, the court entered summary judgment in favor of the Housing Authority and Schwartz. In the second one, the court dismissed Copeland\u2019s complaint with prejudice, which under Florida law operated as an adjudication on the merits. <em>See </em>Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.420(b) (\u201cUnless the court in its order for dismissal otherwise specifies, a dismissal under this subdivision ..., other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction or for improper venue or for lack of an indispensable party, operates as an adjudication on the merits.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">As the district court noted, \u201c[t]he rational of the doctrine of res judicata is that there must be an end to litigation,\u201d <em>Sea Quest Intern., Inc. v. Trident Shipworks, Inc., </em>958 So.2d 1115, 1119 (Fla. 2d DCA 2007), and Copeland has had her day in court. Because Copeland\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims are barred by <em>res judicata, </em>the district court correctly granted summary judgment for the defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b870-7\">. Copeland also included a claim that her constitutional rights were violated when the Housing Authority did not continue her hearing until she was able to retain counsel. The district court properly dismissed this claim for failure to state a cause of action upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b871-6\">. Because we affirm the district court's order granting summary judgment for the Housing\u2019 Authority and Schwartz, we also affirm the district court\u2019s judgments denying as moot her related motions. For the same reason, we deny Copeland\u2019s and Carl Shell\u2019s remaining motions before us on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
