R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b549-26\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-27\">This is a petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order denying petitioners\u2019 motion for administrative closure and declining to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen petitioners\u2019 removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-28\">Respondent\u2019s unopposed motion for summary disposition is construed as a motion for summary disposition in part and a motion to dismiss in part. This court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s refusal to reopen removal proceedings <em>sua sponte. See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159-60 (9th Cir.2002). Accordingly, respondent\u2019s unopposed motion to dismiss in part is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-29\">Respondent\u2019s unopposed motion for summary disposition in part is granted because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard). First, administrative closure is not avail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>able after entry of a final order of removal. <em>See Matter of Lopez-Barrios, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 203 (BIA 1990). Second, to the extent that petitioners\u2019 motion could be construed as a motion to reopen removal proceedings, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that petitioners\u2019 second motion to reopen was untimely and numerically barred. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2); <em>Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that BIA denials of motions to reopen or reconsider are reviewed for abuse of discretion), <em>amended by </em>404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b549-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
