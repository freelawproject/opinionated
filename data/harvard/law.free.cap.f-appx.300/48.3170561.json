We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>procedural history, and scope of issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">We first consider the district court\u2019s dismissal of AMG\u2019s breach of contract claim. To state a claim for breach of contract under New York law, a plaintiff must allege (1) the existence of an agreement; (2) adequate performance of the contract by plaintiff; (3) breach of the agreement by the defendant; and (4) damages. <em>See Harsco Corp. v. Segui, </em>91 F.3d 337, 348 (2d Cir.1996). The question we consider is whether it was proper at the motion to dismiss stage to determine as a matter of law that AMG has not \u201cadequately performed\u201d under the contract at issue and thus was not entitled to the relief it sought. We find dismissal at this stage of the litigation was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\u201c[J]udgment as a matter of law is appropriate if the contract language is unambiguous.\u201d <em>Photopaint Techs., LLC v. Smart-lens Corp., </em>335 F.3d 152, 160 (2d Cir.2003). \u201cWhether or not a writing is ambiguous is a question of law to be resolved by the courts.\u201d <em>Eternity Global Master Fund Ltd. v. Morgan Guar. Trust Co. of N.Y., </em>375 F.3d 168, 178 (2d Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). A contract is unambiguous when it has a \u201cdefinite and precise meaning, unattended by danger of misconception in the purport of the contract itself, and concerning which there is no reasonable basis for a difference of opinion.\u201d <em>Photopaint Techs., </em>335 F.3d at 160 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">The May 2002 addendum to the June 2001 contract between AMG and BPS required that AMG meet specific monthly production requirements, in addition to other rights and obligations. BPS argues that because AMG did not fully meet its production requirements under the contract, AMG did not adequately perform under the contract. The district court agreed, ruling that \u201c[i]n failing to meet the production targets as specified in the Addendum, AMG, by way of its own statistics, did not comply with the agreement and therefore did not sufficiently plead the element of adequate performance required to state a claim for breach of contract.\u201d <em>Advanced Mktg. Group, Inc. v. Bus. Payment Sys. LLC, </em>481 F.Supp.2d 319, 323 (S.D.N.Y.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">We conclude that AMG\u2019s breach of contract claim cannot be dismissed so easily. The June 2001 contract, the terms of which also apply to the May 2002 addendum, provides that AMG will receive residuals on accounts it brought to BPS \u201con a lifetime basis to AMG, as long as the merchant continues to process through BPS.\u201d As a matter of law, and drawing inferences in favor of AMG, we do not agree that the contract unambiguously provides that if AMG did not meet its production requirements in full each month, AMG would lose residuals on all of the accounts it had previously provided to BPS. Additional evidence regarding the contract negotiations and course of dealings between the parties is required to resolve this ambiguity. Resolution of this ambiguity may also call for inquiry into the \u201ccustoms, practices, usages and terminology\u201d of the parties\u2019 business. <em>World Trade Ctr. Props., L.L.C. v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>345 F.3d 154,184 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">BPS alleges other breaches by AMG that would justify a motion to dismiss, including that AMG breached the contract\u2019s confidentiality provisions and failed to pay BPS 50 percent of its profits from high-risk accounts. We decline to consider these issues at the motion to dismiss stage, as the district court correctly pointed out that these issues \u201care less clear-cut and would require a further developed record for the Court to determine whether AMG satisfied the terms of the Agreement with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>respect to these claims.\u201d <em>Advanced Mktg. Group, </em>481 F.Supp.2d at 324 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">We do, however, agree with the district court\u2019s dismissal of AMG\u2019s claim that BPS tortiously interfered with AMG\u2019s contract with Maximum Research (\u201cMR\u201d). The elements of tortious interference with a contract are: \u201c(1) the existence of a valid contract between the plaintiff and a third party; (2) the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the contract; (3) the defendant\u2019s intentional procurement of the third-party\u2019s breach of the contract without justification; (4) actual breach of the contract; and (5) damages resulting therefrom.\u201d <em>Kirch v. Liberty Media Corp., </em>449 F.3d 388, 401 (2d Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). AMG\u2019s complaint failed to state the necessary elements for this cause of action. As the district court observed, while the complaint stated the existence of a valid contract between AMG and MR, it \u201cprovides no detail ... as to BPS\u2019s knowledge of the AMG and MR contract, nor does it allege that MR itself actually breached the contract. Instead, it alleges only a breach by BPS.\u201d <em>Advanced Mktg. Group, </em>481 F.Supp.2d at 324-25. The complaint is also silent on any willful or intentional conduct on the part of BPS to persuade MR to breach its contract with AMG.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the dismissal of AMG\u2019s breach of contract claim is REVERSED and REMANDED for proceedings consistent with this order, and the dismissal of AMG\u2019s tortious interference with a contract claim is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
