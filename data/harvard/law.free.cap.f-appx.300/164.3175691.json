For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-22\">Because we write primarily for the parties, it is not necessary to recite the facts or history of this case except insofar as may be helpful to our brief discussion. Coleman argues that his conviction and sentence must be reversed because (1) the district court erroneously denied his motion to suppress the physical evidence, (2) the evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s determination that the banks were federally insured, and (3) the sentence of 360 months was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-23\">The district court correctly concluded that the initial stop of Coleman\u2019s car was justified because his windows were tinted in violation of the Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Code. 75 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 4524(e). <em>See, United States v. Bonner, </em>363 F.3d 213, 216 (3d Cir.2004). Coleman claims that the police lacked reasonable suspicion to detain him after they inspected his driver\u2019s license and vehicle registration. However, an officer may conduct further investigation where the initial law<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>ful stop gives rise to a \u201creasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity\u201d based on the totality of the circumstances. <em>United States v. Givan, </em>320 F.3d 452, 458 (3d Cir.2003) (citing <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>285 F.3d 744, 749 (8th Cir.2002)). Here, the police had reasonable suspicion to extend the detention. The police heard \u201cflash information\u201d describing a Black female wearing a pink shirt and a Black male traveling in a black Lexus sedan with tinted windows. The officer spotted Coleman\u2019s black sedan with tinted windows just minutes after the \u201cflash information,\u201d in proximity to the robbery scene. Upon approaching the car, police observed that the car contained a Black male driver and a Black female passenger wearing a pink shirt. Thus, they had the reasonable suspicion required for a brief detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Coleman relies on <em>United States v. Kithcart, </em>134 F.3d 529 (3d Cir.1998), in arguing that imprecise car descriptions standing alone can not justify a <em>Terry </em>stop. However, the trial court properly distinguished <em>Kithcart. </em>In <em>Kithcart, </em>we discussed whether \u201cprobable cause\u201d existed for an arrest. The issue here is not probable cause for an arrest, but reasonable suspicion for a brief stop and investigation pursuant to <em>Terry. </em>That is a less demanding inquiry. <em>Bonner, </em>363 F.3d at 217. We conclude that the totality of the circumstances here gave rise to the required reasonable suspicion. Accordingly, Coleman\u2019s suppression motion was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Coleman argues that the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the banks were insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. To sustain a conviction for bank robbery or attempted bank robbery under \u00a7 2113(a), the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the bank\u2019s deposits were insured by the FDIC. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a); <em>United States v. Spinello, </em>265 F.3d 150,155 (3d Cir.2001) (explaining that \u00a7 2113(a) covers banks insured by the FDIC or members of the Federal Reserve). Here, the government offered testimony of officers from both PNC Bank and Univest National Bank and received the bank\u2019s current FDIC certificates into evidence. Coleman attacks the PNC Bank certificate because it lists \u201cPittsburgh, Pennsylvania\u201d as the bank\u2019s location. The PNC Bank officer explained that the FDIC certificate lists the location of the bank\u2019s main office, but extends to all branches. Accordingly, Coleman\u2019s jurisdictional challenge is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">Finally, Coleman argues that the sentence of 360 months was unreasonable. He argues that he was less culpable than his son, who plead guilty, testified against him, and received a sentence of 36 months in custody. Additionally, Coleman points to the Pre-Sentence Investigation Report that disclosed his tough upbringing and substance abuse problems. The sentence that the court imposed was at the bottom of the applicable guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of proving its unreasonableness. <em>United States v. Lessner, </em>498 F.3d 185, 204 (3d Cir.2007) (citing <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 332 (3d Cir.2006)). Given Coleman\u2019s status as a career offender and the serious nature of the crimes, which included robbery and attempted robbery, the district court\u2019s sentence was reasonable. This is particularly true when we consider that Coleman involved his own son in these very serious crimes rather than offering the kind of support and guidance that would have helped his son avoid a criminal career.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">For all of the above reasons, we will affirm the judgment of sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
