Gibson, of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b149-18\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b149-19\">On January 26, 2007, the district court issued an order denying defendant Bankers Trust\u2019s motion for attorneys fees under \u00a7 315(e) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77ooo(e). Bankers Trust appealed to this Court, contending that the district court did not award fees because it erroneously felt constrained by the proviso in the statute barring an award of fees in \u201cany suit instituted by any indenture security holder ... holding in the aggregate more than 10 per centum in principal amount of the indenture securities outstanding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Following oral argument, we issued a Summary Order on October 3, 2008, requesting clarification of the basis on which the district court denied the attorneys fees. <em>See Semi-Tech Litig., LLC v. Bankers Trust Co., </em>No. 07-0722-bk, 2008 WL 4489694 (2d Cir. Oct. 3, 2008). The district court clarified that it denied the award of fees because it concluded that the statute barred such an award, and, alternatively, that even if such an award were not barred by statute it would have declined to award fees in an exercise of its discretion. <em>See </em>Order, Oct. 6, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-23\">The district court\u2019s decision to deny the award of attorneys fees was within its discretion. <em>See Baker v. Health Mgmt. Sys., Inc., </em>264 F.3d 144, 149 (2d Cir.2001); <em>Browning Debenture Holders' Comm. v. DASA Corp., </em>560 F.2d 1078, 1088 (2d Cir. 1977). The district court weighed the factors it identified as relevant to the issue of attorneys fees, and found that the factors cutting against an award of fees \u2014 the plaintiffs good faith during the litigation, the defendant\u2019s pressing of non-meritorious arguments, and the spirit of the statutory proviso \u2014 outweighed the sole factor on the other side \u2014 the lack of substantial merit to plaintiffs case. Further, the district court gave \u201cdue regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses\u201d of the losing party, as required by the statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77ooo(e). We find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Given that the district court did not abuse its discretion we need not reach the statutory interpretation question because, whether or not the proviso applies here, the ultimate outcome of this appeal would be the same. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the order of the district court denying defendant Bankers Trust\u2019s motion for attorneys fees under \u00a7 315(e) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77ooo(e).</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b149-24\">. There is no merit to the defendant's argument that the \u201cdue regard\u201d provision forbids the district court from considering anything <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>other than \"the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses\u201d of the losing party.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
