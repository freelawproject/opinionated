Villegas-Ortiz was sentenced to 120 months\u2019 of imprisonment, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b), because the statutorily required minimum sentence for his offense, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), was greater than the maximum of the applicable guidelines range. He argues that the district court should have granted him \u201csafety-valve\u201d relief from the statutory mandatory minimum sentence, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f), and awarded him a two-level reduction in his offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(ll). He contends that he truthfully disclosed all information and evidence that he possessed in relation to the offense and relevant conduct, as required by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5), and that the court erred when it considered past illegal conduct not related to the specific offense for which he was convicted in its determination of whether he had been sufficiently truthful. VillegasOrtiz also argues that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 violates the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause by making \u201carbitrary classifications\u201d and violates the Eighth Amendment by imposing a sentence disproportionate to his crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">I. District court\u2019s denial of safety-valve relief</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">\u201cWhen reviewing a district court\u2019s safety-valve decision, we review for clear error a district court\u2019s factual determinations and <em>de novo </em>the court\u2019s legal interpretation of the statutes and sentencing guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Poyato, </em>454 F.3d 1295, 1297 (11th Cir.2006) (quotations and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for sentencing without regard to any statutory minimum \u2014 the so-called \u201csafety valve\u201d\u2014 with respect to certain offenses, when specific requirements are met. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)- The guidelines also permit a two-level reduction in the offense level for certain drug-related crimes if the defendant meets the five criteria set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(ll). The defendant must show, <em>inter alia, </em>that he truthfully provided the government with all the information and evidence he had \u201cconcerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C 1.2(a) (5). The application notes to \u00a7 5C1.2 explain that the language of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5) refers to \u201cthe offense of conviction and all relevant conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2, comment, (n. 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-12\">\u201cA defendant has the burden of proving his eligibility for relief under [\u00a7 3553(f) and] \u00a7 5C1.2.\u201d <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>106 F.3d 1553, 1557 (11th Cir.1997). The fifth prong of the safety-valve provision places on the defendant \u201can affirmative responsibility to truthfully disclose to the government all information and evidence that he has about the offense and all relevant conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>375 F.3d 1300, 1302 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted). Lies and omissions do not necessari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>ly disqualify a defendant from safety-valve relief as long as the defendant \u201cmakes a complete and truthful proffer not later than the commencement of the sentencing hearing.\u201d <em>United States v. Brownlee, </em>204 F.3d 1302, 1305 (11th Cir.2000). However, the defendant\u2019s lies remain relevant as \u201cpart of the total mix of evidence for the district court to consider in evaluating the completeness and truthfulness of the defendant\u2019s proffer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). In determining the honesty of a defendant, the district court must independently assess the facts and may not rely on the government\u2019s assertion of dishonesty. <em>United States v. Espinosa, </em>172 F.3d 795, 796-97 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">We have held that it is the district court\u2019s duty to determine whether the statement provided by the defendant is truthful and complete. <em>Espinosa, </em>172 F.3d at 797. \u201cCredibility determinations are typically the province of the fact finder because the fact finder personally observes the testimony and is thus in a better position than a reviewing court to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2002). Furthermore, \u201c[wjhen a defendant argues that the district court made erroneous findings of fact and as a consequence applied the sentencing guidelines incorrectly, the appellate court shall give due regard to the opportunity of the sentencing court to judge the credibility of the witnesses, and shall accept the findings of fact of the district court unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Glinton, </em>154 F.3d 1245, 1258-59 (11th Cir.1998) (quotation and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err when it failed to award Villegas-Ortiz safety-valve relief because Villegas-Ortiz failed to meet his burden of proving that he was eligible for the safety-valve reduction when he failed to present evidence of the completeness and truthfulness of his debriefing. Furthermore, we conclude that the district court did not err when it considered evidence of Villegas-Ortiz\u2019s untruthfulness related to other transactions within the same course of conduct during its determination of his safety-valve eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">II. Constitutionality of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a statute is constitutional. <em>United States v. Reynolds, </em>215 F.3d 1210, 1212 (11th Cir.2000). Section 841 of Title 21 of the U.S.Code prohibits and provides penalties for possession with intent to distribute controlled substances. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a), (b). In the case of an offense involving 50 grams or more of methamphetamine, \u00a7 841(b) (1) (A) (viii) provides that the term of imprisonment will be at least 10 years and not more than life imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (b)(1)(A)(viii). Villegas-Ortiz was sentenced to 120 months of imprisonment, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b), because the statutorily required minimum sentence for his offense, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), was greater than the maximum of the applicable guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">We have upheld the constitutionality of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)\u2019s mandatory minimum sentencing provisions against due process, equal protection, and Eighth Amendment challenges. <em>See United States v. Holmes, </em>838 F.2d 1175, 1177-78 (11th Cir.1988) (holding that \u00a7 841(b)(l)\u2019s mandatory minimum provisions were rationally related to the objectives of protecting public health and welfare); <em>United States v. Willis, </em>956 F.2d 248, 251 (11th Cir.1992) (holding that the mandatory life sentence provisions of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1) do not violate the Eighth Amendment). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>Because we have binding precedent upholding the constitutionality of the mandatory minimum sentence provisions in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1), Villegas-Ortiz\u2019s argument that they are unconstitutional fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Based upon the foregoing discussion, we conclude that the district court did not err in sentencing Villegas-Ortiz and, therefore, we affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
