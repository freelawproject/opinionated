Good appeals the grant of summary judgment in favor of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (\u201cState Farm\u201d) on his claim that State Farm breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under California law. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the underlying facts and procedure, we discuss them only as necessary to explain our disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-24\">Dr. Good asserts that State Farm, acting in bad faith, wrongfully settled his liability to third parties involved in the multi-vehicle accident giving rise to cover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>age because it erred in assessing him as primarily at fault. \u201cTo establish a bad faith claim, the insured must show that (1) benefits due under the policy were withheld and (2) the reason for withholding the benefits was unreasonable or without proper cause.\u201d <em>Century Sur. Co. v. Polisso, </em>139 Cal.App.4th 922, 43 Cal.Rptr.3d 468, 487 (2006). State Farm paid all benefits due under the State Farm Mutual Automobile Policy (\u201cPolicy\u201d). The Policy also expressly provided in \u201cSection I-Liability-Coverage A\u201d that \u201c[State Farm] ha[s] the right to investigate, negotiate, and settle any claim or suit.\u201d Moreover, the Policy provided that Dr. Good\u2019s premium could be affected by his accident history and that State Farm was entitled to increase his premium. In any event, a settlement\u2019s impact on the future insurability of the insured does not create a cause of action for bad faith. <em>See W. Polymer Tech., hie. v. Reliance Ins. Co., </em>32 Cal.App.4th 14, 38 Cal.Rptr.2d 78, 85 (1995) (\u201cAt least where the policy does not require the insured\u2019s consent to a settlement, there appears to be no precedent for holding an insurer liable for injury to an insured\u2019s reputation as a result of the settlement of a third party claim\u201d); <em>Hurvitz v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co., </em>109 Cal.App.4th 918, 135 Cal.Rptr.2d 703, 714-15 (2003) (rejecting the plaintiffs claim that an \u201cinsurer must at least consider the potential impact on the insured\u2019s future premiums when it settles a third party lawsuit.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Nor did the district court err in concluding that there could be no bad faith liability predicated upon State Farm\u2019s alleged unreasonable investigation of Dr. Good\u2019s insurance claim. California courts have concluded that unreasonable investigation is actionable under bad faith only when the insurance company denies or limits a claim after an unreasonable investigation. <em>See Gourley v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>53 Cal.3d 121, 3 Cal.Rptr.2d 666, 822 P.2d 374, 378 (1991) (\u201cThe substance of a bad faith action in these first party matters is the insurer\u2019s unreasonable refusal to pay benefits under the policy.\u201d); <em>Egan v. Mut. of Omaha Ins. Co., </em>24 Cal.3d 809, 169 Cal.Rptr. 691, 620 P.2d 141, 145-46 (1979) (finding bad faith when an insurance company did not take ordinary steps to investigate possible bases for an insured\u2019s claim). State Farm paid Dr. Good\u2019s claim and its investigation and review of the accident show no deliberate attempt to frustrate Dr. Good\u2019s expectations. <em>See Polisso, </em>43 Cal.Rptr.3d at 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b608-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
