While engaged in this work in Interamerican\u2019s warehouse, he suffered serious injury. Interamerican exercised its option to operate outside the workers\u2019 compensation program in Texas and therefore carried no workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Interamerican did maintain a commercial general liability policy with surplus lines insurer, Markel. Because Interamerican was a non-subscriber to the Texas workers\u2019 compensation program, it had no tort immunity and therefore Parra sued Interamerican for damages under Texas tort law. Interamerican did not notify Markel of the suit and Parra obtained a judgment against Interamerican for a sum in excess of $1 million. Parra then sought to recover this judgment from Markel as a third party beneficiary under Interamerican\u2019s commercial general liability policy with Markel.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">Markel filed a motion for summary judgment contending that it provided no coverage for the judgment Parra obtained against its insured based on the following exclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-13\">Exclusions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-14\">e. Employer\u2019s liability \u201cBodily injury\u201d to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-15\">(1) an \u201cemployee\u201d of the insured arising out of and in the course of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-16\">(a) Employment by the insured; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-17\">(b) Performing duties related to the conduct of the insured\u2019s business ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-18\">Definitions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-19\">(5) \u201cEmployee\u201d includes a \u201cleased worker.\u201d \u201cEmployee\u201d does not include a \u201ctemporary worker\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-20\">(9) \u201cLeased worker\u201d means a person leased to you by a labor leasing firm under an agreement between you and the labor leasing firm, to perform duties related to the conduct of your business. \u201cLeased worker\u201d does not include a \u201ctemporary worker.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-21\">(17) \u201cTemporary worker\u201d means a person who is furnished to you to substitute for a permanent \u201cemployee\u201d on leave or to meet seasonal or short-term workload conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-22\">Markel contended that Parra was an employee of the insured at the time of his injury and coverage was excluded. Parra argued that he was a \u201ctemporary worker\u201d and that the district court erred in concluding that liability for his injury was excluded under the \u201cemployee\u201d exclusion. As indicated from the policy language quoted above, temporary worker is a defined term: \u201ctemporary worker means a person who is furnished to you to substitute for a permanent employee on leave or to meet seasonal or short-term workload conditions.\u201d The district court concluded that although Parra was a worker used to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>meet short-term workload conditions, the summary judgment evidence established that he was not \u201cfurnished\u201d to Interamerican. The district court concluded that for this reason, he did not meet the policy definition of \u201ctemporary worker\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The record reveals that Interamerican sometimes called Parra when it needed temporary workers and at other times Parra would contact Interamerican through its warehouse supervisor, Guerrero. On occasion Guerrero would contact Parra when temporary help was needed. Parra argued that he was \u201cfurnished\u201d to Interamerican by Guerrero. The district court concluded that the clause \u201cperson who is furnished to you\u201d required a showing that a third person rather than an agent or employee of the employer referred the temporary worker to the employer for employment. We agree. As the Eighth Circuit in <em>Northland Casualty Co. v. Meeks, </em>540 F.3d 869, 875 (8th Cir. 2008), stated, \u201cwe find that the policy\u2019s use of the term \u2018furnished to\u2019 is unambiguous and clearly requires the involvement of a third party in furnishing a worker either to \u2018substitute for a permanent \u2018employee\u2019 on leave\u2019 or \u2018to meet seasonal or short-term workload conditions.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 875. We agree with this analysis and also agree with the <em>Meeks </em>court that attaching any other meaning to the term would render the provision meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">We therefore agree with the district court that the policy provided no coverage for the judgment obtained by Parra.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Parra asserted additional claims for violation of various provisions of the Texas Insurance Code which would preclude Markel from asserting coverage defenses in the policy. However, to have standing to assert rights under the Texas Insurance Code and claim the benefits of violations of that Code by an unauthorized insurer requires that a plaintiff qualify as a third-party beneficiary of the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">We agree with the district court that Parra, who is a potential judgment creditor of Markel since he holds a judgment against its insured, is nevertheless not a third-party beneficiary. <em>See Palma v. Verex Assur., Inc., </em>79 F.3d 1453, 1457 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">Parra also asserts a claim under the Texas Insurance Code \u00a7 541.151 for unfair\u2019 or deceptive practices by insurers. However, as we held in <em>Warfield v. Fidelity and Deposit Co., </em>904 F.2d 322, 327 (5th Cir.1990), Texas law does not permit a person to recover under this section unless there is a direct and close relationship between wrongdoer and claimant. In other words, the plaintiff must establish either privity with the insurer or some sort of reliance on actions of the insurer. Parra failed to demonstrate either privity or reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">For the reasons stated above and the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s thorough December 11, 2007 opinion, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b344-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
