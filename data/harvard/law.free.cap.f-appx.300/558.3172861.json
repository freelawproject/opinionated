Her claims are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d), and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. Because the parties are aware of the facts in this case, we recount them only as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-16\">\u2018We review de novo a district court\u2019s choice and application of the standard of review to decisions by fiduciaries in ERISA cases.\u201d <em>Abatie v. Alta Health &amp; Life Ins. Co., </em>458 F.3d 955, 962 (9th Cir. 2006) (en banc). Here, the district court properly selected and applied the abuse of discretion standard, considering as a factor in its analysis the structural conflict of interest created by Kemper\u2019s role as claims administrator and as a subsidiary of Lumbermens, the plan\u2019s funding source. <em>Abatie, </em>458 F.3d at 968 (\u201cweighing a conflict of interest as a factor in abuse of discretion review requires a case-by-case balance\u201d). That approach is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Glenn. Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Glenn, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2343, 2346, 171 L.Ed.2d 299 (2008) (where an entity both determines eligibility for benefits and pays benefits out of its own pocket a conflict exists, and such conflict should be weighed as a factor in determining whether the administrator has abused its discretion in denying benefits).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>The district court did not err in according little weight to the conflict. It found that the conflict did not taint Kemper\u2019s decision, noting that Kemper allowed Leon to submit supplemental evidence after the deadline for the administrative appeal. Kemper even allowed Leon to pursue an untimely appeal of her unsuccessful claim for short-term disability benefits. The court properly determined that Kemper engaged in a good faith review of the evidence, and that Kemper did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the evidence did not reveal objective proof of Prinzmetal\u2019s angina.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Neither did the district court err in concluding that none of the alleged procedural irregularities dictated a heightened standard of review. <em>See Abatie, </em>458 F.3d at 971 (where an administrator engages in \u201cwholesale and flagrant violations of the procedural requirements of ERISA,\u201d de novo review is required). None of the alleged irregularities amount to violations of ERISA\u2019s requirements. Kemper did not give a \u201cnew\u201d reason for denying Leon\u2019s claim on administrative appeal. Rather, it merely noted that because Leon did not qualify for short-term disability benefits, she was precluded from receiving long-term benefits. The determination that Leon did not have a qualifying disability during either the short-term period or long-term period does not reveal a new theory or reason for the denial, and is supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Further, Kemper did not abuse its discretion in submitting Leon\u2019s late-filed evidence to Dr. Feldman for review and comment. Kemper properly sought input from its medical consultant in order to conduct an informed review of Leon\u2019s supplemental evidence. Kemper was not required to allow Leon to challenge Dr. Feldman\u2019s comments after the close of evidence. <em>See Silver v. Exec. Car Leasing Long-Term Disability Plan, </em>466 F.3d 727, 732 n. 2 (9th Cir.2006) (in order for an insurer to evaluate an appeal fairly, it must wait until the claimant submits all its materials, otherwise there would be \u201cinterminable back-and-forth\u201d between the administrator and claimant).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">Leon\u2019s claim that Kemper conditioned receipt of benefits on her submission to an arguably dangerous test (ergonovine catheterization), and that this condition was a procedural irregularity requiring de novo review or reduced deference to Kemper\u2019s decision, is unavailing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In its initial denial letter, Kemper indicated that Leon\u2019s claim for benefits was denied because she failed to provide objective evidence of Prinzmetal\u2019s angina. The letter advised Leon that her appeal should include objective medical data such as diagnostic test results, and indicated that \u201crelevant documentation would include, but not be limited to\u201d a psychiatric evaluation regarding her ability to handle stress, and a \u201ccardiac catheterization with ergonovine study.\u201d Although inartfully drafted, the letter indicates that the ergonovine catheterization was just one of \u00e1 number of tests or objective signs that could be used to demonstrate that Leon had Prinzmetal\u2019s angina. Significantly, the medical literature Leon submitted in connection with the administrative appeal indicates various other objective signs and tests that can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>conclusively demonstrate Prinzmetal\u2019s angina. Leon\u2019s own medical records do not include such signs or evidence that she took these additional tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">In light of Leon\u2019s failure to present objective evidence of her alleged disability, despite notice that she was required to do so, the district court properly concluded that Kemper did not abuse its discretion in denying Leon\u2019s claim for long-term disability benefits. The alleged procedural irregularities, to the extent there were any, did not require de novo review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Because we conclude that Kemper did not abuse its discretion, we need not reach Kemper\u2019s argument that Leon\u2019s suit is barred by the plan\u2019s contractual limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b585-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b586-6\">. Leon's more general claim that Kemper improperly required objective evidence at all is also unavailing. The plan gave Kemper discretion to determine whether \"proof ... [was] satisfactory for receipt of benefit payments.\" That provision fairly contemplates a requirement of objective evidence where, as here, tests to confirm a diagnosis are available. Moreover, in the initial denial letter, Kemper advised Leon that she was required to submit objective evidence to support her diagnosis and claim of disability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b587-14\">. On appeal, Leon raises a number of other alleged procedural irregularities, which she did not raise in the district court. These arguments are waived, and the panel will not consider them. <em>See Smith v. Marsh, </em>194 F.3d 1045, 1052 (9th Cir.1999) (\"[A]n appellate court will not consider issues not properly raised before the [trial] court.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
