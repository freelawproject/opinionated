Horn denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Alban Braho, </em>No. A 77 714 464 (B.I.A. Dec. 28, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A 77 714 464 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Feb. 6, 2006). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">When the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision in some respects but not others, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision minus those arguments for denying relief that were rejected by the BIA. <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Shu Wen Sun v. BIA, </em>510 F.3d 377, 379 (2d Cir. 2007) (per curiam). The Court will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005). The Court reviews <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99,110 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Assuming that the agency erred in its determination that Braho failed to demonstrate a nexus to his past persecution, remand on this basis would be futile where the agency reasonably concluded that conditions in Albania have fundamentally changed such that he no longer had a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 339-40 (2d Cir.2006). As the BIA and IJ correctly noted, the leader of Braho\u2019s party, the Democratic Party, was elected Prime Minister in the July 2005 elections. While this information is not contained in the record, Braho conceded in his brief to the BIA that it was \u201cundisputed that the Democratic Party took power in the summer of 2005.\u201d However, Braho further contends that \u201cthere is nothing in the record to establish what the impact will be of the change in Government in Albania.\u201d Regardless, we have held that when making a changed country conditions finding with respect to a country that is \u201cthe subject of an appreciable proportion of asylum claims,\u201d the agency \u201cneed not enter specific findings premised on record evidence.\u201d <em>Hoxhallari v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 179,187 (2d Cir.2006). Thus, the IJ\u2019s \u201cperfunctory\u201d finding of changed country conditions in Albania was adequate. <em>Id. </em>at 188. Accordingly, we decline to reach the agency\u2019s additional finding that Braho\u2019s fear of persecution in Albania was undermined by his false summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">Moreover, Braho\u2019s bald assertion that he still fears being harmed or killed upon his return to Albania because the individuals who forced him to flee \u201care still there,\u201d does not demonstrate that they remain interested in him. Accordingly, any reasonable adjudicator would not be compelled to conclude contrary to the agency\u2019s decision. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
