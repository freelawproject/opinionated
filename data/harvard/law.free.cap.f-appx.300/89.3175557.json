Ferris denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Xi Feng Tung, </em>No. A76 972 444 (B.I.A. Oct. 6, 2004), <em>affg </em>No. A76 972 444 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Nov. 10, 2003). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-14\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See Shunfu Li v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 141, 146 (2d Cir.2008). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99, 110 (2d Cir.2008). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Dong Gao v. BIA, </em>482 F.3d 122,126 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-15\">Because Tung failed to raise his withholding of removal and CAT claims in either his brief to the BIA or his brief to this Court, we deem those claims abandoned. <em>See Gui Yin Liu v. INS, </em>508 F.3d 716, 723 n. 6 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-16\">Regarding Tung\u2019s application for asylum, leaving aside the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, his petition for review fails. Pursuant to our decision in <em>Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Tung is not <em>per se </em>eligible for asylum based on his wife\u2019s alleged forced sterilization.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Gui Yin Liu, </em>508 F.3d at 723 (noting that \u201ca claim of persecution based <em>solely </em>on a forced ... sterilization\u201d brought by someone other than \u201cthe individual who has undergone the procedure ... is doomed\u201d); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number><em>see also Matter of J-S-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 520 (A.G.2008). Tung has never argued that he is otherwise eligible for asylum based on any of the other categories of relief provided in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42). Accordingly, we find no reason to disturb the IJ\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. The pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b116-11\">. Judge Sotomayor continues to believe that the majority opinion in <em>Slii Liang Lin </em>was in error to the extent that it applied beyond unmarried partners, <em>see Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d at 327 (Sotomayor, J., concurring), but notes that the Attorney General has since adopted the Court\u2019s construction of the statute and overruled the BIA's former <em>per se </em>rule of spousal eligibility, <em>see In re J-S-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 520 (A.G.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b116-17\">. As the government observes, there is no merit to Tung's argument that we should apply the law as it was at the time of his hearing before the IJ. <em>See Harper v. Virginia Dep\u2019t of Taxation, </em>509 U.S. 86, 97, 113 S.Ct. 2510, 125 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993); <em>N.L.R.B. v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co., </em>55 F.3d 74, 78 (2d Cir.1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b117-16\">. We decline Tung\u2019s invitation to remand to the BIA based on evidence that was not in the administrative record. If Tung wishes the BIA to consider additional evidence, the proper course would be for him to file a motion to reopen. <em>See Xiao Xing Ni v. Gonzales, </em>494 F.3d 260, 269 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
