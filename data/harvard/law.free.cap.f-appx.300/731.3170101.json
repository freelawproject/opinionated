For the reasons set forth below, we remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-16\">On March 28, 2006, Frederick submitted a counseled \u00a7 2254 petition for writ of habeas corpus based, <em>inter alia, </em>on newly discovered evidence. Specifically, Frederick alleged that his son and the victim\u2019s brother, Eddie Frederick, submitted an affidavit on August 28, 2003, to the effect that he perjured himself at Frederick\u2019s trial at the prosecutor\u2019s bidding. In the affidavit, Eddie Frederick stated that, before the trial, the prosecutor told him to \u201csupport whatever [his] sister said happened.\u201d Accordingly, Eddie Frederick falsely testified that he heard his mother tell Frederick, \u201cIf I find out you did anything more, I\u2019m leaving you.\u201d Eddie Frederick also falsely testified, when asked about his sister preparing a letter recanting her allegations but later claiming that the allegations were true, that his sister had not told him whether her recantation letter was the \u201creal truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-17\">The state responded that Frederick\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was time-barred under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). Frederick replied that his \u00a7 2254 petition was timely under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D), as it was based on newly discovered evidence. The state sur-replied that Frederick could have discovered the evidence in question before his trial had he exercised due diligence and that Eddie Frederick\u2019s false testimony did not cover \u201cvital facts,\u201d such that \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D) did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-18\">A magistrate judge recommended denying Frederick\u2019s \u00a7 2254 motion. The magistrate reasoned that Frederick had not established that the information contained in Eddie Frederick\u2019s affidavit would change the outcome of the trial. Therefore, because Eddie Frederick\u2019s affidavit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>did not contain \u201cvitally crucial vindicating information,\u201d it did not support federal habeas relief and did not constitute newly discovered evidence for the purposes of \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D). Accordingly, \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) controlled, and Frederick\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was untimely. Over Frederick\u2019s objections, the district court adopted and approved the magistrate\u2019s recommendation and reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The district court denied Frederick\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOURT OF APPEALS\u201d). We subsequently granted a COA on the limited issue of \u201c[wjhether the district court erred in dismissing the petition as time-barred under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D) because it found that the newly-discovered evidence could not form the basis of federal habeas relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision that a habeas petition is time-barred. <em>Hepburn v. Moore, </em>215 F.3d 1208, 1209 (11th Cir.2000). The AEDPA imposes a one-year statute of limitations for filing a \u00a7 2254 petition. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). The one-year time for filing begins to run on the latest of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-9\">(A) the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-10\">(B) the date on which the impediment to filing an application created by State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States is removed, if the applicant was prevented from filing by such State action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-11\">(C) the date on which the constitutional right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if the right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-14\">(D) the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-15\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(l)(A)-(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-16\">Neither we nor the Supreme Court have addressed \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D) \u2014 the triggering provision that depends on presenting newly discovered evidence \u2014 outside the context of challenges to parole board decisions. <em>See e.g., Brown v. Barrow, </em>512 F.3d 1304 (11th Cir.2008). Indeed, our consideration of the newly-discovered-evidence provision has been limited. In <em>Aron v. United States, </em>291 F.3d 708, 712 (11th Cir.2002), we considered the similar provision of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(4) and held that the due diligence requirement of that statutory section \u201cdoes not require a prisoner to undertake repeated exercises in futility or to exhaust every imaginable option, but rather to make reasonable efforts.\u201d We also have held that the following facts constituted \u201cfactual predicates\u201d for the purposes of a newly-discovered-evidence claim: (1) receipt of a copy of an appellate brief and discovery of an attorney\u2019s failure to file an appeal, <em>id. </em>at 711, (2) vacatur of a prior state conviction, <em>Rivers v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 1319, 1322 (11th Cir.2005) (\u00a7 2255 context), and (3) the date of a state parole board\u2019s decision, <em>see e.g., Day v. Hall, </em>528 F.3d 1315, 1317 (11th Cir.2008). We never have held, however, that the inquiry also involves determining whether the newly discovered facts support federal habeas relief on their merits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">As an initial matter, Frederick\u2019s appellate arguments regarding the state court\u2019s denial of an evidentiary hearing are beyond the scope of the COA, and we will not consider these matters. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998) (holding that appellate review is limited to the issues specified in the COA). Also, Frederick has abandoned any argument that the district court erred in not considering other affidavits mentioned in his \u00a7 2254 petition, and we will not consider this matter. <em>See Davis v. Jones, </em>506 F.3d 1325, 1328 n. 4 (11th Cir. 2007) (stating that issues not raised in a party\u2019s initial brief on appeal are deemed abandoned).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Regarding the issue included in the COA and discussed on appeal, the district court erred in denying Frederick\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>See Hepburn, </em>215 F.3d at 1209. The district court denied the petition as untimely based on its finding that \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D) was inapplicable because Frederick\u2019s claim did not support federal habeas relief, given that the facts contained in Eddie Frederick\u2019s affidavit would not alter the outcome of Frederick\u2019s trial. Whether or not the state prisoner\u2019s claimed newly discovered evidence is sufficient to merit federal habeas relief is not, however, the standard for determining the appropriate triggering date. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D). Rather, the appropriate standard is whether or not the state prisoner exercised due diligence in discovering the factual predicate for his claim. <em>See Aron, </em>291 F.3d at 711. The district court did not address this matter. Accordingly, because the district court applied the incorrect standard, its conclusion was erroneous, and we remand the case to the district court for proper application of \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b759-12\">. The state argues on appeal that the Third Circuit, in <em>McAleese v. Brennan, </em>483 F.3d 206, 214 (3d Cir.2007), required that the claimed newly discovered evidence support federal habeas relief. Indeed, the Third Circuit referred in that case to \u201cvital facts,\" but did so only in holding that the triggering date is that date on which the state prisoner could have discover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>ed those facts that are vital to his habeas claim, rather than the date on which he could have discovered some ancillary fact merely suggesting a possible claim. <em>McAleese, </em>483 F.3d at 214. Thus, the holding in <em>McAleese </em>does not stand for the proposition that the factual predicate must contain evidence warranting habeas relief before its discovery can trigger \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D). <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b760-21\">. We note that, per our calculations, Frederick\u2019s \u00a7 2554 petition would be timely if August 28, 2003, was the appropriate triggering date.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
