Damato-Sifontes argues that the Board failed to consider the statements in his written application that he had been persecuted because he opposed the Hugo Cha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>vez government. We grant the petition to Damato-Sifontes, but deny the petition to his wife and daughter, vacate the denial of the motion to reconsider, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Damato-Sifontes, his wife, Katiuska Damato-Puertas, and their daughter, Kathryn Damato-Puertas, were admitted to the United States in December 2003 as nonimmigrant visitors. In April 2005, Damato-Sifontes, on behalf of himself, his wife, and their minor daughter, filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act and the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. They sought relief based on their political opinion and membership in a particular social group.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">In an addendum to the application, Damato-Sifontes alleged that he was harassed and later persecuted for his opposition to the Chavez government. Damato-Sifontes alleged that, as a sub-inspector of the Venezuelan Intelligence and Prevention Services, he assisted in the defeat of a coup d\u2019etat by Hugo Chavez in 1992. After Chavez was elected president in 1998, Damato-Sifontes was interrogated, called a traitor, and forced to retire. After retirement, the government failed to deposit his pension and required him to travel to Caracas to update his personal information. Later, a police official called Damato-Sifontes and told him he did not deserve to draw a pension, but that internal regulations required the police to pay the benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">Damato-Sifontes alleged that after his retirement, he became a \u201cmilitant,\u201d but not a \u201cmember,\u201d of a political organization called Democratic Action that opposed the Chavez regime. He distributed propaganda and attended six or seven demonstrations in 2002 and 2003 to oppose the Chavez government. Damato-Sifontes participated in the demonstrations without incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">Damato-Sifontes alleged that his situation changed after he demonstrated at the Altamira Plaza in Caracas on February 4, 2003. En route home the next day, a jeep that resembled an official vehicle of the Venezuelan police began to pass his car. Damato-Sifontes saw a person wearing a balaclava leaning out of the jeep holding a firearm. Damato-Sifontes slammed on his breaks and made a U-turn, then heard gunfire. He sped away and rested at a distant gas station for the rest of the evening. Damato-Sifontes suspected initially that the incident was an attempted robbery, but the next day he received an anonymous phone call and a man said, \u201cYou were saved, damn \u2018escu\u00e1lido\u2019 ... but next time we will burn down your family and you, if you keep going to Altamira.\u201d Damato-Sifontes explained in the addendum that the term \u201cescu\u00e1lido\u201d was \u201ca term used to allude [to] the enemies of the government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">Damato-Sifontes alleged that he and his family made preparations to leave the country, but the government refused to give Damato-Sifontes his passport. Damato-Sifontes traveled to Caracas and hid in the home of his mother-in-law until he was able to obtain the passport. After Damato-Sifontes obtained a visa from the American Embassy, he and his family fled to the United States. After their arrival, the Venezuelan government ceased paying Damato-Sifontes\u2019s pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-12\">At the hearing, Damato-Sifontes did not explain that the anonymous caller threatened him because of his activities at Altamira. Damato-Sifontes described the shooting and his escape and blamed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Venezuelan police. When questioned about the telephone call, Damato-Sifontes testified that he received a call that registered on his caller identification as \u201crestricted\u201d and that the message contained death threats.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">The immigration judge ruled that Damato-Sifontes\u2019s application for asylum was untimely and, in the alternative, the application failed on the merits. The judge did not make an adverse finding about Damato-Sifontes\u2019s credibility, but the judge stated that a memo from the Venezuelan Ministry of Interior Relations, which stated that Damato-Sifontes was \u201cgiven the benefit of retirement by way of grace\u201d and conveyed \u201cfeelings of consideration and esteem\u201d and gratitude for his \u201cinvaluable services,\u201d suggested that Damato-Sifontes was not \u201cperceived officially as a traitor____\u201d The immigration judge also found \u201csignificant\u201d that Damato-Sifontes did not \u201cmention any problems\u201d during his demonstrations in 2002 and 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The immigration judge credited Damato-Sifontes\u2019s testimony that shots were fired at him and that he received a telephone call the next day from an unidentified caller, but the judge did not mention the allegations made by Damato-Sifontes in his application that the caller attributed the incident to the political activities at Altamira. The immigration judge ruled that Damato-Sifontes\u2019s retirement and problems regarding his pension payments constituted harassment. The immigration judge found that there was \u201cno hard evidence\u201d to establish that Damato-Sifontes \u201cever had any problems in Venezuela for any of the five previously enumerated grounds.\u201d The judge also found there was \u201cno corroborating evidence to indicate that any of the statements that [Damato-Sifontes] made happened.\u201d In regard to the shooting, the court found that \u201cthere [was] no evidence whatsoever that this had anything to do with one of the five previously enumerated grounds or of who did it and why.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">The Board of Immigration Appeals dismissed the appeal by Damato-Sifontes and his family. The Board affirmed that the application for asylum was untimely and found that Damato-Sifontes and his family failed to establish that conditions, had changed in Venezuela to excuse the untimely application. The Board then considered the merits of Damato-Sifontes\u2019s application for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention. The Board \u201cassume[d] for purposes of adjudicating the appeal that [Damato-Sifontes] testified credibly, and affirm[ed]\u201d the conclusion of the immigration judge that Damato-Sifontes \u201cfailed to meet his burden of proof establishing that it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted on account of a protected ground if he is returned to Venezuela.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">The Board considered separately the shooting and the phone call. The Board \u201caffirm[ed]\u201d the conclusion of the immigration judge that Damato-Sifontes \u201cfailed to establish a nexus between [the shooting] and a protected ground.\u201d The Board found \u201cthere [was] no evidence at all to confirm [Damato-Sifontes\u2019s] suspicions that the shots were fired by [government] officers\u201d or that \u201cthis event was connected in any way to the demonstration that [Damato-Sifontes] attended in Caracas the previous day.\u201d The Board found that Damato-Sifontes referred to the shooting-incident as an \u201cattempted robbery\u201d and found \u201cno basis upon which to disturb the Immigration Judge\u2019s conclusion that \u2018there is no evidence whatsoever this had anything to do with one of the five previously enumerated ground[s] or of who did it or why.\u2019 \u201d In a separate paragraph, the Board \u201cagree[d]\u201d with the immigration judge that the \u201csingle threatening anonymous phone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>call\u201d did not \u201crise[ ] to the level of prosecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Damato-Sifontes and his family moved for reconsideration. Damato-Sifontes argued that he was entitled to an exception from the filing deadline because of changed conditions in Venezuela. He also argued that the Board erred by finding that fie presented no evidence to establish that he was targeted for his political activities. Damato-Sifontes repeated the statement in his application that the anonymous caller told him that \u201cwe will burn down your family and you, if you keep going to Altamira.\u201d The Board denied the motion and ruled that Damato-Sifontes had \u201cnot identified any material factual or legal errors in the prior decision that are supported by pertinent authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">We review the denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">Damato-Sifontes and his family challenge the denial of their motion to reconsider factual findings by the Board. The family does not challenge the finding that their application for asylum was untimely, which we lack jurisdiction to review. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). Because only claims for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention remain, and these regulations do not provide for derivative benefits, we deny the petition to Damato-Sifontes\u2019s wife and daughter. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c); <em>Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 862 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">An alien may file a motion to reconsider to point out factual errors in the decision of the Board. That motion must \u201cspecify[ ] the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision and ... be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). The Board abuses its discretion when its decision is arbitrary or capricious. <em>See Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148,1149 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-12\">The Board abused its discretion by denying Damato-Sifontes\u2019s motion to reconsider. Damato-Sifontes argued that the Board erred by finding that there was \u201cno evidence at all\u201d to suggest that the shooter was motivated by Damato-Sifontes\u2019s political activities. The Board credited Damato-Sifontes\u2019s testimony that the shooting occurred after he attended a rally opposing the Chavez government and that he received an anonymous call the next day, but the Board failed to consider Damato-Sifontes\u2019s statement in his application that the caller professed responsibility for the shooting and threatened to kill Damato-Sifontes and his family if he participated in further demonstrations at Altamira Plaza. The Board also failed to consider whether the caller related the shooting and the protests.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-13\">We vacate the denial of Damato-Sifontes\u2019s motion. When the Board has not addressed an issue of fact raised by a petitioner \u201c \u2018the proper course ... is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.\u2019\u201d <em>Calle, </em>504 F.3d at 1329 (quoting <em>INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16, 123 S.Ct. 353, 355, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam)). We remand to the Board to consider whether the shooting and Damato-Sifontes\u2019s political activity were related and whether Damato-Sifontes is entitled to withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-14\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b737-15\">We DENY the petition to Damato-Sifontes\u2019s wife and daughter. We GRANT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>Damato-Sifontes\u2019s petition, VACATE the order that denied Damato-Sifontes\u2019s motion to reconsider, and REMAND for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">PETITION GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART. VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
