We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1015 (9th Cir.2003), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-24\">The agency denied Lucas\u2019 asylum application as time barred. Lucas does not challenge this finding in his opening brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-25\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Lucas failed to establish past persecution. <em>See Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 339-40 (9th Cir.1995). In addition, even if the disfavored group analysis set forth in <em>Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>F.3d 922, 927-29 (9th Cir.2004) applies in the context of withholding of removal, Lucas failed to demonstrate that it was more likely than not that he will be persecuted if he returned to Indonesia. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1184-85 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Lucas failed to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if he returns to Indonesia. <em>See El Himri v.
