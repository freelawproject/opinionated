We must raise the question of mootness <em>sua sponte, </em>and we review the question de novo. <em>United States v. Laves-Meraz, </em>452 F.3d 352, 355 (5th Cir.2006). Hailu\u2019s conviction for an aggravated felony has the collateral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>consequence of making him permanently inadmissible to the United States. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(A)(i)\u2014(ii) (barring reentry of aliens removed for conviction of an aggravated felony). This collateral consequence prevents this case from being moot. <em>See Alwan v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 507, 510-11 (5th Cir.2004) (holding that due to the collateral consequence of permanent inadmissibility, deportation did not render the case moot).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Congress has expressly barred judicial review of final orders of removal against an alien who is removable as an aggravated felon. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). After the enactment of the REAL ID Act of 2005, we now have jurisdiction, in cases otherwise covered by \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), to review questions of law or constitutional claims raised upon a petition for review. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Hailu challenges his conviction for indecency with a child. He does not argue that it is not an aggravated felony. He argues that he was denied his constitutional rights because his attorney misled him and forced him to plead guilty by telling him that if he did not plead guilty, the INS would take away his green card. Hailu\u2019s challenge to his state court conviction is not appropriate in this petition for review. A final conviction \u201cprovides a valid basis for deportation unless it is overturned in a judicial post-conviction proceeding.\u201d <em>Zinnanti v. INS, </em>651 F.2d 420, 421 (5th Cir.1981). Hailu has not alleged that his conviction has been overturned, and he may not collaterally attack the validity of his conviction in this immigration proceeding. <em>See Brown v. INS, </em>856 F.2d 728, 731 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The other arguments in Hailu\u2019s brief challenge the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge (IJ) in denying his claims for withholding of removal. He states that he is seeking review because he disagrees with the decisions of the IJ and the BIA, and he contends that he has presented strong evidence and has met his burden of proof. He states that he has \u201cConstitutional Claims,\u201d but he does not state what they are. Hailu\u2019s arguments do not raise questions of law or constitutional claims. We hold that we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s final order of removal. <em>See Alwan, </em>388 F.3d at 515. Because we lack jurisdiction to review the final order of removal, the petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b335-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
