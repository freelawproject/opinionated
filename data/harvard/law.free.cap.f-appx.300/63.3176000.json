We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-18\">We review district court orders granting motions to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(c) <em>de novo. See Jasinski v. Barnhart, </em>341 F.3d 182, 184 (2d Cir.2003). \u201cWhen deciding an appeal from a denial of disability benefits, we focus on the administrative ruling rather than the district court\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Curry v. Apfel, </em>209 F.3d 117, 122 (2d Cir.2000). We conduct a plenary review of the administrative record to determine whether, considering the record as a whole, substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s decision and the correct legal standards have been applied. <em>See Shaw v. Chater, </em>221 F.3d 126, 131 (2d Cir.2000). \u201cSubstantial evidence means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-19\">The Commissioner found that Peace was not entitled to SSI benefits because (1) he either had engaged in substantial gainful activity or was incarcerated between 1985 and 1994, (2) his hypertension and drug abuse did not constitute severe impairment, and (3) he retained the residual functional capacity to perform non-complex work at all exertional levels. The District Court correctly concluded that substantial evidence supported these findings. We have carefully considered Peace\u2019s remaining contentions on appeal and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-20\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
