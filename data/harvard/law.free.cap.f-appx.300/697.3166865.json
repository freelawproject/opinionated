On appeal, Saunders raises three issues: (1) the district court erred in allowing Wal-Mart to present evidence regarding Saunders\u2019s application for Social Security disability benefits and his involvement in the company \u201cLawn Maintenance by Don\u201d; (2) the district court erred in excluding Saunders\u2019s proffered rebuttal evidence of testimony from his social worker and tax documents sent to his fiancee for \u201cLawn Maintenance by Don\u201d; and (3) Wal-Mart used a peremptory challenge to exclude an African American potential juror in violation of <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-14\">After review and oral argument, we find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s order. First, the district court did not abuse its discretion in either evidentiary ruling because Wal-Mart\u2019s evidence was relevant to the issue of mitigation of damages and to impeachment of Saunders\u2019s claim that he still would be working at Wal-Mart but for his termination, and Saunders\u2019s proffered rebuttal evidence was cumulative to Saunders\u2019s own extensive testimony on his Social Security application and his involvement with \u201cLawn Maintenance by Don.\u201d In any event, Saunders has not shown that either evidentiary ruling had a substantial prejudicial effect on the outcome of the trial. Second, as to Saunders\u2019s <em>Batson </em>claim, Wal-Mart offered a race-neutral explanation for using its peremptory strike, and Saunders failed to show that its reason was pretextual. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Saunders\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b724-12\">. We review the denial of a motion for a new trial for an abuse of discretion. <em>Bianchi v. Roadway Exp., Inc., </em>441 F.3d 1278, 1282 (11th Cir.2006). We review rulings on the admissibility of evidence for an abuse of discretion and will not overturn an evidentiary ruling unless the moving party establishes a substantial prejudicial effect. <em>Goldsmith v. Bagby Elevator Co., Inc., </em>513 F.3d 1261, 1276 (11th Cir.2008). We review the district court's resolution of a <em>Batson </em>challenge under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>Central Ala. Fair Hous. Ctr., Inc. v. Lowder Realty Co., Inc., </em>236 F.3d 629, 635 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
