Morales (\u201cMorales\u201d), a diabetic suffering from several attendant illnesses, sought disability benefits and supplemental security income. An Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) found Morales \u201cnot fully credible\u201d and denied benefits. The district court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">Morales raises several issues on appeal. First, she argues that the ALJ erred by failing to ask a Vocational Expert to determine whether she had worked as a receptionist. The ALJ determination, however, was supported by substantial evidence and nothing suggests a need for a Vocational Expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-14\">Second, Morales asserts that the ALJ cited the wrong Dictionary of Occupational Titles provision for the receptionist job. This typographical error was harmless. <em>See Stout v. Comm\u2019r of Social Sec. Admin., </em>454 F.3d 1050, 1055 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-15\">Next, Morales argues that the ALJ erred in rejecting her subjective symptom and attendant limitations testimony. Morales further contends that this improper rejection of testimony infected and invalidated the ALJ\u2019s residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) assessment. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-16\">\u201cWhile an ALJ is responsible for determining the credibility of a claimant, an ALJ cannot reject a claimant\u2019s testimony without giving clear and convincing reasons.\u201d <em>Holohan v. Massanari, </em>246 F.3d 1195, 1208 (9th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Reddick v. Chater, </em>157 F.3d 715, 722 (9th Cir.1998)). \u201cGeneral findings are insufficient; rather, the ALJ must identify what testimony is not credible and what evidence undermines the claimant\u2019s complaints.\u201d <em>Reddick, </em>157 F.3d at 722 (citations and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-17\">In rejecting Morales\u2019 testimony, the ALJ relied on three grounds. First, he looked to a non-testifying, non-treating, non-examining State Agency physician\u2019s checklist. However, the checklist lacked both explanation and citation to the record, and therefore it does not provide a clear and convincing reason for the ALJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Celaya v. Halter, </em>332 F.3d 1177, 1183-84 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-18\">Second, the ALJ relied on the lack of a \u201cdisability\u201d determination in medical source statements. However, the absence of corroborating medical evidence, to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>extent it should be considered at all, is insufficient standing alone to reject Morales\u2019 subjective complaints about the severity of her symptoms when she has provided medical evidence of underlying impairments. <em>See Reddick, </em>157 F.3d at 722 (citing <em>Bunnell v. Sullivan, </em>947 F.2d 341, 343 (9th Cir.1991) (en banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Finally, the ALJ relied on medical improvement. Medical improvement is a clear and convincing reason for rejecting a claimant\u2019s testimony, <em>see </em>SSR 96-7p, but a finding of improvement must be supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Holohan, </em>246 F.3d at 1207-08 (employing \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard in medical improvement context). The ALJ found that Morales\u2019 condition had improved based on several pieces of evidence: (1) Morales\u2019 temporary weight loss, (2) a July 2003, statement that she was feeling well, and (3) a January 2003 examination showing a glucose level of 264, a creatine level of 1.4, and no edema. In light of the entire record, however, the ALJ\u2019s conclusion of medical improvement is not supported by substantial evidence. First, the ALJ did not explain why Morales\u2019 one-time drop to 169 pounds constituted improvement when Morales weighed over 250 pounds on every previous and subsequent occasion. Second, Morales\u2019 July 2003 statement that she felt \u201cwell\u201d provides little evidence of improvement since she made a similar statement less than a week after leaving the intensive care unit. <em>See Kellough v. Heckler, </em>785 F.2d 1147, 1153 (4th Cir. 1986) (finding \u201cisolated references in physician\u2019s notes to \u2018feeling well\u2019 \u201d was an insufficient basis for rejecting subjective limitations where \u201cjust one month before [the claimant] was hospitalized for open heart surgery, [she] also stated that she \u2018feels well\u2019 \u201d), <em>cited with approval in Holohan, </em>246 F.3d at 1205. Third, while the January 2003 examination shows a drop in glucose levels from the 400-500 range to the high-200 to low-300 range, nothing suggests any concomitant alleviation of Morales\u2019 chronic renal insufficiency or other limitations. Indeed, Dr. Ferraro stated that a further change was necessary \u201cto slow the progression of underlying diabetic nephropathy.\u201d (ER 96). The record also shows that many of Morales\u2019 conditions, such as proteinuria and anemia, either worsened or continued unabated. Given these shortcomings, the record does not provide substantial support for the ALJ\u2019s \u201cmedical improvement\u201d finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">In sum, the \u201cmedical improvement\u201d finding is not supported by \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d and the record lacks clear and convincing reasons for rejecting Morales\u2019 testimony. As such, the district court\u2019s judgment is reversed and remanded with instructions to remand to the Commissioner for further proceedings to determine Morales\u2019 credibility and to assess her RFC. Such proceedings may include, if necessary, additional factual development. The district court is affirmed on the remaining grounds. The parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b484-19\"> xhiS disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
