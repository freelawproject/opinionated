For the following reasons, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>vacate the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">This case began when Constable Lopez of Cameron County terminated the employment of Deputy Constable Dario Diaz (\u201cDiaz\u201d). Diaz appealed his termination to the Civil Service Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d), alleging that he was dismissed for political reasons. The Commission upheld Diaz\u2019s termination. Under Texas law, a party has 30 days to appeal a Commission decision by filing a petition in state district court. Tex. Loc. Gov\u2019t Code Ann. \u00a7 158.012(a) (Vernon 1999). Diaz filed a state-court petition within this time period; however, the petition did not expressly indicate that it was an appeal from the Commission\u2019s decision. Rather, the petition was defined as a \u201ccause of action\u201d against the County Defendants \u201cfor employment discrimination and retaliation under the Texas and U.S. Constitutions, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and local [law].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The County Defendants removed the state-court petition to federal court, alleging federal-question jurisdiction based on the constitutional and \u00a7 1983 claims in Diaz\u2019s petition. A few days later, the County Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Specifically, the County Defendants argued that Diaz failed to properly appeal pursuant to \u00a7 158.012(a), rendering Diaz\u2019s present lawsuit an \u201cunauthorized collateral attack\u201d on the Commission\u2019s decision. The district court denied the motion to dismiss and <em>sua sponte </em>remanded the case back to state court. In addition, the court determined that removal was wrongful and thus imposed attorney\u2019s fees against the County Defendants pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c). The County Defendants appeal only this award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">We review the award of attorney\u2019s fees upon remand for an abuse of discretion. <em>Hornbuckle v. State Farm Lloyds, </em>385 F.3d 538, 541 (5th Cir.2004). When a district court remands a case, it has discretion to award the \u201cpayment of just costs and any actual expenses, including attorney fees, incurred as a result of removal.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c). However, this discretion is not unlimited: \u201cAbsent unusual circumstances, courts may award attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1447(c) only where the removing party lacked an objectively reasonable basis for seeking removal.\u201d <em>Martin v. Franklin Capital Corp., </em>546 U.S. 132, 141, 126 S.Ct. 704, 163 L.Ed.2d 547 (2005). In making this determination, the district court \u201cdo[es] not consider the motive of the removing defendant.\u201d <em>Valdes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>199 F.3d 290, 292-93 (5th Cir.2000). Rather, the court must consider the objective merits of removal at the time of removal, irrespective of the ultimate remand. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">Here, the district court awarded attorney\u2019s fees because it found that the County Defendants \u201clacked an objectively reasonable basis for seeking removal.\u201d This finding was based on what the court viewed as inconsistencies between the County Defendants\u2019 removal motion and subsequent motion to dismiss. Specifically, the district court suggested that the County Defendants (1) deliberately misconstrued Diaz\u2019s state-court petition as <em>a new lawsuit </em>in order to remove the case, and then (2) implicitly conceded that the state-court petition was <em>an appeal under \u00a7 158.012(a) </em>in order to seek dismissal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, much of the court\u2019s analysis focused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>on whether Diaz\u2019s state-court petition was properly construed as an appeal or an entirely new lawsuit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">For purposes of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1447(c), this distinction is irrelevant. If Diaz had filed a new lawsuit alleging federal claims, then the case clearly would have been removable. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(b) (providing for removal of claims arising under federal law). Similarly, if Diaz had filed an appeal pursuant to \u00a7 158.012(a) involving federal claims, the case would also have been removable. <em>See Caldera v. County of El Paso, Tex., </em>520 F.Supp.2d 846, 854 (W.D.Tex.2007) (noting that the defendant properly removed a state-court appeal under \u00a7 158.012(a)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Regardless of the characterization of Diaz\u2019s state-court petition, the embedded constitutional and \u00a7 1983 claims provided an \u201cobjectively reasonable basis for seeking removal.\u201d See <em>Martin, </em>546 U.S. at 141, 126 S.Ct. 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Thus, the district court erred in focusing on the County Defendants\u2019 subsequent motion to dismiss. Any inconsistencies between the removal motion and the motion to dismiss are not relevant to the award of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1447(c). We look only to the objective merits of removal <em>at the time of removal; </em>we do not consider the defendants\u2019 motives. <em>Valdes, </em>199 F.3d at 292-93. Because the state-court petition contained \u201can objectively reasonable basis for seeking removal,\u201d the district court abused its discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1447(c). See <em>Martin, </em>546 U.S. at 141,126 S.Ct. 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees is VACATED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b306-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b307-7\">. <em>See </em>Opinion &amp; Order of February 15, 2008 (\"[The County Defendants] may not argue that the Plaintiffs petition is the initiation of a new lawsuit to justify removal, and then argue that the petition is an appeal of an administrative judgment to secure dismissal.\u201d); Transcript of Hearing on Attorney\u2019s Fees, April 30, 2008 (\"I feel that the position of the [County Defendants] was inconsistent.... You know, it's clear to me that [the state-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>court petition] was intended to be an appeal.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b308-7\">. The district court stated that it was \"clear\u201d that Diaz\u2019s state-court petition was intended to be an appeal pursuant to \u00a7 158.012(a). Although not necessary to our analysis, we note that the County Defendants' alternative construction is equally reasonable. Diaz\u2019s petition was defined as \u201ca cause of action for employment discrimination and retaliation.\u201d It never referred to itself as an appeal, never invoked \u00a7 158.012(a), and never discussed the Commission\u2019s decision. Moreover, the petition specifically requested a jury trial, which is unavailable in an appeal under \u00a7 158.012(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b308-22\">. Although this Court has not explicitly addressed the removal of \u00a7 158.012(a) appeals filed in state court, we have consistently assumed that such removals are proper. <em>See Gray v. Bexar County Sheriff\u2019s Civil Service Comm\u2019n, </em>129 F.3d 610, 1997 WL 681148, at *2 (5th Cir.1997) (affirming the district court's decision after removal of the state-court appeal) (unpublished); <em>James v. City of Houston Texas, </em>48 Fed.Appx. 916, 2002 WL 31114951, at *3 (5th Cir.2002) (acknowledging that the district court removed both the federal claims and the state-law claim to review the Commission\u2019s decision). The parties identify no authority suggesting that removal of \u00a7 158.012(a) appeals involving federal questions is improper.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
