We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Alvarez-Sanchez contends the district court erred in applying a two-level enhancement for possession of a firearm under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) because the government did not establish that a weapon was present or, in the alternative, because it was clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense. We conclude the district court did not clearly err in determining that Alvarez-Sanchez\u2019s co-conspirator possessed a gun during the course of the drug conspiracy, that this was reasonably foreseeable to Alvarez-Sanchez, and that the gun was present in connection with the offense. <em>See United States v. Willis, </em>899 F.2d 873, 875 (9th Cir.1990); <em>see also United States v. Garcia, </em>909 F.2d 1346, 1350 (9th Cir. 1990) (in light of the large amount of drugs, co-conspirator\u2019s possession of a gun was reasonably foreseeable).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">In addition, Alvarez-Sanchez contends that, because he received safety-valve relief, the district court was precluded from applying the \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) enhancement. This contention lacks merit. <em>See United States v. Nelson, </em>222 F.3d 545, 551 (9th Cir .2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b614-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
