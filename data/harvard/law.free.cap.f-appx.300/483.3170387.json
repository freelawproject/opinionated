Syaifudin entered the United States on a visitor\u2019s visa in 1991, and has resided in California since his arrival. His son, Naufal, was born in 2000. After receiving a Notice to Appear, Syaifudin conceded removability, but sought cancellation of removal based on the claim that his removal would result in \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d to his United States citizen child. The IJ denied Syaifudin\u2019s application for cancellation of removal and the BIA affirmed. Syaifudin argues that this court has jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s decision because the IJ applied the incorrect legal standard in her analysis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>hardship and violated Naufal\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">We have jurisdiction to address Syaifudin\u2019s claim that the IJ applied the incorrect legal standard by failing to consider cumulatively the factors constituting hardship. <em>See Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 648 (9th Cir.2007). We do not have jurisdiction to review the Equal Protection claim because Syaifudin has not presented a colorable constitutional argument. <em>Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005). Nor do we have jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s comparative analysis of Naufal\u2019s hardship, as this a discretionary determination by the IJ. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B); <em>Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 888 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">We agree with Syaifudin that a cumulative analysis of hardship factors is required, and that lack of such analysis would constitute legal error. The IJ\u2019s decision in this case, however, makes clear that she <em>did </em>engage in that analysis. In her decision, the IJ specifically stated that after considering the factors cumulatively, she found that exceptional and extremely unusual hardship had not been established. Syaifudin argues that, despite the IJ\u2019s statement of the correct legal standard, she still failed to apply it. He argues that, because the IJ discussed each hardship factor individually, she did not consider the cumulative effect of the factors. There is no basis for the proposition that the IJ may not evaluate factors individually as part of her cumulative analysis. Nor are there guidelines that establish what the IJ must say in her decision to demonstrate that she has considered the aggregate impact of the hardship factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">The IJ discussed the factors both in isolation and in combination with each other. For instance, the IJ discussed how Naufal\u2019s age, intelligence, and linguistic ability would affect his ability to obtain an education in Indonesia. She also discussed how Naufal\u2019s age, health, and family health history; the ability to obtain fresh food and milk in Indonesia; and the Indonesian health care system would affect his general health prognosis. It is evident from the IJ\u2019s decision that she weighed the factors both individually and collectively, and that considering all the relevant facts, she found that Syaifudin had not demonstrated exceptional and extremely unusual hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">On the basis of our determination that the IJ applied the correct legal standard, we deny Syaifudin\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">PETITION DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b510-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
