Abrams, which denied Gjelosh Pjetracaj\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>In re Gjelosh Pjetracaj, et. al, </em>Nos. A95 850 573/574/575 (B.I.A. Nov. 30, 2007), <em>ajfg </em>Nos. A95 850 573/574/575 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 30, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>As a preliminary matter, the Government argues that Pjetracaj failed to exhaust any challenge to the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination by neglecting to address that determination in his brief to the BIA. The Government is correct that, while Pjetracaj alluded to a credibility determination in that brief, he failed to articulate error in the IJ\u2019s credibility determination or, indeed, to even acknowledge the IJ\u2019s specific findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">In addition to the statutory requirement that petitioners exhaust each category of relief, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), this Court generally will not consider arguments regarding individual issues that were not exhausted before the agency. <em>Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 107 n. 1 (2d Cir.2007). While not jurisdictional, this judicially imposed issue-exhaustion requirement is mandatory. <em>Id. </em>at 119-20. In particular, a petitioner must challenge all findings that are dispositive of his claims, and the failure to do so is fatal to his petition for review. <em>See Steevenez v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 114, 117-18 (2d Cir. 2007) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Even if we were to reach Pjetracaj\u2019s arguments, however, they are entirely without merit. We treat an IJ\u2019s adverse credibility findings as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Pinto-Montoya v. Mukasey, </em>540 F.3d 126, 129 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">In finding that Pjetracaj was not credible, the IJ identified numerous inconsistencies in the record, including: (1) while Pjetracaj testified extensively to an incident where his van was shot at and flipped over causing him injuries, he omitted that incident from his asylum application; (2) Pjetracaj\u2019s testimony was inconsistent as to the injuries he sustained when the van flipped over; and (3) while Pjetracaj stated on his asylum application that he was elected to a position within the Democratic Party of Albania, Pjetracaj and his wife testified that he did not hold any position in the party. These discrepancies went to the heart of Pjetracaj\u2019s claim that he had been persecuted based on his political opinion. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 308 (2d Cir.2003) <em>abrogated, in pari, on other grounds by Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">Finally, we lack jurisdiction to consider Pjetracaj\u2019s challenges to the agency\u2019s denial of withholding of removal and CAT relief because he failed to raise them to the BIA. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b108-21\">. Rita and Eduard Pjetracaj were listed as derivative applicants on Gjelosh Pjetracaj\u2019s asylum application. We refer to Gjelosh Pjetracaj as \"Pjetracaj\u201d throughout this order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
