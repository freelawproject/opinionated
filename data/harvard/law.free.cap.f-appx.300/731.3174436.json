(\u201cHawksbay\u201d) presented sufficient evidence to support a jury verdict and final judgment of almost $40 million rendered against Appellant Edwai\u2019d Merrit Reizen (\u201cReizen\u201d) in this diversity action. Hawks-bay claimed that Reizen breached his fiduciary duty, engaged in fraud, fraudulent concealment, conversion, civil theft, and aided and abetted a breach of fiduciary duty in violation of Florida law. On appeal, Reizen claims that the district court erred by denying his (1) motion for a new trial on the breach of fiduciary duty count,</p>\n<p id=\"b757-18\">(2) motion for a directed verdict or new trial on the fraud, fraudulent concealment, conversion, civil theft, and aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty counts, and</p>\n<p id=\"b757-19\">(3) motion for a new trial or remittitur on the punitive damage award. After thorough review of the record and having taken oral arguments, we affirm the final judgment of the district court in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-20\">We are satisfied that there was sufficient evidence adduced at trial to support Hawksbay\u2019s claims of fraud, fraudulent concealment, conversion, civil theft, and aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty. We are also convinced that the evidence presented amply supported the jury\u2019s award of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
