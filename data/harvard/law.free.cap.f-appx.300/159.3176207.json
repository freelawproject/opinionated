For the foregoing reasons, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">Petitioner entered the United States on an F-l student visa on May 14, 1994. On October 24, 1994, the government approved petitioner\u2019s application for a J-l visa, available to certain foreign students, scholars, and researchers. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(15)(J). Petitioner\u2019s wife and children were admitted on November 30, 1994, on J-2 visas. Petitioner filed an affirmative application for asylum on March 18, 2003. The government issued a Notice to Appear on February 5, 2004, charging petitioner as removable under INA \u00a7 237(a)(l)(C)(i), for overstaying his J-visa and charging petitioner\u2019s family as removable under INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(A) for having been inadmissible at the time of entry. Petitioner and his family sought asylum, withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) based on petitioner\u2019s 2003 asylum application. The Immigration Judge determined that petitioner\u2019s asylum application was time-barred because he failed to file within one year of April 1, 1998,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and he did not qualify for an exception. The IJ also determined that petitioner had not met his burden of proof for withholding of removal or for CAT relief. The BIA denied petitioners\u2019 appeal, and petitioners timely filed a petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">In their petition for review, petitioner and his family challenge the BIA\u2019s determination that petitioner had failed to meet his burden of proof on his claim for withholding of removal and raise a number of due process issues. Petitioner asserts that he managed the Indonesian government\u2019s family planning programs under the Suharto regime, and that, while in Indonesia, he espoused moderate Muslim beliefs through the MDI, or Counsel of Islamic Beliefs. Petitioner asserts that he fears for his safety because of the rise of extreme Muslim terrorist organizations, and his identity as a moderate Muslim and former Suharto official in charge of family planning programs. Specifically, petitioner notes that an organization known as Jemaah Islamiyah has bombed various locations in an effort to transform Indonesia into an Islamic theocracy, and that it has claimed responsibility for detonating a bomb in Bali in 2002, which killed many people.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-13\">We have jurisdiction over final orders of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1). \u201cWhere the BIA renders its own decision and does not merely adopt the opinion of the IJ, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>review the BIA\u2019s decision, not that of the IJ.\u201d <em>Wong v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>539 F.3d 225, 230 (3d Cir.2008) (citation omitted). Under the substantial evidence standard, we will defer to the BIA\u2019s factual findings unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Id. </em>We exercise de novo review over constitutional claims. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Yusupov v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>518 F.3d 185,197 (3d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Petitioner asserts that the BIA erred in concluding that he was not more likely than not to face persecution by Muslim extremists on account of his identity as a moderate Muslim ex-official in the Suharto regime. Petitioner submitted evidence of tension between Muslim extremists and moderate Muslims in Indonesia and a number of news articles. Petitioner\u2019s expert testified that petitioner had \u201csome justification\u201d for fearing Muslim extremists, not on the basis of his moderate Muslim beliefs, but on the basis of his involvement in the Suharto regime. (A.R. 179.) According to the expert witness, the Suharto regime alienated many militant Islamic groups by restricting Islamic political parties and preventing the implementation of Islamic law. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">We do not believe that this testimony, or any other aspect of the record, compels a conclusion that petitioner faced a clear probability of persecution. Petitioner cites news articles about radical Islamic groups seeking to establish Islamic law in Indonesia; however, the articles fail to demonstrate that these groups have targeted moderate Muslims or former Suharto-regime officials as opposed to committing generalized violence and creating chaos.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree with the BIA that petitioner has not demonstrated a clear probability that he would be recognized as an ex-Suharto official so many years after the regime dissolved, nor has he demonstrated that the harm he would face would constitute persecution. Therefore, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">We also do not believe that the IJ improperly denied petitioner\u2019s claim because of general civil strife in Indonesia.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although petitioner correctly asserts that persecution may exist even in the context of generalized violence, we also note that generalized violence does not excuse the petitioner from demonstrating a nexus between the persecutory acts and a protected category. <em>See Vente v. Gonzales, </em>415 F.3d 296, 301 (3d Cir.2005) (asylum claim possible amidst general social unrest where applicant had received specific threats from paramilitary organizations accusing him of collaborating with guerillas). While petitioner construes the IJ\u2019s statements as evidence of confusion about whether petitioner was required to show he was \u201csingled out\u201d by Muslim extremists, it appears that the IJ was principally concerned by petitioner\u2019s failure to show a nexus between the Bali bombing of 2002 and petitioner\u2019s identity as a moderate Muslim and ex-official of the Suharto regime. Put another way, the IJ determined that petitioner had failed to show that the Bali bombing even partly targeted this group, let alone demonstrated a \u201cclear probability\u201d that petitioner would be persecuted. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>do not believe that the record compels a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Petitioner also contends that the IJ violated due process by exhibiting bias against him and allegedly pre-judging the merits of his application. A non-citizen has a right to due process in a removal hearing, which means an opportunity to reasonably present his or her case. <em>Khan v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 226, 236 (3d Cir. 2006) (citation omitted). Such claims require a showing of \u201csubstantial prejudice\u201d to the non-citizen. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Upon reviewing the record, we do not believe that the IJ pre-judged the timeliness of petitioner\u2019s asylum application,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> nor did she exhibit bias against the petitioner or impermissibly fail to consider the evidence. The IJ\u2019s preliminary remarks merely placed petitioner on notice as to her doubts regarding the timeliness of his asylum application, as he filed the application almost nine years after arriving in the U.S., and that petitioner would be expected to address her concerns. Although the IJ demonstrated impatience with the petitioner at points during his testimony, we agree with the BIA that the IJ\u2019s frustration appears to have stemmed from petitioner\u2019s insistence on testifying in English alongside the court-appointed translator, who was appointed at petitioner\u2019s behest. We agree also with the BIA that the IJ\u2019s confusion as to petitioner\u2019s last residence in Indonesia caused no prejudice to petitioner. Nor do we believe that petitioner has raised any other meritorious issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">For the aforementioned reasons, the petition for review will be denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b186-10\">. Under regulations establishing the one-year filing deadline, anyone seeking asylum who had entered the U.S. on or before April 1, 1997, was required to file his or her application by April 1, 1998. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(2)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b187-7\">. Petitioner also cites an article from <em>Newsweek </em>commenting on the tension between Muslim extremists and other Muslims. (Pet. Br., 14.) However, the article focuses narrowly on the Ahmadiyya sect of Islam. Petitioner\u2019s reliance on this article to demonstrate a large-scale assault by Muslim extremists on all moderates is misplaced. (A.R.1028-1030.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b187-11\">. Petitioner raised this argument before the BIA, but the BIA declined to address the argument explicitly. Under these circumstances, we may examine the IJ's opinion. <em>See Joseph v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>421 F.3d 224, 226 n. 4 (3d Cir.2005) (referring to IJ's opinion to \"provide the proper context and background\u201d for analysis of the BIA\u2019s ruling).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b188-7\">. We note that the timeliness of petitioner's asylum application is not before us, nor would we have jurisdiction over the issue had petitioner raised it. <em>Sukwanputra v. Gonzales, </em>434 F.3d 627, 635 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
