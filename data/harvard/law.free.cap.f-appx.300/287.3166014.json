Carmona-Castillo argues that his third-degree felony conviction under Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 22.04 for causing injury to a child does not constitute aggravated felony that rendered him eligible for removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-16\">The Immigration and Nationality Act lists as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d a \u201ccrime of violence (as defined in section 16 of Title 18, but not including a purely political offense) for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.\u201d Relevant to Carmona-Castillo\u2019s petition for review, a crime of violence for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 is a felony that by its nature involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-17\">The statute under which Carmona-Castillo was convicted \u2014 Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 22.04 \u2014 criminalizes acts or omissions that intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently result in an injury to a child, and specifically prescribes at least two ways in which the offense of injury to a child can be committed: a violation of the statute can committed by an individual who causes an injury to a child (1) by act or (2) by omission. <em>See Perez-Munoz v. Keisler, </em>507 F.3d 357, 362 (5th Cir.2007); \u00a7 22.04(a). Because the statute at issue is divisible in that it defines multiple offenses, at least one of which constitutes an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>aggravated felony, we may consider the charging documents, stipulated facts, or some other formal finding of the relevant facts of conviction to determine if the Carmona-Castillo\u2019s particular crime meets the aggravated felony criteria. <em>See Perez-Munoz, </em>507 F.3d at 362; <em>Larin-Ulloa v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 456, 464 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">In the instant case, the administrative record contains a copy of the charging document and a certified copy of a record of conviction. The adjudicative documents definitively establish that Carmona-Castillo pleaded guilty in answer to an indictment charging that he caused bodily injury to a child through an intentional and knowing act \u2014 by hitting her. This court previously has held that an offense under \u00a7 22.04, when committed by a knowing and intentional act, constitutes a crime of violence under \u00a7 16(b). <em>See Perez-Munoz, </em>507 F.3d at 364. Accordingly, CarmonaCastillo\u2019s offense of conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony that constitutes a legitimate basis for his removal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Carmona-Castillo concedes that this court determined in <em>Perez-Munoz </em>that \u00a7 22.04 is a divisible statute that is subject to analysis under the modified categorical approach, and that an intentional violation of \u00a7 22.04 constitutes a crime of violence under \u00a7 16(b). He nonetheless asserts that <em>Perez-Munoz </em>was wrongly decided and argues that we should not adhere to that decision\u2019s flawed reasoning. However, a panel of this court cannot overrule a prior panel\u2019s decision in the absence of intervening contrary or superseding authority by this court sitting en banc or by the United States Supreme Court. <em>United States v. Lipscomb, </em>299 F.3d 303, 313 n. 34 (5th Cir.2002). Carmona-Castillo identifies no such contrary or superseding decisions. Thus, even if Carmona-Castillo is correct that <em>Perez-Munoz </em>was erroneously decided, we must defer to <em>Perez-Munoz\u2019s </em>resolution of the specific issues that Carmona-Castillo raises in his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">Carmona-Castillo\u2019s conviction for injury to a child under \u00a7 22.04 therefore is punishable under \u00a7 16(b) as a crime of violence. Accordingly, Carmona-Castillo committed an \u201caggravated felony\u201d that rendered him removable under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Because CarmonaCastillo\u2019s conviction qualifies as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d and he has failed to raise any other constitutional claim or questions of law in his petition for review, we deny his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b314-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
