Hamilton claims his counsel was ineffective for failing to ask the court to consider the sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006). He also claims the court erred by not sua sponte considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, in light of <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), <em>Gall v. United States, </em>-U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because Hamilton fails to show he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s conduct or that he was entitled to relief beyond the two-level reduction to his offense level, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. We also deny Hamilton\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
