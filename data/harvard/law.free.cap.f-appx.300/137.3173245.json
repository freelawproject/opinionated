For the reasons that follow, we will grant the petition and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-17\">Liu is a female native of China\u2019s Fujian Province who seeks asylum due to fear of forced abortion or forced sterilization if she is returned to her home country. After arriving in the United States, Liu married a Chinese native.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She and her husband had two daughters in the United States, one born in 2003 and one born in 2005. A.R. 169. Liu testified before the Immigration Judge (IJ) that she would face forced sterilization in China because her daughters were not properly spaced-under Chinese law, she should have waited five years before giving birth to a second child. A.R. 170. Liu and her husband also testified that they desired to have more children. A.R. 175, 215, 270. Liu testified that her mother, mother-in-law, and two aunts had each been forcibly sterilized after having between one and five children, to enforce China\u2019s population control policy. A.R. 170-71, A.R. 222-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-18\">The Immigration Judge granted Liu asylum. She found that Liu\u2019s two U.S. citizen children would return with her to China if she were deported; that they likely would be discovered by the authorities; that she and her husband intended to have more children; and that she had a reasonable and well-founded fear that any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>attempt to do so would result in forced abortion or forced sterilization. The IJ based these conclusions both on governmental reports in the record and on Liu\u2019s testimony concerning her relatives who had been forcibly sterilized.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The BIA reversed the IJ\u2019s decision and ordered that Liu be removed. It found that Liu\u2019s fear of forced sterilization was too speculative, basing this conclusion solely on a 2002 State Department Report (released in 2003), which noted that China simply required payment of a \u201csocial compensation\u201d fee by families that exceeded the child allowance, and that even this policy was only sporadically enforced. A.R. 3. The BIA found that Liu had failed to meet her burden of proof \u201cin the absence of any additional evidence which would support her fear.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The BIA did not mention Liu\u2019s testimony about the specific conditions in her home city and the experiences of her immediate family members. Nor did the BIA discuss other portions of the record that the IJ found supported Liu\u2019s claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Although this court is generally deferential to decisions of the BIA, agency determinations must be supported by substantial evidence. <em>See, e.g., Dia v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 228, 248 (3d Cir.2003). In this case, the BIA overturned the IJ\u2019s thoroughly reasoned decision to grant asylum in a general and cursory two-page opinion. A review of the IJ\u2019s decision and the administrative record reveal that the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Liu failed to introduce any specific evidence to support her fear of forced sterilization is not supported by substantial evidence. While the BIA may have had other reasons for denying Liu\u2019s asylum claim, we are not free to guess what those reasons might be.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">The petition for review is granted, and the proceedings remanded to the BIA to permit the agency to demonstrate that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>I.N.S. v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002). (\u201c... the proper course, except in rare circumstances, is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.\u201d). In light of the BIA\u2019s failure to acknowledge and discuss the evidence that Liu submitted, such a remand is necessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b164-13\">. Liu\u2019s husband was under a final deportation order when they married. He was taken into custody by immigration authorities during the pendency of Liu's removal proceedings and it appears he may have been removed. A.R. 77; 507.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b165-7\">. For example, the IJ noted that although a report produced by the Immigration and Naturalization Service indicated that Chinese scholars who studied abroad, had children overseas, and then returned to China might be treated in a lenient fashion [A.R. 309], there was no evidence that someone like Liu, who is not a scholar, would receive similar lenient treatment. A.R. 88. In fact, the IJ noted that the State Department\u2019s June 2004 profile of Chinese asylum claims stated that \"a family with a U.S.-born child or children receives no special treatment under family planning laws.\u201d A.R. 88, 440. The IJ noted that the Profile stated that U.S. diplomats in China were unaware of any cases of Chinese returnees who were forcibly sterilized, but the same Profile also acknowledges \"huge gaps in our knowledge due to China\u2019s size and political culture, communications limitations, and a frequent lack of cooperation from authorities.\u201d A.R. 88-89, 432, 440.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
