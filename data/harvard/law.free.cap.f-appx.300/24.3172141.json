DeFonzo, which denied her applications for political asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural history, and scope of the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-29\">We review a BIA order that affirms and fully adopts the decision of the IJ under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>the substantial evidence standard, such that we will not disturb a factual finding of the IJ \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence in the record when considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). We overturn the IJ\u2019s factual determinations \u201conly if \u2018any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u2019\u201d <em>Diallo v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 624, 628 (2d Cir.2006) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Upon review of the record, we conclude that substantial evidence supported the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Zheng did not suffer past persecution. There is no indication in the record that Zheng\u2019s required appearance at sonogram-type examinations rose to the level of past persecution as contemplated by the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). <em>See Wu Zheng Huang v. INS, </em>436 F.3d 89, 94-95 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Damko v. INS, </em>430 F.3d 626, 636-37 (2d Cir.2005) (stating that \u201cpersecution does not encompass all treatment that our society regards as unfair, unjust, or even unlawful or unconstitutional\u201d (quoting <em>Fatin v. INS, </em>12 F.3d 1233, 1240 (3d Cir.1993))).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">We further conclude that substantial evidence supported the IJ\u2019s determination that Zheng did not have a well-founded fear of persecution entitling her to asylum. The IJ found that, notwithstanding her mother\u2019s forcible sterilization, the fact that Zheng had no children and was neither married nor pregnant at the time of her application for asylum undercuts any claim that her fear of such treatment was objectively reasonable. <em>See Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir.2004) (noting that to establish well-founded fear, alien must \u201cpresent credible testimony that he subjectively fears persecution and [must] establish that his fear is objectively reasonable\u201d). In view of the applicable standard of review, we are constrained to defer to this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">Moreover, Zheng is not entitled to the presumption of asylum eligibility granted by section 601(a) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d) for applicants who establish a \u201cwell founded fear that [they] will be forced to undergo [a forcible sterilization or abortion] or subject to persecution for such failure, refusal, or resistance.\u201d IIRIRA \u00a7 601(a)(1), Pub.L. No. 104-208,110 Stat. at 3009-689 (amending 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)). Substantial evidence supported the IJ\u2019s finding that Zheng was never specifically threatened with such a procedure, despite her mother\u2019s experience. <em>See Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 306 (2d Cir.2007) (opining that Congress intended \u201cto limit the application\u201d of section 601(a) \u201cto individuals who are themselves physically forced to undergo an abortion or sterilization\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">Substantial evidence also supported the IJ\u2019s determination that Zheng was not entitled to withholding of removal, as Zheng did not meet the higher burden of establishing a \u201cclear probability\u201d that her life or freedom would be threatened on account of a protected ground upon her removal to China. <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984) (stating \u201cclear probability of persecution\u201d standard for withholding of deportation claims); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">Finally, we conclude that the IJ\u2019s determination that Zheng was not entitled to relief under the CAT was supported by substantial evidence. Zheng\u2019s fears of being subject to forcible sterilization or abortions, inhumane prison conditions, and economic sanctions upon her return to China do not prove that it is \u201cmore likely than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>not\u201d that she will be tortured if removed to China. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2); <em>see also Mu Xiang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 159 (2d Cir.2005) (describing burden of proof for establishing eligibility for CAT relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">For the foregoing reasons, this petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
