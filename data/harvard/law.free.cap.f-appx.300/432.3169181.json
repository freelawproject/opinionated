We review de novo the district court\u2019s determination that a prior conviction is a qualifying \u201cviolent felony.\u201d <em>See United States v. Davidson, </em>527 F.3d 703, 707 (8th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-24\">While this case was pending on appeal, the United States Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Begay v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 1583, 1585-86, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008) (to be \u201cviolent felony\u201d under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), crime must be \u201croughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk posed,\u201d to examples listed in statute; listed crimes all typically involve purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct). Following <em>Begay, </em>we re-examined whether auto theft should be considered a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>537 F.3d 969, 971, 973-76 (8th Cir.2008) (this court has never recognized distinction between \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and \u201cviolent felony\u201d; analyzing Missouri auto-theft law in light of Begay). After noting that the relevant Missouri statute sets forth three distinct offenses (auto theft without consent, auto theft by deceit, and auto theft by coercion), <em>see </em>Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 570.030, we concluded that only auto theft by coercion satisfied <em>Begay\u2019s </em>requirements and qualified as a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d <em>see Williams, </em>537 F.3d at 973-976. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Therefore, Dabney\u2019s prior conviction for stealing a truck is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d only if he committed the offense of auto theft by coercion.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">In determining whether Dabney committed auto theft by coercion, our inquiry is restricted to examining a \u201climited universe of judicial documents.\u201d <em>See United States v. Reliford, </em>471 F.3d 913, 916 (8th Cir.2006) (when offense is eligible for \u201cviolent felony\u201d classification but state criminal statute is over-inclusive \u2014 that is, elements of offense also encompass conduct that does not constitute \u201cviolent felony\u201d \u2014 court must consider facts underlying conviction; inquiry is conducted by examining limited universe of judicial documents), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2248, 167 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2007); <em>see also Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (inquiry is limited to terms of charging document, terms of plea agreement or transcript of colloquy, or some comparable judicial record of this information).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Because we cannot determine from the present record whether Dabney committed auto theft by coercion, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing. <em>See Williams, </em>537 F.3d at 973 (instructing district court, after considering materials permissible under <em>Shepard, </em>to determine which auto-theft offense appellant committed).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
