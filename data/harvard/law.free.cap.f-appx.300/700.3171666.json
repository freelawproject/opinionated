In his suit, Bowers alleged he was injured after riding on a defective locomotive seat. Bowers sought to introduce expert testimony regarding the cause of his injuries, but the district court granted the Defendants\u2019 motion to exclude Bowers\u2019s expert testimony on causation. The district court then granted the Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the ground that Bowers failed to show causation. Bowers appeals the grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-24\">On appeal, Bowers challenges the district court\u2019s exclusion of the causation testimony of Dr. David A. Miller, Dr. Arthur Warded, Dr. Roy Baker, and Michael O\u2019Brien. Specifically, Bowers contends the district court abused its discretion in its analysis of whether the expert testimony should be admitted under Fed.R.Evid. 702 and <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>We review a district court\u2019s ruling \u201con the admissibility of expert testimony for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Allison v. McGhan Med. Corp., </em>184 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Bowers first argues that the district court did not apply the appropriate test in analyzing the admissibility of the expert testimony at issue in this appeal. Bowers contends that <em>McCorvey v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., </em>298 F.3d 1253 (11th Cir. 2002), requires a district court to use only the three-part test set forth in Fed.R.Evid. 702 to determine the admissibility of expert evidence. Accordingly, Bowers contends that the district court abused its discretion in applying the factors enumerated in <em>Daubert </em>and in the advisory committee notes to Fed.R.Evid. 702. We disagree. The district court did apply the three-part test set forth in Fed.R.Evid. 702 and, as part of its thorough and sifting analysis of the reliability prong of the test, considered the factors set forth in <em>Daubert </em>and the advisory committee notes to Fed R. Evid. 702. In the very case Bowers cites in support of his argument, we recognized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-5\">In deciding whether these requirements of Rule 702 are met, <em>Daubert </em>instructs courts to consider the following factors: (1) whether the expert\u2019s theory can be and has been tested; (2) whether the theory has been subjected to peer review and publication; (3) the known or potential rate of error of the particular scientific technique; and (4) whether the technique is generally accepted in the scientific community.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-6\"><em>McCorvey, </em>298 F.3d at 1256 <em>(citing Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 593-94, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469). It is obviously not an abuse of discretion, therefore, to apply the <em>Daubert </em>factors in analyzing the admissibility of expert evidence. Additionally, in <em>Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v. Carmichael, </em>526 U.S. 137, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999), the Supreme Court stated that a trial judge has \u201cbroad latitude to determine\u201d what factors are most appropriate to apply in a given case. <em>Id. </em>at 152-53, 119 S.Ct. at 1176. Therefore, we conclude it is not an abuse of discretion for a district court to consider factors enumerated in the advisory committee notes to Fed R. Evid. 702 when analyzing whether expert testimony is admissible under Fed.R.Evid. 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">Bowers next argues that the district court abused its discretion in excluding Dr. Miller\u2019s expert testimony on causation. Bowers argues that the district court made factual errors in its analysis. While most of Bowers\u2019s arguments attempt to reargue the facts presented to the district court, one argument merits discussion. Bowers correctly contends that the district court made use of an unauthenticated document in its analysis of the admissibility of Dr. Miller\u2019s evidence on causation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But, the district court only used the unauthenticated document in its analysis of one factor enumerated in the advisory notes to Fed.R.Evid. 702. The district court reasoned that Dr. Miller had not adequately accounted for obvious alternative explanations for the cause of Bowers\u2019s injury since he had not taken into account information on the unauthenticated document. (R.4-85 at 37.) But the district court\u2019s use of the unauthenticated document in its discussion of one of the nine factors was not critical to the outcome of its analysis. The district court found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>that all nine factors it considered (the four <em>Dauberi </em>factors and the five advisory committee factors) favored exclusion of the expert testimony. (R.4-85 at 34, 38.) We conclude that even without relying on the unauthenticated document, the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the expert testimony when eight of the nine factors the district court considered counseled exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Bowers next argues that the district court abused its discretion in excluding the expert evidence offered by Dr. Wardell and Dr. Baker. The crux of Bowers\u2019s argument is that the district court applied the wrong test to determine admissibility of expert evidence. As discussed above, however, the district court has wide latitude to determine the appropriate factors to use in its analysis. Here, the district court\u2019s application of the <em>Daubert </em>and advisory committee factors was both thorough and careful. We conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the expert evidence offered by Dr. Warded and Dr. Baker.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Bowers next argues that the district court abused its discretion in excluding the expert testimony of Michael O\u2019Brien. Specifically, Bowers contends that the district court improperly credited the testimony of the Defendants\u2019 fact witness over the expert testimony of O\u2019Brien. This is incorrect. The district court excluded O\u2019Brien\u2019s testimony because he admitted he was not qualified to determine the cause of Bowers\u2019s back injuries. (R.4-85 at 47-48). The district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the expert testimony of O\u2019Brien.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Finally, Bowers argues the district court erred in granting summary judgment. We disagree. Because Bowers cannot show causation, summary judgment for the Defendants was appropriate. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for the Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b728-7\">. During the deposition of Dr. Wardell, the Defendants introduced an exhibit, an emergency room chart from Coliseum Health Services, which they never authenticated. (Dr. Wardell\u2019s Dep. 70:5-6, Ex. D-6.) The Defendants later, while deposing Dr. Miller, asked questions about this unauthenticated document. (Dr. Miller's Dep. 52:13-17.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
