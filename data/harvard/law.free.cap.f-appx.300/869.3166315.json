On appeal, Jackson argues the district court erroneously denied his motion for mistrial after the Government\u2019s statement at closing argument improperly shifted the burden of proof from the Government to the defense. Jackson further asserts the district court erred in finding his request for a mistrial was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-23\">Normally, we review the denial of a motion for mistrial for an abuse of discretion. <em>United, States v. Ramirez, </em>426 F.3d 1344, 1353 (11th Cir.2005). However, failure to object to a comment during closing argument, without a viable excuse, \u201centitles the objecting party to relief only if he can show that the remarks, in the context of the trial, amounted to plain error.\u201d <em>United States v. Soto, </em>591 F.2d 1091, 1101 (5th Cir.1979). We may find plain error where: (1) an error occurs; (2) the error is plain; (3) the error affects substantial rights; and (4) \u201cthe error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1777-79, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>\u201cProsecutorial misconduct requires a new trial only if we find the remarks (1) were improper and (2) prejudiced the defendant\u2019s substantive rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>145 F.3d 1433, 1438 (11th Cir.1998) (internal quotation omitted). To determine the prejudicial impact of the prosecutor\u2019s statements, we \u201cmust evaluate them in the context of the trial as a whole and assess their probable impact on the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the habeas corpus context, we have stated, to be substantially prejudicial, the improper comments must have \u201cso infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction or sentence a denial of due process.\u201d <em>Parker v. Head, </em>244 F.3d 831, 838 (11th Cir.2001) (alteration and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">In a criminal proceeding, the government has the burden of proving every element of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Simon, </em>964 F.2d 1082, 1086 (11th Cir.1992). During closing arguments, \u201cprosecutors must refrain from making burden-shifting arguments which suggest that the defendant has an obligation to produce any evidence or to prove innocence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, \u201cprejudice from the comments of a prosecutor which may result in a shifting of the burden of proof can be cured by a court\u2019s instruction regarding the burden of proof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1087.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">The record does not reveal any plain error. The district court instructed the jury immediately after the prosecutor\u2019s comments were made that the Government bears the burden to prove Jackson\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Even if the objection was promptly made, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Jackson\u2019s motion for a mistrial because the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, when taken in context, were not improper burden-shifting that prejudiced Jackson\u2019s substantial rights. Rather, the remarks were merely a response to Jackson\u2019s claims during closing argument that he was injured by the police officers at the time of his arrest. The contested statement, \u201cI have the burden of proof, but if you\u2019re going to get up and allege that he\u2019s beaten and he\u2019s injured and\u2014where is the proof of that? The proof is that he was taken to the hospital,\u201d taken alone, is an argument Jackson was uninjured by the police, not an attempt to shift the burden from the prosecution to the defense. Moreover, even if the prosecutor\u2019s statements were improper, the district court gave three separate curative instructions regarding the burden of proof, and nothing in the record indicates the jurors failed to follow the court\u2019s instructions. <em>Simon, </em>964 F.2d at 1087.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">Because the prosecutor\u2019s comments during closing arguments were not improper, nor substantially prejudicial, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Jackson\u2019s motion for mistrial. Accordingly, no error, plain or otherwise, was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
