For the reasons below, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">In May 2007, Sudol, a native of Poland, was charged as removable as an aggravated felon. Sudol denied the charge of removability and applied for a discretionary waiver of removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (also known as \u201c \u00a7 212(c) relief\u2019). After a hearing, the Immigration Judge (IJ) sustained the charge that Sudol committed an aggravated felony related to the sexual abuse of a minor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The IJ determined that Sudol was not eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief and ordered Sudol removed to Poland. The BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision and dismissed the appeal. Through counsel, Sudol filed a timely petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">We have jurisdiction to consider whether Sudol is an aggravated felon and exercise plenary review over the BIA\u2019s conclusion. <em>Garcia v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>462 F.3d 287, 290-91 (3d Cir.2006). We have jurisdiction to review any constitutional claims or questions of law <em>de novo. Caroleo v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 158,162 (3d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Sudol argues that the IJ erred in finding that he had been convicted of an aggravated felony because he was committed to a mental health facility for psychiatric treatment. However, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(A), the definition of a conviction includes a formal judgment of guilt entered by a court or a guilty plea by an alien and the imposition of restraint on the alien\u2019s liberty. Here, Sudol pleaded guilty to aggravated sexual assault and aggravated sexual contact and was sentenced to fifteen years of confinement at Avenel Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center. Such confinement was a restraint on his liberty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, he was \u201cconvicted\u201d of an aggravated felony and is removable.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">In order for Sudol to establish eligibility for relief under \u00a7 212(c), he must demonstrate, <em>inter alia, </em>that the basis for his removal has a \u201cstatutory counterpart\u201d ground for exclusion in \u00a7 212(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. <em>Caroleo, </em>476 F.3d at 162. Sudol argues that he committed a crime of moral turpitude which is listed in \u00a7 212(a). While Sudol\u2019s crime could be characterized as a crime involving moral turpitude, the statutory counterpart analysis looks at the ground for removal, which here is the aggravated felony of sexual abuse of a minor. <em>Caroleo, </em>476 F.3d at 164. This categorical approach does not violate equal protection. <em>Id. </em>at 165-67. The aggravated felony for which Sudol has been found removable, sexual abuse of a minor, does not have a statutory counterpart in \u00a7 212(a). <em>Zamora-Mallari v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 679, 692-93 (7th Cir.2008); <em>Abebe v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 1092, 1105 (9th Cir.2007); <em>Avilez-Granados v. Gonzales, </em>481 F.3d 869, 872 (5th Cir.2007). <em>But see Blake v. Carbone, </em>489 F.3d 88, 104 (2d Cir.2007) (holding an aggravated felon is eligible for \u00a7 212(c) waiver if his offense could form the basis for exclusion as a crime of moral turpitude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>under \u00a7 212(a)). Thus, the BIA did not err in concluding that Sudol is not eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">For the above reasons, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b184-8\">. Sudol committed aggravated sexual assault against one of his daughters when she was between thirteen and sixteen years old.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b184-9\">. Sudol relies on <em>Holzapfel v. Wyrsch, 259 </em>F.2d 890 (3d Cir.1958), in which the alien\u2019s prison sentence was suspended, and he was placed on probation with psychiatric treatment as a condition of probation. However, in <em>Holzapfel, </em>the alien was charged as removable for being convicted of a crime of moral turpitude and sentenced to confinement for a year or more. Here, Sudol is charged as removable for being an aggravated felon \u2014 the definition of which does not depend on any sentence received.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
