On appeal Jackson asks that we vacate his sentence and order a remand so that the district court can reconsider his sentence in light of <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). Because Jackson was sentenced as a career offender, however, <em>Kimbrough </em>has no effect on his sentence. We therefore affirm Jackson\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-17\">Jackson, using the alias \u201cShane,\u201d arranged to sell two ounces of crack to an undercover police officer for $1,800. Jackson and his friend Gregory Burks met the officer at the agreed location and told him to follow them to an IHOP. At the IHOP, Burks handed Jackson a package, which Jackson passed along to the officer. Testing confirmed that the package contained roughly 47 grams of crack.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-18\">That quantity triggered a statutory maximum of 40 years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii). At sentencing in May 2007, the district court concluded \u2014 and defense counsel conceded \u2014 that Jackson qualified as a career offender because he was 22 when he committed this drug crime and had prior felony convictions for forcible robbery and substantial battery. The court thus applied a base offense level of 34 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.1(B). With a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, Jackson\u2019s total offense level of 31 combined with his criminal history category of VI yielded an imprisonment range of 188 to 235 months. Jackson argued that an even lower sentence would be appropriate and asked the court to depart below the career offender range, but the court disagreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-19\">You\u2019re young and impulsive and very dangerous and I really can\u2019t agree with [defense counsel], as eloquently as he presented his argument, but I can\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>agree with him that you\u2019re somebody that should have the benefit of lower guidelines. I think you\u2019re a career offender and you very much deserve that characterization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">The court therefore imposed a term at the low end of that range after considering Jackson\u2019s offense, history, and characteristics. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">On appeal Jackson makes a <em>\u201cKimbrough </em>\u2014 like\u201d argument: he argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Kimbrough </em>should be extended beyond the guidelines to statutory penalties that turn on whether the cocaine at issue is powder or crack. Jackson acknowledges that he did not raise this argument in the district court, so our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Taylor, </em>520 F.3d 746, 748-49 (7th Cir.2008). Jackson correctly notes that if he had sold powder cocaine instead of crack, the statutory maximum sentence, and therefore his base offense level and sentencing range, would have been lower. So, Jackson proposes, the \u201cintermediate step\u201d of determining the appropriate statutory maximum should also be subject to the same discretion that a sentencing court has under <em>Kimbrough </em>to reject the default ratio of powder to crack.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">However, as Jackson\u2019s attorney conceded at oral argument, this is just new packaging for a recycled argument. In a typical case requiring remand after <em>Kimbrough, </em>the defendant\u2019s base offense level is set by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, and so the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine offenses arises from the drug-quantity table contained in the guidelines. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Hearn, </em>534 F.3d 706, 714-15 (7th Cir.2008) (remanding and observing that \u201cthe 100:1 ratio is not a statutory dictate\u201d but rather \u201ca judgment of the Sentencing Commission.\u201d). In contrast, Jackson was sentenced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, which in turn relies on statutory m\u00e1ximums to establish a defendant\u2019s base offense level. Thus, although Jackson\u2019s sentencing range was higher than if he had been caught with an identical amount of powder cocaine, the disparity in his case stems not \u201cfrom the guideline itself but from the statutory maximum that the guideline referenced.\u201d <em>United States v. Liddell, </em>543 F.3d 877, 882 (7th Cir.2008). And \u201c[wjhile the sentencing guidelines may be only advisory for district judges, congressional legislation is not.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>536 F.3d 798, 803 (7th Cir.2008). <em>Kimbrough </em>therefore has no effect on Jackson\u2019s statutory maximum or his guidelines range. <em>See Hams, </em>536 F.3d at 813 (7th Cir.2008); <em>see also United States v. Clanton, </em>538 F.3d 652, 660 (7th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Clay, </em>524 F.3d 877, 878-79 (8th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>520 F.3d 1072, 1075 (9th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Jimenez, </em>512 F.3d 1, 8-9 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">There is one caveat. We have also recently considered whether sentencing courts may use them discretion under <em>Kimbrough </em>not to disregard the career-offender guideline, but to issue a below-guidelines sentence after correctly applying the career-offender penalty. <em>See Lid-dell, </em>543 F.3d at 882-83. In <em>Liddell, </em>we concluded that they can. <em>Id. </em>at 884-85 (observing that career-offender guidelines are advisory and that after <em>Kimbrough </em>district courts may consider erack/powder disparity when resentencing career offenders). In the district court, Jackson anticipated <em>Liddell </em>by asking the court to apply \u00a7 4B1.1 \u201con paper\u201d and then exercise its discretion under <em>Booker </em>to go below the career-offender range and sentence him as if he was not a career offender. Jackson has not pursued this argument on appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>however, and in any event the district court concluded that a below-guidelines sentence would be inappropriate. Even after <em>Liddell </em>that conclusion is not unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Otero, </em>495 F.3d 393, 401-02 (7th Cir.2007) (holding that a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
