Lucas sued defendantsappellees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for alleged violations of his constitutional rights, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985 for an alleged conspiracy to deprive him of his civil rights, and under Kentucky law for claims of defamation and malicious prosecution. After carefully reviewing the record, the applicable law, the parties\u2019 briefs, and having had the benefit of oral argument, we find that the district court\u2019s opinion carefully and correctly sets out the facts and the governing law. Because this court\u2019s issuance of a full opinion would serve no jurisprudential purpose and would be duplicative, we affirm on the basis of the district court\u2019s well-reasoned order of September 20, 2007, granting summary judgment to defendants-appellees.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
