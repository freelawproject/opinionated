Hakopian claims she will be persecuted and tortured if removed to Iran because she is an evangelical Christian. The IJ did not err in denying Hakopian\u2019s applications for relief, and we therefore deny her petition for review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-14\">The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Kasnecovic v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 812, 813 (9th Cir.2005). Hakopian\u2019s asylum application, where she described only two incidents of persecution by government agents, conflicted with her oral testimony, where she described an additional incident. This discrepancy goes to the heart of Hakopian\u2019s claim for asylum, which claim is based on a fear of persecution. <em>See Kaur v. Gonzales, </em>418 F.3d 1061, 1067 (9th Cir. 2005). The IJ gave Hakopian an opportunity to explain this inconsistency, and the IJ addressed Hakopian\u2019s explanation in a \u201creasoned manner,\u201d noting her inability to explain the discrepancy. <em>See Osorio v. INS, </em>99 F.3d 928, 933 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>The IJ\u2019s denials of Hakopian\u2019s claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief are also supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Kasnecovic, </em>400 F.3d at 813. The State Department Country Condition Reports on which Hakopian relied demonstrate neither that \u201cit is more likely than not that she would be subject to persecution based on\u201d her religion nor that \u201cit is more likely than not that [she] would be tortured if removed to\u201d Iran. <em>Kohli v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 1061, 1070 (9th Cir. 2007). Therefore, we deny Hakopian\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b564-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
