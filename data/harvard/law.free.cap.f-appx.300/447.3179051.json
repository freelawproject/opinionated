Thomas was given consecutive sentences of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment on the felon-in-possession charge and 48 months\u2019 imprisonment on the obliterated serial number charge. In imposing sentence, the district court found that Thomas\u2019s 1991 Missouri state first-degree tampering conviction, based upon his unlawful operation of a motor vehicle without the owner\u2019s consent, constituted a crime of violence within the meaning of United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.2. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>484 F.3d 542 (8th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Following our affirmance of Thomas\u2019s conviction, the United States Supreme Court granted Thomas\u2019s petition for certiorari, vacated our judgment, and remanded the case to us for reconsideration in light of <em>Begay v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008). <em>See Thomas v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 2046, 170 L.Ed.2d 788 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">We recently held that the Missouri crime of tampering does not qualify as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of U.S. Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), <em>United States v. Williams, </em>537 F.3d 969, 974-75 (8th Cir.2008), a term we recognize as synonymous with the term \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act, <em>see United States v. Johnson, </em>417 F.3d 990, 996 (8th Cir.2005) (\u201cThe statutory definition of \u2018violent felony\u2019 is viewed as interchangeable with the guidelines definition of \u2018crime of violence.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-12\">Based on the holding in <em>Williams, </em>we vacate Thomas\u2019s sentence and remand the case to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
