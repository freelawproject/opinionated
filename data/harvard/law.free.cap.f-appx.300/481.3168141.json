We dismiss the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary determination that Mariseal-Valle failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005). Moreover, Mariscal-Valle has not raised a color-able constitutional or legal claim to invoke our jurisdiction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The evidence Mariscal-Valle presented with his motion to reopen concerned the same basic hardship grounds as his application for cancellation of removal. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 602-O3 (9th Cir.2006). We therefore lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination that the evidence would not alter the agency\u2019s prior discretionary determination that Mariscal-Valle failed to establish the requisite hardship. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">PETITIONS FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b507-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
