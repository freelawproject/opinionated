We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural history, and issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-20\">Our review of the District Court\u2019s judgment dismissing the Shareholders\u2019 complaint is plenary because the Shareholders have challenged the \u201clegal precepts applied by the district court in making a discretionary determination.\u201d <em>Scalisi v. Fund Asset Mgmt., L.P., </em>380 F.3d 133,137 (2d Cir.2004). In reviewing a grant of a motion to dismiss <em>de novo, </em>we must take \u201cas true all allegations in the complaint, and draw[ ] all reasonable inferences therefrom in the [plaintiffs\u2019] favor.\u201d <em>Koppel v. 4987 Corp., </em>167 F.3d 125, 130 (2d Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Under Delaware law, which applies here because Bristol-Myers Squibb (\u201cBMS\u201d) was incorporated in Delaware, <em>see RCM Sec. Fund, Inc. v. Stanton, </em>928 F.2d 1318, 1326 (2d Cir.1991), plaintiffs in derivative actions must plead either demand futility or wrongful refusal of demand, <em>Levine v. Smith, </em>591 A.2d 194, 200 (Del.1991), <em>overruled on other grounds by Brehm v. Eisner, </em>746 A.2d 244, 253 n. 13, 254 (Del. 2000). Whether demand is futile is determined by one of two tests articulated in <em>Aronson v. Lewis, </em>473 A.2d 805, 814 (Del. 1984), <em>overruled on other grounds by Brehm, </em>746 A.2d at 254 <em>(\u201cAronson </em>test\u201d), and <em>Rales v. Blasband, </em>634 A.2d 927, 933-34 (Del.1993) <em>(\u201cRales </em>test\u201d). Under the <em>Rales </em>test, which applies here because the subject of the Shareholders\u2019 derivative suit is not a business decision of the Board, demand is excused as futile only where particularized factual allegations create a reasonable doubt that, as of the time the complaint was filed, the Board could have properly exercised its independent and disinterested business judgment in responding to a demand. <em>See Rales, </em>634 A.2d at 934. We reject the Shareholders\u2019 contention that <em>Rales </em>is inapposite here and that <em>Kaplan v. Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &amp; Co., </em>540 A.2d 726 (Del.1988), instead governs the inquiry into whether they have adequately pleaded demand futility. Unlike <em>Kaplan, </em>in which the corporation expressed a position of neutrality respecting its shareholders\u2019 derivative litigation, the record in this case reflects BMS\u2019s opposition to the Shareholders\u2019 derivative action and thus refutes any claim of BMS\u2019s neutrality. In addition, we find it significant that <em>Kaplan </em>preceded <em>Rales. </em>Finally, we note that even if we were to follow <em>Kaplan </em>here, the Court must \u201cexamine the position or policy espoused by the corporation which [the pre-suit demand requirement] seeks to protect.\u201d <em>Kaplan, </em>540 A.2d at 731. In this case, BMS \u2014 the corporation whom we must endeavor to protect \u2014 opposed the Shareholders\u2019 litigation. This Court must respect the BMS Board\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Because the Shareholders do not appeal the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the complaint did not plead improper director interest or lack of directorial independence with particularized facts as required under <em>Rales, </em>they have not satisfied the applicable pleading requirements in this derivative action, and the District Court therefore did not err in dismissing their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">The judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
