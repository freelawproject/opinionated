Prior to accepting the guilty plea, the district court denied Sherman\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized following a vehicle stop in Durham, North Carolina. We affirm the denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">This court reviews the factual findings underlying a motion to suppress for clear error, and the district court\u2019s legal determinations de novo. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>484 F.3d 267, 280 (4th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996)). When evaluating the denial of a motion to suppress, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government. <em>United States v. Uzenski, </em>434 F.3d 690, 704 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">Sherman alleges that there was no reasonable suspicion justifying the stop of his vehicle. \u201c[A]n officer may, consistent with the Fourth Amendment, conduct a brief, investigatory stop when the officer has a reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 123, 120 S.Ct. 673, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000) (citing <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)). To conduct a Terry stop, there must be \u201cat least a minimal level of objective justification for making the stop.\u201d <em>Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. at 123, 120 S.Ct. 673. Reasonable suspicion requires more than a hunch but less than probable cause, and may be based on the collective knowledge of officers involved in an investigation. <em>See id. </em>at 123-24, 120 S.Ct. 673; <em>see also United States v. Hensley, </em>469 U.S. 221, 232, 105 S.Ct. 675, 83 L.Ed.2d 604 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, we conclude that the district court did not err when it denied Sherman\u2019s motion to suppress. The officer who stopped Sherman was an off-duty member of the Durham Police Department who was working as a security guard at the Varsity Ale House. Shortly after closing, at around 2:15 a.m., the officer was in the restaurant\u2019s crowded parking lot when he heard three shots fired. He immediately turned toward where he heard the shots and saw a car rapidly approaching him with its lights off and several security officers pointing at the car and shouting for him to stop it. Under the totality of the circumstances, <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 8, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989), we find that the officer had reasonable, articulable suspicion to stop Sherman\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-14\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
