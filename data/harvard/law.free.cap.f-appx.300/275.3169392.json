He contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>that his 46-month sentence is both proeedurally and substantively unreasonable.. He argues that the district court did not adequately explain why the sentence was appropriate in light of the reasons he advanced for a downward departure or variance. He contends that the presumption of reasonableness given to within-guideline sentences should not be given to sentences calculated pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 because that guideline is not supported by empirical evidence. He finally argues that the sentence failed to take into account his personal circumstances, as is required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">To the extent Alcaraz-Salazar seeks review of the district court\u2019s implicit denial of his downward departure request, we lack jurisdiction to review that denial. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d 416, 424 (5th Cir.2006). To the extent AlcarazSalazar seeks review of the implicit denial of his downward variance request, in <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), the Supreme Court established a bifurcated process for conducting a reasonableness review. <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). Pursuant to <em>Gall, </em>this court must determine whether the district court committed any procedural errors, \u201csuch as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence-including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. If the district court\u2019s decision is procedurally sound, this court will \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard ... tak[ing] into account the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\"><em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), does not support Alcaraz-Salazar\u2019s contention that sentences calculated pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2 should not be presumed reasonable. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008). The district court in Alcaraz-Salazar\u2019s case heard AlcarazSalazar\u2019s argument for a downward variance, stated the guideline sentencing range, adopted the presentence report, and added that a sentence within the range satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 3553(a). The district court\u2019s reasons were sufficient, <em>see Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d at 424. Alcaraz-Salazar has not shown that his within-guideline sentence should not be presumed reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b301-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
