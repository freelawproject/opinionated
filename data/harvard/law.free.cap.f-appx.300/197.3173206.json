She was sentenced to thirty months in prison. Barber sought a departure or variance sentence based upon the sentencing disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine in the applicable advisory guidelines, but the district court found that Barber\u2019s request was foreclosed by <em>United States v. Eura, </em>440 F.3d 625 (4th Cir.2006). Barber timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-15\">After the judgment was entered and while the appeal was pending, the Supreme Court issued <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). The Court held \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 574. Accordingly, the Court remanded to permit the district court to consider the 100-to-l ratio of crack cocaine to powder cocaine in sentencing. Barber argues, and the Government concedes, that this case should be remanded for resentencing in light of <em>Kimbrough.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-18\">Because the district court did not have the benefit of <em>Kimbrough </em>when sentencing Barber, we vacate Barber\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-19\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
