PDNB also appeals the denial of its cross-motion for partial summary judgment. The district court concluded that the financial institution bond (the \u201cPolicy\u201d) issued by Federal did not cover PDNB\u2019s vault cash because it was not \u201cin transit\u201d when the loss occurred. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant or denial of cross-motions for summary judgment. <em>See Bader v. Northern Line Layers, Inc., </em>503 F.3d 813, 816 (9th Cir.2007). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Because this is a diversity action that involves interpretation of an insurance contract, California insurance law governs the analysis. <em>Conestoga Services Corp. v. Executive Risk Indemnity, Inc., </em>312 F.3d 976, 981 (9th Cir.2002). \u201cThe rules governing policy interpretation require us to look first to the language of the contract in order to ascertain its plain meaning or the meaning a layperson would ordinarily attach to it.\u201d <em>See Waller v. Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc., </em>11 Cal.4th 1, 18, 44 Cal. Rptr.2d 370, 900 P.2d 619 (1995) (citing Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 1638).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The district court relied upon <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. v. Burbank Generators, Inc., </em>121 Cal.App.3d 813, 175 Cal. Rptr. 568 (App.1981) to conclude that coverage was not available under the Policy because PDNB\u2019s vault cash could not be considered \u201cin transit\u201d when the loss occurred. Although this rationale might apply, we conclude that coverage of PDNB\u2019s loss is precluded by the express terms of the Policy that extend coverage only to losses occurring when property is \u201cin an armored vehicle\u201d or during \u201cloading and unloading\u201d of the armored vehicle. The stipulated facts in this case indicate that PDNB\u2019s loss occurred after the money was unloaded from the armored vehicle and placed inside the carrier\u2019s office. Therefore, we find that PDNB\u2019s loss is precluded from coverage by the express terms of the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b580-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
