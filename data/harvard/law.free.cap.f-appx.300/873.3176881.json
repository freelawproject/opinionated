Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b900-11\">Garay, a native of Colombia and dual citizen of Colombia and Venezuela, was a member of the Liberal Party in Colombia. Through that affiliation his company, Quantum Ltd., received contracts to provide electrical services to the Colombian government.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to Garay, his political affiliation and Quantum\u2019s government contracts caused him to become a target of Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia (\u201cFARC\u201d) guerillas.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-16\">Garay entered the United States in August 2000 and Paul entered in January 2001, both pursuant to visitor visas. Ga-ray\u2019s status was later changed to that of a \u201cspecialty occupational professional.\u201d Both Garay and Paul, however, overstayed their visas.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On November 21, 2002, Ga-ray and Paul filed separate applications for asylum with Immigration and Naturalization Services, claiming that based on past incidents involving the FARC, they feared returning to Colombia because of their political beliefs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Their applications were referred to immigration court and the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) issued Garay and Paul Notices to Appear, charging each with removability.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-17\">A hearing was conducted, at which time the petitioners presented affidavits and live witnesses. The witness\u2019 varying accounts included allegations of the following: in November 1999, five armed FARC members came to Garay\u2019s office while he was away, detained and threatened his employees, interrogated them about Garay and his wife\u2019s whereabouts, and caused damage to the office and property contained therein. In February 2000, Garay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>received a telephone call warning him that if he did not withdraw Quantum\u2019s bid for a public utility company, the FARC would \u201cmake justice.\u201d A week after Quantum was awarded the contract, Garay received a phone call from FARC stating that he would be killed. He thereafter left Colombia for the United States in March 2000 out of fear for his life, but returned three months later in hope that he would no longer be in danger because enough time had passed. On August 20, 2000, an SUV containing armed FARC members attempted to stop Garay\u2019s car, but he successfully eluded them. Paul similarly received death threats over the telephone from FARC and, in December 2000, a vehicle attempted to block his path, but Paul evaded it.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Among the evidence presented by petitioners was a document that purported to be a November 12, 1999 Colombian police report, detailing the alleged break-in at Quantum. The DHS questioned the authenticity of this document and DHS\u2019s forensic document examiner testified that because the police station\u2019s letterhead and seal were made by ink jet technology, which is an uneconomical and unusual way to make police reports, she believed the document was likely a forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">The IJ denied Garay\u2019s and Paul\u2019s claims, finding that: (1) Garay\u2019s testimony was not credible, based in part on the finding that the police report was a forgery; (2) the petitioners had not established past persecution (3) the petitioners had not established a well-founded fear of future persecution. Both petitioners appealed this decision, and on February 29, 2008, the BIA dismissed their appeal, but only on the past and future persecution grounds. The instant petition followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">The petitioners seek review of the dismissal of their petitions by the BIA, arguing that none of the three grounds asserted by the IJ was supported by substantial evidence. The BIA\u2019s dismissal of the petitioners\u2019 appeal, however, was only based on the issues of past and future persecution. The BIA did not affirm the IJ\u2019s credibility finding, and instead assumed credibility and dismissed based on the substantive merits. We therefore will not consider whether substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusions that Garay lacked credibility and presented a forged police report. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201c[w]e review only the Board\u2019s decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">The BIA\u2019s factual determinations, including the existence of past persecution and a well-founded fear of persecution, are reviewed under the substantial evidence test. <em>I.N.S. v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). The substantial evidence test is very deferential and we will affirm the BIA\u2019s decision so long as it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1286 (citation omitted). The record is reviewed in the light most favorable to the BIA\u2019s decision, and all reasonable inferences are drawn in favor of that decision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">An alien may establish eligibility for asylum by showing that he has either suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b). To establish asylum based on past persecution, the applicant must prove (1) that he was persecuted, and (2) that the persecution was on account of a protected ground. <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006). Mere harass<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>ment does not amount to persecution because \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 401 </em>F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotations and citations omitted). This court has rejected a \u201crigid requirement of physical injury,\u201d noting that \u201c \u2018attempted murder is persecution,\u2019 regardless of whether the petitioner was injured.\u201d <em>De Santamaria v. U.S. Atty Gen., </em>525 F.3d 999, 1008 (11th Cir.2008) (internal quotation omitted). Nonetheless, menacing telephone calls and threats are insufficient to establish persecution. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F at 1231</p>\n<p id=\"ACx\">The witness\u2019 testimony indicated that the FARC bound and interrogated employees at Quantum, but neither of the petitioners were present during this event.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because they were not directly threatened or harmed, this evidence does not compel a finding of past persecution. <em>See Zheng v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1290 (11th Cir.2006) (a \u201cfive-day detention [where the petitioner was actually detained but] during which he was not harmed does not compel the conclusion that he experienced past persecution\u201d), Moreover, although Garay testified that FARC members attempted to stop his car and were in possession of guns, they did not point their guns at him or otherwise attempt to injure him. Similarly, at the most Paul\u2019s testimony indicated that FARC members used their car to block the road and that he successfully eluded it. Paul did not establish that he was the target of this roadblock, that FARC thereafter made any further attempts to stop him, or that they planned to injure him. The BIA was not required to find that these events arose to the high standard of \u201cpersecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AYD\">A well-founded fear of future persecution requires that the petitioner \u201cdemonstrate that his or her fear of persecution is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable,\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289, and js at least in part on account of a protected ground. <em>Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1233 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cThe subjective component is generally satisfied by the applicant\u2019s credible testimony ^at he or she genuinely fears perse- \u00b0 cution. In most cases, the objective prong can be fulfilled either by establishing past persecution or that he or she has a good reason to fear future persecution.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289 (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"A99\">As explained above, the petitioners did not establish Past persecution, so they must demonstrate a good reason to fear future persecution. Garay argues that the reason he became a target of the FARC is because Quantum worked on projects for the Colombian government. Garay admitted that he no longer has any communication with Quantum and has not done any work for the Colombian government since moving to America. Moreover, Garay testified that Quantum is now likely defunct for failure to pay taxes. As such, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that the petitioners would no longer be a target of the FARC as petitioners had broken ties with the Colombian government and a significant amount of time has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>passed. Thus, petitioners failed to show a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\">For the reasons stated, the petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b900-12\">. The BIA decision also listed Maria Del Pilar Bernal, but she is not included in this petition for review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b900-13\">. Paul was also a member of the Liberal Party and the grounds for his petition are the same as his father\u2019s. The facts of this opinion are therefore formulated largely around events in Garay's life, but apply equally to Paul\u2019s petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b900-18\">. Garay\u2019s via expired when his employer became inactive or closed on October 2, 2002. Paul's visa expired by its terms on July 13, 2001.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b900-19\">. The IJ noted that Garay\u2019s application was not filed within one year of his arrival in the United States, but nonetheless considered it because it was filed within a reasonable time after the expiration of his valid non-immigrant status.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"AnU\">. We note that there is no requirement that the petitioners be present for events such as kidnaping or threats in order to establish past persecution. In <em>De Santamar\u00eda, </em>we found past persecution where, amongst other things, FARC members tortured and killed the petitioner\u2019s groundskeeper because he would not disclose the petitioner\u2019s location. <em>De Santa-maria, </em>525 F.3d at 1009. The facts of the instant case, however, fail to rise to this level, None of the employees at Quantum were injured and only property was destroyed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
