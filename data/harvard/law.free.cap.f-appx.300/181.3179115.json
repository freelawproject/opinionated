He pled guilty to two counts: conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and possession with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Sanchez-Mercedes appeals his sentence as unreasonably \u201charsh\u201d because it is \u201ctantamount to a life sentence.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His appeal focuses on the fact that he is a fifty-year old first-time offender. He argues that after the District Court calculated his federal Sentencing Guidelines range, it failed to give adequate weight to this mitigating fact under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). For the reasons below, Sanchez-Mercedes\u2019s sentence was reasonable and thus we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">The Sentencing Guidelines are advisory, and no longer mandatory following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker. See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (citing <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)). We review a sentence under a deferential \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[0]ur [review] is two-fold. We must first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error in arriving at its decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Wise, </em>515 F.3d 207, 217 (3d Cir.2008). Examples of procedural errors include \u201c \u2018failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597). \u201c[W]hen a judge decides simply to apply the Guidelines to a particular case, doing so will not necessarily require lengthy explanation,\u201d but it should set forth enough to comport with \u00a7 3553(c) and \u201csatisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468,168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-14\">If we conclude that the Court committed no procedural error, we then move on to step two and review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. \u201cAs long as a sentence falls within the broad range of possible sentences that can be considered reasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we must affirm.\u201d <em>Wise, </em>515 F.3d at 218 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-15\">Sanchez-Mercedes\u2019s 30-year prison sentence was within the Guideline range. In calculating the appropriate Guideline range, the District Court added two-levels for obstruction of justice, enhanced another two-levels to reflect Sanchez-Mercedes\u2019s aggravating role in the offense, and reduced the sentence two-levels for his acceptance of responsibility by pleading guilty. The Court concluded the Guidelines range was 292-365 months\u2019 imprison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>ment. Sanchez-Mercedes does not argue that this calculation was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">At sentencing, the Court sufficiently stated its reasons for the sentence using the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In particular, it noted that the offense was very serious and involved an \u201cincredible amount of cocaine.\u201d It also reasonably concluded that Sanchez-Mercedes was more culpable than his co-conspirators, which justified any resulting disparity in sentences among the conspirators.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The Court then considered, but did not find, that Sanchez-Mercedes\u2019s personal characteristics and lack of criminal history were compelling reasons to vary from imposing a sentence within the Guidelines range. The Court stated that although Sanchez-Mercedes had \u201cno criminal record,\u201d it was in part influenced by evidence of the prior dealings with his co-conspirator indicating that he had \u201cpreviously distributed multiple kilograms of cocaine\u201d on several occasions. This was information included in the Government\u2019s recitation of the facts at Sanchez-Mercedes\u2019s plea colloquy, to which he did not object. Also, after listening to testimony from several witnesses in support of Sanchez-Mercedes, the Court acknowledged that the witnesses \u201cclearly care a great deal about you,\u201d but that \u201c[i]nstead of finding personal success through legal endeavors, you decided a life of crime would be more fruitful.\u201d Despite \u201cachieving some level of educational success and for successfully migrating to this country,\u201d the Court was \u201csaddened that [Sanchez-Mercedes had] squandered this great opportunity and gift.\u201d In this context, we cannot say that Sanchez-Mercedes\u2019s within-Guidelines sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Sanchez-Mercedes\u2019s sentence was both procedurally and substantively reasonable. We thus affirm the District Court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b208-11\">. The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231.
