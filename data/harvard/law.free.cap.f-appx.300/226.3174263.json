As Matthews had previously pled guilty to possession of a firearm during a drug trafficking crime, the district court imposed a mandatory sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C)\u00ae (2006) of 300 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be served consecutive to any undischarged sentence for his previous conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-28\">Matthews\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), challenging this statutory sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>enhancement and alleging that, due to the length and consecutive nature of the sentence, it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Counsel states, however, that he has found no meritorious grounds for appeal. We agree with his conclusion and affirm.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">We review Matthews\u2019s sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We will affirm a sentence imposed by the district court if it is within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir. 2005). A statutorily required sentence is deemed reasonable <em>per se. United States v. Farrior, </em>535 F.3d 210, 224 (4th Cir. 2008). As a \u201cconviction\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 924(c)(1) \u201crefers to the finding of guilt by a judge or jury that necessarily precedes the entry of a final judgment of conviction,\u201d <em>Deal v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 129, 132, 113 S.Ct. 1993, 124 L.Ed.2d 44 (1993), we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion by enhancing Matthews\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 924(c)(l)(C)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Next, Matthews asserts that the length and consecutive nature of his sentence constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. However, this court rejected the same argument in <em>United States v. Khan, </em>461 F.3d 477, 495 (4th Cir.2006), when we held that lengthy, mandatory sentences imposed pursuant to the \u201ccount-stacking\u201d provision of \u00a7 924(c) do not violate the Eighth Amendment. Therefore, Matthews\u2019s contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Matthews\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Matthews, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Matthews requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Matthews. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b253-10\"> Although Matthews was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, he has not done so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
