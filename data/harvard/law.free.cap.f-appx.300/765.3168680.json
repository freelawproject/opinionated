Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Petitioners now challenge the BIA\u2019s decision, contending that it is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">Where, as here, the BIA does not adopt the IJ\u2019s decision but, instead, issues its own decision, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Rodriguez Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 890 (11th Cir. 2007). Under the substantial evidence test, which guides our decision, we must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 890. \u201cTo reverse a factual finding by the BIA, [we] must find not only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but that it compels one.\u201d <em>Farquharson v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>246 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir.2001). The mere fact that evidence in the record may also support a conclusion contrary to the BIA\u2019s is not enough to justify a reversal. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir. 2004) (en banc). With this standard of review in mind, we consider in turn whether substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding of removal and CAT protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Petitioners contend that the BIA, like the IJ, failed to consider the record as a whole. We disagree and therefore take up the first of their alternative contentions, that the BIA\u2019s decision to deny withholding of removal is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">To qualify for withholding of removal under the INA, an alien bears the burden of showing that it is \u201cmore likely than not,\u201d that there is a \u201cclear probability,\u201d that he will be persecuted, or his life or freedom will be threatened, on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in- a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 241(b)(3); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3); <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 764-66 (11th Cir.2007). Persecution as an \u201cextreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). The alien must show that his fear of persecution is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1257-1258 (11th Cir.2006). The subjective component can be proven \u201cby the applicant\u2019s credible testimony that he or she genuinely fears persecution, .... [while the objective component] can be fulfilled either by establishing past persecution or that he or she has a good reason to fear future persecution.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1289 (11th Cir. 2001) (quotation omitted). \u201cThe weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony ... the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number><em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Petitioners claim that it is more likely than not that they will be persecuted on account of their political opinion if returned to Colombia. The claim is based for the most part on Cardozo-Rodriguez\u2019s testimony about an incident involving the FARC that occurred on June 12,1999. At the time, Cardozo-Rodriguez was the director of accounting at the Finansa S.A. Bank in Cali. As such, he had access to the personal information of the bank\u2019s clients, including their account balances.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Cardozo-Rodriguez testified that on June 12, while driving home, FARC guerillas kidnapped him at gunpoint. They told him that they had seized him because of his political activities, which they demanded that he cease.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They also demanded information about the bank\u2019s clients \u2014 their names, telephone numbers, addresses, and account balances \u2014 and instructed him to give them the information on a computer diskette. They gave him one week to deliver the diskette. They said that they knew where he lived and the names of his wife and daughter, and that if he did not give them the information they were demanding, they would kill his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">Cardozo-Rodriguez refused to comply with the FARC\u2019s demands. He discussed the situation with his wife\u2019s cousin, who was a member of the Colombian armed forces, and he advised him to leave the country. Cardozo-Rodriguez followed the advice, and came to the United States, arriving on June 19, seven days after the FARC seized him. Meanwhile, his wife went to Bogota and stayed with his parents. While there, she received a phone call from the FARC; the message was that Cardozo-Rodriguez was a military target and that he had to present himself or be killed. Shortly thereafter, she and their daughter left Colombia, arriving in the United States on October 28, 1999. After they left, Cardozo-Rodriguez\u2019s parents received threatening telephone calls from the FARC.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">The IJ found, and the BIA agreed, that the FARC kidnaped and threatened Cardozo-Rodriguez, because he was a bank official with access to confidential information about the bank\u2019s clients, that the kidnaping was brief, and that it involved no physical harm. The kidnaping and threats were not \u201con account of\u2019 a protected ground. Although Cardozo-Rodriguez testified that \u201cthey told me the reason I was kidnaped was because of my political activities,\u201d that self-serving recitation was suspect; as the IJ noted, he had not even mentioned it in his asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-11\">As stated above, to reverse the BIA\u2019s factual finding that FARC kidnapped Cardozo-Rodriguez because of his position with the bank, we must find not only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion \u2014 that he was kidnaped because of his political opinion \u2014 but that it \u201ccompels\u201d one. On this record, we could hardly say that Cardozo-Rodriguez\u2019s bare testimonial claim that the guerrillas told him that they kidnaped him because of his political activities compels the conclusion that he was kidnaped and persecuted \u201con account of\u2019 his political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-13\">As for their claim that they are entitled to CAT protection, petitioners ask that we remand the case for additional investigation or explanation, since the IJ failed specifically to address his claim for such protection. To be entitled to CAT protection, an applicant must establish that it is \u201cmore likely than not that he or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d- 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). \u201cTorture\u201d is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVP\">any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or her or a third person information or a confession, punishing him or her for an act he or she or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or her or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1). Petitioners application for protection under CAT fails for lack of proof that the Colombian government acquiesces in the FARC\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b792-7\">. Petitioners, husband, wife, and daughter, are natives and citizens of Colombia, S.A. They entered the United States on non-immigrant visas in 1999. In September 2002, they filed applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT protection. A Notice to Appear issued in November 2002, alleging that petitioners were removable under the INA because they remained in the United States longer than authorized. They subsequently appeared before an IJ, conceded removability, presented their case for asylum and, alternatively, withholding of removal and CAT protection. The IJ denied their applications for asylum as untimely, declined to grant withholding of removal because they failed to establish a clear probability of future persecution on account of a protected ground, and denied CAT protection because they failed to show a clear probability of persecution by the Colombian government if returned to Colombia. Because petitioners\u2019 applications for asylum were untimely, we dismissed for lack of jurisdiction the part of the instant petition seeking a reversal of the denial-of-asylum decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b793-8\">.
