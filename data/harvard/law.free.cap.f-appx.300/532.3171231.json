We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-19\">The IJ found Ravatu not credible for several reasons, including inconsistencies about the presence of police during an attack on his house in July 1987, and inconsistencies about the motivation his attackers in an April 1987 incident. Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination because it was based on \u201cspecific and cogent\u201d reasons that go to the heart of Ravatu\u2019s claim. <em>See id. </em>at 1043; <em>Rivera v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 1271, 1275 (9th Cir.2007). Accordingly, Ravatu\u2019s withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-20\">Further, because Ravatu\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony that the IJ found not credible, and Ravatu does not point to other evidence in the record that the IJ should have considered, his CAT claim also fails. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1157 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Finally, we decline Ravatu\u2019s request that we take judicial notice of changed conditions in Fiji. <em>See Fisher v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 963 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b559-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
