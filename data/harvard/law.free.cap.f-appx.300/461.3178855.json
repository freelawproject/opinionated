We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-14\">The ALJ adequately explained why he found Yarger\u2019s testimony concerning the effects of her symptoms to be not entirely credible with respect to her hand and hip problems. Because the ALJ found that Yarger\u2019s \u201cmedically determinable impairments could reasonably be expected to produce [her] alleged symptoms,\u201d the ALJ must provide clear and convincing reasons for rejecting Yarger\u2019s subjective testimony related to those symptoms. <em>See Carmickle v. Comm\u2019r, Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>533 F.3d 1155, 1159-60 (9th Cir.2008). Here, the ALJ provided three reasons for not fully crediting Yarger\u2019s testimony: (1) her testimony was not supported by the medical evidence; (2) her testimony was inconsistent with her daily life and work activities; and (3) her testimony was inconsistent with the conservative treatment she received. These reasons are clear and convincing and supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-15\">The ALJ properly took into account Yarger\u2019s mental limitations when evaluating Yarger\u2019s residual functional ca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>pacity. Although the ALJ did not consider Yarger\u2019s mental limitations severe, he included several limitations in his hypothetical to the vocational expert: (1) Yarger\u2019s activities of daily life are \u201cmildly limited\u201d; (2) Yarger \u201ccannot perform a lot of judgment or decision-making\u201d; and (3) Yarger \u201cneeds a job that is more routine in nature and is fairly low stress.\u201d These limitations adequately address Yarger\u2019s mental impairments. Accordingly, if the ALJ erred in finding these impairments non-severe, that error is harmless. <em>See Lewis v. Astrue, </em>498 F.3d 909, 911 (9th Cir .2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">However, the ALJ improperly failed to credit Yarger\u2019s medical evidence and testimony concerning incontinence. The ALJ disregarded this evidence because he concluded: (1) incontinence \u201chas not been established by medically acceptable clinical and diagnostic techniques\u201d; and (2) Yarger did not present evidence that \u201cthis impairment would significantly affect her ability to work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Neither of these conclusions is supported by substantial evidence. First, Yarger presented medical evidence of incontinence. At one examination, Yarger\u2019s physician found that she had \u201cminimal if any external or internal sphincter tone.\u201d The ALJ failed to explain why that physician\u2019s technique was not medically acceptable. Further, another of Yarger\u2019s physicians opined that Yarger\u2019s incontinence results from her diabetes. Although Yarger obtained this opinion after the ALJ ruled, she submitted this opinion to the Appeals Council and we may consider it. <em>See Ramirez v. Shalala, </em>8 F.3d 1449, 1451-52 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Second, Yarger did present evidence of limitations related to incontinence. In a social security disability report form, Yarger noted that she needs \u201ctime\u201d to prevent odor and soiling and that her incontinence \u201crequired heavier protection and required her to change clothes and shower several times a day.\u201d Yarger also testified that the incontinence results in an odor that makes it impossible for her to work in most workplaces. The ALJ provided no reason for rejecting these limitations. They should have been taken into account in determining the extent of Yarger\u2019s limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">Accordingly, we remand for the ALJ to consider whether Yarger\u2019s medical evidence and testimony concerning incontinence require limitations on her residual functional capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">REVERSED and REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this memorandum.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b488-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
