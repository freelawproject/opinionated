In a hidden compartment, the agents found 188 kilograms of marijuana. On October 4, 2007, a Southern District of Florida grand jury indicted appellant, in Count One, for attempting to import into the United States more than 100 kilograms of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 963, and, in Count Two, with possessing a quantity of marijuana with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Pursuant to a plea agreement, appellant pled guilty to Count Two, which subjected him to a mandatory minimum prison sentence of 60 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-20\">The presentenee investigation report (\u201cPSi\u201d) calculated appellant\u2019s sentence range under the Guidelines at 60 to 71 months, after giving him credit for acceptance of responsibility and increasing the base offense level by two levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(2)(B) for having been the pilot or captain of the sail boat. At sentencing, appellant objected to the enhancement and moved for \u201csafety valve\u201d relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. The Government objected to such relief on the ground that appellant\u2019s written account of his criminal activity failed to disclose the source, financier, or distributor of the marijuana. The district court sustained the objection, and sentenced appellant to the mandatory minimum sentence of 60 months. He now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>appeals his sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argues that the court erred in denying his request for safety valve relief because he fulfilled its criteria by disclosing to the Government all information related to the specific offense for which he was charged. Additionally, he argues that the district court erred in enhancing his base offense level under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(2)(B) by finding him to be a captain of his sail boat.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">\u201c[We] review[ ] a district court\u2019s factual determinations and subsequent denial of \u2018safety valve\u2019 relief for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Camacho, </em>261 F.3d 1071, 1073 (11th Cir.2001) (citing <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>106 F.3d 1553, 1557 (11th Cir.1997)). The defendant has the burden of proving his eligibility for relief under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. <em>Cruz, </em>106 F.3d at 1557.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">In <em>United States v. Brownlee, </em>204 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th Cir.2000), we explained that the safety-valve provisions of \u00a7 5C1.2 implement 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) and permit a sentence below a statutory minimum sentence; if a defendant meets the criteria set forth in the statutory subsection. The Guidelines provide for a two-level reduction in the base offense level for certain drug-related crimes if the defendant meets five criteria as set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(7). The defendant must show, among other things, that he truthfully provided the government with all information and evidence he had concerning the offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">With respect to disclosure of information, \u201c[i]t is the offense for which the defendant is convicted that determines the scope of information which the defendant must disclose.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>375 F.3d 1300, 1302 (11th Cir.2004). \u201c[T]he defendant has an affirmative responsibility to \u2018truthfully disclose to the government all information and evidence that he has about the offense and all relevant conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Yate, </em>176 F.3d 1309, 1310 (11th Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">In <em>Johnson, </em>a defendant, convicted of cultivation of marijuana plants, challenged a finding that he did not truthfully provide the government with all information he possessed, because he did not divulge information about the intended distribution of the marijuana plants he was cultivating. <em>Johnson, </em>375 F.3d at 1301-02. The defendant argued that he provided all of the information necessary because the scope of information he was required to disclose was properly defined with reference to the crime of cultivation. <em>Id. </em>at 1302. We held that, \u201cgiven the [ ] large number of plants, the district court did not err in reasonably inferring that [the defendant] was growing the marijuana for distribution,\u201d and that \u201c[n]o reasonable law enforcement officer investigating this cultivation offense would [have] failfed] to ask [the defendant] about the intended distribution of such a large quantity of marijuana.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1302-03. We, therefore, concluded that the district court properly determined that information about the intended distribution related to the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction, and that it did not err in finding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>defendant failed to satisfy the \u2018tell all\u2019 factor in \u00a7 501.2(a)(5) by not disclosing this information. <em>Id. </em>at 1303.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">We broadly interpret the scope of the Guidelines relevant conduct provision. <em>United States v. Behr, </em>93 F.3d 764, 765 (11th Cir.1996). That provision requires consideration of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-6\">(1) (A) all acts and omissions committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused by the defendant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-7\">(2) solely with respect to offenses of a character for which \u00a7 3D1.2(d) would require grouping of multiple counts, all acts and omissions described in subdivisions (1)(A) and (1)(B) above that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-8\">(3) all harm that resulted from the acts and omissions specified in subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) above, and all harm that was the object of such acts and omissions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-9\">(4) any other information specified in the applicable guideline.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">Appellant did not fully disclose all the information he had concerning his offense, including how he intended to distribute the marijuana he possessed. Hence, the court properly rejected his statement as insufficient to merit safety valve relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-13\">In evaluating a district court\u2019s imposition of an offense level enhancement, \u201cwe review a district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Rendon, </em>354 F.3d 1320, 1329 (11th Cir.2003) (affirming a \u2018captain\u2019 enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(2)(B)). Clear error is present if we are \u201cleft with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed\u201d by the district court. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1177 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). However, an incorrect factual determination related to application of the Guidelines does not require remand if the error does not affect the selection of the sentence imposed. <em>See United States v. Raad, </em>406 F.3d 1322, 1323 n. 1 (11th Cir.2005) (noting how mandatory minimum rendered any error in challenged guideline calculation harmless).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-15\">Section 2D1.1 of the Guidelines directs that a defendant\u2019s offense level should increase two levels if he \u201cunlawfully imported ... a controlled substance under circumstances in which ... the defendant acted as a pilot, copilot, captain, navigator, flight officer, or any other operation officer aboard any craft or vessel carrying a controlled substance.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-17\">We have not adopted narrow definitions for \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(2)(B) and look to the facts of each case to apply functional definitions. <em>See United States v. Cartwright, </em>413 F.3d 1295,1299 (11th Cir.2005) (interpreting the term captain). In <em>Cartwright, </em>the defendant argued that the district court erroneously interpreted \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(2)(B) to include anyone who operates a vessel as a captain. <em>Id. </em>at 1298. Although the defendant was driving the boat, the evidence showed that he was not in a position of authority on the vessel. <em>Id. </em>We held, however, that the \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(2)(B) enhancement applied because the defendant was a lifelong fisherman, drove the boat, and used a compass to navigate. <em>Id. </em>at 1299.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-18\">Here, appellant owned and solely operated the vessel carrying the marijuana and qualified as a captain or other opera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>tion officer. The district court therefore properly enhanced his base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Appellant\u2019s sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b780-7\">. In his brief on appeal, appellant does not challenge his conviction, the general applicability of a statutory mandatory minimum sentence, or the reasonableness of his sentence. We therefore do not consider these issues. <em>See United States v. Blasco, </em>702 F.2d 1315, 1332 n. 28 (11th Cir.1983). Further, we do not consider the constitutional challenge to the safety valve determination that he raises for the first time in his reply brief. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that a party abandoned an issue by failing to raise it in the opening brief).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
