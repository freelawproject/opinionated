Horn denying petitioner\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Song Biao Wang, </em>No. A97 959 147 (B.I.A. Aug. 24, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A97 959 147 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, Sep. 19, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-23\">When the BIA issues a short opinion affirming the IJ\u2019s decision in part and modifying it in part, we review the IJ\u2019s opinion as modified by the BIA. <em>See Ming Xia Chen v. BIA </em>435 F.3d 141, 144 (2d Cir.2006). We review de novo questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Belortaja v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 619, 623 (2d Cir.2007). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121,129 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">We find no error in the agency\u2019s determination that Wang failed to meet his burden of proof for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. The agency correctly determined that neither Wang\u2019s wife\u2019s forced abortion nor the forced IUD insertion she endured, by itself, constitutes past persecution as to Wang. <em>See Shi Liang Lin v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 309 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc) (holding that spouse of someone who has been forced to undergo an abortion or sterilization is not automatically eligible for refugee status);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Shu Wen Sun v. BIA, </em>510 F.3d 377, 381 (2d Cir.2007) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">To the extent Wang alleged his own \u201cother resistance to a coercive population control program,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B), we identify no error in the agency\u2019s finding that evidence of Wang\u2019s joint decision with his wife that she should evade a January 2004 gynecological examination was insufficient to merit relief. Even if a joint decision to evade a family planning inspection constitutes \u201cresistance,\u201d the record does not compel a conclusion that Wang was persecuted on account of such resistance. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). Nor does the record compel a conclusion that Wang paid a substantial fine to Chinese authorities because of his other resistance; rather, \u201cthe couple paid a fine of 20,000 B.MB for having birth prior to approval.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 9. <em>See Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d at 313 (holding that \u201cimpregnating one\u2019s girlfriend is not alone an act of \u2018resistance.\u201d \u2019 (citation and quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">Wang\u2019s claim that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution in China based on his resistance to a coercive population control program is also without merit. Although Wang states that he will resist the family planning policy by having additional children with his wife, which could subject him to sterilization, we have previously concluded that such an assertion is insufficient, by itself, to demonstrate a non-speculative fear of future persecution. <em>See Jian Wen Wang v. BCIS, </em>437 F.3d 276, 278 (2d Cir.2006) (finding \u201cspeculative\u201d a petitioner\u2019s fear of persecution based on having one child in China with his previous wife, and one child in the United States with his new wife). Wang has not presented any other evidence that indicates he has an objectively reasonable well-founded fear of persecution on account of China\u2019s family planning policy. <em>See, e.g., Matter of J-W-S-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 185,194 (B.I.A.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">Because Wang was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim, he was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on a claim for withholding of removal or CAT relief, to the extent those claims were based upon the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">Finally, the agency did not err in denying Wang\u2019s request for CAT relief to the extent it was based on his illegal de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>parture from China. Although Wang submitted evidence that some individuals who leave China illegally are imprisoned upon their return, and that human rights violations including torture occur in Chinese prisons, this is insufficient to establish a clear probability of torture for a particular illegal emigrant. <em>See Mu Xiang Lin v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156,159-60 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Mu-Xing Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 143-44 (2d Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b47-7\">. Judge Sotomayor continues to believe that the majority opinion in <em>Shi Liang Lin </em>was in error to the extent that it applied beyond unmarried partners, <em>see Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d at 327 (Sotomayor, J., concurring), but notes that the Attorney General has since adopted the Court's construction of the statute and overruled the BIA\u2019s former <em>per se </em>rule of spousal eligibility, <em>see In re J-S-, </em>24 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 520 (A.G.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
