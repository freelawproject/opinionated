Appellee Richard Alfaro, a person of Hispanic ancestry, sued the ZBA defendants under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985 alleging that they violated his right to equal protection by conspiring to deny his application for a zoning variance to operate an auto repair business because of his race. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the relevant facts, procedural history, and arguments on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-19\">We agree with the District Court that, based on the allegations of the complaint, the ZBA defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law. In ruling on a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the District Court was required to accept as true the allegations in the complaint, and apart from those allegations, there was no factual basis upon which the District Court could have determined whether the ZBA defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. The complaint alleges that the ZBA defendants rejected the applicability of Alfaro\u2019s valid permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>and denied his application for a variance because he was Hispanic, while other defendants did not enforce the zoning laws against other similarly situated white business owners. The complaint also contains supportive factual allegations, including that an identified co-conspirator called Al-faro a racially derogatory name and told him he would be \u201cout of here before long,\u201d that the other defendants prevented him from operating his business even though his Certificate of Occupancy stated that one use of the property was as a \u201cconcrete block repair garage,\u201d and that the ZBA defendants denied his application for a variance on the ground that local zoning regulations prohibit auto repair shops in the \u201cVillage Business\u201d zone even though other white-owned auto repair shops operated in that zone. These allegations amount to more than \u201cbare allegations of malice,\u201d and are sufficient to permit Alfaro to attempt to advance evidence that the ZBA defendants violated his clearly established constitutional rights, and that it was not objectively reasonable for them to believe otherwise. <em>See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 817-18, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Accordingly, the District Court properly denied the motion to dismiss on qualified immunity grounds. The District Court is, of course, free to re-consider whether the ZBA defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on an appropriate factual record. We also note the ZBA defendants\u2019 argument that Alfaro has insufficiently alleged a constitutional violation because similarly situated businesses never applied for variances and were thus never before the ZBA. This argument fails because \u201ca plaintiff who ... alleges that a facially neutral law or policy has been applied in an intentionally discriminatory race-based manner ... is not obligated to show a better treated, similarly situated group of individuals of a different race in order to establish a claim of denial of equal protection.\u201d <em>Pyke v. Cuomo, </em>258 F.3d 107, 110 (2d Cir.2001). Even if no one else applied for a variance, Alfaro could prevail if the ZBA defendants\u2019 denial of his application was based on his race.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Because this is an interlocutory appeal, our jurisdiction \u201cis limited to circumstances where the qualified immunity defense may be established as a matter of law and \u2018is not available where the immunity issue turns on disputed questions of fact.\u2019\u201d <em>O\u2019Neill v. Town of Babylon, </em>986 F.2d 646, 649 (2d Cir.1993) (quoting <em>White v. Frank, </em>855 F.2d 956, 958 (2d Cir.1988)). For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
