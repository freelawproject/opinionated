The government proceeded on the theory that Guedea-Martinez arranged to import 11.2 kilograms of cocaine into the United States and hired one individual, Aguirre-Espinoza, to cross the border into the United States with the drugs and another individual, Rodr\u00edguez-Guerrero, to assist Guedea-Martinez in transporting the drugs on to San Antonio.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-15\">The only significant issue presented in the appeal is whether the government presented sufficient evidence to support Guedea-Martinez\u2019s conviction on all four counts. More particularly, the primary issue Guedea-Martinez contested was whether he had knowledge that the drugs were being transported and whether he assisted in that endeavor.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-16\">The government\u2019s primary proof consisted of the testimony of one of GuedeaMartinez\u2019s co-conspirators, Rodr\u00edguezGuerrero, who testified that he and Guedea-Martinez, along with another co-conspirator assisting in the enterprise, met the night before the drugs were crossed into the United States to plan the operation and set up the time and place for meeting after the drugs arrived in the United States. Even if this had been the only evidence presented, \u201c[e]vidence consisting entirely of testimony from accomplices or conspirators is sufficient\u201d to support a conviction. <em>United States v. Mendoza, </em>522 F.3d 482, 489 (5th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>In addition to Rodriguez-Guerrero\u2019s testimony, the government provided substantial corroborating evidence from government agents who observed GuedeaMartinez interacting with Rodr\u00edguezGuerrero while the agents had the co-conspirators under surveillance following Aguirre-Espinoza\u2019s delivery of the drugs to Rodr\u00edguez-Guerrero. Guedea-Martinez himself admitted to immigration officials that he owned all the cars involved in the day\u2019s events, that he had been in control of the truck carrying the drugs since purchasing it, and that he employed his co-defendants to regulai\u2019ly drive cars back and forth across the border. Appellant\u2019s primary argument challenges the testimony of Rodr\u00edguez-Guerrero as being inconsistent in a number of respects. But these arguments all relate to the credibility of Rodr\u00edguez-Guerrero as a witness and this determination is in the province of the jury. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Guedea-Martinez also argues that the chain of custody for the drugs taken from his truck was not sufficiently well established because the parties involved in confiscating and testing the drugs could not identify each other individually. This claim was not raised in the renewed motion for judgment of acquittal and is thus reviewed only for a \u201cmanifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>43 F.3d 117, 126 (5th Cir.1995). In the absence of any evidence of unusual departures from standard practice, GuedeaMartinez cannot meet this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">After a careful review of the record we are satisfied that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction, which we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b346-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
