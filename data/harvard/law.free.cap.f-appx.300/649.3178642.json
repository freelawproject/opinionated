Foster argues that his convictions on certain counts\u2014 ones that the district court erroneously dismissed and then reinstated at the sentencing hearing \u2014 should be reversed as violative of the Double Jeopardy Clause. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-27\">We review Double Jeopardy challenges <em>de novo. See United States v. BaptistarRodriguez, </em>17 F.3d 1354, 1360 (11th Cir. 1994). The Double Jeopardy Clause provides that \u201c[n]o person shall ... be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. V. The Double Jeopardy Clause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>protects defendants in three situations: (1) a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal; (2) a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction; and (3) multiple punishments for the same offense. <em>Jones v. Thomas, </em>491 U.S. 376, 380-81, 109 S.Ct. 2522, 105 L.Ed.2d 322 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">With regard to the first prong \u2014 the only prong at issue here \u2014 a defendant is acquitted only when \u201cthe ruling of the judge, whatever its label, actually represents a resolution [in the defendant\u2019s favor], correct or not, of some or all of the <em>factual elements </em>of the offense chargedf.]\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>437 U.S. 82, 97, 98 S.Ct. 2187, 57 L.Ed.2d 65 (1978) (quotations omitted and emphases added). An acquittal does not occur, however, when the court makes an error of law under certain circumstances. \u201c[A] defendant has no legitimate claim to benefit from an error of law when that error could be corrected without subjecting him to a second trial before a second trier of fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>420 U.S. 332, 345, 95 S.Ct. 1013, 43 L.Ed.2d 232 (1975). For example, \u201cthe imposition of [a] sentence is [not] an \u2018implied acquittal\u2019 of any greater sentence,\u201d where the defendant \u201chas not yet begun to serve that sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. 117, 133-34, 101 S.Ct. 426, 66 L.Ed.2d 328 (1980). Under these circumstances, \u201cthe district court\u2019s intention controls.\u201d <em>United States v. Khoury, </em>901 F.2d 975, 978 (11th Cir. 1990) (quotations and emphases omitted). Further, pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(a), a district court, \u201c[w]ithin 7 days after sentencing,\u201d may correct a sentence \u201cthat resulted from arithmetical, technical, or other clear error.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">On March 21, 2008, Foster pled guilty without the benefit of a plea agreement to a four-count indictment, and was adjudicated guilty on all four counts. During the sentencing hearing, held on June 9, 2008, the government mistakenly relied on a draft plea agreement that was never filed, and as a result, the district court labored under the mistaken belief that Foster only had pleaded guilty to some of the counts, and that the government was recommending dismissal of the ones remaining. The district court dismissed the counts in question before realizing its error, although it reinstated them before the sentencing hearing ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Foster does not argue that the district court\u2019s reinstatement of the dismissed counts constituted a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction, or multiple punishments for the same offense, and he has not shown that this action constituted a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal. First, the record demonstrates that the district court did not intend to acquit Foster or to resolve factual issues in his favor. Because the district court sentenced him on every count to which he had pleaded guilty before he was removed from its custody, the initial dismissal had no legal effect and did not amount to an acquittal. Second, if Foster\u2019s sentence had taken effect at the moment of the dismissal, the district court\u2019s failure to impose a sentence on all four counts would have constituted a sentencing error subject to modification under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a), not an acquittal. Accordingly, the Double Jeopardy Clause has not been violated, and we affirm Foster\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
