Jankun, which denied his motion to reopen his removal proceedings. <em>In re Rizland Eldon Bennett, </em>No. A 37 776 376 (B.I.A. Apr. 27, 2006), <em>affg </em>No. A 37 776 376 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 1, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, issues on appeal, and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">Ordinarily we review an agency\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005). In this case, however, we lack jurisdiction to consider Bennett\u2019s petition for review. Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), we do not have jurisdiction \u201cto review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(C). Because Bennett was convicted of attempted possession of a loaded firearm, he has categorically violated 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(C), which authorizes removal of any alien convicted of possessing or attempting to possess a firearm in violation of the law. Bennett does not raise any constitutional claims or questions of law that would bring his case within our jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">Bennett cannot avoid the jurisdictional bar on the basis that he is seeking review of a denial of his motion to reopen rather than his underlying grounds for deportability or order of removal. We lack jurisdiction to consider motions to reopen that relate to an order of removal specified under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). <em>See Durant v. I.N.S., </em>393 F.3d 113, 114 (2d Cir.2004) (\u2018We ... hold that when an alien has been ordered removed because of a conviction for one of the offenses specified in \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), the jurisdictional bar imposed by this section also applies to an order denying a motion to reopen removal proceedings.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-11\">In any event, we discern no abuse of discretion in the agency\u2019s challenged denial because Bennett failed to advance his \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d argument within the 180 days required by statute, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i), and the explanation he did advance \u2014 essentially, that he confused his hearing dates \u2014 did not rise to the level of \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(l) (defining \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d generally as those circumstances \u201cbeyond the control of the alien\u201d); <em>Alrefae v. Chertoff, </em>471 F.3d 353, 358 (2d Cir.2006) (noting that \u201c[t]he BIA\u2019s standard for exceptional circumstances appears fairly stringent, both in terms of the required severity of the circumstances and the proof required to establish a claim.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-12\">For the foregoing reasons, this petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
