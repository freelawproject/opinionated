The government appeals Zavala\u2019s 178-month sentence, imposed after a remand by a panel of this Court for resentencing consistent with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">The government argues that Zavala\u2019s sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to properly consider the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, instead focusing on the perceived sentence disparity between similarly-situated codefendants. The government also argues that Zavala should not have received a sentence comparable to his codefendants, who received the benefit of \u00a7 5K1.1 motions based on their substantial assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">We review the final sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005) (citations omitted). A sentence may be procedurally unreasonable if the district court incorrectly calculates the Guidelines range, treats the Guidelines as mandatory, fails to properly consider the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, selects a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or fails to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Substantive reasonableness requires that the totality of the circumstances be considered and that the statutory factors of \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">\u201cReasonableness\u201d review requires that we review the sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Id. </em>at 594 (stating that the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cexplanation of \u2018reasonableness\u2019 review in the <em>Booker </em>opinion made it pellucidly clear that the familiar abuse-of-discretion standard of review now applies to appellate review of sentencing decisions\u201d). If the sentence is outside the Guidelines range, we may consider the deviation \u201cbut must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe fact that the appellate court might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">In this case, the underlying facts of the case are not disputed. It is also undisputed that the Guidelines range was properly calculated at the time of Zavala\u2019s initial sentencing, and the Guidelines were not treated as mandatory. The real question before us is whether the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors were appropriately considered by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-13\">The factor in \u00a7 3553(a) bearing on disparities in sentencing provides: \u201cThe court, in determining the particular sentence to be imposed, shall consider ... the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). Additional factors in \u00a7 3553(a) include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the history and characteristics of the, defendant; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment; (4) the need to protect the public; and (5) the Guidelines range. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-15\">In considering these factors, the court is not required to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of them or explain in detail which played a particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>role in sentencing. \u201c[N]othing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. McBride, </em>511 F.3d 1293, 1297 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201c[A] district court need not account for every \u00a7 3553(a) factor, nor must it discuss each factor and the role that it played in sentencing.\u201d). Instead, indications in the record that the district court considered facts and circumstances falling within \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s factors will suffice. <em>See Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Furthermore, as emphasized in <em>Gall, </em>the district court is best situated to weigh factual circumstances. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 600 (holding that a district court did not commit reversible error simply because it \u201cattached great weight\u201d to one factor). District courts are \u201cin a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) in the individual case. The judge sees and hears the evidence, makes credibility determinations, has full knowledge of the facts and gains insights not conveyed by the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597. Indeed, \u201c[t]he weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Moreover, this Court has noted that it will reverse a sentence as substantively unreasonable only when \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1363 (11th Cir. 2006) (internal quotations omitted), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558,169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">Under these standards, we cannot say that the sentence imposed here was unreasonable. Zavala and his four brothers became involved in the sale of methamphetamine. Zavala\u2019s brother, Javier, was the head of the organization, and pursuant to the government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion on his behalf, received a sentence of 188 months\u2019 imprisonment because he was able to provide assistance to the government. In considering Zavala\u2019s sentence, the district court stated its belief that \u201cthe imposition of a greater sentence than 178, 180 months, would cause the public to question the justice of a system that imposes a greater sentence on a follower than a leader.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b820-10\">The record here indicates that the trial judge took into account the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and weighed them to impose the punishment required by statute: a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to comply with the purposes of sentencing. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The court noted that Arturo Zavala had not been in a position to provide the government with the kind of assistance provided by Javier and considered the nature of Arturo\u2019s participation in the drug scheme. The court noted that according to Javier\u2019s plea agreement, when Arturo first became involved in the endeavor it involved only \u201csmall and relatively unorganized [sales of] crystal methamphetamine.\u201d It was only after Javier took over as leader that it became a large and coherent organization. The court concluded that based on the evidence, Arturo had a lesser role in the organization, whereas Javier had \u201cbrought into the region the majority of the methamphetamine sold there, ... and [his] role in the organization placed him in a position to know significant details of individuals, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>groups of individuals, storage location, routes, prices, and overall distribution operations.\u201d Yet, Javier received a sentence of only 188 months, and the other family members who also had 15 kilos of methamphetamine attributed to each of them received sentences of 168 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">It is not erroneous for the district court to have considered the \u201cunwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct\u201d when the statute specifically mandates such consideration. The government argues that these defendants are not because Javier cooperated with the government and Arturo did not. Such an argument might have some merit if both defendants had equal information to provide to the government and one simply refused to produce it. That is not the case here as the district court found that Arturo had no information to trade for a lesser sentence. Moreover, this argument ignores the court\u2019s consideration of the relative culpability of the brothers and the role each played in the conspiracy. With reference to the other brothers, the court also considered that both Javier and Miguel were fugitives from justice for quite some time after the indictment was handed down, while Arturo was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">We are satisfied that the district court considered all of the statutory sentencing factors as it noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-7\">THE COURT: Well, I\u2019m specifically finding that this sentence, the 178-months\u2019 sentence is sufficient, but not greater necessary to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing set forth in subparagraph 2 of the section. I\u2019ve considered the nature and circumstances of the crime, the history and characteristics of this defendant; and I consider that this sentence does reflect the seriousness of the crime, it\u2019s right at 15 years. It promotes respect for the law; I believe that any higher sentence would promote disrespect for the law. I believe it provides just punishment for the offense, as well as affording adequate deterrence to criminal conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">We cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in finding that 15 years was a reasonable sentence for Arturo Zavala under the facts of this case. AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
