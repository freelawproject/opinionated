Morace, denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Yong Chang Chen, </em>No. A77 317 111 (B.I.A. Nov. 28, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A77 317 111 (Immigr. Ct. N.Y. City Feb. 8, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-27\">When \u201cthe BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and ... supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, ... we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA.\u201d <em>Yan Chen v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number><em>Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact.\u201d <em>See Salimatou Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99,110 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">We conclude that the BIA did not err in finding that Chen failed to establish his eligibility for the relief he sought. The Attorney General has recently determined that spouses are not entitled to asylum based solely on a partner\u2019s alleged forced sterilization. <em>See In re J-S- </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 520, 523-24 (A.G.2008). Bather, in order to establish eligibility for relief on family planning grounds, a spouse must demonstrate past persecution based on his own \u201cother resistance\u201d to a coercive population control program or a well-founded fear that he will be subject to persecution for such \u201cresistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 537-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">While Chen\u2019s alleged confrontation with family planning officials likely constituted \u201cresistance\u201d to a coercive population control program, he fails to show that he suffered past persecution or that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of that resistance. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42); <em>In re J-S- </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 537-38. Although Chen describes being \u201cpushed around\u201d before and during his one-night detention, he does not argue how such treatment rises to the level of persecution. Absent such an argument, we find no error in the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Cf. Beskovie v. Gonzales, </em>467 F.3d 223, 226 (2d Cir.2006). Moreover, Chen fails to argue how the fine he fears will be imposed gives rise to a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See Guan Shan Liao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>293 F.3d 61, 69-70 (2d Cir.2002). Thus, we find no reason to disturb the agency\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Because Chen was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim, he was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on a claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Gomez v. INS, </em>947 F.2d 660, 665 (2d Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Finally, because Chen fails to argue in his brief to this Court that he is eligible for CAT relief, and because addressing this argument does not appear to be necessary to avoid manifest injustice, any such argument is deemed waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
