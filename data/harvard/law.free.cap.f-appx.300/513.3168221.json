We also affirm, although on grounds different than those stated by the BAP.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>The Nichols contend they are entitled to relief from the bankruptcy court\u2019s judgment of nondischargeability under the third clause of Rule 60(b)(5), which authorizes a court to grant relief from judgment when \u201cit is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But their request that the nondischargeability judgment be reduced by half is beyond the scope of that rule. The judgment of nondischargeability entered against the Nichols has no \u201cprospective application\u201d within the meaning of the rule; their request to reduce the judgment by half is not based on any subsequent and unanticipated change in factual conditions or in the law; and the rule does not permit review of issues that should have been raised on direct appeal from the original judgment. <em>See Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, </em>502 U.S. 367, 383-84, 112 S.Ct. 748, 116 L.Ed.2d 867 (1992); <em>Flores v. Arizona, </em>516 F.3d 1140, 1163 (9th Cir. 2008); <em>United States v. Asarco Inc., </em>430 F.3d 972, 979 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Maraziti v. Thorpe, </em>52 F.3d 252, 254 (9th Cir.1995) (explaining that \u201cprospective application\u201d requires that the judgment be \u201cexecutory\u201d or involve \u201cthe supervision of. changing conduct or conditions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">The Nichols\u2019 request to reduce the nondischargeability judgment by half is essentially a challenge to the bankruptcy court\u2019s underlying legal ruling that the Nichols\u2019 claim objection and the appellee\u2019s alleged partial assignment of her claim are immaterial to the nondischargeability proceedings. Yet \u201cmotions for relief from judgment may not be used to remedy a failure to contest in the first instance the legal rulings underlying the judgment itself.\u201d <em>Flores, </em>516 F.3d at 1163; <em>see also Floyd v. Laws, </em>929 F.2d 1390, 1400 (9th Cir.1991). The bankruptcy court therefore did not abuse its discretion in partially denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Given our conclusion, we need not reach the merits of the Nichols\u2019 contention that the judgment of nondischargeability should have been reduced by half. Even assuming the Nichols are correct, they are not entitled to relief under Rule 60(b)(5). <em>See Title v. United States, </em>263 F.2d 28, 30-31 (9th Cir.1959) (expressly recognizing that the underlying judgment was erroneous, yet denying Rule 60(b)(5) relief because the error should have been raised in a direct appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b539-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
