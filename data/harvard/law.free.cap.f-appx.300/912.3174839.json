We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b939-16\">In July 1999, the United States Trade Representative compiled a list of imported goods that would be subject to increased duties in retaliation for the European Community\u2019s ban on hormone-treated beef. Gilda, an importer of toasted breads from Spain, challenged the decision of the Trade Representative to include \u201c[rjusks, toasted bread and similar products\u201d on the hormone-beef retaliation list. The litigation focused on the obligations of the Trade Representative under the so-called \u201ccarousel provision\u201d of the Trade and Development Act of 2000, Pub.L. No. 106-200, 114 Stat. 251. That provision requires the Trade Representative to make periodic adjustments to the retaliation list unless (1) the Trade Representative \u201cdetermines that implementation of a recommendation made pursuant to a dispute settlement proceeding ... is imminent,\u201d or (2) \u201cthe Trade Representative together with the petitioner involved in the initial investigation ... agree that it is unneces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>sary to revise the retaliation list.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2416(b)(2)(B). There is no dispute that the Trade Representative has not revised the hormone-beef retaliation list since it went into effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">In its initial motion for judgment on the pleadings, the government invoked the first carousel exception but failed to offer any evidence suggesting that the Trade Representative had determined that the resolution of the hormone-beef dispute was imminent. <em>See Gilda Indus., Inc. v. United States, </em>353 F.Supp.2d 1364, 1372 (Ct. Int\u2019l Trade 2004) <em>(\u201cGilda </em>/\u201d). The trial court nonetheless found that the representations by government counsel as to the applicability of the exception were sufficient to relieve the Trade Representative of his obligations under the carousel provision. <em>Id. </em>at 1372-73. On appeal, we vacated the judgment in favor of the government and remanded for further fact-finding as to whether the Trade Representative had made the required \u201cimminent resolution\u201d determination. <em>Gilda Indus., Inc. v. United States, </em>446 F.3d 1271, 1283 (Fed.Cir.2006) <em>(\u201cGilda II\u201d). </em>Rather than receiving evidence on the factual predicates of the first carousel exception, the trial court granted the government\u2019s motion to dismiss based on the second carousel exception, i.e., that the domestic beef industry concurred in the Trade Representative\u2019s assessment that further revision of the retaliation list was unnecessary. <em>Gilda Indus., Inc. v. United States, </em>No. 03-00203, 2006 WL 2884452 (Ct. Int\u2019l Trade Oct. 10, 2006) <em>(\u201cGilda III\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">Gilda appealed from the dismissal order. After litigation over whether the appeal was timely and whether Gilda\u2019s motion to extend the time for appeal should have been granted, <em>see Gilda Indus., Inc. v. United States, </em>216 Fed.Appx. 973 (Fed. Cir.2007) <em>(\u201cGilda IV\u201d); Gilda Indus., Inc. v. United States, </em>511 F.3d 1348 (Fed.Cir. 2008) <em>(\u201cGilda V\u201d), </em>the trial court ruled that although Gilda\u2019s notice of appeal was late, Gilda showed excusable neglect for its belated filing, and this appeal proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">Gilda\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that the trial court lacked authority to consider whether the Trade Representative had satisfied the requirements of the second carousel exception because our remand in <em>Gilda II </em>was limited to affording the government an opportunity to adduce evidence concerning the applicability of the first carousel exception. We agree with the government that the scope of our remand in <em>Gilda II </em>was not so narrowly drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">While a reviewing court\u2019s mandate \u201cis controlling as to matters within its compass, on the remand a lower court is free as to other issues.\u201d <em>Sprague v. Ticonic Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>307 U.S. 161,168, 59 S.Ct. 777, 83 L.Ed. 1184 (1939); <em>see also Exxon Chem. Patents, Inc. v. Lubrizol Corp., </em>137 F.3d 1475, 1478 (Fed.Cir.1998) (reviewing court\u2019s mandate does not ordinarily encompass an issue that was not presented to the court); <em>Laitram Corp. v. NEC Corp., </em>115 F.3d 947, 951 (Fed.Cir.1997) (\u201cUpon return of its mandate, the district court cannot give relief beyond the scope of that mandate, but it may act on matters left open by the mandate.\u201d). \u201cOnly the issues actually decided \u2014 those within the scope of the judgment appealed from, minus those explicitly reserved or remanded by the court \u2014 are foreclosed from further consideration.\u201d <em>Engel Indus., Inc. v. Lockfomier Co., </em>166 F.3d 1379, 1382-83 (Fed.Cir. 1999); <em>see also Amado v. Microsoft Corp., </em>517 F.3d 1353, 1360 (Fed.Cir.2008) (\u201cthe mandate rule precludes reconsideration of any issue within the scope of the judgment appealed from \u2014 not merely those issues actually raised\u201d). Accordingly, the resolu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>tion of Gilda\u2019s appeal turns on the interpretation of our mandate in <em>Gilda II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">In <em>Gilda I, </em>the government relied on the first carousel exception and did not invoke the second exception. The trial court therefore did not address the second exception. That exception was not at issue on appeal in <em>Gilda II, </em>and in our opinion we did not address whether the Trade Representative\u2019s inaction could be excused on that basis. Because the second carousel exception was not before us in <em>Gilda II </em>and our decision in that case did not implicate that exception, the mandate did not foreclose the trial court from addressing that exception on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">Moreover, our opinion in <em>Gilda II </em>implicitly contemplated that the trial court might need to address issues other than the applicability of the first carousel exception. In <em>Gilda II, </em>the parties\u2019 dispute centered on the question whether, in invoking the first carousel exception, the government was obligated to proffer evidence in support of its assertion that the Trade Representative \u201cbelieves that a solution with the European Communities is imminent.\u201d <em>Gilda I, </em>353 F.Supp.2d at 1372. We answered that question in the affirmative and remanded for the lower court \u201cto further consider whether the Trade Representative has actually determined that resolution of the hormone dispute is imminent.\u201d 446 F.3d at 1282. That remand instruction did not expressly preclude the trial court from addressing the applicability of the second carousel exception. Any inference to that effect would be inconsistent with our observation that, even if the trial court were to find that the Trade Representative had not made an imminence determination, the court should nonetheless consider whether to grant injunctive relief requiring that revisions be made to the retaliation list. <em>Id. </em>Thus, we appreciated that a factual finding favorable to Gilda would not necessarily conclude the matter because the government might have alternative grounds on which to oppose Gilda\u2019s claim. That interpretation of the mandate is consistent with our subsequent statement in the litigation over the timeliness of the notice of appeal, where we noted that we had \u201cremanded for further proceedings to determine whether the Trade Representative had acted lawfully in exercising statutory responsibilities.\u201d <em>Gilda V, </em>511 F.3d at 1349. We therefore reject Gilda\u2019s argument that the mandate barred the trial court from addressing any issue other than the applicability of the first carousel exception.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
