Johnson argues that he was entitled to a downward adjustment for his acceptance of responsibility, United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3E1.1 (Nov.2003), and his sentence was unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b877-13\">Johnson was arrested after he assumed control of what he believed to be 33 kilograms of cocaine. Police also discovered 5653 grams of marijuana in Johnson\u2019s vehicle. Johnson admitted that he had received two similar shipments of cocaine and agreed to make contact with his supplier.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-15\">Johnson was later indicted for conspiracy to distribute and possession with intent to distribute at least five kilograms of cocaine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), 846, and released on bond. Johnson appeared in the district court on March 27, 2007, to plead guilty to both charges, but the court was concerned with the plea form and rescheduled the hearing. After Johnson left the courthouse, Johnson attempted but faded to elude arrest for several traffic offenses and the possession of less than one ounce of marijuana. The arresting officer also discovered $3900 in Johnson\u2019s possession. The district court revoked Johnson\u2019s bond and incarcerated him.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-16\">Johnson entered a blind plea of guilty to both charges, and the presentence investigation report listed Johnson\u2019s base offense level at 34. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(3). The report recommended against a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility because \u201cJohnson failed to withdraw from criminal conduct\u201d as evidenced by his March 27 arrest. Based on a criminal history category of III, the report provided a sentencing range between 188 and 235 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-17\">Johnson filed a tardy objection to the report and challenged the denial of a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. At the sentencing hearing, Johnson argued that he had cooperated with law enforcement and had accepted marijuana from another individual on March 27 to facilitate a future sting operation. The government argued that Johnson was not entitled to a downward adjustment because he did not provide substantial assistance to law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>The district court overruled Johnson\u2019s objection and found that Johnson was not entitled to an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. The district court stated that Johnson had a higher criminal history level than a codefendant; Johnson \u201cdealt in a lot of drugs before he got caught\u201d; and the court could not \u201cput a good spin on the incident where ... Johnson had the marijuana.\u201d The court also stated that it was \u201caware of the fact that ... [it did not] have to give a guideline sentence.\u201d The district court sentenced Johnson to concurrent terms of 180 months of imprisonment and concurrent terms of five years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">We \u201creview the district court\u2019s determination of acceptance of responsibility only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>370 F.3d 1305, 1320 (11th Cir.2004). Because \u201c \u2018[t]he sentencing judge is in a unique position to evaluate a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility,\u2019 \u201d we give that finding \u201c \u2018great deference on review.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1022 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 5). We review the reasonableness of a criminal sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">Johnson presents two challenges to his sentence. First, Johnson argues that he was entitled to a downward adjustment for his acceptance of responsibility. Second, Johnson argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We address each issue in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-11\">\n<em>A. The District Court Did Not Clearly Err By Denying Johnson a Downivard Adjustment.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b878-13\">A defendant may receive a two-level downward adjustment for his acceptance of responsibility for the charged offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 (a). A plea of guilty before trial and truthful admissions about the charged conduct constitutes \u201csignificant evidence of acceptance of responsibility[,]\u201d but may be \u201coutweighed by conduct ... that is inconsistent with such acceptance....\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 1. If a defendant \u201ccontinues to participate in the conduct that formed the basis of the offense for which he was sentenced ... [he] is not entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Villarino, </em>930 F.2d 1527, 1529 (11th Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-14\">The record supports the denial of the downward adjustment. Johnson was apprehended while trafficking in drugs and admitted that, on the same day he was to plead guilty, he accepted a \u201csmall sample of marijuana\u201d from another individual. Johnson attempted to elude arrest and was captured when his motorcycle became mired in a ditch. Although Johnson alleged that he accepted the drugs to facilitate a future sting operation, the district court was entitled to find that this argument was incredible. The district court did not clearly err by denying Johnson a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-15\">\n<em>B. Johnson\u2019s Sentence Is Reasonable.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b878-16\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing a sentence below the advisory guideline range. Johnson argues that the district court did not consider the sentencing factors under section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>3553(a) or the parismony principle, but the record refutes this argument. The district court considered Johnson\u2019s prior criminal history, contrasted that history with the history of Johnson\u2019s codefendant, acknowledged that the guidelines were advisory, and decided to depart from the guideline range and impose a lower sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Johnson\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">Johnson\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
