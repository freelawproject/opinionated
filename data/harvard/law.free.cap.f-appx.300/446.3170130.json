Carlson alleged that Tone\u2019s terminated her employment in retaliation for her seeking workers\u2019 compensation benefits, which would constitute a wrongful discharge in violation of Iowa public policy. Tone\u2019s removed the case to federal court. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted Tone\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and Carlson appealed. We affirm the grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-23\">Carlson began working at Tone\u2019s in 1992. In 2003, Carlson began to experience chest pains and, based on the recommendation of her doctor, stopped working at Tone\u2019s because of her pain. Tone\u2019s informed her that it considered her absence as leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2601 <em>et seq. </em>Carlson asserted a workers\u2019 compensation claim in May 2003. Tone\u2019s had a light duty work program for employees who could not fulfill the physical requirements of their normal job duties and invited Carlson to return to work in the light duty program on several occasions. Initially, because Carlson had not received a medical release, she was not eligible for light duty work under the collective bargaining agreement. However, in November 2003, Dr. Donna Bahls examined Carlson and stated that Carlson could return to light duty work at Tone\u2019s. Carlson did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-24\">While Carlson was on leave from Tone\u2019s, Tone\u2019s learned that she was working for Dr. Gregory Peterson, her treating physician. On May 3, 2004, William Nelson, Tone\u2019s labor relations and security manager, sent a letter to Carlson informing her that Tone\u2019s \u201ccould only assume that [Carlson] voluntarily relinquished\u201d her position with Tone\u2019s because she had \u201caccepted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>other employment\u201d while not responding to Tone\u2019s \u201cconsistent\u201d offers of work. Carlson responded that she had not returned to work at Tone\u2019s because she never received a medical release from her doctor. On July 6, 2004, Nelson again wrote to Carlson and reiterated that her employment had ended on May 3, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Carlson then filed suit, alleging that Tone\u2019s terminated her employment in retaliation for claiming workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Tone\u2019s, finding that Carlson failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether there was a causal connection between her filing of a workers\u2019 compensation claim and her discharge. <em>See Fitzgerald v. Salsbury Chem., Inc., </em>613 N.W.2d 275, 281 (Iowa 2000) (noting that \u201ca causal connection between the conduct and the discharge\u201d is one of the elements of an action to recover damages for discharge in violation of public policy under Iowa law). Carlson appealed, arguing that she had wanted to return to work, that Tone\u2019s failed to compare her duties at Dr. Peterson\u2019s office with her duties at Tone\u2019s, and that supervisors made snide remarks after a previous work-related injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">\u201cWe review a grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Smith v. Int\u2019l Paper Co., </em>523 F.3d 845, 848 (8th Cir.2008). After a thorough review of the record, we agree with the district court that Carlson failed to offer sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that Tone\u2019s terminated her employment in retaliation for her filing a workers\u2019 compensation claim. For the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned opinion, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b472-21\">. The Honorable John A. Jarvey, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b473-7\">. Carlson also argues that the district court erred by not addressing Tone\u2019s arguments that her claims were preempted under \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act and that as a union employee she could not assert a public policy discharge claim. Because we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Carlson failed to make a submissible prima facie case, we need not address Tone's alternative arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
