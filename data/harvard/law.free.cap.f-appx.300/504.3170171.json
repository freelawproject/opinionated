Shadur, Senior United States District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b531-5\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>****</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Vickie Nunez appeals from the district court\u2019s order upholding the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (ALJ) denial of social security disability benefits. We affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the facts and procedural history, we do not restate them here except as necessary to explain our disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Nunez\u2019s impairments did not meet or equal Listing 1.13 or Listing 1.05C. The record does not clearly establish, by means of objective medical signs and laboratory findings, that Nunez\u2019s condition met the requirements of either listing during the relevant time period. <em>See Burch v. Barnhart, </em>400 F.3d 676, 679 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Young v. Sullivan, </em>911 F.2d 180, 184-85 (9th Cir.1990). Where the evidence is unclear or conflicting, we must uphold the Commissioner\u2019s decision. <em>Burch, </em>400 F.3d at 679; <em>Sandgathe v. Chater, </em>108 F.3d 978, 980 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Further, the ALJ did not err by relying on the medical opinion of a non-examining physician, Dr. Gurvey, who disagreed with the findings of Nunez\u2019s treating and examining physicians. \u201cAlthough \u2018more weight is given to a treating physician\u2019s opinion than to the opinion of a nontreating physician,\u2019 the ALJ may reject controverted testimony of a treating physician if [the ALJ] has specific and legitimate reasons supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Sandgathe, </em>108 F.3d at 980 (quoting <em>Andrews v. Shalala, </em>53 F.3d 1035, 1040-41 (9th Cir.1995)); <em>see also Magallanes v. Bowen, </em>881 F.2d 747, 755 (9th Cir.1989). Here, the ALJ did not err in crediting the opinion of Dr. Gurvey above the opinions of Dr. Angerman, Dr. Berenji, Dr. Capen, and Dr. Lounsberry, because the ALJ gave specific and legitimate reasons supported by the record for rejecting the opinions of those physicians. Because Dr. Garvey's opinion was consistent with other evidence in the record \u2014 specifically, testimony of Dr. Crawford, Dr. Phelps, and Dr. Borelli \u2014 reliance on the medical opinion of a non-examining physician did not amount to an abandonment of the ALJ\u2019s position as an impartial adjudicator. <em>See Magallanes, </em>881 F.2d at 752-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-13\">Finally, the ALJ did not err in relying on a hypothetical that assumed Nunez could work with her hands, because substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Nunez did not have material limitations in the use of her hands. <em>See Bayliss v. Barnhart, </em>427 F.3d 1211, 1217-18 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Magallanes, </em>881 F.2d at 756-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"****\">\n<p id=\"b531-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
