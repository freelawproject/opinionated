R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b561-6\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Hong Ling, a native and citizen of China, petitions pro se for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 order dismissing her appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) decision denying her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001), and we deny in part, dismiss in part, and grant in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">Even if Ling filed her asylum application -within one year, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. <em>See id. </em>Ling\u2019s testimony was internally inconsistent and was inconsistent with her asylum application regarding matters that go to the heart of her claim. <em>See Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962-64 (9th Cir.2004). Moreover, Ling\u2019s submission of two fraudulent identity documents to support her claims further supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. <em>See Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741, 745 (9th Cir. 2004) (concluding that substantial evidence supported agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination based, in part, on submission of fraudulent documents that went to the heart of petitioner\u2019s claim); <em>see also Akin-made v. INS, </em>196 F.3d 951, 955-56 (9th Cir.1999) (distinguishing forgeries \u201cincidental\u201d to a claim from those that go to the \u201cheart\u201d of the claim). Accordingly, Ling\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Ling\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony the IJ found not credible, and she points to no other evidence the IJ should have considered. <em>See id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">We conclude that Ling received \u201ca full and fair hearing of [her] claims and a reasonable opportunity to present evidence on [her] behalf,\u201d and she has not shown that \u201cthe outcome of the proceeding may have been affected by the\u201d IJ\u2019s alleged bias. <em>See Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000). Accordingly, we deny her due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-13\">We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s denial of Ling\u2019s request for voluntary departure. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-14\">Finally, it is not clear from the record that Ling received the required notice regarding the consequences of filing a frivolous asylum application. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(d)(4)(A). Therefore, we overturn the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Ling filed a frivolous asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-15\">Accordingly, Ling\u2019s petition for review is denied as to the denial of her asylum, withholding of removal and CAT claims, dismissed as to her voluntary departure claim, but granted with respect to the IJ\u2019s finding that her asylum application was frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-16\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; GRANTED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b561-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
