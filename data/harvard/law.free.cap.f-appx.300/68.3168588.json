Rohan denying her applications for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>In re Xiao Huan Lin, </em>No. A 98 323 146 (B.I.A. Jan. 31, 2008), <em>affg </em>No. A 98 323 146 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 5, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). For asylum applications governed by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his or her account, and inconsistencies in his or her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). Thus we \u201cdefer ... to an IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-13\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination which was based on: (1) the inconsistency between Lin\u2019s testimony that she attended church services at her aunt\u2019s home and her identification of a photograph of a church as her aunt\u2019s home, and her later testimony that her aunt\u2019s home was, in fact, next door to the church depicted in the photograph; (2) the inconsistency between Lin\u2019s testimony that she did not have any pictures of her church in China and her prior submission of pictures of a building she claimed to be her church; (3) the omission from Lin\u2019s aunt\u2019s letter of any assertion that she was arrested, despite Lin\u2019s testimony that she was; (4) the inconsistency between the name and address of Lin\u2019s church in her application and the letter she submitted to show that she attended church services; and (5) the inconsistency between Lin\u2019s testimony that she had never attended baptismal classes and her asylum application, in which she stated that she was attending baptismal classes twice a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Lin asserts that many of these inconsistencies and omissions are minor or immaterial to her claim. However, under the REAL ID Act, which applies to Lin\u2019s application for relief, \u201can IJ may rely on <em>any </em>inconsistency or omission in making an adverse credibility determination as long as the \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 establishes that an asylum applicant is not credible.\u201d <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167 (emphasis in original) (finding that an omission in a friend\u2019s letter that the friend was in hiding could, along with other omissions and inconsistencies, be the proper basis for an adverse credibility determination). Although Lin argues before this Court that she was scared during her hearing and simply forgot certain details, we will not consider that newly-minted explanation. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104,119-20 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">The IJ also found adverse to Lin\u2019s credibility that, despite her testimony that she had studied the Bible and listened to Bible stories and sermons for several years, she could not initially identify her favorite Bible story. Lin argues that a lack of doctrinal knowledge does not automatically render incredible an alien\u2019s religious persecution claim. Although we rejected in <em>Rizal v. Gonzales, </em>442 F.3d 84, 90 (2d Cir.2006), an IJ\u2019s conclusion \u201cthat a certain level of doctrinal knowledge is necessary in order to be eligible for asylum on grounds of religious persecution,\u201d the IJ here did not rely solely on Lin\u2019s lack of doctrinal knowledge. Instead, she reasonably found that Lin\u2019s assertion that she had studied the Bible and listened to Bible stories for years was inconsistent with her initial inability to identify a favorite Bible story and response, \u201cThe Bible, it is very deep, I do not really understand it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Taken as a whole, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 165-66. Therefore, the IJ properly denied Lin\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal because the only evidence that Lin would be persecuted depended on her credibility. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">We lack jurisdiction to review Lin\u2019s arguments regarding relief under the Convention Against Torture because she explicitly declined to seek such relief before the IJ and, therefore, failed to exhaust any such claim. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Karaj v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 113, 119 (2d Cir. 2006). Accordingly, we must dismiss the petition for review to that extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED, in part, and DENIED, in part. As we have completed our review, any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
