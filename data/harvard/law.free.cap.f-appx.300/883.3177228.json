Therefore, Cristeven maintains, the IJ and BIA erred by denying his applications for asylum and withholding of removal. We will address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">\n<em>I. Asylum,</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b910-13\">Conceding that he did not file his application for asylum within the one-year time frame from arrival into the United States, Cristeven argues that BIA erred by finding that he did not establish one of the exceptions, specifically changed circumstances. The Government responds that we lack jurisdiction to review the denial of Cristeven\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-14\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, \u201cexcept to the extent that [the BIA] expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cWe review subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo.\u201d Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-15\">An alien may apply for asylum if he \u201cdemonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). An application filed after one year may be considered \u201cif the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum <em>or </em>extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application within the period specified ....\u201d \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). Section 1158(a)(3) provides: \u201c[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General under paragraph (2).\u201d \u00a7 1158(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-17\">Under our current precedent, \u00a7 1158(a)(3) divests us of jurisdiction to review the determination that an asylum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>applicant filed an untimely application or failed to establish changed or extraordinary circumstances to excuse his untimely filing. <em>Fahim v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1217 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam) (holding that federal courts lack jurisdiction to review the Attorney General\u2019s decision as to timeliness of an asylum request: \u201cPursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3), the Attorney General\u2019s decision regarding whether an alien complied with the one-year time limit or established extraordinary circumstances, such that the time limit should be waived, is not reviewable by any court.\u201d); <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007) (providing that 1158(a)(3) \u201cdivests us of jurisdiction to review decisions of whether an alien complied with the one-year time limit, or whether extraordinary circumstances were present to justify untimely filing of the asylum application\u201d). Hence, we lack jurisdiction to review the determination that Cristeven failed to demonstrate that changed country conditions justified his untimely filing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). Accordingly, we dismiss Cristeven\u2019s petition for review with respect to his asylum claim for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">\n<em>II. Withholding of Removal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">Cristeven argues that, based on his credible testimony and independent evidence, he suffered persecution because of his Chinese ethnicity and Christian denomination, or, in the alternative, he has a well-founded fear of future persecution if he returns to Indonesia. Specifically, Cristeven asserts that the following amounts to persecution: attacks and discrimination in school, threats that forced his family to flee during the Dayak War in or about February 1997, demands for money and harassment by Muslims, and the anti-Chinese riots in Jakarta in 1998. The Government responds that the same does not constitute persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">We review the BIA\u2019s factual detenninations under the substantial evidence test and \u201cmust affirm the [IJ\u2019s] decision if it is \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84 (citation omitted). \u201cWe have described the substantial evidence test as \u2018deferential,\u2019 and have emphasized [that] we may not \u2018re-weigh the evidence\u2019 from scratch.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cTo reverse ... fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">To obtain withholding of removal, an alien must establish that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). \u201cThe alien bears the bur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>den of demonstrating that it is \u2018more likely than not\u2019 [he] will be persecuted or tortured upon being returned to [his] country.\u201d <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1375 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1232 (11th Cir.2005)). \u201c[Persecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and ... [m]ere harassment is not persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (citation and internal quotations omitted); <em>Ruiz, </em>479 F.3d at 766 (construing <em>Sepulveda </em>as holding the same). The standard for withholding of removal \u201cis more stringent than the \u2018well-founded fear of future persecution\u2019 required for asylum.\u201d <em>Tan, </em>446 F.3d at 1375 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">An alien may satisfy his burden of proof for withholding of removal in two ways. First, an alien may establish past persecution based on a protected ground. <em>Tan, </em>446 F.3d at 1375. If he does so, the existence of past persecution creates a rebuttable presumption that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution and shifts the burden to the government to show changed conditions in the country or the ability to avoid a future threat through relocation. <em>Id. </em>Second, an alien may establish that it is more likely than not that he would be persecuted upon removal due to race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Id. </em>\u201c \u2018An alien cannot demonstrate that [he] more-likely-than-not would be persecuted on a protected ground if the [BIA] finds that the alien could avoid a future threat by relocating to another part of [his] country.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Having reviewed the record and the briefs of the parties, we discern no error. Substantial evidence supports the determination that Cristeven did not meet the burden required for withholding of removal because he did not establish past persecution or an inability to avoid future persecution through relocation within Indonesia. Notably, the record reveals that Cristeven never suffered any physical harm based on his Chinese descent or Christianity and his family continues to reside unharmed in a non-Muslim area of Indonesia. <em>See Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1259 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (providing that evidence that an alien\u2019s family continues to reside unharmed in a country supports a conclusion that a threat may be avoided by relocation). Accordingly, we deny Cristeven\u2019s petition with regard to the withholding of removal claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">DISMISSED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b910-10\">. \u2018\u2018Ng\u201d stands for \"name not given.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b910-11\">.

Section \u00a7 106(a)(l)(A)(iii) of the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231, 310 (2005), amended 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 by adding subsection (a)(2)(D), which reads that \"[n]othing in subparagraph (B) [removing jurisdiction for review of denials of discretionary relief] or (C), or in any other provision of this chapter (other than this section) which limits or eliminates judicial review, shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). We, however, have held that the REAL ID Act did not vest us with jurisdiction to review a finding that an asylum application was untimely or that extraordinary circumstances justified an untimely filing, because these were discretionary or factual determinations. <em>Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 957 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (\"The timeliness of an asylum application is not a constitutional claim or question of law covered by the Real ID Act's changes.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
