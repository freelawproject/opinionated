Ingram challenges his sentence, arguing that (1) the District Court erred in finding that he was a career offender; (2) the District Court failed to recognize its authority to grant a downward departure on the basis of an overstated criminal history, or a combination of factors; and (3) his sentence was unreasonable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that these arguments are without merit and will affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">The District Court found that Ingram was a career offender as defined in United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d) \u00a7 4B1.1 based on prior convictions for a controlled substance offense and crimes of violence, in particular: (1) manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing a controlled substance on July 25, 1988; (2) robbery on November 19, 1988; and (3) robbery on June 10, 1991. Each of these offenses was separated by an intervening arrest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ingram was ultimately convicted of these offenses, and on November 21, 1991, he received concurrent sentences of incarceration for all three offenses. Ingram argues that these offenses were consolidated for sentencing and should not have been treated as separate sentences.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The District Court properly determined that these were separate sentences as instructed by Application Note 3 to Guidelines \u00a7 4A1.2 (2005) and our decision in <em>United States v. Hallman, </em>23 F.3d 821, 825 (3d Cir.1994).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-14\">Ingram also maintains that the District Court failed to recognize its authority to grant a downward departure based on his argument that the career offender designation overstated his criminal history. Similarly, Ingram argues that the District Court failed to recognize its authority under Guidelines \u00a7 5K2.0 to depart based on a combination of factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-15\">\u201cWe do not have jurisdiction to review discretionary decisions by district courts to not depart downward. Jurisdiction arises, however, if the district court\u2019s refusal to depart downward is based on the mistaken belief that it lacks discretion to do otherwise.\u201d <em>United States v. Vargas, </em>477 F.3d 94, 103 (3d Cir.2007) (citations omitted). \u201cOur review of the District Court\u2019s legal conclusion that it lacked discretion to consider a departure based on family circumstances is de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Dominguez, </em>296 F.3d 192, 194-95 (3d Cir. 2002). We review the sentencing transcript as a whole and \u201cwill not elevate form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>over substance.\u201d <em>United States v. Dragon, </em>471 F.3d 501, 506 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Although it could have been clearer, the transcript does not suggest that the District Court doubted its discretion to depart downward on the bases argued by Ingram.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After arguments by counsel, the District Court denied both motions. Thus, we conclude that the District Court recognized its discretion to depart downward.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Finally, Ingram argues that his sentence was unreasonable because it was not based on the individualized facts and circumstances of Ingram\u2019s case. Further, Ingram argues that the District Court gave undue weight to the nature of the offense and deterrence, and insufficient weight to other factors including the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">We review a district court\u2019s ultimate determination of a sentence for reasonableness under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Gunter, </em>527 F.3d 282, 284 (3d Cir.2008) (citing <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597-98, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 327-28 (3d Cir.2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">In its sentencing remarks, the District Court set forth the factors it was required to consider under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). It acknowledged Ingram\u2019s \u201cdifficult upbringing,\u201d \u201chard life,\u201d and the \u201csignificant changes\u201d Ingram was making in his life. (App.63, 66.) The District Court further acknowledged Ingram\u2019s loving family. (App.66.) The District Court indicated that it would take these circumstances into consideration. <em>Id. </em>However, the District Court also noted the \u201cvery, very serious\u201d nature of Ingram\u2019s criminal conduct and the need to \u201csend the right message that ... the conduct [Ingram was] involved in is not tolerated in our community.\u201d (App.67.) Ultimately, the District Court imposed a sentence below the applicable Guidelines range.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We find that the District Court appropriately considered the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). Accordingly, we conclude that this sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-15\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment of sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b162-8\">. The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b162-9\">. Indeed, the second and third of these offenses were separated by three additional arrests that led to convictions, but did not contribute to Ingram's criminal history score.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b162-16\">. We exercise plenary review over a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines, reviewing its factual determinations for clear error. <em>United States v. Grier, </em>475 F.3d 556, 570 (3d Cir.2007) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b162-17\">. The Guidelines have since been amended to make it even more clear that offenses separated by intervening arrests should be treated as separate sentences. <em>See </em>Guidelines \u00a7 4A1.2 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b163-12\">. In particular, the Government never argued that the District Court lacked discretion to depart on these bases. Further, the District Court did clearly deny Ingram\u2019s motion for a downward departure pursuant to \u00a7 5K2.0 on the merits, ruling that \u201cI find no factors that warrant a downward departure.\" (App. at 56.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b163-25\">. After granting a motion for a downward departure not at issue here, the District Court found that the applicable Guidelines range was 151 to 188 months. The sentence ultimately imposed was 132 months. According to the District Court, this reduction was based on the same circumstances it considered in granting that motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
