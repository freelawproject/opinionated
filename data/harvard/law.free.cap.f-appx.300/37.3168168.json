We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-14\">The district court granted summary judgment to Hopmayer on Kamal\u2019s malicious prosecution claim because it found the evidence insufficient for a jury to conclude that Hopmayer had initiated Kamal\u2019s prosecution. We agree. The substance of the call that Johnson allegedly received from \u201cAaron\u201d after arresting Kamal does not suggest any collaboration between Hopmayer and the police, much less that Hopmayer \u201cplayed an active role in the prosecution, such as giving advice and encouragement or importuning the authorities to act.\u201d <em>Rohman v. New York City Transit Auth., </em>215 F.3d 208, 217 (2d Cir.2000) (citations omitted). With respect to the interview of Kamal\u2019s ex-girlfriend, B.B., Kamal has identified no evidence suggesting that it was instigated by Hopmayer. Johnson and defendant Acting Assistant Principal Toner both testified that B.B.\u2019s statement was taken by Toner, not Hopmayer. While Toner did say that Hopmayer oversaw her work, she said only that Hopmayer reviewed her findings and did not suggest that he played any role in selecting the students to be interviewed. The circumstances of B.B.\u2019s interview therefore do not support an inference that Hopmayer was \u201cresponsible for providing false information or manufactured evidence that influences a decision whether to prosecute,\u201d <em>Chimurenga v. City of New York, </em>45 F.Supp.2d 337, 343 (S.D.N.Y. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-15\">We need not decide today whether claims under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d <em>et seq. </em>can be asserted against individuals via 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, because Kamal\u2019s evidence, in any event, is insufficient to establish that Hopmayer discriminated against him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>on the basis of his race, color or national origin. <em>Cf. Bruneau v. South Kortright Central School District, </em>163 F.3d 749, 755 (2d Cir.1998) (\u201c[W]e need not address the extent to which Title IX subsumes a \u00a7 1983 claim against ... individual defendants ____\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Kamal alleges that Hopmayer\u2019s frequent visits to Kamal\u2019s English class and discussions there of his military service during the first Gulf War created a hostile educational environment. But mere discussion of military service does not establish discriminatory animus, and Kamal does not allege that Hopmayer expressed any prejudice or negative sentiments about Iranians, Muslims, or any other group during those discussions. Nor do the circumstances of Kamal\u2019s suspension suggest that he suffered discrimination. Although Hopmayer punished R.Y. less severely than he punished Kamal, the record indicates that he did so on the basis of a teacher\u2019s eyewitness report that R.Y. had been \u201cmaking every effort to hold [Kamal] back\u201d and that Kamal was the clear aggressor. Even if R.Y. taunted Kamal on the school bus the day before, it was Kamal who initiated the altercation in the school hallway by verbally challenging R.Y. and who was the first to strike the other with a closed fist.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The extension of Kamal\u2019s term of suspension does not indicate discrimination because there is no evidence that Hopmayer was the final decision maker with respect to the extension. Although Hopmayer may have told Kamal and his parents of the extension at the March 10 meeting, Kamal\u2019s father testified that Assistant Superintendent Cooper told him shortly thereafter that <em>she </em>could not allow Kamal to return to the school, which suggests that she ultimately was responsible for the extension. There is no evidence that Cooper\u2019s decision was motivated by discriminatory animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Kamal\u2019s claim that Hopmayer retaliated against him for speech protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution fails for substantially the reasons given by the district court: to the extent Kamal claims retaliation through his unlawful prosecution, the claim fails because Kamal has not adduced evidence that Hopmayer initiated the prosecution, as discussed above; and to the extent Kamal claims retaliation by his suspension, the claim fails because Kamal cannot show that the suspension or its extension was in retaliation for his protected speech. As discussed above, there is no evidence that Cooper\u2019s decision to extend Kamal\u2019s suspension was attributable to discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
