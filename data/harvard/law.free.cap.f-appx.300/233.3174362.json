On appeal, Ellerbee contends the district court erred in designating him as a career offender and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In response, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Government has filed a motion to dismiss Ellerbee\u2019s appeal, asserting that pursuant to the appellate waiver contained in his plea agreement, there is no basis to challenge the sentence imposed. The Government also contends there is no evidence in the record indicating that Ellerbee\u2019s attorney provided ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Pursuant to a plea agreement, a defendant may waive his appellate rights under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 (2000). <em>United States v. Wiggins, </em>905 F.2d 51, 53 (4th Cir.1990) (waiver upheld as voluntarily and intelligently made). Whether a defendant has waived his right to appeal is an issue of law subject to de novo review. <em>United States v. Marin, </em>961 F.2d 493, 496 (4th Cir.1992). A waiver will preclude appeal of a specific issue if the record establishes that the waiver is valid and that the issue is within the scope of that waiver. <em>United States v. Attar, </em>38 F.3d 727, 731-33 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Ellerbee contends that his criminal history did not justify designation as a career offender, as two of his prior offenses should not have been considered separately under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2) (2007). However, this claim is squarely within the scope of the appellate waiver, as Ellerbee waived his right to appeal his sentence, \u201cincluding any issues that relate to the establishment of the advisory Guideline range.\u201d <em>See United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 172-73 (4th Cir.2005). While Ellerbee reserved the right to appeal a sentence imposed in excess of the established Guidelines range, his sentence of 228 months was within the Guidelines range of 188 to 235 months. Accordingly, Ellerbee\u2019s claim is barred by the appellate waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">Ellerbee also contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Ellerbee asserts that he would not have entered into his plea agreement had he known that he could have been classified as a career offender, as his trial attorney allegedly failed to discuss this matter with him and led him to believe that he would receive a sentence between 70 and 87 months. According to the terms of the plea agreement, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are not barred by the appellate waiver. However, these claims should be raised in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion rather than on direct appeal unless the record conclusively demonstrates ineffective assistance. <em>See United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). Such a claim cannot be fairly adjudicated on direct appeal when the appellant has not raised the issue before the district court and there is no statement from counsel on the record. <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 120-21 (4th Cir. 1991). Because the existing record fails to conclusively support Ellerbee\u2019s assertions that counsel provided ineffective assistance, any such claim must be raised as part of a \u00a7 2255 motion rather than on direct appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">Accordingly, we grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss as to Ellerbee\u2019s sentencing claims. As for Ellerbee\u2019s claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, we deny the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss as to those claims, but nonetheless affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-18\">. Ellerbee has also filed a pro se supplemental brief in which he claims his trial attorney committed fraud and asks this court to review his sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b260-6\">. Ellerbee also asks this court to issue a \"new rule\u201d that appeal waivers do not serve the interests of justice and are not enforceable. However, we have consistently upheld the enforceability of appellate waivers. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>410 F.3d 137, 151 (4th Cir.2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
