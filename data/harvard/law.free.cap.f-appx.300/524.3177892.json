The Commissioner\u2019s decision to deny benefits will only be disturbed if it based on legal error or is not supported by substantial evidence. <em>Stout v. Comm\u2019r Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>454 F.3d 1050, 1052 (9th Cir.2006). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-16\">The ALJ did not abuse his discretion in finding that Lunn\u2019s testimony was not wholly credible with respect to the intensity, duration, and limiting effects of her symptoms. Here, the ALJ provided three reasons for not fully crediting Lunn\u2019s testimony: (1) her testimony was not supported by medical evidence; (2) her testimony was inconsistent with her daily activities; and (3) the residual functional capacity assessment demonstrated that Lunn was able to perform a significant range of light work. These reasons are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-17\">The ALJ did not err in concluding that Lunn could perform light work. Because the ALJ assigned only limited weight to the opinion of Lunn\u2019s primary care doctor, Dr. Reed, he needed to provide \u201cspecific, legitimate reasons for disregarding the opinion of the treating physician.\u201d <em>See Batson v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>359 F.3d 1190, 1195 (9th Cir. 2004). The ALJ gave multiple reasons for rejecting Dr. Reed\u2019s medical opinion, concluding that it was: (1) contrary to his own treating notes; (2) completed without formally testing Lunn\u2019s functional capacity; (3) contradicted by the opinion of Lunn\u2019s neurological surgeon, Dr. Mack; (4) based solely on Lunn subjective reports; and (5) contrary to Lunn\u2019s reports of her daily activities. These reasons are specific and legitimate and supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Likewise, substantial medical evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Lunn\u2019s depression and headaches were not severe impairments. The ALJ found no medical evidence that these impairments significantly limited Lunn\u2019s physical or mental ability to perform basic work activities. There are no medical records from December 2004 forward that indicate Lunn was seen, treated for, or even reported headaches to any physician. Additionally, the ALJ relied on the treatment notes of Lunn\u2019s counselor and doctors, the state psychologist\u2019s evaluation, and the vocational evaluation to find that her depression had no more than a minimal effect on her ability to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Finally, the ALJ properly concluded that Lunn was capable of returning to her previous work. At Lunn\u2019s hearing, the ALJ posed a hypothetical question to the vocational expert about Lunn\u2019s residual functioning capacity. Both the expert\u2019s answer to the hypothetical and his earlier vocational evaluation served as substantial evidence that Lunn could perform her past work as an administrative aide; therefore, the ALJ properly concluded that Lunn could perform light work.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b551-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
