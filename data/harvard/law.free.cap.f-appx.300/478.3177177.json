Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo claims of constitutional violations in immigration proceedings, <em>Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 516 (9th Cir.2001), and we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s denial of petitioners\u2019 applications for cancellation of removal because they did not file a timely petition for review of that decision. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The evidence petitioners presented with their motion to reopen concerned the same basic hardship grounds as their applications for cancellation of removal. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 602-03 (9th Cir.2006). We therefore lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination that the evidence would not alter its prior discretionary determination that petitioners failed to establish the requisite hardship. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Petitioners\u2019 argument that the BIA denied them due process by failing adequately to explain its reasons and address the entirety of the evidence they submitted is unpersuasive. <em>See id. </em>at 603-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b504-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
