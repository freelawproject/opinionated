R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b589-21\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-22\">Kusuma Putra Indra, a native and citizen of Indonesia, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s decision denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1015 (9th Cir.2003), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-23\">The agency denied Indra\u2019s asylum application as time barred. Indra does not challenge this finding in his opening brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-24\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Indra failed to establish past persecution, <em>see id. </em>at 1016-18, and Indra has not demonstrated any basis for persecution under <em>Hernandez-Ortiz v. Gonzales, </em>496 F.3d 1042 (9th Cir.2007). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>addition, even if the disfavored group analysis set forth in <em>Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922, 927-29 (9th Cir.2004) applies in the context of withholding of removal, Indra failed to demonstrate that it was more likely than not that he will be persecuted if he returns to Indonesia. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1184-85 (9th Cir. 2003). Accordingly, Indra\u2019s withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Indra failed to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if he returns to Indonesia. <em>See El Himri v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 932, 938 (9th Cir.2004). Indra\u2019s CAT claim fails because he has not demonstrated that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if he returns to Indonesia. <em>See El Himri v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 932, 938 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Finally, we reject Indra\u2019s contention that we should remand the case based on the Id\u2019s corroborating evidence finding, because the BIA conducted a de novo review, treated Indra\u2019s testimony as true, and denied Indra\u2019s withholding and CAT claims on the merits. <em>See Kataria v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 1107,1114 (9th Cir .2000)</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b589-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
