The Kaplans sought the BOTOX injections for purely cosmetic purposes. After receiving several injections without incident, the Kaplans suffered severe injuries when, on November 24, 2004, McComb substituted raw botulinum-A toxin for BOTOX.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">The Kaplans submitted approximately $800,000 of resulting medical bills to their health insurer, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida, Inc. (BCBSF). BCBSF denied their claims, finding that the November 24, 2004 injections were \u201ccosmetic services,\u201d not covered under their health insurance plan and that the medical care the Kaplans required as a result of those injections were \u201ccomplications of non-covered services,\u201d also not covered under their health insurance plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">After an administrative review process yielded affirmance of BCBSF\u2019s coverage determination, the Kaplans sued BCBSF in district court, alleging violation of ERISA. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court denied the Kaplans\u2019 motion and granted summary judgment to BCBSF. The Kaplans now appeal that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-11\">We find no reversible error. The district court correctly found that BCBSF did not misinterpret the language of the Kaplan\u2019s health insurance plan when it denied their claims. (R.l-28 at 11.) Like the district court, we decline to accept the Kaplans\u2019 arguments that McComb\u2019s substitution of raw botulinum-A toxin for BO-TOX tranformed the medical services they later received to treat their resulting injuries into covered services.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
