We hold that Xiong\u2019s conviction under California Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 261.5(c) and 664 was not a conviction for the aggravated felony of sexual abuse of a minor, and we grant the petition for review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">When the BIA conducts an independent review of the IJ\u2019s findings, we review the BIA\u2019s decision, and not that of the IJ. <em>See Hernandez-Guadarrama v. Ashcroft, </em>394 F.3d 674, 679 (9th Cir.2005). The BIA\u2019s determination of purely legal questions is reviewed de novo. <em>See De Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>374 F.3d 759, 761 (9th Cir.2004). Whether a criminal offense constitutes an aggravated felony is a legal question that we review de novo. <em>Martinez-Perez v. Ashcroft, </em>417 F.3d 1022, 1025 (9th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-15\">Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), \u201cany alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission\u201d is removable. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A) defines aggravated felony to include \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(U) defines aggravated felony to include \u201can attempt or conspiracy to commit an offense described\u201d elsewhere in \u00a7 1101(a)(43). To determine whether a particular conviction constitutes \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A), we apply the <em>Taylor </em>categorical analysis. <em>Estrada-Espinoza v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 1147, 1151-52 (9th Cir. 2008) (en banc); <em>see also Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-17\">We have recently determined that a conviction under California Penal Code \u00a7 261.5(c) is not categorically a conviction for sexual abuse of a minor. <em>Estrada-Espinoza v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d at 1159-60. Therefore, a conviction for attempted unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor under California Penal Code \u00a7 261.5(c) and 664 cannot constitute a conviction for attempted sexual abuse of a minor under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A) and (U). We grant Xiong\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-18\">PETITION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b538-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-13\">. Xiong also challenges the BIA's affirmance of the IJ's denial of his application for asylum and withholding of removal. Because we hold that Xiong is not removable, we need not address these issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
