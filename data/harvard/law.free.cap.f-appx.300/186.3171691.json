For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-20\">Inasmuch as we write primarily for the parties, we need not recite the rather involved procedural or historical background of this appeal. In an exceptionally throughly and persuasive Report and Recommendation, dated May 21, 2007, Magistrate Judge Lisa Pupo Lenihan, explained that even though the court was \u201cnot unsympathetic to Plaintiffs\u2019 plight and the seemingly inequitable result reached ... \u201d, \u201ccontrolling law\u201d, and the \u201cunambiguous language of the DTY leases,\u201d \u201cresultfed] in a finding in favor of the Defendants.\u201d Accordingly, she recommend that the defendants\u2019 motion for partial Summary Judgment be granted, and the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-21\">By order dated October 3, 2007, the district court rejected the Plaintiffs\u2019 Objections to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation, and entered judgment in favor of defendants, and against plaintiffs as to all claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-22\">We can add little to the thoughtful analyses set forth in the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation. Accordingly we will affirm the judgment of the district court adopting that Report and Recommendation, substantially for the reasons set forth by the Magistrate Judge.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
