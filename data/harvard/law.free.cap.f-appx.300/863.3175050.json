On appeal, Boco argues that the district court\u2019s sentence was unreasonable. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">In July 2001, Boco pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. In October 2001, the district court sentenced Boco to forty-six months\u2019 imprisonment and five years\u2019 supervised release. In September 2004, Boco began serving his supervised release term.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">A. Boco\u2019s violations of supervised release</p>\n<p id=\"b890-12\">In October 2005, Boco\u2019s probation officer reported that Boco had violated his supervised release by receiving citations for driving with a suspended license, speeding, and failing to maintain proof of insurance. The district court did not take any action against Boco at that time. In June 2006, the district court found that Boco had violated his supervised release by using a controlled substance and modified the conditions of Boco\u2019s supervised release to require him to participate in a home detention program for sixty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-14\">In February 2007, the district court required Boco to participate in a residential treatment center for 180 days because he violated his supervised release by: (1) unlawfully possessing or using a controlled substance; (2) leaving the judicial district without permission from his probation officer; (3) failing to notify his probation officer within seventy-two hours of being arrested or questioned by a law enforcement officer; and (4) failing to submit a truthful and complete monthly report to his probation officer. In May 2007, the district court issued a summons because Boco again had violated his supervised release by being discharged from the residential treatment center for consuming alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-15\">In June 2007, Boco was arrested for violating his supervised release by: (1) failing to participate in the residential treatment center; (2) committing a robbery with a deadly weapon, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon; and (3) not reporting contact with law enforcement to his probation officer within seventy-two hours. The district court issued a warrant for Boco\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-16\">B. Hearing on revocation petition before a magistrate judge</p>\n<p id=\"b890-17\">In a December 2007 hearing before a magistrate judge, Boco admitted to being discharged from the residential center for alcohol consumption and failing to notify his probation officer that he had been questioned by law enforcement. As to the assault and robbery, Jonathan Beuter testified that Boco and another man attacked him while he was leaving a strip club and that Boco stabbed him in the chest with a knife, punched him, and robbed him of his gold necklaces and wallet. Detective Or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>ville Wright testified that he saw Boco speeding off in a car immediately after the attack. The magistrate judge\u2019s report (\u201cR&amp;R\u201d) found that Beuter\u2019s in-court identification of Boco and description of the attack were credible and thus found by a preponderance of the evidence that Boco committed the three violations. In an order dated January 2, 2008, the district court adopted the R&amp;R.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">C. Sentencing hearing before the district court</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">At sentencing, the district court reaffirmed its finding that Boco committed the three violations. The government recommended that the district court impose the statutory maximum of three years\u2019 imprisonment because of his criminal history and recidivism. Boco noted that the advisory guidelines range was twelve to eighteen months\u2019 imprisonment. Boco also argued that the district court should consider Boco\u2019s cooperation with the government in two unrelated cases. The government acknowledged that Boco had agreed to cooperate with the government, but argued that it would be premature for Boco to benefit from his cooperation because he had not yet been called to testify as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">The district court acknowledged that it had considered the advisory guidelines range. Although it commended Boco for cooperating with the government, the district court stated that it would consider his cooperation only if the government filed a motion outlining the extent of Boco\u2019s cooperation and requesting that he receive a reduction of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">The district court stated that it was \u201cabsolutely satisfied that Mr. Boco did, in fact, commit that assault which turned into a robbery on that young man\u201d and discussed the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a). After reviewing the assault and robbery and noting that it occurred outside of a strip club where Boco apparently was a regular, the district court stated that \u201c[i]t just makes you stop and wonder whether he is, frankly, trying to turn his life around or is he doing other things and certainly doing it in a way that is just going to send him back to the problems he is having before.\u201d The district court opined that instead of toning into a law-abiding citizen, Boco was \u201cengaged in an activity that puts him on a trajectory back to what he was doing in the first place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">The district court expressed the need to impose a sentence that reflected the seriousness of the offense and the need to protect the public. The district court stated that this was a \u201cserious offense\u201d and that Boco needed to understand that he could not \u201cdo things like this.\u201d After examining the robbery and assault that occurred here and Boco\u2019s prior conduct, the district court stated that \u201c[i]t really suggests that he learned nothing while on supervised release.\u201d Thus, the district court revoked Boco\u2019s supervised release and imposed a thirty-six-month sentence. Boco objected that the district court\u2019s sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">Boco filed this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b891-13\">\u201cPursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), upon finding that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release, a district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>may revoke the term of supervised release and impose a term of imprisonment after considering the specific factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1251 (11th Cir.2008). In addition, a district court is required to consider the policy statements in Chapter Seven of the Sentencing Guidelines, including the recommended ranges of imprisonment applicable upon revocation, but the policy statements are merely advisory. <em>United States v. Silva, </em>443 F.3d 795, 799 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Boco above the advisory guidelines range to thirty-six months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court properly considered the advisory guidelines range and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and imposed a sentence within the statutory range. The district court\u2019s thirty-six-month sentence was reasonable in light of the serious and violent nature of Boco\u2019s violations and his repeated violations of the conditions of his supervised release in the past. The district court gave Boco several opportunities to rehabilitate himself by modifying his supervised release conditions. However, Boco failed to comply with, and continued to violate, the terms of his supervised release, this time by, <em>inter alia, </em>participating in an assault and robbery with a knife outside of a strip club. As the district court observed, Boco\u2019s conduct indicates that his previous term of imprisonment and supervised release did not provide adequate deterrence and that the thirty-six-month sentence was necessary to reflect the seriousness of his violations and deter him from future violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to consider Boco\u2019s cooperation with the government in other cases because the government has not filed a motion, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 or Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b), requesting that Boco\u2019s sentence be reduced based on his cooperation. Consideration of such cooperation thus would be premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">For all of these reasons, we affirm Boco\u2019s thirty-six-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b891-8\">. We review a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1251 (11th Cir.2008). A district court\u2019s decision to exceed the advisory sentencing range in Chapter Seven of the Sentencing Guidelines, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4, is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Silva, </em>443 F.3d 795, 798 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
