For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-15\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b348-16\">Baldwin alleges that she was sexually harassed by a fellow employee at Northrop Grumman Information Technology (\u201cNGIT\u201d). During this period of harassment, Baldwin allegedly sent many faxes about this mistreatment to Layton, NGIT\u2019s human resources manager. On February 10, 2003, Baldwin filed a discrimination charge, alleging sexual harassment by the co-worker and violations of both the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act (\u201cTCHRA\u201d) and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), against NGIT with the Austin Commission on Human Rights and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the \u201cEEOC\u201d). On September 8, 2003, the EEOC found that it could not conclude that any statutory violation occurred. On that same day, the EEOC sent Baldwin a right-to-sue letter stating that she had 90 days to file a lawsuit in federal court. Baldwin did not file suit within that time period. On January 7, 2005, Baldwin\u2019s attorneys withdrew from representation, explaining, <em>inter alia, </em>that the deadline had passed to sue in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>On February 2, 2007, over three years after the EEOC sent Baldwin her right-to-sue letter, Baldwin filed this employment discrimination action against Layton in Texas state court under Title VII. Layton removed to federal court and, on March 12, 2007, Layton filed a Motion to Dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. On May 17, 2007, the district court granted Layton\u2019s motion, reasoning both that (1) the statute of limitations barred Baldwin\u2019s claims and that (2) Layton, as an employee, could not be held individually liable under Title VII. Baldwin filed a Rule 59(e) Motion to Alter or Amend the Judgment, arguing for the first time that she was entitled to equitable tolling because her attorney had not released himself from representation before the TCHRA filing deadline in February 2005. On November 2, 2007, the district court denied the motion, stating that Baldwin \u201cfail[ed] to proffer any evidence or argument that she could not have offered prior to entry of final judgment ....\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, <em>Morin v. Caire, </em>77 F.3d 116, 120 (5th Cir.1996), \u201caccepting all well-pleaded facts as true and viewing those facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,\u201d <em>Stokes v. Gann, </em>498 F.3d 483, 484 (5th Cir.2007) (per curiam). \u201cTo survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the plaintiff must plead \u2018enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Elsensohn v. St. Tammany Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office, </em>530 F.3d 368, 372 (5th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Coup. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544,127 S.Ct. 1955,1974,167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). This court reviews for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to alter or amend the judgment. <em>Templet v. HydroChem, Inc., </em>367 F.3d 473, 477 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">Title VII\u2019s statute of limitations provides claimants with the right to file a civil action \u201cwithin ninety days\u201d after the giving of notice. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1). We strictly construe this 90-day limitations period. <em>See Ringgold v. Nat\u2019l Maint. Corp., </em>796 F.2d 769, 770 (5th Cir. 1986) (holding that a Title VII claim was barred when filed 92 days late); <em>Espinoza v. Mo. Pac. R.R. Co., </em>754 F.2d 1247, 1251 (5th Cir.1985) (same). In the present case, Baldwin filed her suit over three years after the limitations period. Thus, we agree with the district court that her suit is time-barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">Furthermore, we agree that Baldwin has failed to state a claim under Title VII because she sued Layton. This court has repeatedly rejected any individual liability under Title VII. <em>Ackel v. Nat\u2019l Commc\u2019ns, Inc., </em>339 F.3d 376, 382 n. 1 (5th Cir.2003) (\u201cIndividuals are not liable under Title VII in either their individual or official capacities.\u201d); <em>Smith v. Amedisys, Inc., </em>298 F.3d 434, 448 (5th Cir.2002) (\u201cThis circuit has held that there is no individual liability for employees under Title VII.\u201d). In the present case, Layton is NGIT\u2019s human resources manager and thus cannot be held individually liable under Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">Finally, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Baldwin\u2019s Motion to Alter or Amend the Judgment. The reconsideration of a judgment is an \u201cextraordinary remedy\u201d that we use \u201csparingly.\u201d <em>Templet, </em>367 F.3d at 479. A Rule 59(e) motion is not a \u201cvehicle for rehashing evidence, legal theories, or arguments that could have been offered or raised before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>entry of judgment\u201d but instead has a \u201cnarrow purpose of allowing a party to correct manifest errors of law or fact or to present newly discovered evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 478-79. Equitable tolling is also a remedy that should be used \u201csparingly.\u201d <em>Irwin v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>498 U.S. 89, 96, 111 S.Ct. 453, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990). This court primarily applies equitable tolling when \u201c \u2018the plaintiff is actively misled by the defendant about the cause of action or is prevented in some extraordinary way from asserting his rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Coleman v. Johnson, </em>184 F.3d 398, 402 (5th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Rashidi v. Am. President Lines, </em>96 F.3d 124, 128 (5th Cir.1996)). Equitable tolling is not warranted when an attorney merely commits error or neglect. <em>Cousin v. Lensing, </em>310 F.3d 843, 849 (5th Cir.2002). In the present case, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Baldwin\u2019s Motion to Alter or Amend the Judgment. Baldwin\u2019s argument for equitable tolling is not based on newly-discovered evidence and thus could have been raised before the district court prior to judgment. Furthermore, Baldwin does not clearly articulate how or why her attorneys\u2019 actions warrant the remedy of equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the orders of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b348-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b349-7\">. The district court also denied two subsequent responses to this order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
