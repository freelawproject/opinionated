Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in the district court which was unopposed by Larkin. The district court granted the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">A review of the record and appellant\u2019s opening brief indicates that the questions raised in this appeal are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">We review whether the United States is immune from liability under the FTCA <em>de novo. See Alfrey v. United States, </em>276 F.3d 557, 561 (9th Cir.2002). The district court correctly ruled that Larkin could not bring a claim under the FTCA against the United States for lost or damaged personal property and dismissed the claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Bramwell v. United States Bureau of Prisons, </em>348 F.3d 804, 806-08 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-13\">We review constitutional claims asserted under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), de novo. <em>See Martinez v. City of Los Angeles, </em>141 F.3d 1373, 1382 (9th Cir.1998). We agree with the district court\u2019s dismissal of appellant\u2019s claim for property deprivation or loss in that it does not give rise to a cognizable constitutional or <em>Bivens </em>claim because appellant has an adequate post-deprivation remedy for the loss or deprivation of his property. <em>See Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 533, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984); <em>Barnett v. Centoni, </em>31 F.3d 813, 816 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-14\">We also agree with the district court that Larkins\u2019 claim that the defendants improperly processed his administrative complaints or grievances does not give rise to a cognizable constitutional or <em>Bivens </em>claim. <em>See Ramirez v. Galaza, </em>334 F.3d 850, 860 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-15\">Accordingly, appellees\u2019 unopposed motion for summary affirmance of the district court\u2019s judgment is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-16\">All pending motions are denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b528-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
