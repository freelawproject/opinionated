In 2001, a jury convicted him of felonious assault upon a police officer in violation of Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 2908.11. After exhausting his state-court appeals, petitioner initiated this proceeding. After denying the petition, the district court certified a single issue for appeal: Whether petitioner\u2019s due process rights were violated when the trial court refused to allow his mother to testify about events surrounding petitioner\u2019s initial arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-20\">Having had the opportunity to review the record, consider the briefs of the parties, and hear oral argument, we conclude that the district court correctly analyzed the issue certified for appeal in its Order filed on October 28, 2005, particularly in light of the deference accorded the state court under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), (2). Because that Order reflects the thinking of this court, an additional reasoned opinion would serve no useful purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-21\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
