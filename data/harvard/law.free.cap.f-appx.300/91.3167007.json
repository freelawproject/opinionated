We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Horieianu\u2019s argument that his sentence is unreasonable is without merit. The court properly calculated the Guidelines range of three to nine months, and explained its decision to impose more time based on Horicianu\u2019s repeated refusal to obey the conditions of his supervised release. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Horicianu to approximately three months beyond the Guidelines recommendation, based on the totality of Horicianu\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Many of Horicianu\u2019s other claims are directly contradicted by the record. For example, despite Horicianu\u2019s argument that the Probation Department did not follow the district court\u2019s order to assess his ability to pay, the transcript of the violation hearings makes clear that the Probation Department determined that he was able to pay for both the electronic monitoring and the mental health treatment. Other arguments are against the letter and spirit of the conditions of his supervised release, such as Horicianu\u2019s contention that his work on his direct criminal appeal should qualify as lawful employment under his supervised release. Yet other contentions are redundant of his earlier appeal, <em>see Horicianu v. United States, </em>No. 07-4246 (2d Cir. May 8, 2008) (order denying motion for fair punishment), or take issue with either the fairness of his supervised release conditions or the way in which these conditions were imposed. These arguments would have been properly raised in his appeal from his original conviction and sentence, but are beyond this Court\u2019s purview on appeal from his conviction and sentence for violating his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">We have reviewed appellant\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
