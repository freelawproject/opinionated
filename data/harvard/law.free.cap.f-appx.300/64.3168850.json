Chew denying Gao\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Xiang Xin Gao, </em>No. A98 719 835 (B.I.A. Feb. 25, 2008), <em>affg </em>No. A98 719 835 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, Apr. 21, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-21\">As a preliminary matter, because Gao failed to challenge the IJ\u2019s denial of his applications for withholding of removal and CAT relief in his brief to the BIA, we deem those claims unexhausted and dismiss the petition for review to that extent. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d); <em>Theodoropoulos v. INS, </em>358 F.3d 162 (2d Cir.2004) (finding that where exhaustion is required, a court must dismiss any unexhausted claim for lack of jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-22\">When the BIA does not adopt the decision of the IJ to any extent, we review only the decision of the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Jin Yu Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>413 F.3d 188, 191 n. 4 (2d Cir. 2005). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). We review the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">We find no error in the BIA\u2019s determination that Gao\u2019s wife\u2019s forced abortion does not constitute past persecution as to Gao. As we have held, \u201cthe statutory scheme unambiguously dictates that applicants can become candidates for asylum relief only based on persecution that they themselves have suffered or must suffer.\u201d <em>Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 308 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc); <em>see also Matter of J-S- </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 520, 521 (A.G.2008). Accordingly, to the extent Gao\u2019s petition for review is based on his wife\u2019s forced abortion, it \u201cis doomed.\u201d <em>See Shu Wen Sun v. BIA </em>510 F.3d 377, 381 (2d Cir.2007); <em>Gui Yin Liu v. INS, </em>508 F.3d 716, 723 (2d Cir.2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Even where an applicant has not suffered a forced abortion or sterilization, he or she may still establish eligibility for relief based on his or her own resistance to a family planning policy. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B). Gao argues that he demonstrated \u201cother resistance\u201d to a coercive population control program because after he learned of his wife\u2019s forced abortion, he injured a family planning official. The BIA found that Gao\u2019s experience did not establish eligibility for asylum because it was \u201cbased on causing personal injury to someone.\u201d Because Gao does not reference this determination, let alone challenge it, we leave it undisturbed. <em>Cf. Gui Yin Liu, </em>508 F.3d at 723 (remanding where petitioner\u2019s \u201cother resistance\u201d claim was not adequately developed).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Gao also argues that the IJ prevented him from developing his claim and denied him a fair hearing by appearing impatient to end the hearing. However, the BIA found that Gao failed to establish that he was deprived of a fair hearing where he did not explain \u201cwhat material testimony he was prevented from presenting as a result of the [IJ\u2019s] conduct.\u201d Again, because Gao has failed to address this finding, we leave it undisturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-8\">. We are troubled that Gao\u2019s counsel fails to acknowledge either the Attorney General\u2019s decision in <em>Matter of J-S-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 520 (A.G.2008), or our holding in <em>Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d at 300, where these issues are dis-positive.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
