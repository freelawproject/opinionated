Although Palmer does not contest on appeal the district court\u2019s calculation of the advisory guidelines range, he asserts two sentencing errors. First, Palmer argues that the court erred by imposing a sentence greater than necessary to fulfill the purposes of sentencing as set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006). Second, he contends that the advisory guidelines range applied to him both overstates the seriousness of his conduct and does not sufficiently address his recent attempts to change his life. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">We review sentences for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473-74 (4th Cir.2007). This court may afford sentences that fall within the properly calculated guidelines range a presumption of reasonableness. <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473; <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding presumption of reasonableness of within-guidelines sentence). This presumption can be rebutted only by showing \u201cthat the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Here, the district court properly calculated the guidelines range and correctly treated the sentencing guidelines as advisory.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-15\">In determining an appropriate sentence, a district court \u201cneed not robotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection,\u201d but should \u201cprovide [this court] an assurance that the sentencing court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors with regard to the particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Moulden, </em>478 F.3d 652, 657 (4th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Here, the district court explained that it had considered both the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the advisory guideline range. Moreover, the court stated that it believed the sentence was appropriate when viewed in light of the particular circumstances of the offense, Palmer\u2019s repeated criminal convictions, and the need to protect the public from Palmer\u2019s further criminal acts. Accordingly, we find that the seventy-month sentence, which is within the advisory guidelines range, is reasonable. <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2462.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-16\">Because we reject Palmer\u2019s challenge to his sentence, we affirm the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately addressed in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
