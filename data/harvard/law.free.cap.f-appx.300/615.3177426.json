EBEL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Charles James Griffin, Jr., proceeding pro se, appeals from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to Mr. Griffin\u2019s failure to exhaust his administrative remedies. The Commissioner of Social Security has filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, asserting that upon further factual review, the agency has determined that a remand for further administrative proceedings is appropriate. Mr. Griffin, whose pro se filings are entitled to a liberal construction, <em>see Wheeler v. Comm\u2019r, </em>528 F.3d 773, 781 (10th Cir.2008), has objected to the motion to dismiss. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we grant the motion to dismiss, subject to the Commissioner\u2019s agreement, as stated in his motion, to consider Mr. Griffin\u2019s filing of this action as a timely filed request for a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ), and to remand the matter to an ALJ for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">In 1993, the Commissioner determined that Mr. Griffin was entitled to disability insurance benefits (DIB) under Title II of the Social Security Act. Those benefits were later reduced by an offset for state workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Mr. Griffin filed a request for reconsideration, which was denied by a Notice of Reconsideration dated December 11, 2006 (Notice). In the Notice, the Commissioner advised Mr. Griffin that he had the right to appeal the decision by requesting a hearing before an ALJ within sixty days of the date he received the Notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">Mr. Griffin did not request a hearing before an ALJ; instead, he filed this action on January 24, 2007, naming the Commissioner and three individual employees of the Social Security Administration (SSA) in their official capacity. The Commissioner moved to dismiss the official-capacity claims against the individual defendants on the ground that Mr. Griffin\u2019s claims were really against the United States in the form of the Commissioner. The Commissioner also moved to dismiss the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">The district court granted the motion for the reasons stated in it, dismissing the official-capacity claims and the case. Mr. Griffin asked the court to reconsider its dismissal of the case or, in the alternative, to consider his request as a notice of appeal. The district court denied the motion to reconsider but considered the request to be Mr. Griffin\u2019s notice of appeal. Mr. Griffin thereafter filed an additional notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b642-13\">By statute, federal courts have jurisdiction to review \u201cany final decision of the Commissioner.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 405(h) (\u201cNo findings of fact or decision of the Commissioner . .\u2022. shall be reviewed by any person, tribunal, or governmental agency except as herein provided.\u201d). The term \u201cfinal decision\u201d is not defined in the statutes, and \u201cits meaning is left to the [Commissioner] to flesh out by regulation.\u201d <em>Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 766, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>(1975). To that end, the Commissioner has promulgated regulations setting out a four-step administrative review process. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.900(a). A determination about \u201c[a] reduction in [a claimant\u2019s] disability benefits because [the claimant] also receive[s] benefits under a workmen\u2019s compensation law\u201d is an \u201cinitial determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.902(e). If dissatisfied with the initial determination, a claimant may ask for reconsideration. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.907. If the claimant is dissatisfied with the reconsideration, he may request a hearing before an ALJ, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 404.929, 404.930, and if still dissatisfied after the ALJ\u2019s decision, the claimant may request that the Appeals Council review the decision, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 404.967. After the Appeals Council either denies the request for review or grants the request and issues its own decision, the claimant may seek judicial review by filing an action in the proper federal district court within sixty days after receiving notice of the Appeals Council\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.981.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Mr. Griffin completed only the first two steps of this process. Because there is no indication that further administrative proceedings would be futile or that the Commissioner has waived further exhaustion, the district court properly dismissed his action for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See Heckler v. Ringer, </em>466 U.S. 602, 617-19, 104 S.Ct. 2013, 80 L.Ed.2d 622 (1984) (discussing exceptions to exhaustion doctrine and affirming dismissal for failure to exhaust); <em>see also Weinberger, </em>422 U.S. at 765, 95 S.Ct. 2457 (explaining that among other things, exhaustion is ordinarily required to \u201cprevente ] premature interference with agency processes, so that the agency may function efficiently and so that it may have an opportunity to correct its own errors\u201d). But rather than affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal, we elect to grant the Commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss this appeal. In the motion, the Commissioner states that the SSA,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-8\">in its role as finder of fact, has further reviewed [Mr.] Griffin\u2019s case and determined that a remand for further administrative proceedings is appropriate. If the Court grants this motion, the Appeals Council will consider [his] filing of the district court civil action (D.C. NO. 07-cv-00176-JLK) as a timely filed request for hearing before an [ALJ], The Appeals Council will remand the matter to an ALJ for a hearing on SSA\u2019s determination to offset [Mr.] Griffin\u2019s Social Security disability benefit amount because he was also receiving federal workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">Mot. to Dismiss at 1. Although Mr. Griffin opposes the motion, he has not advanced any reasoned argument that persuades us to deny it; indeed, he would be disserved by the alternative \u2014 affirmance of the district court\u2019s dismissal. Accordingly, subject to the conditions set forth in the motion regarding a remand for a hearing before an ALJ, we GRANT the motion to dismiss this appeal. We encourage Mr. Griffin to take advantage of the Commissioner\u2019s generous offer, and we thank the Commissioner for advancing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">The appeal is DISMISSED for the reasons stated above.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b642-8\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b643-6\">. In his complaint and his motion to reconsider, Mr. Griffin also requested that the district court appoint an attorney to represent him. Mr. Griffin has not challenged the district court's implicit denial of those requests, and to the extent he has asked for counsel on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>appeal in his \u201cThird Brief Motion Answer,\u201d his request is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
