Weisel denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Jaspal Singh, </em>No. A 96 149 124 (B.I.A. Dec. 28, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A 96 149 124 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Dec. 13, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">\u201cWhere, as here, the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, we will review both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions\u2014 or more precisely, we review the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA.\u201d <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. In concluding that Singh was not credible, the IJ properly found implausible Singh\u2019s testimony regarding his fear of persecution. While Singh argues that his continued Sikh practice in the U.S. and Dubai was a valid reason to fear persecution, he fails to explain why the IJ erred in finding it implausible that, despite his fear, he remained in India for one year after his alleged arrest and beating. Moreover, the IJ found equally questionable Singh\u2019s claim that although he traveled to Dubai for lengthy periods on at least two occasions, he returned to India at least three times. We are not compelled to conclude that the IJ erred in finding Singh\u2019s story, as a whole, implausible. <em>See Ying Li v. BCIS, </em>529 F.3d 79, 80 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">The IJ also properly found that the absence of evidence corroborating the central elements of Singh\u2019s claim further undermined his credibility. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 341 (2d Cir.2006). Singh argues that the agency disregarded his explanations for his failure to submit such evidence: that he was \u201can uneducated person,\u201d that he was unaware of this evidentiary requirement, and that he feared potential retaliation from the police in India. However, rather than ignoring these explanations, the IJ considered and reasonably rejected them. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 (2d Cir.2005) (holding that the agency need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>not credit an applicant\u2019s explanations for inconsistent testimony unless those explanations would compel a reasonable fact-finder to do so).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">To the extent Singh challenges the IJ\u2019s other credibility findings, we decline to consider these arguments. Even if the IJ\u2019s remaining findings were in error, remand would be futile as it can be confidently predicted that the agency would reach the same conclusion on remand. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 339. Ultimately, substantial evidence supported the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). Accordingly, the IJ properly denied asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief where the only evidence that Singh would be persecuted or tortured depended on his credibility. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156-57 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
