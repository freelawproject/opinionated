We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">We review the denial of a motion to intervene, whether as of right or by permission, for abuse of discretion. <em>AT &amp; T Corp. v. Sprint Corp., </em>407 F.3d 560, 561 (2d Cir.2005). When a district court denies permissive intervention, our review is \u201cparticularly deferential.\u201d <em>United States v. City of New York, </em>198 F.3d 360, 367 (2d Cir.1999). \u201c[A] denial of permissive intervention has virtually never been reversed.\u201d <em>United States v. Hooker Chems. &amp; Plastics Corp., </em>749 F.2d 968, 990 n. 19 (2d Cir. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-14\">Dibbs\u2019s proposed intervention was not as of right because, <em>inter alia, </em>his motion was untimely and his alleged interest as a voter was not an interest that risked impairment by disposition of the underlying action. <em>See In re Bank of N.Y. Derivative Litig., </em>320 F.3d 291, 300 (2d Cir .2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-15\">Furthermore, Dibbs seeks to impermissibly interject collateral issues into an existing action: he argues that the 2006 judicial elections were rigged; he charges that certain New York State judges violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 <em>et seq. </em>in responding to his earlier lawsuit; and he attempts to introduce new defendants. <em>See Washington Elec. Co-op. v. Mass. Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., </em>922 F.2d 92, 97 (2d Cir.1990) (\u201cIntervention cannot be used as a means to interject collateral issues into an existing action.\u201d); <em>see generally New York News Inc., v. Kheel, </em>972 F.2d 482, 486 (2d Cir.1992). Hence, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Dibbs\u2019s motion to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-16\">We also dismiss a pending motion filed by Chi\u2019istopher Earl Strunk to file an <em>amicus curiae </em>brief before this Court. Strunk\u2019s motion is no longer timely. Moreover, it does not indicate that he sought or obtained permission from the parties, and his proposed brief is largely irrelevant. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 29(a)-(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-17\">Finding no merit in Dibbs\u2019s remaining arguments, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
