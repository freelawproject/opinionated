Kahn, J.) granting summary judgment in favor of appellees Patricia Monroe and Adirondack Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, P.C. (\u201cAIMP\u201d), and dismissing Page\u2019s complaint in its entirety. The district court determined that (1) Page failed to provide any evidence to support her claim that Dr. Monroe breached a duty to report under New York\u2019s mandatory reporter system, or that such an alleged breach was knowing and willful; and (2) Page\u2019s medical malpractice claim failed as well because she did not establish that Dr. Monroe had breached her professional duty of care, or that such an alleged breach was the proximate cause of the Pages\u2019 harm. In addition, the court dismissed the vicarious liability claims against AIMP because it found no liability on the part of AIMP\u2019s employee, Dr. Monroe. <em>Page v. Monroe, </em>488 F.Supp.2d 219 (N.D.N.Y.2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">We review an award of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>and will affirm only if the record, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, reveals no genuine issue of material fact. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., All </em>U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); <em>Jute v. Hamilton Sundstrand Corp., </em>420 F.3d 166, 172 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">First, Page argues that the district court erred in dismissing her claim that Dr. Monroe and AIMP breached a statutory duty to report under section 413 of the New York Social Services Law. Because appellants have failed to show that, under the circumstances, a duty arose on the part of Dr. Monroe to report Catherine Page, this argument must fail. Section 413 requires medical professionals, among others, to make a report to the State Central Register (\u201cSCR\u201d) when they have reasonable cause to suspect child abuse or maltreatment. N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law \u00a7 413 (McKinney 2007). As used in this section, an \u201cabused child\u201d is a minor child (less than 18 years of age) whose \u201cparent or other person legally responsible for his care\u201d commits or allows to be committed physical or sexual abuse upon the child. Family Ct. Act \u00a7 1012(e)(iii); <em>see </em>N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law \u00a7 412(l)(a). The statute further defines the \u201csubject\u201d of such a report as \u201cany parent of, guardian of, custodian of or other person eighteen years of age or older legally responsible for [the abused child] who is allegedly responsible for [the abuse, or allowing the abuse to be inflicted].\u201d N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law \u00a7 412(4) (McKinney 2007). A person required to report suspected child abuse or maltreatment under the statute may be subject to civil liability if she knowingly and wilfully fails to do so. N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law \u00a7 420(2) (McKinney 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">As a 14-year-old minor not legally responsible for his sisters\u2019 care, Anthony could not be the subject of a report under the mandatory reporter law. <em>See </em>N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law \u00a7 412(4) (McKinney 2007) (limiting reportable subjects to adults legally responsible for the care of the allegedly abused child); see <em>also Catherine G. v. County of Essex, </em>3 N.Y.3d 175, 180, 785 N.Y.S.2d 369, 818 N.E.2d 1110 (2004) (finding no reportable incident because Anthony was a 14-year-old boy and not legally responsible for his siblings). Thus, when Catherine Page informed Dr. Monroe in August of 2000 of her daughter\u2019s diary entry indicating possible abuse by Anthony, this would only have been a re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>portable incident had Dr. Monroe thought that Catherine Page, or any other adult legally responsible for the children\u2019s care, was incapable or unwilling to protect the children from the potential abuse. <em>Id. </em>The evidence shows that, at the time of the initial reports of abuse, Dr. Monroe had no reason to believe that Catherine Page was neglecting her duty to protect her daughters from abuse. Catherine Page called Dr. Monroe the night she read her daughter\u2019s diary entry indicating that abuse was taking place. She told Dr. Monroe that she had taken steps to obtain professional help for her children in the form of counseling, that the children were currently separated \u2014 Anthony at his father\u2019s house, and her two daughters at their aunt\u2019s house \u2014 and that she would not leave the children together unattended going forward. Her decisions to cancel subsequent appointments with Dr. Monroe were explained by Brittany\u2019s preference not to speak with Dr. Monroe about the incident, and the fact that Brittany was seeing a mental health professional skilled in treating sexually abused children. Thus, with the information she had at the time, Dr. Monroe did not have a duty to report under New York\u2019s mandatory reporter laws.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law \u00a7 413 (McKinney 2007). Although the record evidence before the district court was far more extensive than that before the court in <em>Catherine G., </em>both lead to the same conclusion. <em>See Catherine G., </em>3 N.Y.3d at 180, 785 N.Y.S.2d 369, 818 N.E.2d 1110 (\u201c[Catherine Page] never suggested that she was so bereft of control that she was unable to stop her 14-year-old boy from harming his siblings. The record reveals a mother who ... appeared to be taking reasonable measures to protect her daughters and obviate the need for governmental intervention.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Page\u2019s second claim sounds in medical malpractice. She claims that Dr. Monroe breached her duty to exercise due care by failing to report or make an independent investigation of the steps Catherine Page was or was not taking to combat the alleged abuse. The expert testimony of Dr. Tomiak indicating that Dr. Monroe deviated from the standard of care raises a question of fact as to whether Dr. Monroe breached her duty of care as a physician. As a doctor, Monroe was charged with the duty to exercise due care, as measured against the conduct of her peers, and act as a reasonably prudent doctor would under the circumstances. <em>Nestorowich v. Ricotta, </em>97 N.Y.2d 393, 398, 740 N.Y.S.2d 668, 767 N.E.2d 125 (2002). In an affidavit, Dr. Monroe\u2019s expert witness, pediatrician Henry P. Tomiak, opined that Dr. Monroe had not violated the standard of care when she failed to take additional action either after Page assured her that Anthony and his sisters would be kept apart until Dr. Monroe had an opportunity to speak with Brittany or after Page failed to bring Brittany for scheduled follow-up appointments. Dr. Tomiak, however, several times during his deposition, expressly stated that failure to inquire as to whether Anthony was being kept away from Brittany and Melissa, failure to ascertain whether the children were being supervised at all times, and failure to follow up with the Pages after Brittany\u2019s initial allegations of sexual molestation would be deviations from the standard of care. Further, Page\u2019s expert witness, pediatrician Jenni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>fer Canter, opined that Dr. Monroe had violated the standard of care by failing to follow up on Brittany\u2019s missed appointment after learning of the abuse, failing to ascei\u2019tain that Page was incapable of preventing further abuse, and by failing to make an independent call to law enforcement authorities to report the abuse. We find that this expert testimony is enough to raise a triable question of fact as to whether Dr. Monroe breached her duty of care as a physician. <em>See Rodriguez v. City of New York, </em>72 F.3d 1051, 1063 (2d Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Whether Dr. Monroe\u2019s alleged breach of a duty of care was the proximate cause of the Pages\u2019 injuries is generally a question of fact for the jury. <em>See, e.g., Decker v. Forenta LP, </em>290 A.D.2d 925, 926, 736 N.Y.S.2d 554 (3rd Dep\u2019t 2002) (\u201cIt is axiomatic that proximate cause ordinarily is a question to be determined by the finder of fact.\u201d). Proximate cause may be determined as a matter of law, but that is so \u201cwhen only one conclusion can be drawn.\u201d <em>Bell v. Bd. of Educ., </em>90 N.Y.2d 944, 946, 665 N.Y.S.2d 42, 687 N.E.2d 1325 (1997). In this case, however, Page offered evidence that created at least an inference that had Dr. Monroe herself contacted the Child Protective Services or law enforcement authorities, those authorities would have intervened to stop Anthony\u2019s abuse of his half-sisters at some point before February 2001. Accordingly, Page has demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether Dr. Monroe\u2019s alleged deviations from the standard of care were the proximate cause of the girls\u2019 injuries such that, in this case, the question is one appropriately determined by the jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Finally, in light of the fact that we find a material issue of fact as Dr. Monroe\u2019s liability in medical malpractice, we remand the appellant\u2019s vicarious liability claim against AIMP as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this summary order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-4\">. We note that even had appellants\u2019 shown a duty to report, they have failed to allege any facts to demonstrate that Dr. Monroe\u2019s failure to report was knowing and willful. <em>Bowes v. Noone, </em>298 A.D.2d 859, 861, 748 N.Y.S.2d 440 (4th Dep't 2002). While Dr. Monroe knew she was not reporting, the evidence suggests that she did not believe the Pages were abused children under the specific terms of the reporting statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b101-6\">. It is unclear whether as a matter of law the common law duty to exercise due care encompasses an independent obligation to report to law enforcement separate and apart from the statutory duty to report to the state registry. <em>See Heidt v. Rome Memorial Hosp., </em>278 A.D.2d 786, 787, 724 N.Y.S.2d 139 (4th Dep't 2000), <em>leave to appeal denied, </em>725 N.Y.S.2d 263 (4th Dep't 2001) (Lawton, L, dissenting) (\"The conclusion is inescapable that [the Mandated Reporter Law] was intended to define the duty of a care giver to report cases of suspected child abuse and that no common-law duty, if any ever existed before the enactment of [the Mandated Reporter Law], survived.\"). The question arises whether the medical profession has taken it upon itself to enter farther into the realm of law enforcement than the New York legislature has required it to do since 1973 when N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law \u00a7 413 was enacted into law. On that we express no opinion and leave its resolution to the district court in the first instance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
