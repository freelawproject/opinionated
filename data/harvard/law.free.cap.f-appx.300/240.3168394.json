We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Brunson contends that the district court erred in denying his motion for a new trial, which was based on the Government\u2019s failure to turn over the inconclusive results of a field test performed on the substance taken off his person when he was arrested. We review the district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Fulks, </em>454 F.3d 410, 431 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The Due Process clause requires that the Government disclose to the defense prior to trial any impeaching or exculpatory evidence in its possession. <em>See Giglio v. United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 153-55, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972) (requiring disclosure of evidence affecting the credibility of prosecution witnesses); <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 86-88, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963) (requiring disclosure of exculpatory evidence). Due process is violated by a failure to disclose, however, only if the evidence in question: (1) is favorable to the defendant, because it is either exculpatory or impeaching; (2) was suppressed by the Government; and (3) is material in that its suppression prejudiced the defendant. <em>See Strickler v. Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 281-82, 119 S.Ct. 1936,144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999). Undisclosed evidence is material when its cumulative effect is such that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Kyles v. Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 433-34, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). A reasonable probability is one sufficient to \u201cundermine[ ] confidence\u201d in the outcome. <em>Id. </em>at 434,115 S.Ct. 1555.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that Brunson fails to demonstrate \u201ca reasonable probability\u201d that the outcome of the proceeding would have been different had the evidence been disclosed to the defense. <em>Id. </em>at 433-34, 115 S.Ct. 1555. Though the evidence may have had limited impeachment value, its nondisclosure does not undermine confidence in the result of his trial. <em>See id. </em>at 434, 115 S.Ct. 1555. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Brunson\u2019s motion for a new trial. We therefore affirm Brunson\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
