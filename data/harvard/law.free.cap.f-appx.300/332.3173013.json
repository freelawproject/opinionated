The BIA dismissed his appeal of the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision, which found that Avila\u2019s prior Texas offense of deadly conduct was a crime of violence and an aggravated felony, thus rendering him removable pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). In his petition, Avila argues that deadly conduct under Tex Penal Code \u00a7 22.05 is not a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-16\">This court lacks jurisdiction to consider petitions for review filed by aliens who are ordered removed based on the commission of an aggravated felony. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). Nevertheless, we retain jurisdiction to review the issue whether Avila\u2019s prior offense constitutes an aggravated felony for immigration purposes. <em>See Andrade v. Gonzales, </em>459 F.3d 538, 542, 544 (5th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>549 U.S. 1132, 127 S.Ct. 973, 166 L.Ed.2d 739 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-17\">Avila has not shown that the BIA erred in its classification of his prior offense as a crime of violence and thus an aggravated felony. <em>See United States v. Hernandez-Rodriguez, </em>467 F.3d 492, 495 (5th Cir. 2006); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). Consequently, we lack jurisdiction to review his order of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-19\">Avila\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b359-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
