First, Ervin argues that the district court erred when an inaccurate transcript introduced at trial by the government was published to the jury. Second, Ervin argues that the court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal based on insufficiency of the evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Third, Ervin argues that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to make any objections at his trial. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm in part and dismiss without prejudice in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-16\">At Ervin\u2019s trial, the government moved to admit an audiotape and its accompanying transcript of a conversation between Ervin and the confidential informant (\u201cCl\u201d). After the government played the audiotape, the court stated, \u201cI want to see counsel at sidebar,\u201d and a hearing was conducted outside of the jury\u2019s presence. During the sidebar, the court indicated that the audiotape\u2019s corresponding tran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>script reflected that Ervin stated to the Cl \u201cI\u2019ve got what you need,\u201d but the court did not hear the word \u201cneed\u201d actually spoken on the audiotape. Ervin\u2019s counsel moved to withdraw the transcript. The Cl, who helped prepare the transcript, told the court that he did not actually hear the word \u201cneed\u201d on the audiotape, but he filled in the word \u201cneed\u201d based upon what he remembered Ervin saying to him that day. The court granted Ervin\u2019s motion to strike the transcript. When the jury was brought back in, the court explained that it had stricken the transcript, and it gave the jury a curative instruction regarding the transcript. During his testimony, the Cl testified that Ervin told him \u201cI\u2019ve got what you need.\u201d The jury ultimately found Ervin guilty of the conspiracy charge, and the court sentenced him to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">We normally review the admission of evidence at trial for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>918 F.2d 1501, 1510 (11th Cir.1990). However, where a defendant fails to preserve an evidentiary ruling by contemporaneously objecting, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>474 F.3d 1265, 1275 (11th Cir.2007), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 867, 169 L.Ed.2d 735 (2008). To prove plain error, a defendant must show: (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 1276. If the defendant satisfies all three conditions, we may exercise our discretion to recognize the error, if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, because Ervin failed to object at trial to the admission of the transcript he complains of on appeal, we review for plain error only.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">\u201c[T]he use of a transcript as a guide is analogous to the use of expert testimony as a device aiding a jury in understanding other types of real evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Onori, </em>535 F.2d 938, 947 (5th Cir.1976). \u201cSince the jury must always reconcile the discrepancies in the transcripts) against the recording itself, the district court need not listen to the tape or decide whether a transcript is accurate before the transcript is given to the jury and the recording is played.\u201d <em>United States v. Hogan, </em>986 F.2d 1364, 1376 (11th Cir.1993) (citation omitted, alteration in original). The proper protocol in this Circuit when a party disputes the accuracy of a transcript is for \u201ceach side [to] produce its own version of a transcript or its own version of the disputed portions. In addition, each side may put on evidence supporting the accuracy of its own version or challenging the accuracy of the other side\u2019s version.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted) (concluding that defendant\u2019s claim of error must fail when he does not offer his own transcript and does not point out inaccuracies in the government\u2019s transcript). However, \u201cabsent a showing that the transcripts are inaccurate or that specific prejudice occurred, there is no error in allowing transcripts to go to the jury room.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>872 F.2d 385, 392 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-11\">Ervin can not show error because the district court was not required to listen to the audiotape or decide whether the transcript was accurate before the transcript was published to the jury and the recording was played. <em>See Hogan, </em>986 F.2d at 1376; <em>Turner, </em>474 F.3d at 1276. Regardless, however, the court <em>sua sponte </em>questioned the accuracy of the transcript and struck the transcript from evidence. Significantly, the court also instructed the jury to disregard the inaccurate transcript and decide for itself the contents of the audiotape. <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>426 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>F.3d 1344, 1352 (11th Cir.2005) (stating that \u201c[a] jury is presumed to follow the instructions given to it by the district judge\u201d). It is also worth noting that, even though he had been provided a copy of the transcript prior to trial, Ervin did not object to the transcript\u2019s contents, did not object when the court published the transcript, and did not produce his own version of the disputed transcript. <em>See Hogan, </em>986 F.2d at 1376. Finally, Ervin has not shown that his substantial rights were affected or that any specific prejudice occurred with respect to the publication of the transcript, particularly in light of the fact that other evidence corroborated that Ervin actually did state \u201cI have what you need.\u201d <em>See Turner, </em>474 F.3d at 1276; <em>Brown, </em>872 F.2d at 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">We review the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal <em>de novo. United States v. Bowman, </em>302 F.3d 1228, 1237 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cWhen the motion raises a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we review the sufficiency of the evidence <em>de novo, </em>drawing all reasonable inferences in the government\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In order to support a guilty verdict, \u201cit is not necessary that the evidence exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except that of guilt[.]\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>289 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir.2002) (brackets and quotation omitted). Rather, \u201c[t]he evidence is sufficient so long as a reasonable trier of fact, choosing among reasonable interpretations of the evidence, could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>389 F.3d 1359, 1367 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">In order to convict a defendant of conspiracy to distribute cocaine, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that: (1) a conspiracy existed; (2) the defendant knew of the conspiracy; and (3) the defendant knowingly and voluntarily joined the conspiracy. <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>896 F.2d 513, 518 (11th Cir. 1990). The \u201cexistence of an agreement in a conspiracy case is rarely proven by direct evidence that the conspirators formally entered or reached an agreement.... The more common method of proving an agreement is through circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Glinton, </em>154 F.3d 1245, 1258 (11th Cir.1998) (quotation omitted). Although mere association with a conspirator or presence at the scene of the crime is insufficient to establish participation in a conspiracy, \u201cpresence is a material and probative factor which the jury may consider in reaching its decision.\u201d <em>Hernandez, </em>896 F.2d at 518 (quotation omitted). Moreover, we have held that \u201cthe uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice is sufficient to support a conviction if it is not on its face incredible or otherwise insubstantial.\u201d <em>United States v. Milkintas, </em>470 F.3d 1339, 1344 (11th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">A thorough review of the record demonstrates that the evidence was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Erwin knowingly and voluntarily joined a conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine. Ervin\u2019s codefendant, Terrell McElrath, testified that Ervin \u201ccooked up\u201d cocaine for him and ran errands on drug deals, in exchange for which McElrath \u201calways\u201d gave Ervin either drugs or money. This testimony was sufficient to support a finding that Ervin had knowledge of McElrath\u2019s unlawful plan to sell crack cocaine to the Cl and that he knowingly and voluntarily participated in that unlawful activity. <em>See Milkintas, </em>470 F.3d at 1344; <em>see also Hernandez, </em>896 F.2d at 518 (noting that \u201cwe are constrained to make all credibility choices in favor of the jury verdict\u201d). Moreover, although McElrath\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>was alone sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict, the government\u2019s other evidence, including the testimony of the two agents from the Drug Enforcement Agency, which was substantiated by the surveillance video, along with the testimony of the Cl, further supported a jury finding that Ervin was more than simply associated with McElrath or present at the scene, but agreed to participate with McElrath in the sale of crack cocaine to the Cl. <em>See Hernandez, </em>896 F.2d at 518. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Ervin\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">\u201cClaims of ineffective assistance of counsel generally are not considered for the first time on direct appeal unless the record is sufficiently developed.\u201d <em>United States v. Le, </em>256 F.3d 1229, 1241 (11th Cir.2001). Additionally, the Supreme Court has articulated that, while \u201c[tjhere may be cases in which trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness is so apparent from the record that appellate counsel will consider it advisable to raise the issue on direct appeal,\u201d generally, these claims are best raised in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504-09, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 1694-96, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003). \u201cWhen an ineffective-assistance claim is brought on direct appeal, appellate counsel and the court must proceed on a trial record not developed precisely for the object of litigating or preserving the claim and thus often incomplete or inadequate for this purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 504-05, 123 S.Ct. at 1694.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">In this case, although Ervin claims that his counsel was ineffective for failing to make <em>any </em>objections on the record, his main contention is that his counsel neither objected to the inaccurate transcript at trial nor investigated the source of the audiotape or transcript prior to trial. However, Ervin failed to object to his counsel\u2019s performance in the district court. As a result, the record is not sufficiently developed precisely for the object of litigating Ervin\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim that he raises on direct appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Massaro, </em>538 U.S. at 504-05, 123 S.Ct. at 1694; <em>Le, </em>256 F.3d at 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-13\">In light of the foregoing, we affirm Ervin\u2019s conviction. We dismiss Ervin\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim without prejudice so that he may bring that claim in a later \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-14\">AFFIRMED IN PART, DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b872-10\">. Ervin\u2019s first appellate attorney raised the sufficiency of the evidence issue in Ervin's initial appellate brief, and the government filed a brief responding to that issue. After the court granted Ervin\u2019s first appellate attorney\u2019s motion to withdraw, a subsequent attorney was appointed, who filed a second brief on appeal. Although the second brief does not address the issue, there is no indication that the sufficiency of the evidence issue has been withdrawn. Accordingly, we address the merits of that issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b875-8\">. Ervin\u2019s reliance upon <em>Atkins v. Attorney Gen. of Alabama, </em>932 F.2d 1430, 1431 (11th Cir. 1991), is unavailing because, unlike Ervin\u2019s claim that he raises on direct appeal, the ineffective assistance of counsel claim in <em>Atkins </em>was raised in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
