McCONNELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b631-25\">Gary Lynn Gaines, a federal prisoner proceeding pro se, seeks a certificate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>appealability (COA) to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 petition. In 2002, Mr. Gaines pled guilty to aggravated sexual abuse of a child in Indian country. In 2005, Mr. Gaines filed this petition for habeas relief under \u00a7 2255, arguing that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary because he was incompetent when he entered it. The district court denied his request for a COA. Mr. Gaines now applies to this court for a COA, which we deny.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">We described the facts leading to Mr. Gaines\u2019s instant petition for habeas relief in <em>United States v. Gaines, </em>214 Fed.Appx. 849 (10th Cir.2007):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">After he was indicted, Mr. Gaines asked for and received a competency examination. Dr. Thomas Patenaude, a psychologist, performed it. After receiving Dr. Patenaude\u2019s report, the court held a competency hearing and then issued an order deeming Mr. Gaines competent to stand trial. On December 18, 2002, approximately one week after the district court deemed him competent, Mr. Gaines pleaded guilty. The district court sentenced him to 168 months in prison and a sixty-month term of supervised release.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">On December 19, 2003 \u2014 one year after Mr. Gaines was sentenced \u2014 the Federal Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) sent a letter to the district judge informing him that an internal investigation of Dr. Patenaude revealed \u201csufficient evidence to question the credibility and accuracy of a psychological evaluation\u201d Dr. Patenaude had prepared in another case. The letter continued:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">This internal investigation could call into question the credibility of other psychological evaluations conducted by this psychologist. Our records show that this psychologist issued a report in a case before your court: <em>United States v. Gary L. Gaines, </em>Case No. CR-02-063-P, concerning defendant Gary Lynn Gaines, Register Number 29031-177. Accordingly, we bring this information to your attention for any action the court may deem appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">The district court denied Mr. Gaines\u2019s \u00a7 2255 petition. We granted COA, and after receiving further briefing remanded to the district court for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether, in light of the BOP\u2019s letter, Mr. Gaines was entitled to collateral relief on the ground that the credibility of his mental competency evaluation had been called into question. 214 Fed.Appx. at 852. We also ordered that counsel be appointed. The district court conducted the evidentiary hearing in accordance with this Court\u2019s decision, and concluded that Mr. Gaines \u201cpresented absolutely no evidence [other than the BOP letter] to support [his] allegation.\u201d Dist Ct. Op. 5. The court found that \u201call of the evidence presented establishes [that] the psychological evaluation of [Mr. Gaines] was conducted in a routine manner and during the course of the evaluation [of him] nothing came to the attention of the evaluators which would cause this Court to question [Mr. Gaines\u2019s] competency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On the basis of this evidence and the district judge\u2019s own recollection of Mr. Gaines\u2019s plea colloquy, the district court denied Mr. Gaines\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-12\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b632-13\">The denial of a motion for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 may be appealed only if the district court or this Court first issues a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B). A COA will issue \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To make such a showing, a petitioner must demonstrate that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether ... the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-84, 120 S.Ct. 1595,146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">We do not believe that standard was met. The district court conducted an evidentiary hearing as required by this Court\u2019s prior decision. Petitioner, represented by counsel, had full opportunity to present evidence in support of his position. Based on that evidence, the district court reached a factual conclusion that the psychological examination of Mr. Gaines was \u201cconducted in a routine manner\u201d and that there was no reason to question the original finding of competency. That factual conclusion is subject to review in this Court only for clear error, which we do not discern.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Mr. Gaines bases his argument here primarily on a 2007 submission by the government to the Eastern District of Oklahoma in a different case involving Dr. Patenaude, in which the government reported that \u201cthe actions taken by the Courts, government, and defense counsel [in response to the BOP\u2019s letter on Dr. Patenaude] [have] varied.\u201d Government Response to Motion for Continuance (September 10, 2007), 2. In some of the cases briefly described by the government, the defendant was resentenced; in one, Dr. Patenaude\u2019s study was rejected and another study ordered; in another, a court found that nothing in the BOP letter had anything to do with the particular defendant before that court, and the defendant\u2019s sentence was upheld. <em>Id. </em>at 2-3. Given these different outcomes, Mr. Gaines suggests, reasonable minds must be able to debate whether he is entitled to habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">This argument fails to recognize that in each case, the court is bound to consider the import of the BOP\u2019s letter <em>as to the particular defendant </em>before it. The unfortunate history of Dr. Patenaude provided ample reason for this Court to insist that an evidentiary hearing be conducted, but that hearing failed to uncover any evidence that Mr. Gaines\u2019s psychological test was faulty or the results incorrect. That in other cases there was such evidence avails Mr. Gaines not at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">As a brief review of the BOP\u2019s complaint against Dr. Patenaude and the record <em>in this case </em>will demonstrate, the district court was not mistaken in concluding that Mr. Gaines is not entitled to habeas relief. The basis of the BOP\u2019s complaint against Dr. Patenaude was that he allegedly \u201cfalsified the records of four federal inmates to make it appear he met with inmates when in fact he had not.\u201d <em>Violette v. United States, </em>365 F.Supp.2d 2, 4 (D.Me.2005) (internal quotations omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If, therefore, this were a case where the district judge had based his competency determination solely on Dr. Patenaude\u2019s word that he met with Mr. Gaines and found him competent, we might agree that reasonable minds could at least debate whether Mr. Gaines was entitled to a new competency hearing. The facts here, however, are different. At the evidentiary hearing, testimony confirmed that Dr. Patenaude did, in fact, meet with Mr. Gaines. A second doctor, Dr. Balduzzi, who was then com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>pleting a pre-doctoral internship program at the Federal Medical Center-Devens, recalled assisting Dr. Patenaude with the interview. As the district court noted, \u201cDr. Balduzzi remembered interviewing the defendant and the defendant\u2019s life story as he told it to her. Dr. Balduzzi administered the psychological tests referred to in Petitioner\u2019s Forensic Mental Health Evaluation and none of the testing results gave her any reason to question [Mr. Gaines\u2019s] competency.\u201d Dist. Ct. Order (Oct. 17, 2007), 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Mr. Gaines gives us no reason to question Dr. Balduzzi\u2019s account. Her independent recollection of Mr. Gaines\u2019s case also bolsters the credibility of Dr. Patenaude\u2019s statement at the evidentiary hearing that Mr. Gaines presented an \u201ceasy\u201d case of competency, such that it was appropriate for a pre-doctoral intern to handle. <em>Id. </em>at 2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">The district judge also based his conclusion that the BOP letter did not impeach Mr. Gaines\u2019s competency determination on his own interaction with Mr. Gaines during the plea process. The district court found that Mr. Gaines \u201cpersonally appeared before this Court and communicated rationally and effectively in entering a change of plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. Indeed, our own review of Mr. Gaines\u2019s plea colloquy with the district court convinces us that it would be hard to conclude anything other than that Mr. Gaines was competent to plead guilty. Not only did Mr. Gaines engage rationally and articulately with the district judge, but he clearly understood the implications of receiving different advisory Guidelines scores on the basis of his plea and his willingness to accept responsibility for his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Because Mr. Gaines\u2019s competency at trial was confirmed by several sources, each of which supported the conclusion that he was competent, we find that there is little risk that Mr. Gaines was incompetent to enter a guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Therefore, we DENY Mr. Gaines\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability. All of Mr. Gaines\u2019s other motions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b633-7\">. Dr. Patenaude apparently claims that this was merely the result of a clerical error on his part. For purposes of this appeal, we assume the allegations against Dr. Patenaude are true.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
