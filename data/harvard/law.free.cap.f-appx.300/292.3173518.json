Over a year and a half after the judgment of conviction was entered, Torres-Jacinto filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The district court ruled that TorresJacinto\u2019s notice of appeal was \u201cuntimely.\u201d In addition, the district court granted Torres-Jacinto leave to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal but denied his request for appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Torres-Jacinto now moves this court for the appointment of counsel. This court can dismiss an appeal during consideration of an interlocutory motion if the appeal \u201cis fiivolous and entirely without merit.\u201d 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Torres-Jacinto did not file a notice of appeal within 10 days after the entry of the criminal judgment, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A), or even within the time for extending the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4). Thus, the district court did not err in enforcing the time limitations set forth in Rule 4(b), and this court may not reverse its decision to do so. <em>See United States v. LeijanoCruz, </em>473 F.3d 571, 574 (5th Cir.2006). Because the instant appeal is without arguable merit, Torres-Jacinto\u2019s motion for the appointment of appellate counsel is denied, and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b319-10\">Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
