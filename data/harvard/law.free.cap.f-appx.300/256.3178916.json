Perez argues that his non-guidelines sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to deter future criminal conduct. He contends that the sentencing court did not provide adequate reasons to support the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-23\">The selection of a non-guidelines sentence is within the discretion of the district court. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review sentences for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir.2005). We consider whether the district court committed any \u201csignificant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. If no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>procedural error occurred, we review for abuse of discretion the substantive reasonableness of the sentence selected by the district court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">In this case, the sentencing court imposed a sentence seven months higher than the guidelines sentencing range. In support of its sentencing determination, the court cited Perez\u2019s recidivism, his criminal activities that had not resulted in incarceration, and the fact that his criminal history category of VI did not adequately represent his \u201cextensive criminal history.\u201d Perez presented mitigating arguments, but the court ultimately concluded that they did not outweigh his criminal history. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2469, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). We hold that Perez\u2019s sentence was both procedurally and substantively reasonable and thus within the discretion of the sentencing court. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 348-50 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b282-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
