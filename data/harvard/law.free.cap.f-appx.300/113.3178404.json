We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Barry has established a prima facie case of age discrimination and retaliation under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621 et seq., his claims fail because he cannot show that the Board\u2019s \u201cproffered explanations\u201d for terminating his position or not hiring him to be Director of Human Resources (\u201cDirectdr\u201d) were \u201cmerely pretextual and that the actual motivations more likely than not were discriminatory,\u201d <em>Abdu-Brisson v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>239 F.3d 456, 469 (2d Cir.2001), or retaliatory, <em>Slattery v. Swiss Reinsurance Am. Corp., </em>248 F.3d 87, 94-95 (2d Cir.2001) (describing pretext requirement for age retaliation claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-12\">Former Director Scott McDonald and newly hired Director Robert Stacy each had a law degree, a characteristic the Board perceived saved money and increased office efficiency. Barry, though experienced in human resources management, was not a lawyer. Consequently, although Barry technically may have had the qualifications necessary for the position of Director, he cannot show that he was the only qualified candidate for the job. In circumstances like these, we give deference to an employer\u2019s reasonable business judgment and therefore \u201cmust respect the [Board\u2019s] unfettered discretion to choose among qualified candidates.\u201d <em>Byrnie v. Cromwell Bd. of Educ., </em>243 F.3d 93, 103 (2d Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Fischbach v. D.C. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>86 F.3d 1180, 1183 (D.C.Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-13\">Thus, considering the \u201crecord as a whole,\u201d <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prod. Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 151, 120 S.Ct. 2097,147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000), Barry cannot establish pretext for either of his claims. <em>See Byrnie, </em>243 F.3d at 103 (to show discriminatory pretext where qualifications are at issue, a \u201cplaintiffs credentials would have to be so superior to the credentials of the person selected for the job that \u2018no reasonable person ... could have chosen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>the candidate selected over the plaintiff \u201d (quoting <em>Deines v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Protective &amp; Regulatory Servs., </em>164 F.3d 277, 280-81 (5th Cir.1999))); <em>Cifra v. Gen. Elec. Co., </em>252 F.3d 205, 216 (2d Cir.2001) (rational factfinder must conclude employer\u2019s explanation is merely pretext for retaliation).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
