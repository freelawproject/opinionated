Smith argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion by failing to apply Amendment 599 to his U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-25\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a defendant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has discretion to reduce the term of imprisonment of an already incarcerated defendant when that defendant was sentenced based on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o). <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-26\">Anendment 599 became effective November 1, 2000, and amended the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, which provides the base offense level for individuals who have violated either 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 844(h), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>924(c), or 929(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> U.S.S.G.App. C, Amendment 599; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4. Amendment 599 directed that, if a sentence under \u00a7 2K2.4 was being \u201cimposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense,\u201d a district court should \u201cnot apply any specific offense characteristics for possession, brandishing, use, or discharge of an explosive or firearm when determining the sentence for the underlying offense.\u201d U.S.S.GApp. C, Amendment 599. The purpose of Amendment 599 was \u201cto clarify under what circumstances defendants sentenced for violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) in conjunction with convictions for other offenses may receive weapon enhancements contained in the guidelines for those other offenses.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Because Amendment 599 became effective November 1, 2000, prior to Smith\u2019s sentencing, Section 3582 does not permit a modification of Smith\u2019s sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (allowing a motion to modify when a sentencing range has \u201csubsequently been lowered\u201d by an amendment to the sentencing guidelines). Smith\u2019s argument also fails on the merits because Amendment 599 amended the commentary to \u00a7 2K2.4, which provides the base offense level for individuals who have violated either 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 844(h), 924(c), or 929(a), yet Smith violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e). Therefore, Amendment 599 is inapplicable to Smith on its face, and the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Smith\u2019s \u00a7 3582 motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b765-6\">. Section 844(h) criminalizes the use of fire or the use or carrying of explosives during the commission of any felony. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(h).

We also note that Smith has abandoned any argument as to Amendment 709 because he did not raise it here. <em>See Irwin v.
