We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">We review the grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Newman v. County of Orange, </em>457 F.3d 991, 993 (9th Cir.2006). In doing so, we view \u201cthe evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party\u201d to determine \u201cwhether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Ali v. Daniel, Mann, Johnson &amp; Mendenhall </em>355 F.3d 1140, 1144 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-16\"><em>Smiddy v. Varney </em>established a rebuttable presumption that a prosecutor exercises independent judgment in deciding to file criminal charges, thus immunizing the investigating officers from liability for injuries suffered after the charging decision. 665 F.2d 261 (9th Cir.1981). This presumption may be rebutted with evidence that the officers \u201cimproperly exerted pressure on the prosecutor, knowingly provided misinformation to him, concealed exculpatory evidence, or otherwise engaged in wrongful or bad faith conduct that was actively instrumental in causing the initiation of legal proceedings.\u201d <em>Awabdy v. City of Adelanto, </em>368 F.3d 1062, 1067 (9th Cir.2004). \u201cSuch evidence must be substantial.\u201d <em>Harper v. City of Los Angeles, </em>533 F.3d 1010,1027 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-17\">Colbert contends that he presented sufficient evidence to establish an issue of material fact as to whether defendant officers interfered with the prosecutor\u2019s independent judgment by withholding video evidence from the district attorney and misrepresenting the contents of that evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court properly rejected these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>First, although the officers did not physically deliver the video evidence to the district attorney when they provided him with their police report, the report noted the existence of the video, stated that the video was booked into evidence in the police station property room, and offered Officer Guith\u2019s opinion that the video was inconclusive as to the charges. Colbert does not offer any evidence that defendant officers prevented the district attorney\u2019s office from accessing and viewing the video. Colbert therefore fails to create a triable issue of fact as to whether defendants concealed or withheld the video.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Second, Colbert\u2019s claim that Guith \u201cmade a false statement\u201d in his description of the video in the police report is not supported by the evidence. Guith did not provide a definitive statement on whether the video shows a weapon, but merely his own opinion that, based on the video, he \u201ccould not tell whether or not suspect Colbert had a weapon.\u201d The video is brief and choppy, and the image quality is low. Even viewed in the light most favorable to Colbert, this evidence cannot be considered sufficiently \u201csubstantial\u201d for a reasonable trier of fact to conclude that Guith \u201cknowingly provided misinformation\u201d to the prosecutor in expressing his opinion that the video was inconclusive. <em>Awabdy, </em>368 F.3d at 1067.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Finally, Guith\u2019s alleged failure to indicate in his report that the video showed Colbert waving at someone, as Colbert had claimed, and did not show Colbert reaching into his waistband, as the alleged victim had claimed, does not amount to a knowing material omission or concealment of exculpatory evidence. Had Guith detailed Colbert\u2019s filmed movements in his report, but omitted from the description that Colbert had raised or waved his hand, a reasonable jury could conclude that Colbert had falsely represented the evidence or omitted material evidence from his report. <em>Cf. Blankenhorn v. City of Orange, </em>485 F.3d 463, 469, 484 (9th Cir.2007) (finding that where a police report provided a description of the plaintiffs arrest, but failed to include that an officer had punched the plaintiff during the arrest, the omission could reasonably be considered both \u201cpurposeful\u201d and \u201crelevant\u201d to the prosecutor\u2019s decision to charge plaintiff with resisting arrest). But Guith was not required to provide a play-by-play of the short video, which the prosecutor could view on his own, and he did not purport to do so, stating only that he found the video inconclusive. In this context, Guith\u2019s failure to provide such details cannot reasonably be said to amount to a purposeful material omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">Colbert therefore fails to rebut the presumption of prosecutorial independence, and defendant officers are entitled to summary judgment on Colbert\u2019s malicious prosecution claim. Additionally, because the officers were not the cause of any injury suffered by Colbert as a result of the criminal charges, summary judgment is also appropriate on his claim against Fontana City and Fontana Police Department. <em>Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978); <em>see also Harper, </em>533 F.3d at 1024 (\u201cA municipality may be held liable under \u00a7 1983 only where an \u2018action pursuant to official municipal policy of some nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>causes a constitutional tort.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Monell, </em>436 U.S. at 659, 98 S.Ct. 2018)).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b517-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9lh Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b517-14\">. Colbert also briefly suggests that by requesting expedited filing of Colbert\u2019s case, the Fontana Police Department pressured the district attorney in such a way as to interfere with his exercise of independent judgment. But a routine request to make a filing decision quickly does not amount to the exertion of improper pressure to file.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-19\">Colbert also suggests that Officer Guith omitted material information from his police report by failing to include the statement of Colbert's wife that Colbert \u201cdid not have a gun\u201d and \u201cdid not commit any crime\" is also without merit. A bald assertion of innocence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>by a suspect's spouse, without any support or showing that she had personal knowledge of the relevant facts, is not material to the charging decision. <em>Cf. Newman, </em>457 F.3d at 995 (\"Prosecutors generally rely on police reports \u2014 not suspect\u2019s stories \u2014 when deciding</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">whether charges should be filed.... A suspect's account of an incident, by itself, is unlikely to influence a prosecutor\u2019s decision, and thus, it cannot, by itself, serve as evidence that officers interfered with the prosecutor's decision.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
