The government argues that the district court erred in deciding that Mays\u2019s prior Alabama convictions for first-degree possession of marijuana for other than personal use were not \u201cserious drug offense[s],\u201d for purposes of Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d) enhancement. Specifically, the government argues that, pursuant to our unpublished opinion in <em>United States v. Barnes, </em>280 Fed.Appx. 910 (11th Cir.2008) (unpublished), possession of marijuana for other than personal use is a serious drug offense under the ACCA. It further argues that the plain meaning of possession of marijuana \u201cfor other than personal use,\u201d under Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-12-213(a)(l), is possession for someone else\u2019s use. The government contends that the intent to distribute may be inferred from possession of a certain amount of drugs under both <em>United States v. James, </em>430 F.3d 1150, 1154-55 (11th Cir.2005), and <em>United States v. Madera-Madera, </em>333 F.3d 1228, 1232-33 (11th Cir.2003), as well as from possession for other than personal use. Finally, the government argues that Mays cannot invoke the rule of lenity because the Alabama statute is unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a prior conviction is a serious drug offense within the meaning of the ACCA. <em>James, </em>430 F.3d at 1153. Section 922(g) prohibits possession of firearms by any person, who has been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). Section 924 sets forth the penalties for \u00a7 922 violations. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924. If a defendant has three previous convictions for a violent felony or serious drug offense, the defendant must be imprisoned for not less than 15 years (180 months). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). A serious drug offense includes offenses \u201cunder State law, involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance ..., for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-13\">Pursuant to Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-12-213, a person commits the crime of unlawful possession of marijuana in the first degree if: (1) marijuana is possessed for other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>personal use; or (2) marijuana is possessed for personal use after a previous conviction for unlawful possession of marijuana in the second degree or unlawful possession for personal use. Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-12-213. The offense is punished as a Class C felony, with an imprisonment range of not more than ten years, nor less than one year and one day. Ala.Code \u00a7\u00a7 13A-5-6(a)(3), 13A-12-213.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court erred in finding that Mays\u2019s prior convictions for first-degree marijuana possession were not \u201cserious drug offenses\u201d for purposes of the ACCA. As we recently held in <em>United States v. Barnes, supra, </em>possession of marijuana for other than personal use necessarily implies intent to distribute marijuana for someone else\u2019s use. Because this offense categorically involves possession with intent to distribute and is punishable by up to ten years of imprisonment, it is a serious drug offense for purposes of the ACCA. Therefore, we conclude that the district court should have adopted the sentencing guidelines calculation in the pre-sentence report and should have imposed a sentence of at least 180 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Accordingly, we vacate Mays\u2019s sentence and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
