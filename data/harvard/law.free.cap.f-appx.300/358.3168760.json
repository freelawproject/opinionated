McNeill contends that the County failed to reasonably accommodate her alleged disabilities \u2014 namely, her lupus and thrombocytopenia conditions \u2014 and that the County retaliated against her due to those disabilities. Despite these allegations, McNeill fails to demonstrate any substantial limitation in her major life activities, and thus is not \u201cdisabled\u201d for ADA purposes. On that basis, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-16\">The district court set forth the pertinent facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-17\">Plaintiff initially was hired by Defendant Wayne County in 1997, and she resigned later that year. Three years later, in October of 2000, Plaintiff was rehired by the County as an account clerk, and was assigned to work at a jail facility operated by the Wayne County Sheriffs Office. At the time of Plaintiffs rehiring, the County was aware that she had been diagnosed with lupus and thrombocytopenia, and that she was medically restricted from lifting more than 25 pounds. From October of 2000 until June of 2001, Plaintiff was transferred to different work locations within the same jail facility and reassigned to the afternoon shift at her request, but she resigned from her employment on June 4, 2001 when the County informed her that it was unable to accommodate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>her request to work at a location other than a jail facility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-4\">Plaintiff again was rehired as a County employee on January 14, 2002, in the position of juvenile detention specialist at the Wayne County Juvenile Detention Facility. Again, it appears that the County was aware that she suffered from lupus and thrombocytopenia, and that she was restricted from lifting more than 25 pounds. Although Plaintiff worked well at the detention facility, she contends that she was no longer able to remain at this facility after sustaining workplace injuries to her hands and right knee on October 19, 2003. Rather, because the detention center was a \u201cno restrictions\u201d facility, and because the County purportedly refused her requests for placement in a job with the same classification and rate of pay, Plaintiff claims that she had no other choice but to accept a \u201cmedical demotion\u201d to the position of account clerk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">When such a position became available with the Wayne County Clerk\u2019s Office in the Lincoln Hall of Justice, Plaintiff was placed in this position on February 23, 2004, where she remained until after this suit was filed. In late July or August of 2005, she was reassigned to work at the Coleman A. Young Municipal Center.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">Throughout the period of her employment with Wayne County, Plaintiff has filed a number of [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) ] charges, and also has commenced at least two prior suits in Wayne County Circuit Court. The present action followed closely after Plaintiff received a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC dated June 30, 2005, which in turn was based on an EEOC charge that Plaintiff filed on or around May 4, 2005. Since commencing this suit, Plaintiff apparently has filed one or more additional EEOC charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Def's.App. at 247-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>See Jones v. </em>Potter, 488 F.3d 397, 402 (6th Cir.2007). Drawing all inferences in McNeill\u2019s favor, we will affirm where no genuine issue exists as to any material fact and the County is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). The County bears the burden of demonstrating no genuine issue of material fact, but McNeill must \u201cdo more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\u201d <em>Jerman v. Carlisle, McNellie, Rini, Kramer &amp; Ulrich, </em>538 F.3d 469, 472 (6th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Matsushita, </em>475 U.S. at 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e)(2) (providing that the non-moving party \u201cmay not rely merely on allegations ... rather, its response must ... set out specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">Among other elements, recovery under the ADA requires a qualifying disability, defined as \u201c(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more ... major life activities ...; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2); <em>see also Nance v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>527 F.3d 539, 553 (6th Cir.2008) (setting forth the elements required to prevail in a disability discrimination case). The EEOC describes major life activities as including \u201cfunctions such as caring for oneself, per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>forming manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1680.20). To be \u201csubstantially limited\u201d in such activities means that an individual is \u201c[ujnable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform\u201d or is \u201c[significantly restricted as to the condition, manner or duration under which an individual can perform a particular major life activity as compared to ... [an] average person in the general population.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(j)(1). Although the district court agreed that McNeill\u2019s medical records and diagnoses suggested impairments that \u201cdiminished [her] quality of life and restricted her daily activities to some extent,\u201d Def's App. at 259-60, the court concluded that McNeill did not demonstrate ADA disability because she failed to establish that these impairments substantially limit major life activities. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">McNeill raises two specific challenges, both of which prove unavailing. First, she relies on her doctors\u2019 diagnoses to argue that her impairments substantially limit major life activities. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2). In a June 2005 request for accommodation, McNeill\u2019s primary-care physician, Dr. Marc A. Feldman, noted that she suffered physical impairments such as arthralgias, myalgias, fatigue, and thrombocytopenia. But in the same document, Dr. Feldman expressly stated that McNeill\u2019s impairments did not substantially limit any major life activity. JA 207. And although her psychiatrist, Dr. John T. Dziuba, diagnosed her with recurrent depression, he conceded that he was \u201cunclear\u201d as to whether McNeill had a substantially limiting impairment because he saw her \u201cinfrequently\u201d and could not give a \u201ccurrent assessment based on limited contact.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Response, Ex. 21. McNeill also produced a May 2001 letter from Dr. James Leisen that diagnosed her with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and recommended that McNeill not work in \u201can office environment that is cold, damp, and drafty\u201d due to her \u201csensitivity to environmental conditions.\u201d Defs Mot. for Summ. J., Ex. 8. But the letter is similarly silent on whether McNeill\u2019s lupus substantially limits any major life activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Although McNeill attempts to rely on these records of physical impairments, without more, medical diagnoses alone are insufficient to support disability status under the ADA. <em>Toyota Motor Mfg. v. Williams, </em>534 U.S. 184, 198, 122 S.Ct. 681, 151 L.Ed.2d 615 (2002). McNeill presents no concrete evidence that these conditions substantially limit her major life activities. And even were we to assume that her lupus causes sensitivity to environmental conditions that affects her ability to work, McNeill fails to allege or demonstrate that her inability to work in cold or drafty environments precludes her from working \u201ca class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes.\u201d <em>See Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., </em>527 U.S. 471, 491, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 144 L.Ed.2d 450 (1999) (quoting the EEOC\u2019s requirement in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(j)(3)(i) that ADA plaintiffs allege an inability to work in a \u201cbroad class of jobs\u201d if the major life activity at issue is working); <em>Black v. Roadway Express, Inc., </em>297 F.3d 445, 452 (6th Cir.2002) (same). Likewise, despite McNeill\u2019s assertions that her diagnosed impairments \u201cresulted in a loss of appetite, fatigue, joint pain and stiffness, restricted movement in her knee and shoulders, difficulty in sleeping, stress, depression, and an inability to drive, do yard work, or write,\u201d we agree with the district court that those summary claims are \u201cutterly unsupported by any citation whatsoever to evidence in the record.\u201d Def's.App. at 257; <em>see Black, </em>297 F.3d at 454-55 (concluding that an ADA plaintiff failed to demonstrate substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>limitation in major life activities where the plaintiff merely presented conclusory affidavits and reports and internal contradictions existed in the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Second, McNeill contends that her eligibility for Social Security disability insurance (\u201cSSDI\u201d) from 1996 through 2000 constitutes a \u201crecord\u201d of a substantially limiting impairment for ADA purposes. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2). But the EEOC emphasizes that \u201c[t]he fact that an individual has a record of ... disability retirement, or is classified as disabled for other purposes does not guarantee that the individual will satisfy the [ADA] definition of \u2018disability.\u2019\u201d 29 C.F.R. app. \u00a7 1630.2(k). This court recently noted, moreover, that \u201ca disability determination by the Social Security Administration, even if substantiated, would not be controlling [for a determination of ADA disability].\u201d <em>Thornton v. Federal Express Corp., </em>530 F.3d 451, 455 (6th Cir.2008); <em>see also Lloyd v. Washington &amp; Jefferson College, </em>288 Fed.Appx. 786, 788 n. 1 (3d Cir.2008) (rejecting a contention that the \u201creceipt of SSA benefits qualifies as a \u2018record of impairment\u2019 because the SSA\u2019s definition of disability differs from the ADA\u2019s definition of disability\u201d); <em>Horwitz v. L. &amp; J.G. Stickley, Inc., </em>20 Fed.Appx. 76, 80-81 (2d Cir.2001) (same). Remarking on this distinction, the Supreme Court compared the two procedures for determining disability and concluded that an individual qualifying for SSDI could fail to be substantially limited in performing major life activities under the ADA. <em>Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. Corp. </em>526 U.S. 795, 803-04, 119 S.Ct. 1597, 143 L.Ed.2d 966 (1999). The <em>Cleveland </em>Court also refused to find the SSA and ADA designations of disability equivalent because the SSA\u2019s procedure for administering SSDI involves a variety of presumptions, including a list of automatically qualifying impairments. <em>Cleveland, </em>526 U.S. at 804, 119 S.Ct. 1597. These administrative rules are qualitatively distinct from the ADA\u2019s \u201cmore fact-intensive inquiry.\u201d <em>Horwitz, </em>20 Fed.Appx. at 81. McNeill makes no effort to distinguish the precedent against her, so we reject her argument that a record of SSDI benefits controls our determination of ADA disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Because neither doctors\u2019 diagnoses nor SSDI benefits suffice to demonstrate that McNeill\u2019s impairments substantially limit her major life activities, McNeill\u2019s conditions are not qualifying disabilities under the ADA. The district court properly granted summary judgment for the County on McNeill\u2019s ADA claims, and likewise properly declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims. <em>See Peters v. Fair, </em>427 F.3d 1035, 1038 (6th Cir.2005) (applying the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard in concluding that the district court need not exercise supplemental jurisdiction over pendent state-law claims where the court dismissed the federal claims). We affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b385-13\">. McNeill named as additional defendants Wayne County Executive Robert A. Ficano, the Wayne County Sheriff's Office, and Wayne County Sheriff Warren C. Evans. The district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment for the County dismissed the Wayne County Sheriff's Office as a party because it is not a legal entity subject to suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
