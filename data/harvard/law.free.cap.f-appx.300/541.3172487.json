Roth, Senior United States Circuit Judge for the Third Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b568-19\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-20\">This case arises from allegedly fraudulent statements regarding the \u201cnetwork costs per subscriber per month\u201d of Freei Networks, Inc., a provider of free internet access and related services. Robert Pack alleges that defendants McCausland, Menninger and Stevens told him that Freei\u2019s costs per subscriber per month were $1.50 when, in fact, they were $5.00. As a result, Pack invested $1.5 million in Freei which he lost when Freei filed for bank<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>ruptcy. Pack appeals from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Stevens<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the denial of a request to amend his complaint to allege misrepresentations made in 1999. We affirm in part and vacate in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">We review summary judgment <em>de novo. DuBois v. Ass\u2019n of Apartment Owners of 2987 Kalakaua, </em>458 F.3d 1175, 1178 (9th Cir.2006). In his brief opposing summary judgment, Pack conceded that his claims against Stevens were based solely on misrepresentations made in 1999 while the claims in the operative complaint were limited to misrepresentations made in 2000. On appeal, Pack argues that his concession was a mistake and that the court erred by not considering a number of alternate theories of liability. These alternate theories were not presented to the district court, however, and we generally will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Bolker v. Comm\u2019r, </em>760 F.2d 1039, 1042 (9th Cir.1985). Since Pack told the district court that his claims, as alleged, were unsupported, we hold him to that representation and affirm the district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Denial of leave to amend is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Lockheed Martin Corp. v. Network Solutions, Inc., </em>194 F.3d 980, 986 (9th Cir.1999). Upon conceding that Pack\u2019s claims against Stevens were based on misrepresentations made in 1999 rather than 2000, Pack asserted that he would \u201cmove to amend ... to conform to proof.\u201d The district court preemptively denied Pack\u2019s request on the grounds that Pack had unduly delayed and acted in bad faith and that any amendment would prejudice Stevens. On reconsideration, the district court denied the amendment on the basis that, since Pack had alleged claims based on the 1999 misrepresentations in earlier iterations of his complaint but had omitted them from the most recent version, Pack was <em>\u201cprocedurally </em>barred from amending ... even in the absence of bad faith, undue delay or prejudice to defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">This ruling was in error. It was a clearly erroneous application of the law and thus an abuse of discretion. <em>Alaska Limestone Corp. v. Hodel, </em>799 F.2d 1409, 1411 (9th Cir.1986). We have held that, on appeal, the scope of our review is limited to the allegations in the most recent complaint filed. <em>King v. Atiyeh, </em>814 F.2d 565, 567 (9th Cir.1987); <em>Bullen v. De Bretteville, </em>239 F.2d 824, 833 (9th Cir.1956). Since \u201can amended pleading supersedes the original, the latter being treated thereafter as non-existent,\u201d a defeated plaintiff who has amended his complaint cannot argue on appeal that the district court erred in its ruling on the original complaint. <em>See Bullen, </em>239 F.2d at 833. We have never held, however, that, at the district court level, a plaintiff who omits previously dismissed claims from an amended complaint waives his right to re-allege these claims in <em>further amendments.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">We note, moreover, that the 1999 representations had been dismissed without prejudice from the earlier iteration of Pack\u2019s complaint with the district court\u2019s warning that Pack \u201cmay not reallege the falsity of any ... statements of pre-Febru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>ary 2000 network costs without specific factual allegations which describe in detail why the statements are false and why knowledge of falsity can be imputed to the defendants.\u201d Discovery taken shortly before summary judgment motions were filed uncovered the basis for such \u201cspecific factual allegations.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, the findings of bad faith, undue delay, and prejudice were unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">On remand, the district court should permit Pack to amend his complaint to re-allege claims against Stevens based on the 1999 misrepresentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">\u25a0 For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED in part and VACATED in part and this case is REMANDED to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b568-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.

In fact, as has been pointed out by the district court of Connecticut, such a rule would be inconsistent with the standard practice of courts in this Circuit. <em>See Haddock v. Nationwide Fin.
