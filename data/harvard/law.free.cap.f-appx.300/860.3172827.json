We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-23\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b886-24\">Johnson, an Illinois private citizen, filed a <em>pro se </em>civil complaint against the Financial Management Service of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (\u201cTreasury\u201d) in which she alleged that Treasury deducted money from her federal disability benefits in violation of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3711(a) and 3716. Rl-1 at 2-3. Johnson stated that since 2004 she had been making payments to the Illinois Department of Human Services (\u201cIDHS\u201d) to pay off an outstanding \u201cdisputed\u201d debt she owed the IDHS. <em>Id. </em>at 2, 4. Johnson claimed that although she informed the IDHS in October and November 2007 that she had incurred emer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>gency medical expenses that prevented her from making further payments, Treasury nevertheless withheld \u201cover $200.00\u201d from her monthly federal disability check to satisfy the IDHS debt, causing her extreme financial hardship. <em>Id. </em>at 2-3. Johnson requested injunctive relief directing the Treasury to (1) cease all unlawful collections of the disputed debt, (2) act lawfully in the collection of the disputed debt, and (3) return all monies unlawfully deducted from her disability benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">When Treasury failed to timely respond to the complaint, Johnson moved for default judgment, alleging that Treasury\u2019s withholding of her federal benefits was unlawful and violated her right to due process under the Illinois Constitution and Illinois statutory law. Rl-9 at 1-3. Johnson further claimed that Treasury\u2019s actions amounted to intentional infliction of emotional distress and demanded actual damages in the amount withheld from her disability benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Treasury responded, arguing that a default judgment was inappropriate and moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim for relief, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Rl-12 at 3, 5; Rl-13. In support of its motion to dismiss, Treasury contended that it was named as a defendant only because it operated the Treasury Offset Program (\u201cTOP\u201d), a centralized debt collection program used by federal and state agencies to collect delinquent non-tax debts. Rl-14 at 4. Treasury asserted that it has no independent authority to determine whether a debt is valid or whether a federal payment should be offset and is required to implement the offset once a debt is properly certified by the creditor agency. <em>Id. </em>at 5-6. Treasury further asserted that because the agencies themselves are the parties responsible for affording due process to their debtors, Johnson\u2019s request for relief was more properly addressed to IDHS, which established the debt and referred it to Treasury for collection. <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">The district court denied Johnson\u2019s motion for a default judgment and granted Treasury\u2019s motion to dismiss. <em>See </em>Rl-17 at 1-2. Construing Johnson\u2019s complaint liberally, the court found that Johnson should have sought relief against IDHS and not Treasury, that her allegations against Treasury were \u201cdevoid of colorable merit,\u201d and that her complaint was fraught with \u201cother insurmountable shortcomings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1-2. The court concluded that the complaint failed to state a claim against Treasury and \u201ccould not be amended to do so.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 2. Johnson now appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">On appeal, Johnson contends that: (1) she was denied due process under the Illinois Constitution; (2) Treasury was aware of IDHS\u2019s \u201cunlawful discriminatory collection practices\u201d and had the \u201csole responsibility\u201d not to intentionally disregard the deprivations of which it was aware; (3) Treasury\u2019s actions violated the state-immunity provision of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12202, as well as regulations codified at 28 C.F.R. Part 35 regarding disability discrimination in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>state and local government services; and (4) Treasury\u2019s refusal to act on the information she provided to it constituted intentional infliction of emotional distress and was racist and discriminatory.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Arthur v. King, </em>500 F.3d 1335, 1339 (11th Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 660, 169 L.Ed.2d 511 (2007). Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is appropriate \u201conly when the movant demonstrates beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Spain v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Carp., </em>363 F.3d 1183, 1187 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">\u201cThe practice of withholding federal payment in satisfaction of a debt is known as an administrative offset.\u201d <em>Reeves v. Astrue, </em>526 F.3d 732, 738 n. 3 (11th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. Aug. 1, 2008) (No. 08-5605). The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1982, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3701 <em>et seq., </em>authorizes the Treasury Department \u201cto collect non-tax debts by withholding funds paid out by other federal agencies.\u201d <em>Reeves, </em>526 F.3d at 738 n. 3; <em>see </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3716(a); 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 285.5. Pursuant to the TOP, any federal agency with a claim against the debtor, after notifying the debtor that the debt is subject to administrative offset and providing an opportunity to dispute the debt or make arrangements to pay it, may collect the debt by administrative offset. <em>See </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3716(a), (c)(6). In order to do so, the creditor agency must certify to Treasury that the debt is eligible for collection by offset<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that all due process protections have been met. <em>See </em>31 C.F.R. \u00a7 285.5(d)(3)(ii), (d)(6). If properly certified, the Treasury Department must administratively offset the debt. <em>See </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3716(c)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-11\">Although Johnson named Treasury as the sole defendant, the allegations in her complaint focused primarily on alleged wrongdoing by IDHS in its efforts to collect a \u201cdisputed\u201d debt. The essence of Johnson\u2019s complaint was that Treasury acted illegally by withholding a portion of her disability benefits, despite her having notified the IDHS that she encountered emergency medical expenses that left her unable to pay her underlying debt. Treasury, however, had no statutory authority over the debt, nor any role in determining whether or not the debt was valid or whether Johnson\u2019s benefit payment should be offset. Rather, once the IDHS certified the debt to Treasury, Treasury was legally obligated to offset Johnson\u2019s disability payment in satisfaction of the debt. <em>See </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3716(c)(1)(A); 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 285.5(d)(6). Further, it is the creditor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>agency, not the disbursing agency, that is required to ensure that the debtor receives due process under the law. <em>See </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3716(a). Because relief against Treasury would be improper in this case, the district court correctly dismissed Johnson\u2019s complaint without prejudice for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">Johnson appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of her complaint without prejudice under Rule 12(b)(6). Because Johnson\u2019s complaint against Treasury failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b887-7\">. In rendering its decision, the district court first concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the complaint. Although it found alternatively that the complaint failed to state a claim for relief, we note that jurisdiction was proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 because at least some of Johnson\u2019s claims presented questions of federal law. <em>See Butero v. Royal Maccabees Life Ins. Co., </em>174 F.3d 1207, 1212 (11th Cir.1999) (\u2018\u2018[A] cause of action arises under federal law only when the plaintiff's well-pleaded complaint raises issues of federal law.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b888-8\">. Johnson also argues that Treasury (1) intentionally and maliciously violated the Debt Collection Improvement Act; (2) violated the procedures of 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.18 (governing recapture of food-stamp overpayments); and (3) violated 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3718 (allowing federal agencies to enter contracts for debt-collection services). Because she raises these claims for the first time in her reply brief, we decline to address them. <em>See Big Top Koolers, Inc. v. Circus-Man Snacks, Inc., </em>528 F.3d 839, 844 (11th Cir.2008) (\"We decline to address an argument advanced by an appellant for the first time in a reply brief.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b888-14\">. To be eligible for collection by administrative offset, a debt submitted to Treasury must be: (1) past-due in the amount stated by the creditor agency; (2) legally enforceable; (3) less than ten years delinquent, unless the debt legally may be offset if more than ten years delinquent; (4) more than $25; and (5) not secured by collateral subject to a pending foreclosure action. <em>See </em>31 C.F.R. \u00a7 285.5(d)(3)(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
