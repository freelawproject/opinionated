Pardo argues that the district court erred by imposing an upward variance from the guidelines sentencing range of 30-37 months of imprisonment without calculating a departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. He contends that this was procedurally unreasonable. Pardo also asserts that the sentence imposed was substantively unreasonable because the district did not calculate the correct guidelines range, given the omission of the \u00a7 4A1.3 departure; too much weight was given to his prior DWI offense and the perception that he had received a light sentence for it, as well as for his prior theft offenses; and, consequently, the district court erred in balancing the sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-20\">Because the district court imposed a sentence variance, rather than a departure, \u00a7 4A1.3 was inapplicable. <em>See United States v. Mejia-Huerta, </em>480 F.3d 713, 723 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2954, 171 L.Ed.2d 884 (2008). As in <em>Mejia-Huerta, </em>480 F.3d at 723, the district court\u2019s decision to impose a variance was not based solely on the underrepresentation of Pardo\u2019s criminal history. Rather, the district court pointed to Pardo\u2019s recidivism; the need to deter him and to protect the public, as well as to promote respect for the law; the nature and characteristics of the offense; and Pardo\u2019s history and characteristics. These findings are supported by the record, and there is no indication that the district court\u2019s decision was based disproportionately on Pardo\u2019s prior DWI offense. Thus, Pardo has not shown that the sentence imposed was unreasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-25\">Pardo argues that the district court erred under Fed.R.Crim.P. 32 and <em>Bums </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number><em>v. United States, </em>501 U.S. 129, 111 S.Ct. 2182, 115 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991), by not providing advance notice of its consideration of a sentence variance. He concedes that this issue is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Mejia-Huerta, </em>480 F.3d at 723. Additionally, the Supreme Court recently confirmed that such notice is not required. <em>Irizarry v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 2198, 2202-04, 171 L.Ed.2d 28 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Pardo challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b303-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
