He was sentenced to a total of life imprisonment and 60 months, set to run consecutively, and now challenges several aspects of his trial and conviction. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">On June 27, 2007, following a jury trial, William Brent was found guilty on five counts: (1) one count of possession of 50 grams or more of a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine base with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)(iii); (2) one count of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c); and (3) three counts of possession of a firearm by a felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) and \u00a7 924(e)(1). The evidence at trial focused on three dates: April 15, 2005, April 30, 2005, and September 7, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">On April 15, 2005, during the execution of a search warrant, Brent was arrested while fleeing a Dallas residence used to distribute cocaine. Conducting a search incident to arrest, officers found two firearms in his possession. The officers asked Brent for his name, date of birth and other biometric information. They also asked him why he did not attempt to use the firearms against them. Brent replied that he knew he was outnumbered and the odds were not in his favor for a shoot-out. Brent then went on to claim ownership for \u201ceverything in the house.\u201d He was handcuffed, placed in a squad car, and driven back to the residence. While in the squad car, Brent again told officers that \u201call the drugs and guns in the house are mine.\u201d He asked to speak with the chief investigating officer, Daniel Kaase, and told him that the rest of the individuals being arrested in the raid \u201chad nothing to do with this\u201d and again claimed ownership of the drugs and guns on the premises. Brent was not given a <em>Miranda </em>warning. A search of the residence uncovered several guns, drugs \u2014 including 279 grams of cocaine base and one pound of marijuana\u2014 and drug-related paraphernalia. Officers intended to interview Brent but he was inexplicably released on bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-16\">On April 30, 2005, Brent was stopped for a traffic violation. During the stop, the officer on the scene seized a loaded firearm and a bag of marijuana. The officer performed a background check and found that there was a warrant out for Brent\u2019s arrest. Brent was arrested. It is again inexplicable as to why he was subsequently released.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-17\">On September 7, 2005, pursuant to a federal arrest warrant, officers arrested Brent at a Dallas residence. After his arrest, Brent made several incriminating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>statements. He claimed that the marijuana and gun found in the possession of another individual on the scene belonged to him. He also stated that: (1) he should have stayed in Mexico with a drug cartel where he rode around in bulletproof cars; (2) if anyone had tried to arrest him in Mexico, that person would have been killed; (3) his arrest would resolve a lot of murders because he had killed a number of people; (4) if his arrest was the result of a snitch, that person would be killed; and (5) he wished he had been arrested later so he could have killed more of his enemies. He was not given a <em>Miranda </em>warning. Officer Kaase arrived on the scene and asked Brent if anything in the residence could hurt the officers who were yet to conduct a search. Brent informed him that there was a firearm under the mattress. A search of the residence produced the gun Brent had described. Brent was finally detained.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">In October of 2006, Brent entered a plea agreement which was later withdrawn based on a miscalculation of the applicable sentencing guideline range. Defense counsel then submitted several motions to suppress evidence and dismiss charges. Brent argued that the felon in possession of a firearm charge should be dismissed because the underlying statute is unconstitutional and Brent did not know he was a felon or that his actions affected interstate commerce. He also sought to suppress the incriminating statements made on April 15 and September 7, and moved to suppress the evidence seized during the April 30 traffic stop. All motions were denied. With the exception of the motion based on the traffic stop, Brent appeals all rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">During <em>voir dire, </em>the government struck one juror whose exclusion the defense now appeals. Brent objected to the government\u2019s peremptory strike but did not challenge the prosecution\u2019s race-neutral explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">At trial, the government introduced evidence establishing that all of the firearms seized in connection with Brent were functioning as designed and were manufactured outside Texas. The prosecution did not introduce Brent\u2019s statement that he would have attempted to shoot the officers on April 15 if he had not been outnumbered. The government also did not introduce Brent\u2019s statements that he should have remained in Mexico, that several murders would be solved by his detention, and that whoever informed on his location would be killed. These statements were introduced at sentencing which Brent now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">At the close of the prosecution\u2019s evidence, the defense moved for acquittal on all charges pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29. The motion was denied and is now appealed, along with the verdict and sentence. The district court imposed a sentence of life imprisonment plus 60 months, to run consecutively. This sentence was also to run consecutively to any sentence imposed on six charges pending in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">In total, Brent appeals on eight grounds, arguing that the district court erred in: (1) denying his motion to suppress incriminating statements resulting from the functional equivalent of a custodial interrogation; (2) allowing the government to introduce statements resulting from <em>Miranda </em>violations at sentencing; (3) finding that the government offered an adequate race-neutral explanation for striking a juror; (4) denying his Rule 29 motion that there was no nexus between the firearms and interstate commerce; (5) allowing an unavailable witness\u2019s testimony to be introduced at sentencing; (6) sentencing him to life imprisonment; (7) failing to take into account the factors of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) at sentencing; and (8) running his sentence consecutively to unimposed sentences from other jurisdictions. Brent concedes that his fourth, fifth and eighth claims of error are foreclosed by circuit precedent but urges this court to revisit its prior holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">For the reasons discussed below, Brent\u2019s claims fail. We affirm the district court on all grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s findings of fact supporting the denial of a motion to suppress under a clearly erroneous standard and review the district court\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Williams, </em>365 F.3d 399, 403 (5th Cir.2004). Because challenges to constitutional violations are assertions that the district court erred in its legal conclusions, these are reviewed <em>de novo. </em>Challenges to a district court\u2019s determination of race-neutral explanations given by an attorney regarding peremptory challenges are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>393 F.3d 540, 544 (5th Cir.2004). The reasonableness of a sentence is reviewed under the abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>517 F.3d 801, 807-808 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Therefore, claims one, two, four, five, and six receive <em>de novo </em>review. Brent\u2019s third claim is reviewed for clear error. Claims seven and eight are reviewed for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">A. Motion to Suppress Incriminating Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">Brent argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the incriminating statements of March 15 and September 7. He asserts that the officers\u2019 actions in placing him in the back of the squad car, on both dates, was the equivalent of a custodial interrogation. Citing <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980), Brent states that the officers \u201cknew or should have known that returning Brent to the house to see his friends get arrested was \u2018reasonably likely to evoke an incriminating response\u2019 from him.\u201d The government concedes that Brent was in custody for <em>Miranda </em>purposes but argues that there was no interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-13\">Brent\u2019s arguments are without merit. The Fifth Amendment protects a defendant from self-incrimination and prohibits the prosecution from using statements \u201cstemming from custodial interrogation ... unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Nevertheless, \u201c[vjolunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment\u201d and do not implicate any <em>Miranda </em>considerations. <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 300,100 S.Ct. 1682 (quotation omitted). <em>Innis </em>specifically states that <em>Miranda </em>concerns are not triggered when officers merely take actions \u201cnormally attendant to arrest and custody.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301,100 S.Ct. 1682.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-14\">Brent\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights came into play when, on April 15th, officers asked him why he did not use his weapons to shoot them. Even if we assume <em>arguendo </em>that this sole question violated Brent\u2019s Fifth Amendment protections, this statement was never introduced at trial. Thus, any <em>Miranda </em>violation was remedied by its exclusion \u2014 precisely the Constitutional protection required. Brent does not point to a single other question asked by police that may have amounted to a custodial interrogation. Instead, Brent argues that he was psychologically coerced by police actions, establishing the functional equiva<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>lent of interrogation. Being placed in hand-cuffs and held in a squad car cannot amount to the functional equivalent of interrogation. No court has ever held that seeing others implicated in a crime being arrested amounts to psychological coercion. Even if we accept Brent\u2019s argument that the sight of his friends being arrested placed Brent under psychological coercion, <em>Miranda </em>protections are only violated when officers <em>should have known </em>their actions would produce an incriminating response. Officers cannot be held to anticipate the unique psychological and subjective factors affecting each potential defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Because Brent\u2019s incriminating statements did not result from custodial interrogation or the functional equivalent thereof, the district court did not err in denying his motion to suppress these statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">B. Incriminating Statements Introduced At Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Brent renews his arguments from the first claim of error to assert that, for the same reasons presented above, the district court erred in considering his incriminating statements during sentencing. A review of the record reveals that the district court clearly stated that, even without Brent\u2019s own incriminating statements, life imprisonment was appropriate given his history as a violent career offender. Thus, even if any \u2014 or all \u2014 incriminating statements made by Brent during his arrests were erroneously admitted at sentencing, it was harmless and the conviction stands.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">C. Government\u2019s Explanation for Striking a Juror</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Brent argues that the district court erred in accepting the government\u2019s nondiscriminatory reason for striking a minority juror and that his rights under <em>Batson </em>were thereby violated. <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 89, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986) (holding that the Equal Protection Clause forbids the prosecution from challenging potential jurors solely on the basis of race or assumptions drawn from their race). Brent asserts that, while the court had a colloquy with the government regarding its reasons for striking each minority juror and found that the reasons were neutral, because the prosecution cited facial expressions and the district court did not make a specific finding on juror demeanor, its determination cannot be afforded deference. The government responds that it provided a race-neutral explanation which was acceptable to the court, and that Brent did not object to the government\u2019s race-neutral reason and has therefore waived this issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">This court has consistently held that \u201cwe must give great deference to the district court because findings in this context largely turn on an evaluation of the credibility or demeanor of the attorney who exercises the peremptory challenge.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>393 F.3d at 544 (alteration and internal quotations omitted). The district court may only be reversed for clear error. <em>Id. </em>Further, where the defense fails to object to the prosecution\u2019s offered reasons for a peremptory challenge, he appears to acquiesce in them and waives his right to object on appeal. <em>United States v. Arce, </em>997 F.2d 1123,1127 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">Brent\u2019s assertion of error fails. The record shows that Brent made no objection to the government\u2019s demeanor explanation. Brent waived this issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">D. Rule 29 Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b298-13\">Brent argues that the district court erred in denying his Rule 29 motion for acquittal because proof that a firearm crossed state lines is insufficient to estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>lish the required jurisdictional nexus to interstate commerce under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Conceding that circuit precedent forecloses this argument, Brent urges reconsideration based on <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995). Brent\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">For a conviction under \u00a7 922(g)(1), the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that: \u201c(1) that the defendant previously had been convicted of a felony; (2) that he possessed a firearm; and (3) that the firearm traveled in or affected interstate commerce.\u201d <em>United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 515 (5th Cir. 2001) (quotation omitted). Brent does not dispute the first two elements but argues that this circuit\u2019s precedent should be reversed as to the proof required on the third.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">We have consistently held that, where the government proves beyond a reasonable doubt that a firearm has traveled through interstate commerce before coming into the defendant\u2019s possession, the interstate commerce nexus is satisfied. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Guidry, </em>406 F.3d 314, 318 (5th Cir.2005) (\u201cThe interstate commerce element of a \u00a7 922(g)(1) charge is satisfied where the government demonstrates that the firearm was manufactured out of state.\u201d); <em>Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d at 518. We have upheld the constitutionality and proof requirements of \u00a7 922(g)(1) after the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Lopez </em>decision. <em>See Guidry, </em>406 F.3d at 318-19 (noting that the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g)(1) is foreclosed by prior precedent). We have stated that, \u201cneither the holding in <em>Lopez </em>nor the reasons given therefor constitutionally invalidate \u00a7 922(g)(1).\u201d <em>United States v. Rawls, </em>85 F.3d 240, 242 (5th Cir.1996). The district court did not err in denying Brent\u2019s Rule 29 motion for acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">E. Unavailable Witness Testimony at Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">Brent asserts that the district court erred in allowing evidence from an unavailable witness, implicating Brent in several murders, to be introduced at sentencing. Brent argues that circuit precedent should be reversed to afford defendants the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses at every stage of their case, including sentencing. Conceding that his argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent, Brent raises the issue to preserve it for future review. Brent\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-13\">Defendants have no Confrontation Clause right at sentencing. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>484 F.3d 762, 776 (5th Cir. 2007). The district court specifically found the hearsay evidence introduced at sentencing to be reliable and corroborated by eyewitness reports, evidence found in Brent\u2019s possession, and Brent\u2019s own statements. The district court did not err in allowing an unavailable witness\u2019s testimony at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-14\">F. Life Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b299-15\">Brent argues that the district court erred in imposing a life sentence. While the jury found Brent guilty on all five counts for which he was tried, placing him within the guidelines range for a life sentence, he argues that the district court should not have heard additional evidence at sentencing. This argument is a revival of his challenge to the evidence in the fifth ground for error. More generally, Brent asserts that a life sentence is unreasonable for drug and weapons charges.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Brent\u2019s arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>This circuit has held that, <em>\u201cBooker </em>contemplates that, with the mandatory use of the Guidelines excised, the Sixth Amendment will not impede a sentencing judge from finding all facts relevant to sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). A judge is given wide discretion with respect to the evidence that he may consider in imposing a sentence. The district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">G. Section 3553(a) Sentencing Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Brent argues that the district court\u2019s sentence should be reversed because the court did not specifically mention the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the sentencing determination. Brent maintains that the district court should have deviated below the guidelines range in imposing a sentence. The government argues that the district court\u2019s failure to list the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is of no moment because the court actually evaluated Brent\u2019s history and violence, which is precisely what \u00a7 3553(a) requires. Brent\u2019s arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">We have held that, \u201c \u2018[i]f the sentencing judge exercises [his] discretion to impose a sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range, in our reasonableness review we will infer that the judge has considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519). Thus, a court that fails to explicitly discuss the \u00a7 3553(a) factors may still be affirmed if the sentence is within the guidelines range and reasonable. Our precedent makes it clear that \u201c[a] checklist recitation of the section 3553(a) factors is neither necessary nor sufficient for a sentence to be reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006). We review the sentencing record for reasonableness. The record reveals that the district court discussed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court considered evidence regarding Brent\u2019s lengthy criminal career of violence and drugs, heard testimony of Brent\u2019s involvement in. five murders, and was presented with Brent\u2019s own incriminating statements. The sentence imposed by the district court was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">H. Consecutive sentences</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">Finally, Brent challenges the district court\u2019s determination to run his sentence consecutively with unimposed state sentences in order to preserve the issue on appeal. He does, however, recognize that this issue is foreclosed by our opinion in <em>United States v. Brown, </em>920 F.2d 1212 (5th Cir.1991), <em>abrogated by, United States v. Candia, </em>454 F.3d 468, 473 (5th Cir.2006). Brent\u2019s arguments are not availing.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">As we made clear in <em>Candia, </em>under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), both the sentence itself and its consecutive nature are reviewed for reasonableness. 454 F.3d at 472-73. \u201cWhere ... the term of imprisonment and the consecutiveness of that sentence were each imposed by proper interpretation and calculation of applicable guidelines provisions, the consecutiveness of the sentence enjoys a presumption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>reasonableness similar to that applied to a \u25a0within-guidelines term of imprisonment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 479. As discussed above, the district court evaluated Brent\u2019s extensive criminal record, his own admissions of guilt and the corroborated evidence of Brent\u2019s participation in five murders. Because we review a district court\u2019s imposition of sentence for reasonableness and Brent offers no arguments to reverse our precedent, the district court\u2019s sentencing determination is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b295-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
