Vela was sentenced at the top of his advisory sentencing guidelines range to a 57-month term of imprisonment. He contends in light of his personal circumstances and the circumstances surrounding his offense that his sentence is unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>548 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review a district court\u2019s sentencing decisions for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). First, we consider whether the sentence imposed is procedurally sound. <em>Id. </em>at 597. Thereafter, we consider whether the sentence is substantively reasonable, using an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Id. </em>A sentence imposed within a properly calculated guideline range is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Citing the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 558, 575, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2463, Vela argues that the within guidelines sentence imposed in his case should not be accorded a presumption of reasonableness. Vela contends that the justification for applying a presumption of reasonableness in his case is undercut because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b), the Guideline used to calculate his advisory sentencing guidelines range, was not promulgated according to usual Sentencing Commission procedures and did not take into account \u201cempirical data and national experience.\u201d He portrays the <em>Kimbrough </em>decision as having \u201csuggested\u201d that the appellate presumption should not be applied to Guidelines that did not take account of this data and experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">Our reading of <em>Kimbrough </em>does not reveal any such suggestion. The question presented in <em>Kimbrough </em>was whether a sentence \u201coutside the guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses.\u201d 128 S.Ct. at 564. Speaking specifically to the crack cocaine Guidelines, the Court simply ruled that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary1 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575. In <em>Kimbrough, </em>the Court said nothing of the applicability of the presumption of reasonableness. Moreover, the appellate presumption\u2019s continued applicability to \u00a7 2L1.2 sentences is supported by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338-39 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008), which involved a similar challenge to \u00a7 2L1.2. The appellate presumption is therefore applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-14\">Vela argues that the sentence imposed by the district court is greater than necessary to satisfy the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. He contends that the Guidelines range overstates the seriousness of his criminal history and the seriousness of his unlawful entry offense. He also asserts that his motive for reentering the United States mitigates the seriousness of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-15\">The district court sentenced Vela to 57 months, a sentence at the top of the sentencing guidelines range. The totality of the circumstances in Vela\u2019s case, considered in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, supports the sentence the district court judge imposed. The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in imposing a sentence within the advisory guideline range. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-16\">Finally, Vela contends that his sentencing range is excessive because the lack of a \u201cfast-track\u201d program in the Western District of Texas results in a disparity between sentences imposed in that district and sentences imposed in districts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>have such programs. As Vela concedes, his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 559-64 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for </em>cert. <em>filed </em>(U.S. July 2, 2008) (No. 08-5226). <em>See also United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 808 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. July 25, 2008) (No. 08-5514) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b330-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
