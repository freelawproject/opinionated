Carson applied for disability insurance benefits based on pain and impairment of his right knee, which stemmed from an injury he suffered in 1995.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-19\">In his brief on appeal, Carson argues that the district court\u2019s judgment should be reversed, and the case remanded to the Commissioner with instructions that he be afforded benefits, because the evidence clearly established that he was disabled because he could not work eight hours per day performing light or sedentary work. Alternatively, he argues that the case should be remanded to the Commissioner because the ALJ improperly discounted the opinion of his treating physician, Dr. John McCaulie, regarding his physical capacities and level of pain.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-20\">A claimant is eligible for disability benefits when he demonstrates disability on or before the last date for which he was insured. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(a)(1)(A). Here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>because Carson was last insured on June 30, 1999, he needed to establish disability on or prior to that date. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the legal principles that underlie the Commissioner\u2019s decision in Social Security cases. <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). The question we must answer is whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>The substantial evidence test requires that the decision be based on \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThis limited review precludes deciding the facts anew, making credibility determinations, or re-weighing the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Bloodsworth v. Heckler, </em>703 F.2d 1233, 1239 (11th Cir.1983)). With these principles in mind, we turn to Carson\u2019s arguments \u2014 in reverse order.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">The ALJ must give the opinion of a treating physician \u201csubstantial or considerable weight unless \u2018good cause\u2019 is shown to the contrary.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir.1997); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2). \u201c \u2018[G]ood cause\u2019 exists when the: (1) treating physician\u2019s opinion was not bolstered by the evidence; (2) evidence supported a contrary finding; or (3) treating physician\u2019s opinion was conclusory or inconsistent with the doctor\u2019s own medical records.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1240-41 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cThe ALJ must clearly articulate the reasons for giving less weight to the opinion of a treating physician, and the failure to do so is reversible error.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>125 F.3d at 1440. Where the ALJ articulated specific reasons for failing to give the opinion of a treating physician controlling weight, and those reasons are supported by substantial evidence, we do not disturb the ALJ\u2019s refusal to give the opinion controlling weight. <em>Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1212. While statements from treating physicians regarding the level of work a claimant can perform are important, they are not determinative because the ALJ has the ultimate responsibility to assess a claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d). <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1513(c), 404.1527, 404.1545, 404.1546(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-15\">In this case we conclude that substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s decision to discount the opinion of Dr. McCaulie regarding Carson\u2019s RFC because the evidence, taken as a whole, did not bolster his opinion; rather, it supported a contrary finding. Dr. McCaulie opined that Carson: (1) could sit and work no more than one hour during a workday; (2) could stand no more than one hour during a workday; and (3) experienced \u201cmarked pain,\u201d about six or seven on a ten point scale, which would prevent him from completing tasks at work without frequent breaks or interruptions. Other evidence, however, including opinions from other treating physicians, state agency medical consultant reports, and Carson\u2019s own statements, contradicted Dr. McCaulie\u2019s opinion. Because the evidence failed to support Dr. McCaulie\u2019s opinion, and, indeed, supported a contrary finding, the ALJ had good cause to discount his opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-17\">A disability insurance benefits (\u201cDIB\u201d) claimant must demonstrate disability on or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>before the date for which he was last insured. <em>Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1211; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(a)(1)(A). Social Security regulations establish a five-step evaluation process, used to determine disability for DIB claims, that \u201cplacets] a very heavy burden on the claimant to demonstrate both a qualifying disability and an inability to perform past relevant work.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1211; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Under the five-stop process, even if a claimant\u2019s impairment is severe and prevents him from doing his past relevant work, he is not considered disabled if he retains the RFC to make an adjustment to other work. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4). An RFC assessment is based upon all of the relevant evidence and measures a claimant\u2019s ability to do work despite his impairments. <em>See Lewis, </em>125 F.3d at 1440. The ALJ makes this determination by considering the claimant\u2019s ability to lift weight, sit, stand, push, pull, etc. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545(b). Relevant evidence regarding a claimant\u2019s RFC may include medical reports and assessments by state agency medical consultants. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1513(a), (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">To determine the physical exertion requirements of work in the national economy, jobs are classified as sedentary, light, medium, heavy, and very heavy. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567. Sedentary work involves lifting no more than ten pounds at a time, with periods of standing or walking generally totaling no more than two hours in an eight hour workday, and sitting totaling approximately six hours in an eight hour workday. <em>See Kelley v. Apfel, </em>185 F.3d 1211,1213 n. 2 (11th Cir.1999). Light work involves lifting no more than 20 pounds at a time and frequently lifting objects weighing up to 10 pounds, as well as a good deal or walking or standing, or sitting with some pushing and pulling of arm or leg controls. <em>See Walker v. Bowen, </em>826 F.2d 996, 1000 (11th Cir.1987); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.967(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">The Commissioner has found that a claimant retains the RFC to adjust to other work only if he can do so on a \u201cregular and continuing basis,\u201d which means \u201c8 hours a day, for 5 days a week, or an equivalent work schedule.\u201d <em>Kelley, </em>185 F.3d at 1214 (quoting Social Security Ruling 96-8p).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">Here, substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s denial of Carson\u2019s disability benefits claim. First, as discussed in part I, substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s decision to discount Dr. McCaulie\u2019s opinion because it was inconsistent with other evidence in the record. Also, substantial evidence specifically supported the ALJ\u2019s RFC determination that Carson could sit or stand for up to one and a half hours at a time and up to four hours in an eight-hour workday and perform other limited physical activities. Carson does not challenge the testimony of the vocational expert that a person with the RFC found by the ALJ with Carson\u2019s age, education, and skills could perform a range of light and sedentary work as found in jobs such as an estimator or a purchasing agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b768-12\">. He also presented some evidence regarding vision impairment and mental health problems. His brief on appeal does not mention those matters; hence, we do not consider them. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 74, 172 L.Ed.2d 67 (2008) (No. 07-10871).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b768-23\">. We have rephrased this argument as an alternative argument for relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b769-9\">. Although the AU incorrectly stated that Dr. McCaulie saw Carson only twice, that error was harmless because the record does not indicate that it affected the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Diorio v. Heckler, </em>721 F.2d 726, 728 (11th Cir. 1983) (applying the harmless error analysis in the Social Security case context).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
