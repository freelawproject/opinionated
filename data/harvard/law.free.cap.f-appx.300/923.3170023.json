Morgan appeals the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) that sustained the action of the Federal Aviation Administration (\u201cFAA\u201d or \u201cAgency\u201d) removing him from his position based upon two charges: (1) indirectly threatening a co-worker and (2) claiming unauthorized overtime. <em>Morgan v. Dept of Trans., </em>105 M.S.P.R. 647 (2007) (Table) <em>(\u201cFinal Decision\u201d). </em>We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b951-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">Prior to his removal, Mr. Morgan was employed as an Air Traffic Control Specialist at the FAA\u2019s High Desert Terminal Radar Approach Control facility at Edwards Air Force Base. On September 30, 2005, the FAA removed Mr. Morgan for indirectly threatening a co-worker and for working beyond his scheduled shift without authorization, and then claiming overtime. The events giving rise to these charges were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b951-12\">On February 16, 2005, Mr. Morgan was scheduled to work until 1:45 p.m. but he failed to sign-out. Consequently, his supervisor annotated the log sheet to indicate that Mr. Morgan had left at the end of his scheduled shift. During his next shift, Mr. Morgan changed the log sheet to indicate that he signed out at 2:30 p.m. and that he had worked forty-five minutes of overtime. According to Mr. Morgan, on February 16, one of his supervisors, Susan Marmet, ordered him to obtain a medical document before his next shift, and the forty-five minutes he claimed was spent doing that.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-16\">On February 22, 2005, Mr. Morgan met with another supervisor and a union representative, Roy Awana, to discuss the February 16, 2005 incident. Mr. Morgan was questioned about the forty-five minutes of unauthorized overtime and given a proposed five-day suspension letter, stemming from another separate incident. After the meeting, Mr. Morgan and Mr. Awana went into the union office, where Mr. Morgan stated, in addition to various expletives, that he was going to kill one of his supervisors, Frank Ceruti. Mr. Morgan and Mr. Ceruti apparently had a long-term history of conflict. According to Mr. Awana, when Mr. Morgan stated that he would kill Mr. Ceruti, \u201cthe words came from his whole being; the words came out like a roar.\u201d Mr. Awana then called the FAA Administrator\u2019s Hotline to report Mr. Morgan\u2019s threat. On July 27, 2005, Mr. Morgan was issued a Notice of Proposed Removal for the above incidents and he was, subsequently removed on September 30, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-18\">Mr. Morgan appealed his removal to the Board. On July 14, 2006, the administrative judge (\u201cAJ\u201d) to whom the appeal was assigned issued an initial decision, sustaining Mr. Morgan\u2019s removal for indirectly threatening a co-worker and claiming unauthorized overtime. <em>Morgan v. Dept of Trans., </em>SF-0752-06-0090-I-1, slip op. (M.S.P.B. July 14, 2006) <em>(\u2018Initial Decision </em>\u201d). The AJ explained that, while Mr. Morgan denied making the threatening remarks, the preponderance of evidence, in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>eluding several sworn statements by Mr. Awana, showed that Mr. Morgan indirectly threatened to kill Mr. Ceruti. Additionally, the AJ determined that the preponderance of evidence showed that Mr. Morgan claimed forty-five minutes of overtime without authorization. The AJ also ruled that the FAA\u2019s penalty of removal was reasonable and not in retaliation for whistleblowing, which would, if true, violate the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, Pub.L. No. 101-12,103 Stat. 16 (codified at various sections of 5 U.S.C.) (\u201cWPA\u201d). The <em>Initial Decision </em>became the final decision of the Board on March 22, 2007, when the Board denied Mr. Morgan\u2019s petition for review. <em>Final Decision. </em>This appeal followed. We have jurisdiction over his appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Our scope of review in an appeal from a decision of the Board is limited. Specifically, we must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless we find it to be (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c); <em>Kewley v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>153 F.3d 1357, 1361 (Fed.Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">Mr. Morgan makes several arguments on appeal; we address them in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">Mr. Morgan argues that the Board erred in finding that he threatened to kill Mr. Ceruti, because it misapplied the evidentiary factors outlined in <em>Metz v. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>780 F.2d 1001 (Fed.Cir.1986), for determining whether a Government employee threatened someone. In addition, Mr. Morgan contends that <em>Metz </em>is in conflict with <em>Virginia v. Black, </em>538 U.S. 343, 123 S.Ct. 1536, 155 L.Ed.2d 535 (2003), and therefore should not have been applied in the first place. He also seems to argue that the FAA cannot discipline him for making an indirect threat because such conduct is a criminal offense under Section 422 of the California Penal Code. Alternatively, if the FAA can punish him for making an indirect threat, Mr. Morgan asserts that the FAA was required to, and did not, prove that he violated section 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">Because the Board\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence and it did not err as a matter of law in its application of the law to the facts, we affirm the Board\u2019s ruling that Mr. Morgan indirectly threatened to kill a co-worker. The Board considered substantial evidence that showed Mr. Morgan said he was \u201cgoing to kill\u201d Mr. Ceruti, including sworn declarations from several co-workers and corroborating written memoranda. The Board then correctly applied the <em>Metz </em>factors to the record evidence and concluded that all five factors weighed in favor of sustaining the charge that Mr. Morgan had made an indirect threat. While the record included a statement from Mr. Morgan claiming that he never threatened Mr. Ceruti, the Board properly considered all of the record evidence and \u201cit is not for this Court to reweigh the evidence before the Board.\u201d <em>Henry v. Dep\u2019t of Navy, </em>902 F.2d 949, 951 (Fed.Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-11\">In addition, contrary to Mr. Morgan\u2019s suggestion, <em>Metz </em>was appropriately applied as the controlling test and is not in conflict with <em>Black. </em>In contrast to <em>Black, </em>the issue before the Board was not whether Mr. Morgan could be convicted of a crime for his threat, but rather, whether he could be disciplined by his employer. Mr. Morgan\u2019s arguments regarding California Penal Code section 422 are similarly incorrect. The FAA may discipline its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>employees for the kind of conduct in which Mr. Morgan engaged. It was not required to prove that Mr. Morgan violated section 422 in order to support its disciplinary decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">Regarding the Board\u2019s finding that he claimed forty-five minutes of unauthorized overtime, Mr. Morgan argues that the Board erroneously interpreted the term \u201cworking.\u201d Additionally, he argues that Ms. Marmet authorized his overtime when she required him to obtain medical documentation on February 16, 2005. Mr. Morgan also suggests that he did not \u201cclaim\u201d overtime but instead was merely \u201crequesting\u201d it.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">We will not disturb the Board\u2019s finding that Mr. Morgan claimed forty-five minutes of unauthorized overtime, because the Board\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence and it did not err as a matter of law in its application of the law to the facts. The Board correctly concluded that Mr. Morgan\u2019s time spent obtaining his medical documentation was time worked. Likewise, the Board properly considered all of the record evidence, for example a declaration from Ms. Marmet, and correctly determined that Mr. Morgan was not authorized to work beyond his scheduled shift. Not only did Mr. Morgan fail to provide any evidence that he had been approved for overtime, but Ms. Mar-met \u2014 the supervisor that allegedly authorized his overtime \u2014 directly contradicted Mr. Morgan. Indeed, Ms. Marmet stated that she did not authorize him to obtain his medical documents and, in fact, was not even at work on the day in question. Furthermore, the Board appropriately considered all of the record evidence and found that Mr. Morgan had in fact \u201cclaimed\u201d overtime \u2014 a decision we will not disturb by reweighing the evidence before the Board. <em>See, e.g., Henry, </em>902 F.2d at 951.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">Turning now to Mr. Morgan\u2019s WPA contentions, the Board determined that he failed to prove his affirmative defense of protected whistleblowing. The Board found that Mr. Morgan proved that he made two protected disclosures: (1) a disclosure that a co-worker made \u201cmaterially, false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements\u201d in a report and (2) a disclosure related to an alleged safety issue resulting from an order by management. In addition, the Board found that these protected disclosures were contributing factors in his removal. Consequently, the FAA had the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have removed Mr. Morgan absent the protected disclosures. Mr. Morgan argues that the Board erred in finding clear and convincing evidence that the FAA would have removed him absent his protected disclosures. According to Mr. Morgan, contrary to the Board\u2019s conclusion, the evidence shows he was removed because of his disclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">We affirm the Board\u2019s decision that there was clear and convincing evidence that the FAA would have removed Mr. Morgan absent the protected disclosures. The Board correctly considered the substantial record evidence and applied the relevant factors, such as the strength of the evidence supporting removal and the existence and strength of any motive by agency officials to retaliate against him. <em>See Carr v. Social Sec. Admin., </em>185 F.3d 1318, 1323 (Fed.Cir.1999). Importantly, the evidence submitted in support of the serious charge of threatening to Idll a coworker was clear and convincing. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 1325-26. Accordingly, the Board properly concluded that any possible retaliatory motive was strongly outweighed by the \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d of Mr. Morgan\u2019s serious misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">We now turn to Mr. Morgan\u2019s contention that the Board improperly sustained the FAA\u2019s removal decision. We will only overturn an agency\u2019s penalty determination if it is \u201cso harsh and unconscionably disproportionate to the offense that it amounts to an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>O\u2019Neill v. Dep\u2019t of Hous. &amp; Urban Dev., </em>220 F.3d 1354, 1365 (Fed.Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Villela v. Dep\u2019t of Air Force, </em>727 F.2d 1574, 1576 (Fed.Cir.1984)). Contrary to Mr. Morgan\u2019s arguments, the Board properly found that his removal was reasonable and that the deciding official appropriately considered the factors in <em>Douglas v. Veterans Admin., </em>5 MSPB 313, 5 M.S.P.R. 280 (1981). The Board correctly found that the deciding official considered, among other facts, the seriousness of Mr. Morgan\u2019s misconduct, past disciplinary problems, that his job required \u201cimmense responsibility for the lives and property of others,\u201d and that many of his co-workers became uncomfortable around Mr. Morgan. Subsequently, the deciding official appropriately applied the Human Resources Operating Instructions (\u201cHROI\u201d) table of penalties, which supports removal for \u201cthreatening another.\u201d Under these circumstances, we cannot properly disturb the FAA\u2019s decision to impose the penalty of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">In conclusion, there is substantial evidence to support both the Board\u2019s decisions that Mr. Morgan indirectly threatened to kill a co-worker and that he claimed unauthorized overtime. In addition, the Board did not err in finding that there was clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Morgan would have been removed regardless of his protected disclosures, which precluded his affirmative defense of whistleblowing. Finally, we find no error with the decision that the FAA\u2019s removal was an appropriate penalty for his misconduct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the final decision of the Board is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b954-5\">. Mr. Morgan also makes two additional arguments: (1) he suggests that the Board decision should be reversed because the FAA, not the Department of Transportation (\"DOT\u201d), is the proper respondent and (2) he challenges the FAA\u2019s withdrawal of his security clearance. Both of Mr. Morgan\u2019s allegations are without merit. Regarding the issue of whether the FAA should be the proper respondent, regardless of the FAA's independence over employment matters, it is still a subordinate administration within the DOT. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 106(a) (2008). Consequently, the DOT has frequently been the respondent in appeals to this Court from decisions of the Board involving employees of the FAA. <em>See, e.g., Elmore v. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>421 F.3d 1339 (Fed.Cir. 2005); <em>Plasai v. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>228 Fed. Appx. 976 (Fed.Cir.2007). In addition, any possible error would have no effect on the outcome of his appeal. Regarding Mr. Morgan\u2019s challenge to the removal of his security clearance, the Board requires an adverse personnel action to obtain jurisdiction. The withdrawal of a security clearance alone is not an adverse action however \u2014 a fact acknowledged by Mr. Morgan himself \u2014 and therefore the Board did not possess jurisdiction to hear this contention. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7512 (1989); <em>Dep\u2019t of Navy v. Egan, </em>484 U.S. 518, 530, 108 S.Ct. 818, 98 L.Ed.2d 918 (1988). Additionally, while removal is an adverse action, Mr. Morgan was not removed because his security clearance was withdrawn. Rather, as explained above, <em>supra </em>Section IV, Mr. Morgan was removed because of his own misconduct. In short, neither of Mr. Morgan's additional arguments warrants reversing the Board's decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
