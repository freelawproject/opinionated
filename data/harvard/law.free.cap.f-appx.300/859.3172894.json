U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 808 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-24\">If the Attorney General permits an alien to depart the United States voluntarily, the alien must do so during the prescribed period. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240B(a), (d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(a), (d). If the alien fails to depart the United States within the specified time period, he becomes ineligible to, <em>inter alia, </em>apply for an adjustment of status or change of status for a period of ten years. <em>See id.; </em>INA \u00a7 245(i)(l)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(l)(A); <em>see also Dada v. Mukasey, </em>554 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2307, 2310, 171 L.Ed.2d 178 (2008) (noting that failure to depart within the prescribed voluntary departure period renders the alien ineligible for adjustment of status for a period of ten years).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-27\">In this case, Lemus-Sanchez admitted that he remained in the United States after his voluntary departure period expired. Thus, he must wait a period of ten years before seeking an adjustment of status. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240B(d)(l)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(d)(l)(B). Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Lemus-Sanchez\u2019s appeal from the denial of his motion to reopen for purposes of seeking an adjustment of status, and we deny Lemus-Sanchez\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-28\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-20\">. We agree with the government that LemusSanchez's brief does not comply with Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A). However, we exercise our discretion to consider the brief. <em>See Mendoza v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1286 n. 4 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
