The City removed and destroyed various construction materials from the Property pursuant to a Sentencing Order McCullough signed to resolve criminal charges brought by the City. McCullough asserts claims against the City for violating the Fourth Amendment, procedural due process, substantive due process, the Takings Clause, and California state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-18\">We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Buono v. Norton, </em>371 F.3d 543, 545 (9th Cir.2004). Appellate review is governed by the same standards for summary judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 applied by the trial court. <em>Qwest Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. City of Berkeley, </em>433 F.3d 1253, 1256 (9th Cir.2006). A party moving for summary judgment must dem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>onstrate that there are no genuine issues of material fact to be tried and that it is therefore entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). Upon review of the District Court\u2019s judgment, we must determine, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the District Court correctly applied the substantive law. <em>Olsen v. Idaho State Bd. of Med., </em>363 F.3d 916, 922 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Plea agreements, such as the Sentencing Order at issue here, are contractual, and are interpreted under state contract law standards. <em>California v. Paredes, </em>160 Cal. App.4th 496, 506-07, 72 Cal.Rptr.3d 867 (Ct.App.2008) (citations omitted). When the parties dispute the meaning of a contract, a court must first determine whether the contractual language is ambiguous; contract language is ambiguous if it is \u201c \u2018reasonably susceptible\u2019 \u201d to either meaning advocated by the parties. <em>Curry v. Moody, </em>40 Cal.App.4th 1547, 48 Cal. Rptr.2d 627, 630 (Ct.App.1995). In resolving such a dispute, a court must first look to the terms of the agreement. <em>Ticor Title Ins. Co. v. Employers Ins. of Wausau, </em>40 Cal.App.4th 1699, 48 Cal.Rptr.2d 368, 373 (Ct.App.1995). If the terms are clear, then extrinsic evidence need not be considered. <em>See United States v. Clark, </em>218 F.3d 1092, 1095 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Ticor Title Ins. Co., </em>48 Cal.Rptr.2d at 373 (\u201cWhere contract language is clear and explicit and does not lead to absurd results, we ascertain intent from the written terms and go no further.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">We \u201cconsider the circumstances under which an agreement was made, including its object, nature, and subject matter.\u201d <em>Badie v. Bank of Am., </em>67 Cal.App.4th 779, 79 Cal.Rptr.2d 273, 287 (Ct.App.1998). The Sentencing Order was intended to resolve the criminal charges brought against McCullough, one of which was for violation of Compton Municipal Code \u00a7 30-12.4(g) which requires that \u201c[a]ll uses, storage, and display shall be located entirely within a building.\u201d Thus, McCullough\u2019s agreement to \u201cabate the violations\u201d meant that the City could remove all items stored on the property in violation of the code, i.e., anything not located inside a building, including the construction materials. McCullough could not reasonably have expected to recover \u201ctrash\u201d removed from the Property, and the Sentencing Order defined \u201ctrash\u201d broadly enough to include the construction materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">We do not consider extrinsic evidence in interpreting the Sentencing Order because it is not ambiguous, i.e. it is not reasonably susceptible to the meaning urged by McCullough. <em>See Tahoe Nat'l Bank v. Phillips, 4 </em>Cal.3d 11, 92 Cal.Rptr. 704, 480 P.2d 320, 325 n. 5 (1971). The contract at issue here shows that McCullough consented to the removal and destruction of the construction materials, which bars all of his claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Interpretation of a contract is generally a question of law. <em>Badie, </em>79 Cal.Rptr.2d at 286. Therefore, the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the City was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">Consent negates all of McCullough\u2019s claims except for violation of substantive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>due process. To sustain a substantive due process claim, the plaintiff must prove that the government\u2019s action was \u201cclearly arbitrary and unreasonable, having no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare.\u201d <em>Vill. of Euclid, v. Ambler Realty Co., </em>272 U.S. 365, 395, 47 S.Ct. 114, 71 L.Ed. 303 (1926) (citations omitted). The facts asserted by McCullough do not support his claim of a substantive due process violation. Therefore, the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the City was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b602-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b603-6\">. McCullough apparently arranged to have various trucks, tractors, and trailers removed from the Property and stored according to a separate arrangement with a towing service; the City gave McCullough an inventory of the vehicles removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Although McCullough raises a substantive due process claim, under <em>Armendariz v. Penman, </em>75 F.3d 1311 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc) and <em>Albright v. Oliver, </em>510 U.S. 266, 114 S.Ct. 807, 127 L.Ed.2d 114 (1994), the claim is properly treated as an unreasonable seizure claim under the Fourth Amendment, which is barred by his consent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
