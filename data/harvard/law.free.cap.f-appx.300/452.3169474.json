We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d)(1) and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Cool Fuel asserts that the Bankruptcy Court improperly entered judgment on remand from this court because the district court\u2019s prior sanctions order was not, and could not have been, before the Ninth Circuit in the Board\u2019s appeal. We review the scope of this court\u2019s prior mandate de novo. <em>United States v. Kellington, </em>217 F.3d 1084, 1092 (9th Cir.2000). Although matters that were adjudicated on the first appeal are no longer open to reexamination, <em>Coleman Co. v. Holly Mfg. Co., </em>269 F.2d 660, 664 (9th Cir.1959), \u201c[a]n order issued after remand may deviate from the mandate ... if it is not counter to the spirit of the circuit court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Lindy Pen Co. v. Bic Pen Corp., </em>982 F.2d 1400,1404 (9th Cir.1993) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Cool Fuel\u2019s objections to the entry of judgment are not well taken. Our disposition of the Board\u2019s appeal specifically instructed the Bankruptcy Court \u201cto enter judgment in favor of the Board.\u201d Moreover, we find it significant that: (1) the sanctions order was entered before the summary judgment order; (2) the sanctions order was provisional and did not finally adjudicate any facts; (3) the sanctions order was fully briefed in the Board\u2019s appeal; (4) Cool Fuel represented to this court in the Board\u2019s appeal that there were no material facts in dispute; and (5) the most reasonable reading of our prior disposition is that we considered the discovery issues. Accordingly, the district court properly entered judgment in favor of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Cool Fuel asserts that the Bankruptcy Court did not consider the Rule 60(b) motions on their merits and that the motions were compelling. Our review of the record shows that the Bankruptcy Court considered Cool Fuel\u2019s Rule 60(b) motions on their merits, but found them not persuasive. The denial of a motion for relief under Rule 60(b) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Bateman v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>231 F.3d 1220, 1223 (9th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">The Bankruptcy Court\u2019s denial of Cool Fuel\u2019s Rule 60(b) motions was well reasoned. It reasonably denied relief under Rule 60(b)(2) because Cool Fuel knew of the discovery issues before the entry of judgment and the issues were not likely to change the disposition of the case. The Bankruptcy Court reasonably denied relief under Rule 60(b)(3) because there was no evidence of \u201cfraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct,\u201d and the alleged conduct did not prevent Cool Fuel from fully and fairly presenting its case. The Bankruptcy Court properly denied relief under Rule 60(b)(6) because Cool Fuel failed to demonstrate both injury and circumstances beyond its control that prevented it from proceeding in a proper fashion. <em>See United States v. Washington, </em>394 F.3d 1152, 1157 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">For the forgoing reasons the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s entry of judgment in favor of the Board and its denial of Cool Fuel\u2019s Rule 60(b) motions are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b479-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
