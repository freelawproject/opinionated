We review the district court\u2019s order <em>de novo </em>to determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact for trial. <em>Wong v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., </em>410 F.3d 1052, 1063 (9th Cir.2005). We can affirm the grant of summary judgment on any ground supported by the record. <em>See Enlow v. Salem-Keizer Yellow Cab Co., </em>371 F.3d 645, 649 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-21\">In order to survive summary judgment on his Rehabilitation Act claim, Chapman must establish that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether \u201che is (1) an individual with a disability, (2) otherwise qualified and (3) subjected to discrimination solely by reason of his disability.\u201d <em>Mustafa v. Clark County Sch. Dist. </em>157 F.3d 1169, 1174 (9th Cir.1998) (per curiam). Summary judgment in favor of USPS was appropriate because no reasonable factfinder could have concluded that Chapman was a \u201cqualified individual\u201d or that he was terminated solely because of his disability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Chapman concedes that he was unable to move mail. USPS was not required to exempt Chapman from performing this duty, which the job description makes clear is an essential function. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number><em>See Dark v. Curry County, </em>451 F.3d 1078, 1087, 1089 (9th Cir.2006). Moreover, USPS offered to accommodate Chapman by reassigning him to a different craft, but Chapman refused to apply. Accordingly, he was not terminated \u201csolely\u201d because of his disability; he was terminated because he refused to accept reasonable accommodation. Summary judgment was therefore appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Turning to Chapman\u2019s retaliation claim, we must affirm if no reasonable factfinder could conclude that USPS\u2019s reason for putting him on non-pay status \u2014 that there was no work for him to do \u2014 was pretextual. <em>See Coons v. Sec. of U.S. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>383 F.3d 879, 887 (9th Cir.2004). Chapman has failed to submit any evidence suggesting that there was work that he could do. In fact, he admits that he could not perform the essential functions of his job. Accordingly, USPS was entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AJJ\">This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
