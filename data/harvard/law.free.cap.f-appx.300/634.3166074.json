Corbett and James M. Garrison. Specifically, Diamond asserts there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Corbett and Garrison deprived Diamond of his right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment, and that Corbett and Garrison are not entitled to quali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>fied immunity. Diamond further asserts the policies and procedures of BSO allowed for activities by its police officers which violated the Fourth Amendment rights of Diamond and that BSO\u2019s failure to properly train and superase its officers resulted in the violation of Diamond\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">After review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s well-reasoned Order on Motions for Summary Judgment entered on April 1, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
