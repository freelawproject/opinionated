After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b801-15\">In April 1995, a jury found Fields guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 864. Because Fields\u2019s offense involved both crack cocaine and powder cocaine, the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) converted the amount of each substance into its marijuana equivalent and set Fields\u2019s base offense level at 34. Based on a total offense level of 34, and a criminal history category of III, the PSI calculated a guidelines range of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-16\">However, Fields had prior felony drug convictions, which subjected him to a mandatory minimum term of life imprisonment, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii). Because the guidelines range of 188 to 235 months was lower than the statutory mandatory minimum life sentence, the statutory mandatory minimum life sentence became his guidelines sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b) (making the statutory mandatory minimum sentence the guidelines sentence if it is greater than the high end of the otherwise applicable guidelines range). The district court adopted the PSI\u2019s factual findings and guidelines calculations and imposed a life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-17\">On March 3, 2008, Fields filed a \u00a7 3582 motion, seeking a modification of his sentence of life imprisonment. The motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered the offense levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 for offenses involving crack cocaine and was made retroactive by Amendment 713. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amends. 706, 713; <em>United States v. Stratton, </em>519 F.3d 1305, 1307 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-18\">The district court denied the motion, concluding that it was not authorized to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>reduce Fields\u2019s sentence. The district court explained that, because Fields was sentenced to a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment, Amendment 706 did not lower Fields\u2019s applicable guidelines range. Fields filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Section 3582(c)(2) prohibits a court from modifying a term of imprisonment after it has been imposed except \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(l) (Supp. May 1, 2008). However, \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B) (May 1, 2008) (providing that a reduction is not authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if \u201can amendment listed in subsection (c) does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, if the defendant\u2019s original sentence for a crack cocaine offense was based on something other than \u00a7 2Dl.l\u2019s drag quantity tables, such as a career offender provision or a statutory mandatory minimum sentence, the defendant is not eligible for a sentence reduction because Amendment 706 does not lower the defendant\u2019s sentencing range. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28 (11th Cir. 2008); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(A) (Supp. May 1, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">Here, Fields\u2019s life sentence was based not on the amount of crack cocaine attributed to him, but rather on the statutory mandatory minimum life sentence in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, although Amendment 706 lowered the base offense level for Fields\u2019s crack cocaine offense, it did not lower his applicable guidelines range. Even after Amendment 706, Fields\u2019s sentencing range remains life imprisonment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b). Therefore, the district court correctly concluded that it lacked authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce Fields\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">We reject Fields\u2019s argument that the district court violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by treating the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B) as mandatory. Section 3582(c)(2), which is not advisory, independently authorizes a district court to modify a sentence only when the defendant\u2019s original sentence is \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered\u201d by an amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). And, because Fields is not eligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u2019s standard, the district court had no occasion to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and exercise its discretion to impose a new sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-12\">Likewise, because Fields is not eligible for resentencing under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we do not address Fields\u2019s remaining arguments concerning the procedures a district court must follow and the standards it must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>apply in determining whether to exercise its discretion and reduce a sentence. Finally, Fields\u2019s arguments regarding the deficiencies in his \u00a7 851 information are outside the scope of this proceeding, and we do not address them. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (limiting proceedings under the statute to cases where a retroactive amendment affects the applicable guidelines range).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b802-7\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusion regarding the scope of its authority to modify a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b802-13\">. Fields\u2019s arguments that the district court did not impose a life sentence pursuant to \u00a7 841(b) and that the government abandoned its argument that the life sentence was based on \u00a7 841(b) are without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
