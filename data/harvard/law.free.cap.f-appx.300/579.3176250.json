The memorandum disposition filed May 16, 2008, and appearing at 279 Fed.Appx. 465, is withdrawn. It may not be cited as precedent by or to this court or any district court of the Ninth Circuit. An amended memorandum disposition is filed contemporaneously.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-24\">The full court has been advised of the petition for rehearing en banc and no judge has requested a vote on whether to rehear the matter en banc. Fed. RApp. P. 35. Therefore, the petition for rehearing en banc is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-25\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-26\">George S. Louie appeals the dismissal with prejudice of his First Amended Corn-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>plaint alleging violations of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) and related state law for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), and the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees. The parties are familiar with the facts and we do not repeat them here except as necessary. We review the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss de novo. <em>Manzarek v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>519 F.3d 1025,1030 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Louie fails to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182(b)(1)(D), because an attorney who uses a room in an office building to conduct a deposition does not \u201coperate\u201d the facility within the meaning of the ADA. <em>See Disabled Rights Action Comm. v. Las Vegas Events, Inc., </em>375 F.3d 861, 878 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201c[W]hether Title III applies [to a private entity] depends on whether those private entities exercise sufficient control over the [facilities], and in particular over the configuration of the facilities, even temporarily, with regard to accessibility, that they can be said to \u2018operate\u2019 the [facilities].\u201d). Aso, Louie\u2019s allegation that \u201cCarichoffs standards or criteria for the selection of venues for depositions have the effect of discriminating on the basis of disability,\u201d is conclusory and undermined by Louie\u2019s own allegation that Carichoff asked Louie to suggest a location for the deposition. <em>See Sprewell v. Golden State Warriors, </em>266 F.3d 979, 988 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cNor is the court required to accept as true allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences.\u201d). For the same reasons, Louie\u2019s cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii) also fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Louie\u2019s claims for retaliation and intimidation under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12203(a), (b) fail because filing a motion to compel in the course of a discovery dispute is an appropriate step towards resolving the dispute, not an act of retaliation, coercion, or intimidation. <em>See </em>Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 2025.480; <em>cf. </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Because the federal causes of action cannot be sustained, the state law causes of action, which are based on the same conduct as the federal causes of action, were properly dismissed. <em>See </em>Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 51(f) (a violation of the ADA is a violation under California\u2019s Unruh Civil Rights Act); Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 54(c) (a violation of the ADA is a violation under California\u2019s Disabled Person\u2019s Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that attorney\u2019s fees were warranted. <em>See Armstrong v. Davis, </em>318 F.3d 965, 970 (9th Cir.2003). However, the district court erred in awarding fees for Carichoffs self-representation. <em>See Kay v. Ehrler, </em>499 U.S. 432, 111 S.Ct. 1435, 113 L.Ed.2d 486 (1991). Therefore, we remand to the district court to determine the proper fee award for Carichoffs representation of Coleman.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">AFFIRMED IN PART AND REMANDED IN PART. Costs on appeal are awarded to appellees.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b606-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
