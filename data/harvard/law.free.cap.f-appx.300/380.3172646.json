Victor DeLeon (plaintiff, appellant, or DeLeon) sued the City of Ecorse, Larry Salisbury, and George Anthony (collectively, defendants or appellees) alleging violations of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment related to the termination of his employment as an Ecorse police officer. After defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment was granted in part and denied in part, the parties entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which an arbitration proceeding would be held and any award of attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>fees would subsequently be decided by the court. After the arbitration proceeding concluded, DeLeon moved for his attorney\u2019s fees and costs, which the district court denied. DeLeon\u2019s appeal of that ruling is now before this court. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">A. Underlying Suit</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The essential facts do not appear to be in dispute for purposes of this appeal. For twenty-eight years, DeLeon was employed as a police officer by the City of Ecorse. After an on-the-job physical altercation between DeLeon and Ecorse\u2019s City Attorney, for which DeLeon was charged with a misdemeanor count of assault and battery, the police department initiated a disciplinary proceeding against DeLeon. This \u201cChiefs Hearing\u201d was held on March 17, 2004, and shortly thereafter the department gave DeLeon the options of either termination or voluntary retirement. On April 6, 2004, DeLeon submitted his retirement letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">However, in letters dated May 25 and October 25, 2004, DeLeon, through his counsel, wrote to Ecorse Mayor Larry Salisbury stating that DeLeon was a veteran of the United States Marines who served during the Vietnam War and requesting that DeLeon therefore be afforded the pre-termination hearing to which he was entitled under the Michigan Veteran\u2019s Preference Act (MVPA), Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 35.402.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> DeLeon also claimed that his alleged conduct did not justify his discharge under the discipline provision in the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between police officers and the City of Ecorse. Mayor Salisbury apparently did not respond to these letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">On December 22, 2004, DeLeon sued the City of Ecorse, Mayor Salisbury (in his official and individual capacities), and police chief George Anthony (in his official capacity).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This one-count complaint alleged that defendants violated DeLeon\u2019s due process rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Specifically, DeLeon argued that he had a property interest in his employment based on two \u201cindependent sources\u201d: the MVPA and the CBA. Joint Appendix (J.A.) 11 (Compl.\u00b6 1). He contended that he was constructively discharged; that the defendants made no findings regarding the criteria for discharge under the MVPA, the CBA, or the city\u2019s charter; and that his decision to retire was \u201cinvoluntary and unknowing.\u201d J.A. 13-15 (Compl.HH 12, 17, 19, 23-24). He claimed that, \u201c[a]s a result of the constructive discharge,\u201d he suffered \u201csevere and extreme emotional and [ ] and loss of pension rights,\u201d as well as \u201ca loss of back pay, seniority status, reduction in pension and other benefits.\u201d J.A. 16 (Compl.\u00b6\u00b6 31-32). DeLeon also sought punitive damages from Mayor Salisbury in his individual capacity. J.A. 16 (Compl.\u00b6 33). DeLeon alleged that defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>dants\u2019 failure \u201cto hold a \u2018right to reply1 pre-termination hearing[,] ... to hold a \u2018full trial-like\u2019 hearing at some point, either pre-termination or post-termination[,] ... [and] to make findings regarding the substantive predicates necessary for discharge\u201d as defined by the MVPA, the CBA, and the city\u2019s charter all violated DeLeon\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment right to due process. J.A. 17-18 (Compl.\u00b6\u00b6 39-43). DeLeon\u2019s prayer for relief requested \u201creinstatement and all equitable remedies,\u201d compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, and costs and interest. J.A.19 (Compl. at 10).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">On January 11, 2006, the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of defendants as to the alleged individual-capacity liability of Mayor Salisbury and the municipal liability of the City of Eeorse, but denied defendants\u2019 motion as to the official-capacity liability of Salisbury for failing to provide the MVPA hearing DeLeon demanded. <em>Deleon v. City of Ecorse, </em>No. 05-CV-70187-DT, 2006 WL 83063, at * 11 (E.D.Mich. Jan.ll, 2006). The court rejected two of DeLeon\u2019s arguments in support of his claim that his procedural due process rights had been violated. <em>See id. </em>at *7-9. However, the court also ruled that because \u201conly a may- or can be the final decisionmaker pursuant to the MVPA, not a chief of police,\u201d and because it was undisputed that DeLeon did not have a hearing before Mayor Salisbury as was required by the MVPA, a reasonable jury could find that DeLeon\u2019s right to such a hearing was violated. <em>Id. </em>at *10. The court observed that DeLeon did not cite any evidence to dispute a finding that his \u201cviolent, indeed criminal, conduct\u201d was anything less than \u201cserious neglect\u201d in the performance of his duty\u2014which would be a sufficient basis for discharge under the MVPA. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, because Mayor Salisbury had not held the hearing to which DeLeon was entitled, the court denied summary judgment on DeLeon\u2019s \u201cMVPA procedural due process claim.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Shortly after the court\u2019s ruling, in an apparent attempt to cure the procedural defect that the court had identified, the City of Eeorse conducted a hearing before Mayor Salisbury\u2014purportedly \u201cin strict compliance with the Michigan Veterans Preference Act\u201d\u2014at which the Mayor determined that any termination of DeLeon would be justified. J.A. 59 (Defs.\u2019 Renewed Mot. for Summ. J. 1\u00cd 3). Plaintiff, by his attorney, objected to the hearing and did not attend because he believed it \u201cillegal for the mayor (or anyone chosen by the City of Eeorse or the mayor) to be the decisionmaker.\u201d J.A. 206 (Pl.\u2019s Mot. for Att\u2019y Fees <em>&amp; </em>Costs at Ex. 8). Nevertheless, after holding the hearing, defendants renewed their motion for summary judgment on the remaining MVPA claim. However, according to defendants, the court was \u201cnot satisfied with the process surrounding the MVPA hearing\u201d and refused to dismiss the claim. J.A. 239 (Resp\u2019ts\u2019 Post-Hr\u2019g Br. 2, Pl.\u2019s Mot. for Att\u2019y Fees &amp; Costs at Ex. 10).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">The parties subsequently entered into settlement discussions and agreed to submit the case to the American Arbitration Association (AAA). Defendants agreed that \u201cthe issue of the dismissal and any remedy beyond that would be handled through the arbitration process.\u201d J.A. 67 (Settlement Conf. Tr. 4) (quoting defense counsel). The parties further agreed that the district court would dismiss the case but retain jurisdiction so that plaintiff could, if he wished, file a motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs after the arbitration concluded\u2014and that any such motion would not be entirely dependent on the arbitrator\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>J.A. 67-69 (Settlement Conf. Tr. 4-6). On March 10, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>2006, the district court issued an order dismissing the matter \u201cpursuant to the settlement agreement placed on the record\u201d at the settlement conference and ordering that \u201cthe Plaintiffs claims in their entirety\u201d were to be submitted to the AAA for \u201cbinding arbitration.\u201d JA. 63 (Order Dismissing Claims &amp; Retaining Jurisdiction for Att\u2019y Fees &amp; Costs 2). The court retained jurisdiction \u201csolely for the purpose of entertaining a motion by plaintiff for attorneys fees and costs.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">B. Arbitration</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The parties proceeded to arbitration. The arbitrator rejected DeLeon\u2019s unlawful termination claim, finding \u201cthat the uncontroverted evidence shows that [DeLeon] intentionally used physical violence during his official interaction with the City Attorney,\u201d and that this \u201cconstituted official misconduct and amounted to serious and/or willful neglect in the performance of his duties as an Ecorse police officer.\u201d J.A. 196 (Award of Arbitrator 5). The arbitrator upheld DeLeon\u2019s claim that the failure to provide him a pre-termination healing pursuant to the MVPA violated due process. The arbitrator reasoned, however, that a violation of the MVPA did not automatically entitle DeLeon to reinstatement with back pay, and that an award of back pay would not be appropriate when a veteran is removed for cause. The arbitrator therefore denied DeLeon\u2019s request for reinstatement and back pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">With respect to DeLeon\u2019s MVPA due process claim, the arbitrator acknowledged that defendants\u2019 \u201cfailure to timely provide [DeLeon] with a MVPA hearing resulted in [DeLeon] incurring costs for a determination to which he was statutorily entitled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The arbitrator found that \u201cthe costs associated with this arbitration should be borne solely by Respondents,\u201d and accordingly granted DeLeon\u2019s request that defendants \u201creimburse\u201d plaintiff for his portion of the filing fee, administrative fee, and total arbitrator\u2019s fee in connection with the arbitration proceeding\u2014a figure that came out to $9,008.00. J.A. 196-97 (Award of Arbitrator 5-6).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">C. Motion for Attorney\u2019s Fees and Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">DeLeon subsequently filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs with the district court. DeLeon claimed prevailing party status based on both the settlement order of March 10, 2006 and the arbitrator\u2019s subsequent decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendants opposed this motion, arguing that DeLeon\u2019s \u201ctechnical win\u201d under the MVPA did not entitle him to prevailing party status and that, even if DeLeon could be considered a prevailing party, he did not \u201cprevail substantially on enough of his claims\u201d to be entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. J.A. 297, 300-01 (Defs.\u2019 Resp. in Opp\u2019n to Pl.\u2019s Mot. for Att\u2019y Fees &amp; Costs 2, 5-6).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cMore importantly,\u201d defendants argued, \u201cthe City has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>already compensated Plaintiff for his purported due process violation claim through the payment of the arbitration filing fee, administrative fee and Arbitrator fee.\u201d J.A. 297 (Defs.\u2019 Resp. in Opp\u2019n 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">The district court denied DeLeon\u2019s motion. <em>DeLeon v. City of Ecorse, </em>No. 05-CV-70187, 2007 WL 2259331 (E.D.Mich. Aug.3, 2007). DeLeon timely appealed this ruling, and his appeal is now before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b) provides that \u201cthe court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party ... a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs\u201d in an action or proceeding brought to enforce a provision of certain specified civil rights statutes. Our review of a district court\u2019s attorney\u2019s-fees determination is ordinarily a two-step inquiry. We first review de novo the district court\u2019s legal determination of prevailing party status. <em>Radvansky v. City of Olmsted Falls, </em>496 F.3d 609, 619 (6th Cir. 2007). \u201cAfter a district court determines that a plaintiff is a prevailing party ..., it must then determine what is a \u2018reasonable\u2019 attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d <em>Cramblit v. Fikse, </em>33 F.3d 633, 634 (6th Cir.1994). We review a district court\u2019s award or denial of attorney\u2019s fees for an abuse of discretion. <em>Wikol ex rel. Wikol v. Birmingham Public Sch. Bd. of Educ., </em>360 F.3d 604, 611 (6th Cir.2004). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion when it relies upon clearly erroneous factual findings, applies the law improperly, or uses an erroneous legal standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAn abuse of discretion may also be found when the reviewing court is firmly convinced that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>Adcock-Ladd v. Sec\u2019y of Treasury, </em>227 F.3d 343, 349 (6th Cir.2000) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">B. Review of District Court\u2019s Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">DeLeon claims that he became a \u201cprevailing party\u201d upon entry of the March 10, 2006 settlement order and because of the subsequent arbitration proceeding.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The district court held that the settlement order did not grant any substantive relief to DeLeon, but \u201cmerely submitted Plaintiffs claims to arbitration,\u201d and therefore was unconvinced that this materially altered the parties\u2019 legal relationship. <em>DeLeon, </em>2007 WL 2259331, at *4. As for the arbitration, the district court acknowledged that DeLeon \u201csucceed[ed] in proving that his due process rights were violated\u201d and therefore \u201cachieve[d] some degree of success\u201d: \u201c[t]he fact that Defendants were required to pay all of the arbitration costs as a result of the due process denial, a portion of which costs was originally Plaintiffs obligation, modified Defendants\u2019 behavior in a way that directly benefits Plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *5. The court ruled that DeLeon may be considered a prevailing party \u201c[t]o the extent that\u201d the arbitrator\u2019s decision materially altered the parties\u2019 legal relationship, but noted that \u201c[t]o the extent that the arbitrator\u2019s award is insufficient to bestow prevailing party status <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>upon Plaintiff, Plaintiff fails to establish his eligibility for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *5 &amp; n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">We need not decide whether DeLeon was made a \u201cprevailing party\u201d either by the settlement order or the arbitration. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that DeLeon was a \u201cprevailing party,\u201d we nevertheless conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to award attorney\u2019s fees to DeLeon. Section 1988 provides in pertinent part that \u201cthe court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party ... a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. The Supreme Court has made clear that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_VL\">[o]nce civil rights litigation materially alters the legal relationship between the parties, \u201cthe degree of the plaintiffs overall success goes to the reasonableness\u201d of a fee award under <em>Hensley v. </em>Eckerhart[.] Indeed, \u201cthe most critical factor\u201d in determining the reasonableness of a fee award \u201cis the degree of success obtained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-6\"><em>Farrar, </em>506 U.S. at 114, 113 S.Ct. 566 (citations omitted). The \u201ctechnical\u201d nature of an award does not affect whether a plaintiff prevailed, but \u201cit does bear on the propriety of fees awarded under \u00a7 1988.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">The district court found DeLeon\u2019s procedural victory regarding the hearing to which he was entitled under the MVPA to be insufficient to support an award for fees in this case. The court observed that \u201c[DeLeon]\u2019s success was only in the context of establishing procedural rights\u201d\u2014 and that \u201c[t]he procedural issue, though not insignificant, was not the substance of his case.\u201d <em>DeLeon, </em>2007 WL 2259331, at *6. According to the court, \u201cit was the CBA-based property interest in employment that was the meat of Plaintiffs claims, not the rather ethereal MVPA violation upon which he now bases his claim for attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *5. The district court acknowledged that DeLeon achieved \u201csome degree of success,\u201d but observed that \u201cthe relief Plaintiff obtained, in light of the relief he sought, [was] not substantial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court found that the arbitration award was akin to a mere technical victory, as the award to DeLeon of his arbitration costs \u201cin essence left Plaintiff in only a marginally more favorable position after arbitration,\u201d and concluded that \u201cthe award in this case reinforces the technical nature of Plaintiffs success.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *6.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that any success by DeLeon in this litigation was \u201ctechnical\u201d and insubstantial. Although the arbitrator awarded DeLeon what turned out to be $9,008, DeLeon acknowledges that this award \u201ccompensated DeLeon for arbitration costs.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 50. Thus, the award of $9,008 was more than nominal, but it was clearly technical or de minimis when considered in context.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">As this court recently observed, \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion is entitled to substantial deference because the rationale for the award is predominately fact-driven.\u201d <em>Imwalle v. Reliance Med. Prods., Inc., </em>515 F.3d 531, 551 (6th Cir. 2008). \u201cThis deference \u2018is appropriate in view of the district court\u2019s superior understanding of the litigation and the desirability of avoiding frequent appellate review of what essentially are factual matters.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 437, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983)). We see no reason in this case not to defer to the district court\u2019s understanding of the litigation and, thus, the \u201cdegree of success obtained\u201d by DeLeon. Accordingly, and in light of the fact that \u201cthe most critical factor\u201d in determining the reasonableness of a fee award is a party\u2019s success, <em>see Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 436, 103 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>S.Ct. 1933, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to award DeLeon his attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Because it was within the district court\u2019s discretion to decline to award DeLeon his attorney\u2019s fees in this case, the district court\u2019s denial of the motion for attorney\u2019s fees is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b407-9\">.
