The district court determined that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Morton were barred by the exclusivity provision of the Louisiana Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and entered a final judgment pursuant to Fed.R.CivP. 54(b). We AFFIRM for the following reasons.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-7\">1. The crux of plaintiffs\u2019 appeal is whether the complaint adequately set forth the intentional act exception to workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity. <em>See </em>La.Rev.Stat. 23:1032(A)(1) &amp; (B). The plaintiffs contend that the complaint set forth such a claim because they alleged that Morton\u2019s procedures for handling misfires were contrary to safety regulations and that Morton knew the procedures were substantially certain to result in injury. The intentional act exception is narrowly construed, <em>Reeves v. Structural Pres. Sys., </em>731 So.2d 208, 211 (La.1999), and Louisiana courts have recognized that \u201cmere knowledge and appreciation of a risk does not constitute intent; reckless or wanton conduct, gross negligence, disregard of safety regulation or the failure to use safety equipment by an employer does not constitute intentional wrongdoing.\u201d <em>Micele v. CPC of La., Inc., </em>709 So.2d 1065, 1068 (La.Ct. App.1998). The complaint here included allegations that the explosion occurred in a manner not contemplated by Morton, that the defendant presumed that misfires were inert and could not be exploded except by planned detonation or the equivalent of a hammer blow, and that Morton knew its procedures would result in the \u201clikelihood\u201d of a misfire detonation and a subsequent injury \u201cat some point\u201d or \u201ceventually.\u201d There were no allegations that the defendant had ever been cited for safety violations or that other workers had previously been injured. The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint sets out an appreciation of a risk of injury and at most alleges gross negligence. Thus, the district court did not err. <em>See, e.g., Reeves, </em>731 So.2d at 212 (\u201c[Gjross negligence does not meet the intentional act requirement.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-10\">2. The plaintiffs contend that Morton\u2019s denial of the allegations in the complaint and assertion of affirmative defenses created material fact issues precluding a judgment under Rule 12(c). Based in part on affidavits from purported \u201clay experts,\u201d they also argue that the district court should have converted the Rule 12(c) motion into a motion for summary judgment and delayed ruling until they had an opportunity to complete discovery. We disagree with these contentions. Even accepting the plaintiffs\u2019 factual allegations as true for purposes of the Rule 12 motion, <em>see Guidry v. Am. Pub. Life Ins. Co., </em>512 F.3d 177,180 (5th Cir.2007), we have already concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint failed to show that their claims were not barred by state workers\u2019 compensation law. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>affidavits merely repeat the factual allegations of the complaint, and we see no abuse of discretion by the district court. 3. Finally, we find no merit to the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the district court failed to provide sufficient reasons for its decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b284-8\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
