Stiles made a claim for benefits pursuant to the Long-shore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cLHWCA\u201d), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-948. The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) awarded benefits to Stiles based on an average weekly wage of $1,329.63, and the Benefits Review Board (\u201cBRB\u201d) affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision. We must decide whether the BRB\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole and is in accordance with the law. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-16\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b309-17\">Stiles was hired as a scaffolding supervisor and, after working approximately two weeks for Bay, Ltd., suffered a work-related injury on May 22, 2003. During this time, Stiles earned a total of $1,636, at a rate of $18 per hour. Stiles made a claim for benefits for his work-related injury pursuant to the LHWCA. A formal hearing was held before an ALJ, and the sole issue before the ALJ was Stiles\u2019 average weekly wage. Stiles testified that during the years preceding the accident he had worked \u201con and off.\u201d Stiles submitted the wages of several coworkers, including Troy Thibodeaux (\u201cThibodeaux\u201d), Noel Valderrama (\u201cValderrama\u201d), and Gilbert Sarver (\u201cSarver\u201d). Thibodeaux\u2019s wage was about $23/hour and he earned an average weekly income of approximately $1,300.00, including overtime. Valderrama\u2019s wage was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>about $18/hour and he earned an average weekly income of approximately $1,330.00, including overtime. Sarver\u2019s wage was about $18/hour and he earned an average weekly income of approximately $1,025.00, including overtime. The parties stipulated that Stiles\u2019 co-workers worked in the \u201csame or similar\u201d employment as Stiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">The ALJ awarded Stiles continuing temporary total disability benefits from May 23, 2003, based on an average weekly wage of $1,329.63. Bay, Ltd. appealed the ALJ\u2019s decision to the BRB. The BRB held that the ALJ properly determined Stiles\u2019 average weekly wage and affirmed. Bay, Ltd. appeals the BRB\u2019s decision and claims that the ALJ and the BRB erred in holding that Yalderrama\u2019s earnings reasonably reflected Stiles\u2019 wage earning capacity under \u00a7 10(c) of the LHWCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">II. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">We have jurisdiction over the BRB\u2019s decision affirming the ALJ\u2019s decision pursuant to the LHWCA. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c). We review a decision of the BRB \u201cunder the same standard as it reviews the decision of the ALJ: Whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence and is in accordance with the law.\u201d <em>Empire United Stevedores v. Gatlin, </em>936 F.2d 819, 822 (5th Cir.1991) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">When this court reviews decisions of the BRB, \u201cour only function is to correct errors of law and to determine if the BRB adhered to its proper scope of review \u2014 i.e., has the Board deferred to the ALJ\u2019s fact-finding or has it undertaken de novo review and substituted its views for the ALJ\u2019s.\u201d <em>Ceres Marine Terminal v. Dir., Office of Worker\u2019s Comp. Programs, </em>118 F.3d 387, 389 (5th Cir.1997) (citing <em>Avon-dale Shipyards, Inc. v. Vinson, </em>623 F.2d 1117, 1119 n. 1 (5th Cir.1980) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Therefore, we must \u201cconduct an independent review of the record to determine if the ALJ\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Avondale, </em>623 F.2d at 1119 n. 1. We \u201cmay not substitute [our] judgment for that of the ALJ ... nor may we reweigh or reappraise the evidence, but may only inquire into the existence of evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s factual findings.\u201d <em>Empire, </em>936 F.2d at 822 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">Section 910 provides several alternate formulas for calculating an employee\u2019s average weekly wage based upon the employee\u2019s average annual earnings. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 910(a)-(d); <em>Empire, </em>936 F.2d at 821 (\u201cThe determination of the average weekly wage is governed by section 10 of the Act, which provides three alternative methods for calculating the employee\u2019s average annual earning capacity, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 910(a)-(c), the amount of which is then divided by 52 weeks to arrive at the average weekly wage, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 910(d)(1).\u201d). Both parties concede that \u00a7 910(a) is inapplicable in this case, because Stiles had not \u201cworked in the employment in which he was working at the time of the injury ... during substantially the whole of the year immediately preceding his injury.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 910(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">Section 910(b) is also not appropriate for calculating Stiles\u2019 average annual earnings, because there was no evidence of either Stiles\u2019 average daily wage or the daily wage of a similarly situated employee. Section 910(b) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-12\">[i]f the injured employee shall not have worked in such employment during substantially the whole of such year, his average annual earnings, if a six-day worker, shall consist of three hundred times the average daily wage or salary, and, if a five-day worker, two hundred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>and sixty times the average daily wage or salary, which an employee of the same class working substantially the whole of such immediately preceding year in the same or in similar employment in the same or a neighboring place shall have earned in such employment during the days when so employed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">33 U.S.C. \u00a7 910(b). The ALJ noted that there was no evidence of Stiles\u2019 average daily wage during the two weeks Stiles worked at Bay, Ltd. It then examined the wage history of similarly situated employees. The parties stipulated that Thibodeaux, Valderrama, and Sarver \u201cwork[ed] in the same or similar employment as Claimant.\u201d Sarver\u2019s \u201cearning history [did] not provide an adequate basis to use Section 10(b),\u201d and Thibodeaux\u2019s wage of $23/ hour was not reasonably similar to Stiles\u2019 wage of $18/hour. The ALJ concluded that \u201conly Mr. Valderrama would qualify as a fair and reasonable similar employee in the application of Section 10(b).\u201d However, because there was no record of the number of hours Valderrama worked <em>each day, </em>the ALJ could not calculate Valderrama\u2019s average daily wage, as required by \u00a7 910(b). Section 910(b) is not appropriate for calculating average annual earnings where there is no evidence of either the employee\u2019s average daily wage or the daily wage of similarly situated employees. <em>See id. </em>Under such circumstances, \u00a7 910(b) cannot reasonably and fairly be applied. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 910(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The ALJ properly determined that \u00a7 910(c) was the appropriate standard for calculating Stiles\u2019 average annual earnings. Section 910(c) provides that if subsections (a) and (b)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">cannot reasonably and fairly be applied, [the employee\u2019s] average annual earnings shall be such sum as, having regard to the previous earnings of the injured employee in the employment in which he was working at the time of the injury, and of other employees of the same or most similar class working in the same or most similar employment in the same or neighboring locality, or other employment of such employee, including the reasonable value of the services of the employee if engaged in self-employment, shall reasonably represent the annual earning capacity of the injured employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">33 U.S.C. \u00a7 910(c). Thus, the statute allows the ALJ to calculate average annual earnings based upon three factors: (1) past earnings of the employee in the employment in which he was working at the time of the injury; (2) the earning history of employees of the same or most similar class working in the same or most similar employment; and (3) the employment history of the injured employee. Bay, Ltd. argues that the first and third factors go against the ALJ\u2019s findings and require this court to overturn the ALJ\u2019s holding. First, we consider the second factor, which the ALJ found to reasonably represent Stiles\u2019 annual earning capacity. Then, we examine the first and third factors to determine if either factor suggests that the ALJ\u2019s reliance upon the second factor alone was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">The ALJ concluded that the critical factor in this case was the second factor: the earning history \u201cof other employees of the same or most similar class working in the same or most similar employment in the same or neighboring locality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The ALJ reviewed the pay records for three similarly situated employees. The pay records reflected each employee\u2019s annual earnings and included their average weekly income and the number of hours worked each week over a one-year period. From the evidence in the record, the ALJ determined that Valderrama was similarly situated to Stiles at the time of Stiles\u2019 injury. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>It also noted that Valderrama\u2019s income included overtime, but found that \u201cone of the primary variables in [average weekly wage] calculations is the number of hours of work and overtime an employee can expect to accumulate.\u201d The ALJ concluded that Valderrama\u2019s annual earnings presented substantial evidence that Stiles could have enjoyed similar opportunities for overtime earnings. There was no evidence to show that Stiles would have less opportunities for overtime earnings than similarly situated employees such as Valderrama. Therefor, the ALJ used Valderrama\u2019s earnings to estimate Stiles\u2019 earning capacity at the time of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Bay, Ltd. argues that the first factor, which inquires into the past earnings of the employee in the employment in which he was working at the time of the injury, demonstrates that the ALJ\u2019s reliance upon Valderrama\u2019s wage was unreasonable. Bay, Ltd. urges this court to apply the framework from <em>National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co. v. Bonner, </em>600 F.2d 1288 (9th Cir.1979), and hold that Stiles\u2019 past earnings with Bay, Ltd. represent the upper limit of his earning capacity. However, Bay, Ltd. misunderstands the critical finding in <em>National Steel. </em>In <em>National Steel, </em>the court held that \u201c[t]he earlier wages [or past earnings] could be considered for what they were worth, but they are not binding upon the ALJ.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1293. The court emphasized that \u201c[t]he trier can reasonably draw an inference that but for the injury, the worker would have continued to earn new, higher wages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, in <em>National Steel, </em>the Ninth Circuit found that an employee\u2019s disability wages could <em>exceed </em>the amount the employee had earned in his employment with the company in which he was working at the time of the injury. The court implicitly recognized that an employee might have more opportunity to earn wages at the time of his injury than he had prior to his injury. This conclusion is supported by the case law in this circuit. <em>See Empire, </em>936 F.2d at 823 (holding that earning capacity includes the amount that the employee would have had the opportunity to earn). The statute does not require the ALJ to limit the compensation award under \u00a7 910(c) based upon the wages the employee had earned at his job prior to his injury. The ALJ could reasonably consider the two other factors when determining the upper limit of Stiles\u2019 earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The third factor requires the ALJ to give consideration to the employment history of the injured employee. Bay, Ltd. argues that Stiles\u2019 past earnings indicate that he would not have pursued the same overtime opportunities that Valderrama did; and therefore, any calculation that is based upon Valderrama\u2019s overtime earnings was error. Though this court held, in <em>Empire, </em>that the ALJ must take into account the employee\u2019s earnings over several years, it did not find that this was the critical factor. 936 F.2d at 822. All the statute requires is that the ALJ give regard to the relevant factors when determining what \u201creasonably represents] the annual earning capacity of the injured employee.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 910(c); <em>see Empire, </em>936 F.2d at 822; <em>see also Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. v. Van Steene, </em>120 F.2d 548, 549-50 (9th Cir.1941) (holding that the court is required to consider the factors but need not rely upon a factor if the factor does not reasonably represent the annual earning capacity of the injured employee).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The ALJ determined that a claimant\u2019s annual earning capacity, at the time of his injury, may be more than his average earnings over the previous one to five years, even if this means including opportunities for overtime. For this reason, the ALJ held that Stiles\u2019 opportunities for overtime should be included in the calculation of his earning capacity at the time of his injury. This court has found that the \u201cprime objective of section 10(c) is to ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>rive at a sum that reasonably represents a claimant\u2019s annual earning capacity at the time of the injury.\u201d <em>Empire, </em>936 F.2d at 822 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In <em>Empire, </em>we found that an injured employee\u2019s earning capacity can be defined as: \u201cthe amount that the employee would have the potential and opportunity of earning absent the injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 823 (citing <em>Tri-State Terminals, Inc. v. Jesse, </em>596 F.2d 752, 757 (7th Cir.1979) (\u201c[E]aming capacity of [an] injured workman [can] mean the amount of earnings the claimant would have the potential and opportunity to earn absent injury.\u201d)); <em>see also Palacios v. Campbell Indus., </em>633 F.2d 840, 843 (9th Cir.1980) (\u201c[I]t is necessary to consider [the employee\u2019s] \u2018ability, willingness and opportunity to work.\u2019 \u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). Thus, this court has found that calculations of earning capacity allow for an inquiry into the opportunity to earn wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">In sum, the ALJ considered all three factors in its determination of Stiles\u2019 average annual earning capacity, that is the amount he could have earned absent his injury. First, the ALJ considered Stiles\u2019 actual earnings at the time of injury. The ALJ reviewed Stiles\u2019'pay records, which stated that he had been working for Bay, Ltd. for about two weeks at the time of his injury, that his wage was $18/hour, and that in those two weeks he had earned $1,636.00. Second, the ALJ considered the earnings of other employees working in the same or similar type of employment. The ALJ concluded that one employee, Valderrama, was similarly situated to Stiles\u2019 and that his earnings represented a fair and accurate assessment of Stiles\u2019 earning capacity. This estimate included Valderrama\u2019s overtime earnings, because the ALJ concluded that Stiles\u2019 would have had the same opportunities to acquire overtime had he not been injured. Third, the ALJ considered Stiles\u2019 earning capacity over a period of years prior to his injury. The ALJ reviewed Stiles\u2019 social security records and found that Stiles\u2019 annual earning capacity over the previous five years ranged from $11,872.00 to $66,496.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">After considering all of the factors, the ALJ concluded that Valderrama\u2019s annual earning capacity reasonably represented Stiles\u2019 annual earning capacity. The ALJ relied upon Valderrama\u2019s past earnings because he was working in a similar job at the same hourly wage and had similar opportunities as Stiles. The ALJ\u2019s decision to rely upon the past earnings of a similarly situated employee is in accordance with the law and there was substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s calculation of Stiles\u2019 earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">There was substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s determination of Stiles\u2019 annual earning capacity and the decision was in accordance with the law. Thus, the BRB properly affirmed the ALJ\u2019s Decision and Order. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b309-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
