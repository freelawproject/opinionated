We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-19\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Leone submitted evidence supporting a Fifth Amendment takings claim, her claim was not ripe because she had not yet exhausted judicial remedies available under state law. <em>See Williamson County Reg\u2019l Planning Comm\u2019n v. Hamilton Bank, </em>473 U.S. 172, 194-95, 105 S.Ct. 3108, 87 L.Ed.2d 126 (1985). A plaintiff must pursue a state court remedy \u201ceven where it \u2018remains unsure and undeveloped.\u2019 \u201d <em>Villager Pond, Inc. v. Town of Darien, </em>56 F.3d 375, 380 (2d Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Southview Assocs., Ltd. v. Bongartz, </em>980 F.2d 84, 99 (2d Cir. 1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-20\">Moreover, were we to reach the merits, Leone\u2019s appeal would still fail. It is clear that Leone failed to present evidence supporting a takings claim based on the \u201cpromise\u201d of a degree, because she never established that a state official with actual authority made such a promise, nor that she lacked a remedy under state law for any breach. With respect to her \u201cweb banner\u201d, the record is clear that she did in fact receive compensation in the form of class credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-21\">Finding no merit in Leone\u2019s remaining arguments, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
