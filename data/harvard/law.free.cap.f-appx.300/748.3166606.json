AI Transport, </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1023 (11th <em>Cir.2000)(en </em>banc). The moving party is entitled to summary judgment if \u201cthe pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). If the non-moving party bears the ultimate burden of proof regarding the claim at issue in the motion, that party, in response to the motion, must go beyond the pleadings and establish, through competent evidence, that there truly is a genuine, material issue to be tried. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">Wills argues that the USPS violated Title VII, which prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of race, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a), when it suspended Wills in 2004<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and terminated him in 2005, and because he was subjected to racial harassment by a supervisor. Normally, before filing a Title VII action, a plaintiff must exhaust his administrative remedies by filing a charge of discrimination with the EEOC. <em>Gregory v. Ga. Dep\u2019t of Human Res., </em>355 F.3d 1277, 1279 (11th Cir.2004). A plaintiffs judicial complaint is limited by the scope of the EEOC investigation that \u201ccan reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1280 (quoting <em>Alexander v. Fulton County, Ga., </em>207 F.3d 1303, 1332 (11th Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">Wills did not administratively exhaust any claim that his suspension in 2004 or his termination in 2005 constituted discrimination on the basis of race. Further, because Wills\u2019s EEOC complaint did not mention any harassment except a single incident that occurred on September 23, 2003, that was the only harassment claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>to be exhausted. Thus the district court did not err in barring these claims for failure to exhaust available administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Wills also argues that the USPS violated Title VII when it treated him differently because of his race in denying him forklift training, requiring him to work on a holiday, denying him the opportunity to work requested overtime, requiring him to work two machines simultaneously, and requiring him to operate a machine with a defective \u201cstop\u201d button. To establish a prima <em>facie </em>case of disparate treatment based on race, an employee must show that: (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he was subject to an adverse employment action; (3) his employer treated similarly situated employees who were not members of his class more favorably; and (4) he was qualified for the job or benefit at issue. <em>Gillis v. Ga. Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>400 F.3d 883, 887 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Here, Wills provided numerous examples of situations in which he felt he was mistreated, but he failed to show that he was treated differently because of his race. Indeed, in many instances, white employees were subject to the same treatment. Thus, because Wills did not show that he was treated differently than any other similarly situated employees, the USPS was entitled to summary judgment on his Title VII disparate treatment claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Wills also argues that he was subject to racial harassment by the USPS in violation of Title VII. To establish a hostile work environment under Title VII, an employee must demonstrate that: (1) he belongs to a protected group; (2) he has been subjected to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment was based on the protected characteristic; (4) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of employment and thus create a discriminatorily abusive work environment; and (5) the employer is responsible for that environment under a theory of either direct or vicarious liability. <em>Miller v. Kenworth of Dothan, Inc., </em>277 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">As discussed above, Wills exhausted only one claim of racial harassment \u2014 that on September 23, 2003, a supervisor was hostile to him. He did not show that this single incident was tied to his race, nor that it was sufficiently severe or pervasive as to alter the terms and conditions of his employment. Accordingly, the district court did not err by granting summary judgment on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">Wills also argues that the USPS retaliated against him, in violation of Title VII, in response to his filing of a complaint with the EEOC. To state a claim for retaliation under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a), an employee must prove that \u201che engaged in statutorily protected activity, he suffered a materially adverse action, and there was some causal relation between the two events.\u201d <em>Goldsmith v. Bagby Elevator Co., Inc., </em>513 F.3d 1261, 1277 (11th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, </em>548 U.S. 53, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006)). The filing of an EEOC charge constitutes a \u201cstatutorily protected activity.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(applying this analysis in a case where the employee was fried after filing a charge with the EEOC).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">\u201cAfter the plaintiff has established the elements of a claim, the employer has an opportunity to articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the challenged employment action as an affirmative defense to liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the employer does so, the plaintiff may prevail only by \u201cdemonstrat[ing] that the proffered reason was not the true reason for the employment deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>sion ... by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or ... by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Texas Dep\u2019t of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 256, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Here, the USPS offered Wills\u2019s excessive absences as a legitimate, nondiscriminatory explanation for its actions, and, therefore, Wills was required to demonstrate that that reason was pretextual. He did not present any evidence to show that the USPS didn\u2019t actually believe that its leave calculations and records were correct or that the true reason for suspending Wills was in retaliation for his EEOC charge. Accordingly, summary judgment for the USPS was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Wills also argues that he was discriminated against because of mental and emotional disabilities in violation of the Rehabilitation Act. To qualify as disabled, a plaintiff must have an impairment that \u201csubstantially limits one or more major life activities.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 705(9)(B). Although the record showed that Wills had mental impairments, it did not show that he was substantially limited in any major life activity. Thus, the USPS was entitled to summary judgment on Wills\u2019s Rehabilitation Act claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Wills also brings a claim against the USPS arguing that it negligently retained Wills\u2019s supervisor. The district court properly found that this tort claim could only be brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2671 <em>et </em>seq.(\u201cFTCA\u201d), and that under the FTCA Wills had named the wrong defendant, the USPS, rather than the United States. Even if this flaw had not waived Wills\u2019s tort claim, it was still properly dismissed for lack of exhaustion.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">A federal court has no subject matter jurisdiction over a suit against the United States unless the plaintiff has first filed an administrative claim with the concerned agency pursuant to \u00a7 2675(a) that contains a \u201cclaim for money damages in a sum certain.\u201d <em>Dalrymple v. United States, </em>460 F.3d 1318, 1324 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cWhen the sum certain is omitted, the administrative claim fails to meet the statutory prerequisite to maintaining a suit against the government, and leaves the district court without jurisdiction to hear the case.\u201d <em>Suarez v. United States, </em>22 F.3d 1064, 1065 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">Here, the record shows that Wills did not comply with the FTCA\u2019s exhaustion requirements. Specifically, he never presented to the USPS an administrative claim stating a sum certain. Accordingly, his claim of negligent retention was precluded under the FTCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b776-6\">. In addition to appealing the summary judgment rulings, Wills argues that the district court erred in denying his motions for appointment of counsel. Even if this claim were not waived by Wills's failure to object to the denials below, this Court reviews the denial of a motion to appoint counsel only for abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Berger, </em>375 F.3d 1223, 1226 (11th Cir.2004). Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(1), a court may appoint counsel for indigent plaintiffs, but only in exceptional circumstances. <em>Bass v. Perrin, </em>170 F.3d 1312, 1320 (11th Cir.1999). Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the facts and legal issues relating to Wills\u2019s Title VII, Rehabilitation Act, and tort claims were not so novel or complex as to constitute exceptional circumstances warranting appointment of counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b776-12\">. With respect to his suspension, Wills also argues that he was wrongfully suspended for absences that were covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 6381, <em>et seq. </em>(\"FMLA\u201d). However, since the FMLA does not provide a private cause of action for federal government employees against their government employers, <em>see id., </em>the district court was correct to analyze Wills\u2019s discrimination claims under only Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
