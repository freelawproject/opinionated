Jackson appeals an order of the District Court granting summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>ment to the federal government on his claims of racial discrimination and retaliation arising under Title VII. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Because we write exclusively for the parties, we will recount only those facts essential to our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">This case arises from Jackson\u2019s unsuccessful attempts to become a Special Agent of the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). Although the Philadelphia Field Division of the DEA recommended Jackson for hire, his first application was rejected after a background investigation revealed that he had made contradictory statements regarding marijuana use.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On three applications, Jackson stated variously that he had used marijuana: 3-4 times (DEA internship application), 4-6 times (DEA Special Agent application), and never (application for top secret security clearance).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">In light of the foregoing, Jackson submitted a written apology to the Office of Security Programs, admitting that he failed to mention his youthful indiscretions to improve his chances at becoming a military counter-intelligence agent. App. 551-52. Following Jackson\u2019s apology, his application was reactivated, but the Chief of the Recruitment and Placement Section of the DEA\u2019s Office of Personnel, Kenneth Dickinson, did not recommend Jackson. Pursuant to DEA policy, Chief Dickinson referred the matter to an \u201c1811 Hiring Panel\u201d for review of his decision. All three members of the 1811 Hiring Panel voted to disapprove Jackson\u2019s application. Jackson then filed an EEO complaint alleging racial discrimination, which was denied by the Department of Justice (DOJ).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-12\">Instead of seeking review of the DOJ\u2019s final agency action, Jackson reapplied\u2014 pursuant to a later vacancy announcement \u2014 for the same Special Agent position for which he had been rejected. Because Jackson failed to submit any new information concerning the basis of the DEA\u2019s prior denial of his application, the DEA treated Jackson\u2019s second application as a reconsideration request and referred it to Richard Ludowig, who was Chairman of the DEA\u2019s Reconsideration Panel. After reviewing Jackson\u2019s file and finding it devoid of any new information in mitigation of Jackson\u2019s prior misrepresentations, Ludowig denied Jackson\u2019s re-application without referring the matter to a Reconsideration Panel. Ludowig testified that he did not recall being aware of Jackson\u2019s prior EEO complaint at the time he denied his re-application.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">Following Ludowig\u2019s denial, Jackson added a retaliation claim, alleging that the DEA treated his second application differently because he previously filed an EEO complaint regarding the handling of his application. The DOJ issued a final agency decision finding no discrimination based on race or retaliation on account of Jackson\u2019s EEO activity. Jackson filed a timely appeal to the District Court and, following its entry of summary judgment, filed a timely appeal here.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-15\">We discern Jackson\u2019s principal claim to be that the DEA should not have treated his second application as a re-application and that the rejection thereof evidences a systemic pattern and practice of racial dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>crimination in hiring by the DEA. The District Court granted the DEA summary judgment on the racial discrimination claim, finding that Jackson did not proffer any evidence of pretext under <em>Fuentes v. Perskie, </em>32 F.3d 759 (3d Cir.1994). <em>See Jackson v. Ashcroft, </em>No. 02-8298, at *9 (E.D.Pa. Mar. 16, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">On appeal, Jackson does not cite any evidence of record to establish a triable issue of fact regarding pretext. Instead, he argues that the DEA treated similarly situated white applicants more favorably than him. Jackson\u2019s support of this claim is plainly insufficient. First, as the Government correctly notes, the so-called \u201caffidavit\u201d of Arthur Reed is neither a sworn affidavit nor an unsworn declaration under penalty of perjury as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746. Thus, it is invalid as evidence. Second, the first three white comparators cited by Jackson were hired initially, not on reconsideration. Finally, Jackson cites the case of \u201cApplicant G,\u201d who was reconsidered after an initial rejection for making false statements on his application. In that case, however, the Hiring Panel had not made a formal decision and the applicant submitted additional information to rebut the file report that he had lied in his application. App. 643-45, 571-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">In sum, Jackson has not cited any record evidence that undermines the Government\u2019s position that applicants who reapply for a Special Agent position \u2014 but who proffer no new facts in mitigation of their prior misrepresentations \u2014 are neither entitled to a reconsideration hearing nor entitled to be considered as new applicants. Instead of identifying any applicants who received a reconsideration hearing in the absence of mitigating evidence, Jackson speculates that the DEA could or should have advised candidates that additional mitigating facts are a pre-condition for reconsideration. There is nothing in the record to suggest that this, in fact, is a typical DEA practice or policy. As such, Jackson\u2019s evidence is insufficient to raise a genuine issue of pretextual discrimination. <em>Lexington Ins. Co. v. W. Penn. Hosp., </em>423 F.3d 318, 333 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">Jackson next claims that the District Court erred in entering summary judgment against him on his retaliation claim. We reject this argument out of hand because the record is devoid of a triable issue of material fact regarding Agent Ludowig\u2019s knowledge about Jackson\u2019s prior EEO complaint. Even if Reed\u2019s testimony constituted competent evidence (which it does not), his speculation that Jackson\u2019s EEO activity \u201cwould have been\u201d known by Ludowig is plainly insufficient to withstand the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">For all the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b167-9\">. That investigation also indicated that Jackson had two arrests for domestic abuse that were dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
