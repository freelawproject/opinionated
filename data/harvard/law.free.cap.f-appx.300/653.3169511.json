Diggs argues that this sentence is proeedurally and substantively unreasonable, in that the district court (1) did not afford Diggs an opportunity to speak before deciding to impose a sentence within the guidelines imprisonment range, (2) only considered one 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factor, (3) did not adequately explain its choice of sentence, and (4) imposed a sentence greater than necessary. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">On the afternoon in question, 22-year-old Diggs and a codefendant armed themselves, entered a bank, and yelled for the bank\u2019s staff and customers to lay on the floor. Diggs fired a round into the bank\u2019s ceiling and began searching for additional staff and customers in the bank\u2019s offices. His codefendant vaulted the teller counter and began collecting money from the teller drawers. Diggs and his codefendant ultimately collected $25,240. They then fled the bank in Diggs\u2019s car. The police ultimately tracked down and arrested both men. In a post-arrest interview with authorities, Diggs apologized for his crime and for frightening the people in the bank that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-12\">Regarding Count 1, a probation officer set Diggs\u2019s base offense level at 20, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(a); added two levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(l), because Diggs robbed a financial institution; added one level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(7)(B), because Diggs robbed the financial institution of more than $10,000; and subtracted two levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(a), because Diggs accepted responsibility for his actions. The probation officer set Diggs\u2019s criminal history category at I, as he had no prior criminal history. With a total offense level of 21 and a criminal history category of I, Diggs\u2019s recommended guideline imprisonment range for this count was 37 to 46 months. Regarding Count 2, the probation officer noted that, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4(b), the mandatory consecutive ten-year term of imprisonment required by \u00a7 924(c) controlled. The probation officer concluded that Diggs\u2019s total guideline imprisonment range was 157 to 166 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-13\">At a sentencing hearing, the district court adopted the probation officer\u2019s calculations, but subtracted another level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(b), because Diggs timely notified the government of his intent to plead guilty. Thus, Diggs\u2019s guideline imprisonment range as to this Count I was 33 to 41 months and his total guideline imprisonment range was 153 to 161 months. Diggs did not object to the court\u2019s calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-14\">Diggs requested a downward variance, specifically 120 months\u2019 and one day\u2019s im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>prisonment. To this end, Diggs argued that he only was 22 years old, had worked his entire life and helped his single mother support his younger siblings, and never had been in trouble before. The district court denied Diggs\u2019s request for a non-guidelines sentence. The court reasoned that (1) the Guidelines adequately took into account that Diggs had no prior criminal history and (2) Diggs\u2019s crime involved a \u201cviolent, scary act of premeditated criminal conduct\u201d that must be \u201cseverely punished.\u201d Diggs requested a sentence at the low end of the guideline imprisonment range.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The district court gave Diggs the opportunity to speak on his own behalf before the sentence was imposed, but Diggs declined to do so. The court sentenced Diggs to 83 months\u2019 imprisonment as to Count 1 and 120 consecutive months\u2019 imprisonment as to Count 2. The court explained that it found a sentence at the low end of the guidelines imprisonment range adequate in light of the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of Diggs \u2014 namely that he was young and had no prior criminal history, the need for the sentence imposed to adequately reflect the seriousness of the offense, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. The court concluded that the sentence imposed was reasonable in light of \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the sentencing court first must correctly calculate the guideline imprisonment range and then must treat that range as advisory and impose a reasonable sentence. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Specifically, the district court must impose a sentence that is both procedurally and substantively reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180,1182 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The Supreme Court has held that the reasonableness of a sentence is reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 597. \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-13\">The Supreme Court has explained that a sentence may be procedurally unreasonable if the district court improperly calculates the guideline imprisonment range, treats the Guidelines as mandatory, fails to consider the appropriate statutory factors, bases the sentence on clearly erroneous facts, or fails to adequately explain its reasoning. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at -, 128 S.Ct. at 597. The Supreme Court instructed that the court \u201cshould set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that [it] has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decision making authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(i)(4)(A) instructs the court that, before imposing a sentence, it must</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0i\">(i) provide the defendant\u2019s attorney an opportunity to speak on the defendant\u2019s behalf;(ii) address the defendant personally in order to permit the defendant to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence; and (iii) provide an attorney for the government an opportunity to speak equivalent to that of the defendant\u2019s attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-16\">The Supreme Court also has explained that review for substantive reasonableness involves inquiring whether the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at-, 128 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>S.Ct. at 598-99. Pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a), the sentencing court shall impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to comply with the purposes of sentencing listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), namely reflecting the seriousness of the offense, promoting respect for the law, providing just punishment for the offense, deterring criminal conduct, protecting the public from future criminal conduct by the defendant, and providing the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The statute also instructs the sentencing court to consider certain factors, including the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The district court did not impose a procedurally or substantively unreasonable sentence. <em>See Hunt, </em>459 F.3d at 1182 n. 3; <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 597.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> First, the court gave Diggs the opportunity to speak before imposing a sentence on him, as required by Rule 32(i)(4)(A). Although the court already had denied Diggs\u2019s request for a downward variance, and thus implied that it would impose a sentence within the guidelines imprisonment range, Diggs has not shown that the court already had decided on a specific sentence, and thus effectively imposed a sentence, before allowing him to speak. Thus, Diggs\u2019s sentence is not procedurally unreasonable for this reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">Also, although Diggs argues that the district court only considered the seriousness of the offense, the court heard arguments on Diggs\u2019s youth, work history, and criminal history, and also specifically stated that it had considered Diggs\u2019s youth and prior criminal history, such that it clearly considered the nature and characteristics of the defendant. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). The court also explicitly stated that it had considered the nature and circumstances of the offense and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2), (6). Thus, Diggs\u2019s sentence is not procedurally unreasonable for this reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">Furthermore, the district court considered the parties\u2019 arguments and explained that its choice of sentence had to do with the fact that Diggs\u2019s crime was a \u201cviolent, scary act of premeditated criminal conduct\u201d that must be \u201cseverely punished.\u201d This explanation was sufficient to show that the court had a reasoned basis for imposing the sentence in question. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. at-, 127 S.Ct. at 2468. Thus, Diggs\u2019s sentence is not procedurally unreasonable for this reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-13\">Finally, the district court explained that it believed the sentence to be adequate in light of the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of Diggs, and the need for the sentence imposed to adequately reflect the seriousness of the offense. Given the seriousness of Diggs\u2019s crime, which involved shooting a gun in a room full of people, his sentence was in keeping with the factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 598-99. Thus, Diggs\u2019s sentence is not substantively unreasonable for this reason. In conclusion, Diggs\u2019s sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>was neither procedurally nor substantively unreasonable. <em>See Hunt, </em>459 F.3d at 1182 n. 3; <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 597. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-8\">. The government suggests on appeal that we review Diggs\u2019s allocution argument for plain error only, because he failed to raise this objection before the district court. We need not determine, however, whether plain error review is appropriate regarding any of Diggs's specific arguments, as the district court did not commit error, much less plain error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
