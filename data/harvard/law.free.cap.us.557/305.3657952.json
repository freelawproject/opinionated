The question presented is whether those affidavits are \u201ctestimonial,\u201d rendering the affiants \u201cwitnesses\u201d subject to the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">In 2001, Boston police officers received a tip that a Kmart employee, Thomas Wright, was engaging in suspicious activ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>ity. The informant reported that Wright repeatedly received phone calls at work, after each of which he would be picked up in front of the store by a blue sedan, and would return to the store a short time later. The police set up surveillance in the Kmart parking lot and witnessed this precise sequence of events. When Wright got out of the car upon his return, one of the officers detained and searched him, finding four clear white plastic bags containing a substance resembling cocaine. The officer then signaled other officers on the scene to arrest the two men in the car \u2014 one of whom was petitioner Luis Melendez-Diaz. The officers placed all three men in a police cruiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">During the short drive to the police station, the officers observed their passengers fidgeting and making furtive movements in the back of the car. After depositing the men at the station, they searched the police cruiser and found a plastic bag containing 19 smaller plastic bags hidden in the partition between the front and back seats. They submitted the seized evidence to a state laboratory required by law to conduct chemical analysis upon police request. Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 111, \u00a712 (West 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Melendez-Diaz was charged with distributing cocaine and with trafficking in cocaine in an amount between 14 and 28 grams. Ch. 94C, \u00a7\u00a732A, 32E(b)(1). At trial, the prosecution placed into evidence the bags seized from Wright and from the police cruiser. It also submitted three \u201ccertificates of analysis\u201d showing the results of the forensic analysis performed on the seized substances. The certificates reported the weight of the seized bags and stated that the bags \u201c[h]a[ve] been examined with the following results: The substance was found to contain: Cocaine.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a, 26a, 28a. The certificates were sworn to before a notary public by analysts at the State Laboratory Institute of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, as required under Massachusetts law. Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 111, \u00a7 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Petitioner objected to the admission of the certificates, asserting that our Confrontation Clause decision in <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U. S. 36 (2004), required the analysts to testify in person. The objection was overruled, and the certificates were admitted pursuant to state law as \u201cprima facie evidence of the composition, quality, and the net weight of the narcotic . . . analyzed.\u201d Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 111, \u00a7 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The jury found Melendez-Diaz guilty. He appealed, contending, among other, things, that admission of the certificates violated his Sixth Amendment right to be confronted with the witnesses against him. The Appeals Court of Massachusetts rejected the claim, affirmance order, 69 Mass. App. 1114, 870 N. E. 2d 676, 2007 WL 2189152, *4, n. 3 (July 31, 2007), relying on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Verde, </em>444 Mass. 279, 283-285, 827 N. E. 2d 701, 705-706 (2005), which held that the authors of certificates of forensic analysis are not subject to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment. The Supreme Judicial Court denied review. 449 Mass. 1113, 874 N. E. 2d 407 (2007). We granted certiorari. 552 U. S. 1256 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, made applicable to the States via the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>380 U. S. 400, 403 (1965), provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d In <em>Crawford, </em>after reviewing the Clause\u2019s historical underpinnings, we held that it guarantees a defendant\u2019s right to confront those \u201cwho \u2018bear testimony\u2019 \u201d against him. 541 U. S., at 51. A witness\u2019s testimony against a defendant is thus inadmissible unless the witness appears at trial or, if the witness is unavailable, the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. <em>Id., </em>at 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Our opinion described the class of testimonial statements covered by the Confrontation Clause as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>\u201cVarious formulations of this core class of testimonial statements exist: <em>ex parte </em>in-court testimony or its functional equivalent \u2014 that is, material such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially; extrajudicial statements . . . contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions; statements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 51-52 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">There is little doubt that the documents at issue in this case fall within the \u201ccore class of testimonial statements\u201d thus described. Our description of that category mentions affidavits twice. See also <em>White </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>502 U. S. 346, 365 (1992) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\u201c[T]he Confrontation Clause is implicated by extrajudicial statements only insofar as they are contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions\u201d). The documents at issue here, while denominated by Massachusetts law \u201ccertificates,\u201d are quite plainly affidavits: \u201cdeclaration[s] of facts written down and sworn to by the declarant before an officer authorized to administer oaths.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 62 (8th ed. 2004). They are incontrovertibly a \u201c \u2018solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crawford, supra, </em>at 51 (quoting 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828)). The fact in question is that the substance found in the possession of Melendez-Diaz and his codefendants was, as the prosecution claimed, cocaine \u2014 the precise testimony the analysts would be expected to provide if called at trial. The \u201ccertificates\u201d are functionally identical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>to live, in-court testimony, doing \u201cprecisely what a witness does on direct examination.\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>547 U. S. 813, 830 (2006) (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Here, moreover,, not only were the affidavits \u201c \u2018made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial,\u2019\u201d <em>Crawford, supra, </em>at 52, but under Massachusetts law the <em>sole purpose </em>of the affidavits was to provide \u201cprima facie evidence of the composition, quality, and the net weight\u201d of the analyzed substance, Mass., Gen. Laws, ch. 111, \u00a713. We can safely assume that the analysts were aware of the affidavits\u2019 evidentiary purpose, since that purpose \u2014 as stated in the relevant state-law provision \u2014 was reprinted on the affidavits themselves. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 25a, 27a, 29a.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">In short, under our decision in <em>Crawford </em>the analysts\u2019 affidavits were testimonial statements, and the analysts were \u201cwitnesses\u201d for purposes of the Sixth Amendment. Absent a showing that the analysts were unavailable to testify at trial <em>and </em>that petitioner had a prior opportunity to cross-examine them, petitioner was entitled to \u201c\u2018be confronted with\u2019 \u201d the analysts at trial. <em>Crawford, supra, </em>at 54.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AgL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Respondent and the dissent advance a potpourri of analytic arguments in an effort to avoid this rather straightforward application of our holding in <em>Crawford. </em>Before addressing them, however, we must assure the reader of the falsity of the dissent\u2019s opening alarum that we are \u201csweeping] away an accepted rule governing the admission of scientific evidence\u201d that has been \u201cestablished for at least 90 years\u201d and \u201cextends across at least 35 States and six Federal Courts of Appeals.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The vast majority of the state-court cases the dissent cites in support of this claim come not from the last 90 years, but from the last 30, and not surprisingly nearly all of them rely on our decision in <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>448 U. S. 56 (1980), or its since-rejected theory that unconfronted testimony was admissible as long as it bore indicia of reliability, <em>id., </em>at 66. See <em>post, </em>at 357-358.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As for the six Federal Courts of Appeals cases cited by the dissent, five of them postdated and expressly relied on <em>Roberts. </em>See <em>post, </em>at 349-350. The sixth predated <em>Roberts </em>but relied entirely on the same erroneous theory. See <em>Kay </em>v. <em>United States, </em>255 F. 2d 476, 480-481 (CA4 1958) (rejecting Confrontation Clause challenge \u201cwhere there is reasonable necessity for [the evidence] and where . . . the evidence has those qualities of reliability and trustworthiness\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">A review of cases that predate the <em>Roberts </em>era yields a mixed picture. As the dissent notes, three State Supreme Court decisions from the early 20th century denied confrontation with respect to certificates of analysis regarding a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>substance\u2019s alcohol content. See <em>post, </em>at 349 (citing cases from Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Virginia). But other state courts in the same era reached the opposite conclusion. See <em>Torres </em>v. <em>State, </em>113 Tex. Crim. 1, 2-4, 18 S. W. 2d 179, 180 (1929); <em>Volrich </em>v. <em>State, 4 </em>Ohio L. Abs. 253 (App. 1925) <em>(per curiam). </em>At least this much is entirely clear: In faithfully applying <em>Crawford </em>to the facts of this case, we are not overruling 90 years of settled jurisprudence. It is the dissent that seeks to overturn precedent by resurrecting <em>Roberts </em>a mere five years after it was rejected in <em>Crawford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">We turn now to the various legal arguments raised by respondent and the dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Respondent first argues that the analysts are not subject to confrontation because they are not \u201caccusatory\u201d witnesses, in that they do not directly accuse petitioner of wrongdoing; rather, their testimony is inculpatory only when taken together with other evidence linking petitioner to the contraband. See Brief for Respondent 10. This finds no support in the text of the Sixth Amendment or in our case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">The Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the right \u201cto be confronted with the witnesses <em>against him.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) To the extent the analysts were witnesses (a question resolved above), they certainly provided testimony <em>against </em>petitioner, proving one fact necessary for his conviction \u2014 that the substance he possessed was cocaine. The contrast between the text of the Confrontation Clause and the text of the adjacent Compulsory Process Clause confirms this analysis. While the Confrontation Clause guarantees a defendant the right to be confronted with the witnesses \u201cagainst him,\u201d the Compulsory Process Clause guarantees a defendant the right to call witnesses \u201cin his favor.\u201d U. S. Const., Arndt. 6. The text of the Amendment contemplates two classes of witnesses \u2014 those against the defendant and those in his favor. The prosecution <em>must </em>produce the for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>mer;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the defendant <em>may </em>call the latter. Contrary to respondent\u2019s assertion, there is not a third category of witnesses, helpful to the prosecution, but somehow immune from confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">It is often, indeed perhaps usually, the ease that an adverse witness\u2019s testimony, taken alone, will not suffice to convict. Yet respondent fails to cite a single case in which such testimony was admitted absent a defendant\u2019s opportunity to cross-examine.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Unsurprisingly, since such a holding would be contrary to longstanding case law. In <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 174 U. S. 47 (1899), the Court considered Kirby\u2019s conviction for receiving stolen property, the evidence for which consisted, in part, of the records of conviction of three individuals who were found guilty of stealing the relevant property. <em>Id., </em>at 53. Though this evidence proved only that the property was stolen, and not that Kirby received it, the Court nevertheless ruled that admission of the records violated Kirby\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause. <em>Id., </em>at 55. See also <em>King </em>v. <em>Turner, 1 </em>Mood. 347, 168 Eng. Rep. 1298 (1832) (confession by one defendant <em>to </em>having stolen certain goods could not be used as evidence against another defendant accused of receiving the stolen property).</p>\n<p id=\"Apq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">Respondent and the dissent argue that the analysts should not be subject to confrontation because they are not \u201cconventional\u201d (or \u201ctypical\u201d or \u201cordinary\u201d) witnesses of the sort whose <em>ex parte </em>testimony was most notoriously used at the trial of Sir Walter Raleigh. <em>Post, </em>at 343-345; Brief for Respondent 28. It is true, as the Court recognized in <em>Crawford, </em>that <em>ex parte </em>examinations of the sort used at Raleigh\u2019s trial have \u201clong been thought a paradigmatic confrontation violation.\u201d 541 U. S., at 52. But the paradigmatic case identifies the core of the right to confrontation, not its limits. The right to confrontation was not invented in response to the use of the <em>ex parte </em>examinations in <em>Raleigh\u2019s Case, </em>2 How. St. Tr. 1 (1603). That use provoked such an outcry precisely because it flouted the deeply rooted common-law tradition \u201cof live testimony in court subject to adversarial testing.\u201d <em>Crawford, supra, </em>at 43 (citing 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 373-374 (1768)). See also <em>Crawford, supra, </em>at 43-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">In any case, the purported distinctions respondent and the dissent identify between this case and Sir Walter Raleigh\u2019s \u201cconventional\u201d accusers do not survive scrutiny. The dissent first contends that a \u201cconventional witness recalls events observed in the past, while an analyst\u2019s report contains near-contemporaneous observations of the test.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 345. It is doubtful that the analyst\u2019s reports, in this case could be characterized as reporting \u201cnear-contemporaneous observations\u201d; the affidavits were completed almost a week after the tests were performed. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a-29a (the tests were performed on November 28, 2001, and the affidavits sworn on December 4, 2001). But regardless, the dissent misunderstands the role that \u201cnear-contemporaneity\u201d has played in our case law. The dissent notes that that factor was given \u201csubstantial weight\u201d in <em>Davis, post, </em>at 345, but in fact that decision <em>disproves </em>the dissent\u2019s position. There the Court considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>the admissibility of statements made to police officers responding to a report of a domestic disturbance. By the time officers arrived the assault had ended, but the victim\u2019s statements \u2014 written and oral \u2014 were sufficiently close in time to the alleged assault that the trial court admitted her affidavit as a \u201cpresent sense impression.\u201d 547 U. S., at 820 (internal quotation marks omitted). Though the witness\u2019s statements in <em>Davis </em>were \u201cnear-contemporaneous\u201d to the events she reported, we nevertheless held that they could not.be admitted absent an opportunity to confront the witness. <em>Id., </em>at 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">A second reason the dissent contends that the analysts are not \u201cconventional witnesses\u201d (and thus not subject to confrontation) is that they \u201cobserve[d] neither the crime nor any human action related to it.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 345. The dissent provides no authority for this particular limitation of the type of witnesses subject to confrontation. Nor is it conceivable that all witnesses who fit this description would be outside the scope of the Confrontation Clause. For example, is a police officer\u2019s investigative report describing the crime scene admissible absent an opportunity to examine the officer? The dissent\u2019s novel exception from coverage of the Confrontation Clause would exempt all expert witnesses \u2014 a hardly \u201cunconventional\u201d class of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">A third respect in which the dissent asserts that the analysts are not \u201cconventional\u201d witnesses and thus not subject to confrontation is that their statements were not provided in response to interrogation. <em>Post, </em>at 345-346. See also Brief for Respondent 29. As we have explained, \u201c[t]he Framers were no more willing to exempt from cross-examination volunteered testimony or answers to open-ended questions than they were to exempt answers to detailed interrogation.\u201d <em>Davis, supra, </em>at 822-823, n. 1. Respondent and the dissent cite no authority, and we are aware of none, holding that a person who volunteers his testimony is any less a \u201c 'witness against\u2019 the defendant,\u201d Brief for Respondent 26, than one who is responding to interrogation. In any event, the ana<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>lysts\u2019 affidavits in this case <em>were </em>presented in response to a police request. See Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 111, \u00a7\u00a7 12-13. If an affidavit submitted in response to a police officer\u2019s request to \u201cwrite down what happened\u201d suffices to trigger the Sixth Amendment\u2019s protection (as it apparently does, see <em>Davis, </em>547 U. S., at 819-820; <em>id., </em>at 840, n. 5 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part)), then the analysts\u2019 testimony should be subject to confrontation as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Respondent claims that there is a difference, for Confrontation Clause purposes, between testimony recounting historical events, which is \u201cprone to distortion or manipulation,\u201d and the testimony at issue here, which is the \u201cresul[t] of neutral, scientific testing.\u201d Brief for Respondent 29. Relatedly, respondent and the dissent argue that confrontation of forensic analysts would be of little value because \u201cone would not reasonably expect a laboratory professional ... to feel quite differently about the results of his scientific test by having to look at the defendant.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 31 (internal quotation marks omitted); see <em>post, </em>at 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">This argument is little more than an invitation to return to our overruled decision in <em>Roberts, </em>448 U. S. 56, which held that evidence with \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d was admissible notwithstanding the Confrontation Clause. <em>Id., </em>at 66. What we said in <em>Crawford </em>in response to that argument remains true:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-8\">\u201cTo be sure, the Clause\u2019s ultimate goal is to ensure reliability of evidence, but it is a procedural rather than a substantive guarantee. It commands, not that evidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-9\">\u201cDispensing with confrontation because testimony is obviously reliable is akin to dispensing with jury trial be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>cause a defendant is obviously guilty. This is not what the Sixth Amendment prescribes.\u201d 541 U. S., at 61-62.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Respondent and the dissent may be right that there are other ways \u2014 and in some cases better ways \u2014 to challenge or verify the results of a forensic test.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But the Constitution guarantees one way: confrontation. We do not have license to suspend the Confrontation Clause when a preferable trial strategy is available.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Nor is it evident that what respondent calls \u201cneutral scientific testing\u201d is as neutral or as reliable as respondent suggests. Forensic evidence is not uniquely immune from the risk of manipulation. According to a recent study conducted under the auspices of the National Academy of Sciences, \u201c[t]he majority of [laboratories producing forensic evidence] are administered by law enforcement agencies, such as police departments, where the laboratory administrator reports to the head of the agency.\u201d National Research Council of the National Academies, Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward 183 (2009) (hereinafter National Academy Report). And \u201c[b]ecause forensic scientists often are driven in their work by a need to answer a particular question related to the issues of a particular case, they sometimes face pressure to sacrifice appropriate methodology for the sake of expediency.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 23-24. A forensic analyst responding to a request from a law enforcement official may feel pressure \u2014 or have an incentive \u2014 to alter the evidence in a manner favorable to the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Confrontation ,is one means of ensuring accurate forensic analysis. While it is true, as the dissent notes, that an honest analyst will not alter his testimony when forced to confront the defendant, <em>post, </em>at 339, the same cannot be said of the fraudulent analyst. See Brief for National Innocence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Network as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>15-17 (discussing cases of documented \u201cdrylabbing\u201d where forensic analysts report results of tests that were never performed); National Academy Report 44-48 (discussing documented cases of fraud and error involving the use of forensic evidence). Like the eyewitness who has fabricated his account to the police, the analyst who provides false results may, under oath in open court, reconsider his false testimony. See <em>Coy </em>v. <em>Iowa, </em>487 U. S. 1012, 1019 (1988). And, of course, the prospect of confrontation will deter fraudulent analysis in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Confrontation is designed to weed out not only the fraudulent analyst, but the incompetent one as well. Serious deficiencies have been found in the forensic evidence used in criminal trials. One commentator asserts that \u201c[t]he legal community now concedes, with varying degrees of urgency, that our system produces erroneous convictions based on discredited forensics.\u201d Metzger, Cheating the Constitution, 59 Vand. L. Rev. 475, 491 (2006). One study of cases in which exonerating evidence resulted in the overturning of criminal convictions concluded that invalid forensic testimony contributed to the convictions in 60% of the cases. Garrett <em>&amp; </em>Neufeld, Invalid Forensic Science Testimony and Wrongful Convictions, 95 Va. L. Rev. 1, 14 (2009). And the National Academy Report concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">\u201cThe forensic science system, encompassing both research and practice, has serious problems that can only be addressed by a national commitment to overhaul the current structure that supports the forensic science community in this country.\u201d National Academy Report, at <em>xx.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Like expert witnesses generally, an analyst\u2019s lack of proper training or deficiency in judgment may be disclosed in cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">This case is illustrative. The affidavits submitted by the analysts contained only the bare-bones statement that \u201c[t]he substance was found to contain: Cocaine.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a, 26a, 28a. At the time of trial, petitioner did not know what tests the analysts performed, whether those tests were routine, and whether interpreting their results required the exercise of judgment or the use of skills that the analysts may not have possessed. While we still do not know the precise tests used by the analysts, we are told that the laboratories use \u201cmethodology recommended by the Scientific Working Group for the Analysis of Seized Drugs,\u201d App. to Brief for Petitioner la-2a. At least some of that methodology requires the exercise of judgment and presents a risk of error that might be explored on cross-examination. See 2 P. Giannelli &amp; E. Imwinkelried, Scientific Evidence \u00a723.03[c], pp. 532-533, and ch. 23A, p. 607 (4th ed. 2007) (identifying four \u201ccritical errors\u201d that analysts may commit in interpreting the results of the commonly used gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis); Shellow, The Application of <em>Daubert </em>to the Identification of Drugs, 2 Shepard\u2019s Expert &amp; Scientific Evidence Quarterly 593, 600 (1995) (noting that while spectrometers may be equipped with computerized matching systems, \u201cforensic analysts in crime laboratories typically do not utilize this feature of the instrument, but rely exclusively on their subjective judgment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The same is true of many of the other types of forensic evidence commonly used in criminal prosecutions. \u201c[T]here is wide variability across forensic science disciplines with regard to techniques, methodologies, reliability, types and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>numbers of potential errors, research, general acceptability, and published material.\u201d National Academy Report 6-7. See also <em>id., </em>at 138-139, 142-143, 154-155 (discussing problems of subjectivity, bias, and unreliability of common forensic tests such as latent fingerprint analysis, pattern/ impression analysis, and toolmark and firearms analysis). Contrary to respondent\u2019s and the dissent\u2019s suggestion, there is little reason to believe that confrontation will be useless in testing analysts\u2019 honesty, proficiency, and methodology\u2014 the features that are commonly the focus in the cross-examination of experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Respondent argues that the analysts\u2019 affidavits are admissible without confrontation because they are \u201cakin to the types of official and business records admissible at common law.\u201d Brief for Respondent 35. But the affidavits do not qualify as traditional official or business records, and even if they did, their authors would be subject to confrontation nonetheless.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Documents kept in the regular course of business may ordinarily be admitted at trial despite their hearsay status. See Fed. Rule Evid. 803(6). But that is not the case if the regularly conducted business activity is the production of evidence for use at trial. Our decision in <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Hoffman, </em>318 U. S. 109 (1943), made that distinction clear. There we held that an accident report provided by an employee of a railroad company did not qualify as a business record because, although kept in the regular course of the railroad\u2019s operations, it was \u201ccalculated for use essentially in the court, not in the business.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 114.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The analysts\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>certificates \u2014 like police reports generated by law enforcement officials \u2014 do not qualify as business or public records for precisely the same reason. See Rule 803(8) (defining public records as \u201cexcluding, however, in criminal cases matters observed by police officers and other law enforcement personnel\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Respondent seeks to rebut this limitation by noting that at common law the results of a coroner\u2019s inquest were admissible without an opportunity for confrontation. But as we have previously noted, whatever the status of coroner\u2019s reports at common law in England, they were not accorded any special status in American practice. See <em>Crawford, </em>541 U. S., at 47, n. 2; <em>Giles </em>v. <em>California, </em>554 U. S. 353, 399-400 (2008) (Breyer, J., dissenting); Note, Evidence \u2014 Official Records \u2014 Coroner\u2019s Inquest, 65 U. Pa. L. Rev. 290 (1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The dissent identifies a single class of evidence which, though prepared for use at trial, was traditionally admissible: a clerk\u2019s certificate authenticating an official record \u2014 or a copy thereof \u2014 for use as evidence. See <em>post, </em>at 347. But a clerk\u2019s authority in that regard was narrowly circumscribed. He was permitted \u201cto certify to the correctness of a copy of a record kept in his office,\u201d but had \u201cno authority to furnish, as evidence for the trial of a lawsuit, his interpretation of what the record contains or shows, or to certify to its substance or effect.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>141 La. 404, 409, 75 So. 95, 97 (1917). See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Champion, </em>116 N. C. 987, 988-989, 21 S. E. 700, 700-701 (1895); 5 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a71678 (3d ed. 1940). The dissent suggests that the fact that this exception was \u201c\u2018narrowly circumscribed\u2019\u201d makes no difference. See <em>post, </em>at 348. To the contrary, it makes all the difference in the world. It shows that even the line of cases establishing the one narrow exception the dissent has been able to identify simultaneously vindicates the general rule applicable to the present case. A clerk could by affidavit <em>authenticate </em>or provide a copy of an other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>wise admissible record, but could not do what the analysts did here: <em>create </em>a record for the sole purpose of providing evidence against a defendant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">Far more probative here are those cases in which the prosecution sought to admit into evidence a clerk\u2019s certificate attesting to the fact that the clerk had searched for a particular relevant record and failed to find it. Like the testimony of the analysts in this case, the clerk\u2019s statement would serve as substantive evidence against the defendant whose guilt depended on the nonexistence of the record for which the clerk searched. Although the clerk\u2019s certificate would qualify as an official record under respondent\u2019s definition \u2014 it was prepared by a public officer in the regular course of his official duties \u2014 and although the clerk was certainly not a \u201cconventional witness\u201d under the dissent\u2019s approach, the clerk was nonetheless subject to confrontation. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Bromwich, </em>200 N. Y. 385, 388-389, 93 N. E. 933, 934 (1911); <em>People </em>v. <em>Goodrode, </em>132 Mich. 542, 547, 94 N. W. 14, 16 (1903); Wigmore, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1678.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Respondent also misunderstands the relationship between the business-and-official-records hearsay exceptions and the Confrontation Clause. As we stated in <em>Crawford: </em>\u201cMost of the hearsay exceptions covered statements that by their nature were not testimonial \u2014 for example, business records or statements in furtherance of a conspiracy.\u201d 541 U. S., at 56. Business and public records are generally admissible absent confrontation not because they qualify under an exception to the hearsay rules, but because \u2014 having been created for the administration of an entity\u2019s affairs and not for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact at trial \u2014 they are not testimonial. Whether or not they qualify as business or official records, the analysts\u2019 statements here \u2014 prepared specifically for use at petitioner\u2019s trial \u2014 were testimony against petitioner, and the analysts were subject to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Respondent asserts that we should find no Confrontation Clause violation in this case because petitioner had the ability to subpoena the analysts. But that power \u2014 whether pursuant to state law or the Compulsory Process Clause\u2014 is no substitute for the right of confrontation. Unlike the Confrontation Clause, those provisions are of no use to the defendant when the witness is unavailable or simply refuses to appear. See, <em>e. g., Davis, </em>547 U. S., at 820 (\u201c[The witness] was subpoenaed, but she did not appear at... trial\u201d). Converting the prosecution\u2019s duty under the Confrontation Clause into the defendant\u2019s privilege under state law or the Compulsory Process Clause shifts the consequences of adverse-witness no-shows from the State to the accused. More fundamentally, the Confrontation Clause imposes a burden on the prosecution to present its witnesses, not on the defendant to bring those adverse witnesses into court. Its value to the defendant is not replaced by a system in which the prosecution presents its evidence via <em>ex parte </em>af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>fidavits and waits for the defendant to subpoena the affiants if he chooses.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Finally, respondent asks us to relax the requirements of the Confrontation Clause to accommodate the \u201c'necessities of trial and the adversary process.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Respondent 59. It is not clear whence we would derive the authority to do so. The Confrontation Clause may make the prosecution of criminals more burdensome, but that is equally true of the right to trial by jury and the privilege against self-incrimination. The Confrontation Clause \u2014 like those other constitutional provisions \u2014 is binding, and we may not disregard it at our convenience.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">We also doubt the accuracy of respondent\u2019s and the dissent\u2019s dire predictions. The dissent, respondent, and its <em>amici </em>highlight the substantial total number of controlled-substance analyses performed by state and federal laboratories in recent years. But only some of those tests are implicated in prosecutions, and only a small fraction of those cases actually proceed to trial. See Brief for Law Professors as <em>Amici Curiae </em>7-8 (nearly 95% of convictions in state and federal courts are obtained via guilty plea).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Perhaps the best indication that the sky will not fall after today\u2019s decision is that it has not done so already. Many States have already adopted the constitutional rule we an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>nounce today,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> while many others permit the defendant to assert (or forfeit by silence) his Confrontation Clause right after receiving notice of the prosecution\u2019s intent to use a' forensic analyst\u2019s report, <em>id., </em>at 13-15 (cataloging such state laws). Despite these widespread practices, there is no evidence that the criminal justice system has ground to a halt in the States that, one way or another, empower a defendant to insist upon the analyst\u2019s appearance at trial. Indeed, in Massachusetts itself, a defendant may subpoena the analyst to appear at trial, see Brief for Respondent 57, and yet there is no indication that obstructionist defendants are abusing the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The dissent finds this evidence \u201cfar less reassuring than promised.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 356. But its doubts rest on two flawed premises. First, the dissent believes that those state statutes \u201crequiring the defendant to give early notice of his intent to confront the analyst\u201d are \u201cburden-shifting statutes [that] may be invalidated by the Court\u2019s reasoning.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 350, 356. That is not so. In their simplest form, notice- and-demand statutes require the prosecution to provide notice to the defendant of its intent to use an analyst\u2019s report as evidence at trial, after which the defendant is given a period of time in which he may object to the admission of the evidence absent the analyst\u2019s appearance live at trial. See, <em>e. g., </em>Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 35-3-154.1 (2006); Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 38.41, \u00a74 (Vernon 2005); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a72925.51(0 (Lexis 2006). Contrary to the dissent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>perception, these statutes shift no burden whatever. The defendant <em>always </em>has the burden of raising his Confrontation Clause objection; notice-and-demand statutes simply govern the <em>time </em>within which he must do so. States are free to adopt procedural rules governing objections. See <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Sykes, </em>433 U. S. 72, 86-87 (1977). It is common to require a defendant to exercise his rights under the Compulsory Process Clause in advance of trial, announcing his intent to present certain witnesses. See Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. 12.1(a), (e), 16(b)(1)(C); Comment, Alibi Notice Rules: The Preclusion Sanction as Procedural Default, 51 U. Chi. L. Rev. 254, 254-255, 281-285 (1984) (discussing and cataloging state notice-of-alibi rules); <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>484 U. S. 400, 411 (1988); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>399 U. S. 78, 81-82 (1970). There is no conceivable reason why he cannot similarly be compelled to exercise his Confrontation Clause rights before trial. See <em>Hinojos-Mendoza </em>v. <em>People, </em>169 P. 3d 662, 670 (Colo. 2007) (discussing and approving Colorado\u2019s notice-and-demand provision). Today\u2019s decision will not disrupt criminal prosecutions in the many large States whose practice is already in accord with the Confrontation Clause.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Second, the dissent notes that several of the state-court cases that have already adopted this rule did so pursuant to our decision in <em>Crawford, </em>and not \u201cindependently ... as a matter of state law.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 356. That may be so. But in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>assessing the likely practical effects of today\u2019s ruling, it is irrelevant <em>why </em>those courts adopted this rule; it matters only <em>that </em>they did so. It is true that many of these decisions are recent, but if the dissent\u2019s dire predictions were accurate, and given the large number of drug prosecutions at the state level, one would have expected immediate and dramatic results. The absence of such evidence is telling.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">But it is not surprising. Defense attorneys and their clients will often stipulate to the nature of the substance in the ordinary drug case. It is unlikely that defense counsel will insist on live testimony whose effect will be merely to highlight rather than cast doubt upon the forensic analysis. Nor will defense attorneys want to antagonize the judge or jury by wasting their time with the appearance of a witness whose testimony defense counsel does not intend to rebut in any fashion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The <em>amicus </em>brief filed by district attorneys in support of the Commonwealth in the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court case upon which the Appeals Court here relied said that \u201cit is almost always the case that [analysts\u2019 certificates] are admitted without objection. Generally, defendants do not object to the admission of drug certificates most likely because there is no benefit to a defendant from such testimony.\u201d Brief for District Attorneys in Support of the Commonwealth in No. SJC-09320 (Mass.), p. 7 (footnote omitted). Given these strategic considerations, and in light of the experience in those States that already provide the same or similar protections to defendants, there is little reason to believe that our decision today will commence the parade of horribles respondent and the dissent predict.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">This case involves little more than the application of our holding in <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U. S. 36. The Sixth Amendment does not permit the prosecution to prove its ease via <em>ex parte </em>out-of-court affidavits, and the admission of such evidence against Melendez-Diaz was error.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We therefore reverse the judgment of the Appeals Court of Massachusetts and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b359-7\"> Contrary to the dissent\u2019s suggestion, <em>post, </em>at 332-333, 335-336 (opinion of Kennedy, J.), we do not hold, and it is not the case, that anyone whose testimony may be relevant in establishing the chain of custody, authenticity of the sample, or accuracy of the testing device, must appear in person as part of the prosecution\u2019s ease. While the dissent is correct that \u201c[i]t is the obligation of the prosecution to establish the chain of custody,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 335, this does not mean that everyone who laid hands on the evidence must be called. As stated in the dissent\u2019s own quotation, <em>post, </em>at 336, from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lott, </em>854 F. 2d 244, 250 (CA7 1988), \u201cgaps in the chain [of custody] normally go to the weight of the evidence rather than its admissibility.\u201d It is up to the prosecution to decide what steps in the chain of custody are so crucial as to require evidence; but what testimony <em>is </em>introduced must (if the defendant objects) be introduced live. Additionally,, documents prepared in the regular course of equipment maintenance may well qualify as nontestimonial records.

In all three cases, defendants \u2014 who were prosecuted for selling adulterated milk \u2014 objected to the admission of the state chemists\u2019 certificates of analysis. In all three eases, the objection was defeated because the chemist testified live at trial.

These assumptions are wildly unrealistic, and, as discussed below, the figures they produce do not reflect what has in fact occurred in those jurisdictions that have already adopted the rule we announce today.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b374-6\"><em> State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>982 So. 2d 672, 680-681 (Fla. 2008); <em>Hinojos-Mendoza </em>v. <em>People, </em>169 P. 3d 662, 666-667 (Colo. 2007); <em>State </em>v. <em>Birchfield, </em>342 Ore. 624, 631-632, 157 P. 3d 216, 220 (2007); <em>State </em>v. <em>March, </em>216 S.

Until today, scientific analysis could be introduced into evidence without testimony from the \u201canalyst\u201d who produced it. This rule has been established for at least 90 years. It extends across at least 35 States and six Federal Courts of Appeals. Yet the Court undoes it based on two recent opinions that say nothing about forensic analysts: <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U. S. 36 (2004), and <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>547 U. S. 813 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">It is remarkable that the Court so confidently disregards a century of jurisprudence. We learn now that we have misinterpreted the Confrontation Clause \u2014 hardly an arcane or seldom-used provision of the Constitution \u2014 for the first 218 years of its existence. The immediate systemic concern is that the Court makes no attempt to acknowledge the real differences between laboratory analysts who perform scientific tests and other, more conventional witnesses\u2014 \u201cwitnesses\u201d being the word the Framers used in the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\"><em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis </em>dealt with ordinary witnesses\u2014 women who had seen, and in two cases been the victim of, the crime in question. Those cases stand for the proposition that formal statements made by a conventional witness\u2014 one who has personal knowledge of some aspect of the defendant\u2019s guilt \u2014 may not be admitted without the witness appearing at trial to meet the accused face to face. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number><em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis </em>do not say \u2014 indeed, could not have said, because the facts were not before the Court \u2014 that anyone who makes a testimonial statement is a witness for purposes of the Confrontation Clause, even when that person has, in fact, witnessed nothing to give them personal knowledge of the defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Because <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis </em>concerned typical witnesses, the Court should have done the sensible thing and limited its holding to witnesses as so defined. Indeed, as Justice Thomas warned in his opinion in <em>Davis, </em>the Court\u2019s approach has become \u201cdisconnected from history and unnecessary to prevent abuse.\u201d 547 U. S., at 838 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). The Court\u2019s reliance on the word \u201ctestimonial\u201d is of little help, of course, for that word does not appear in the text of the Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The Court dictates to the States, as a matter of constitutional law, an as-yet-undefined set of rules governing what kinds of evidence may be admitted without in-court testimony. Indeed, under today\u2019s opinion the States bear an even more onerous burden than they did before <em>Crawford. </em>Then, the States at least had the guidance of the hearsay rule and could rest assured that \u201cwhere the evidence f[ell] within a firmly rooted hearsay exception,\u201d the Confrontation Clause did not bar its admission. <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>448 U. S. 56, 66 (1980) (overruled by Crawford). Now, without guidance from any established body of law, the States can only guess what future rules this Court will distill from the sparse constitutional text. See, <em>e. g., </em>M\u00e9ndez, <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington: </em>A Critique, 57 Stan. L. Rev. 569, 586-593 (2004) (discussing unanswered questions regarding testimonial statements).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">The Court\u2019s opinion suggests this will be a body of formalistic and wooden rules, divorced from precedent, common sense, and the underlying purpose of the Clause. Its ruling has vast potential to disrupt criminal procedures that already give ample protections against the misuse of scientific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>evidence. For these reasons, as more fully explained below, the Court\u2019s opinion elicits my respectful dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">The Court says that, before the results of a scientific test may be introduced into evidence, the defendant has the right to confront the \u201canalysts.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 310-311. One must assume that this term, though it appears nowhere in the Confrontation Clause, nevertheless has some constitutional substance that now must be elaborated in future cases. There is no accepted definition of analyst, and there is no established precedent to define that term..</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Consider how many people play a role in a routine test for the presence of illegal drugs. One person prepares a sample of the drug, places it in a testing machine, and retrieves the machine\u2019s printout \u2014 often, a graph showing the frequencies of radiation absorbed by the sample or the masses of the sample\u2019s molecular fragments. See 2 P. Giannelli <em>&amp; </em>E. Imwinkelried, Scientific Evidence \u00a7 23.03 (4th ed. 2007) (describing common methods of identifying drugs, including infrared spectrophotometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, gas chromatography, and mass spectrometry). A second person interprets the graph the machine prints out \u2014 perhaps by comparing that printout with published, standardized graphs of known drugs. <em>Ibid. </em>Meanwhile, a third person \u2014 perhaps an independent contractor \u2014 has calibrated the machine and, having done so, has certified that the machine is in good working order. Finally, a fourth person \u2014 perhaps the laboratory\u2019s director \u2014 certifies that his subordinates followed established procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">It is not at all evident which of these four persons is the analyst to be confronted under the rule the Court announces today. If all are witnesses who must appear for in-court confrontation, then the Court has, for all practical purposes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>forbidden the use of scientific tests in criminal trials. As discussed further below, requiring even one of these individuals to testify threatens to disrupt if not end many prosecutions where guilt is clear but a newly found formalism now holds sway. See Part I-C, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">It is possible to read the Court\u2019s opinion, however, to say that all four must testify. Each one has contributed to the test\u2019s result and has, at least in some respects, made a representation about the test. Person One represents that a pure sample, properly drawn, entered the machine and produced a particular printout. Person Two represents that the printout corresponds to a known drug. Person Three represents that the machine was properly calibrated at the time. Person Four represents that all the others performed their jobs in accord with established procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">And each of the four has power to introduce error. A laboratory technician might adulterate the sample. The independent contractor might botch the machine\u2019s calibration. And so forth. The reasons for these errors may range from animus against the particular suspect or all criminal suspects to unintentional oversight; from gross negligence to good-faith mistake. It is no surprise that a plausible case can be made for deeming each person in the testing process an analyst under the Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Consider the independent contractor who has calibrated the testing machine. At least in a routine case, where the machine\u2019s result appears unmistakable, that result\u2019s accuracy depends entirely on the machine\u2019s calibration. The calibration, in turn, can be proved only by the contractor\u2019s certification that he or she did the job properly. That certification appears to be a testimonial statement under the Court\u2019s definition: It is a formal, out-of-court statement, offered for the truth of the matter asserted, and made for the purpose of later prosecution. See <em>ante, </em>at 309-311. It is not clear, under the Court\u2019s ruling, why the independent contractor is not also an analyst.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Consider the person who interprets the machine\u2019s printout. His or her interpretation may call for the exercise of professional judgment in close cases. See Giannelli &amp; Imwinkelried, <em>supra. </em>If we assume no person deliberately introduces error, this interpretive step is the one most likely to permit human error to affect the test\u2019s result. This exercise of judgment might make this participant an analyst. The Court implies as much. See <em>ante, </em>at 318-320.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">And we must yet consider the laboratory director who certifies the ultimate results. The director is arguably the most effective person to confront for revealing any ambiguity in findings, variations in procedures, or problems in the office, as he or she is most familiar with the standard procedures, the office\u2019s variations, and problems in prior cases or with particular analysts. The prosecution may seek to introduce his or her certification into evidence. The Court implies that only those statements that are actually entered into evidence require confrontation. See <em>ante, </em>at 309. This could mean that the director is also an analyst, even if his or her certification relies upon or restates work performed by subordinates.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The Court offers no principles or historical precedent to determine which of these persons is the analyst. All contribute to the test result. And each is equally remote from the scene, has no personal stake in the outcome, does not even know the accused, and is concerned only with the performance of his or her role in conducting the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">It could be argued that the only analyst who must testify is the person who signed the certificate. Under this view, a laboratory could have one employee sign certificates and appear in court, which would spare all the other analysts this burden. But the Court has already rejected this arrangement. The Court made clear in <em>Davis </em>that it will not permit the testimonial statement of one witness to enter into evidence through the in-eourt testimony of a second:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>\u201c[W]e do not think it conceivable that the protections of the Confrontation Clause can readily be evaded by having a note-taking policeman [here, the laboratory employee who signs the certificate] <em>recite </em>the unsworn hearsay testimony of the declarant [here, the analyst who performs the actual test], instead of having the declarant sign a deposition. Indeed, if there is one point for which no case \u2014 English or early American, state or federal \u2014 can be cited, that is it.\u201d 547 U. S., at 826.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Under this logic, the Court\u2019s holding cannot be cabined to the person who signs the certificates. If the signatory is restating the testimonial statements of the true analysts\u2014 whoever they might be \u2014 then those analysts, too, must testify in person.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Today\u2019s decision demonstrates that even in the narrow category of scientific tests that identify a drug, the Court cannot define with any clarity who the analyst is. Outside this narrow category, the range of other scientific tests that may be affected by the Court\u2019s new confrontation right is staggering. See, <em>e. g., </em>Comment, Toward a Definition of \u201cTestimonial\u201d: How Autopsy Reports Do Not Embody the Qualities of a Testimonial Statement, 96 Cal. L. Rev. 1093, 1094, 1115 (2008) (noting that every court post <em>-Crawford </em>has held that autopsy reports are not testimonial, and warning that a contrary rule would \u201ceffectively functio[n] as a statute of limitations for murder\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">It is difficult to confine at this point the damage the Court\u2019s holding will do in other contexts. Consider just two \u2014 establishing the chain of custody and authenticating a copy of a document.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">It is the obligation of the prosecution to establish the chain of custody for evidence sent to testing laboratories \u2014 that is, to establish \u201cthe identity and integrity of physical evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>by tracing its continuous whereabouts.\u201d 23 C. J. S., Criminal Law \u00a71142, p. 66 (2006). Meeting this obligation requires representations \u2014 that one officer retrieved the evidence from the crime scene, that a second officer checked it into an evidence locker, that a third officer verified the locker\u2019s seal was intact, and so forth. The iron logic of which the Court is so enamored would seem to require in-court testimony from each human link in the chain of custody. That, of course, has never been the law. See, <em>e. g., United States </em>v. <em>Lott, </em>854 F. 2d 244, 250 (CA7 1988) (\u201c[G]aps in the chain [of custody] normally go to the weight of the evidence rather than its admissibility\u201d); 29A Am. Jur. 2d, Evidence \u00a7 962, p. 269 (2008) (\u201cThe fact that one of the persons in control of a fungible substance does not testify at trial does not, without more, make the substance or testimony relating to it inadmissible\u201d); 23 C. J. S., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1142, at 67 (\u201cIt is generally not necessary that every witness who handled the evidence testify\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">It is no answer for the Court to say that \u201c[i]t is up to the prosecution to decide what steps in the chain of custody are so crucial as to require evidence.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 311, n. 1. The case itself determines which links in the chain are crucial\u2014 not the prosecution. In any number of cases, the crucial link in the chain will not be available to testify, and so the evidence will be excluded for lack of a proper foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Consider another context in which the Court\u2019s holding may cause disruption: The long-accepted practice of authenticating copies of documents by means of a certificate from the document\u2019s custodian stating that the copy is accurate. See, <em>e.g., </em>Fed. Rule Evid. 902(4) (in order to be self-authenticating, a copy of a public record must be \u201ccertified as correct by the custodian\u201d); Rule 902(11) (business record must be \u201caccompanied by a written declaration of its custodian\u201d). Under one possible reading of the Court\u2019s opinion, recordkeepers will be required to testify. So far, courts have not read <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis </em>to impose this largely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>meaningless requirement. See, <em>e. g., United States </em>v. <em>Adefehinti, </em>510 F. 3d 319, 327-328 (CADC 2008) (certificates authenticating bank records may be admitted without confrontation); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>460 F. 3d 920, 927 (CA7 2006) (certificate authenticating hospital records). But the breadth of the Court\u2019s ruling today, and its undefined scope, may well be such that these courts now must be deemed to have erred. The risk of that consequence ought to tell us that something is very wrong with the Court\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Because the Court is driven by nothing more than a wooden application of the <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis </em>definition of \u201ctestimonial,\u201d divorced from any guidance from history, precedent, or common sense, there is no way to predict the future applications of today\u2019s holding. Surely part of the justification for the Court\u2019s formalism must lie in its predictability. There is nothing predictable here, however, other than the uncertainty and disruption that now must ensue.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">With no precedent to guide us, let us assume that the Court\u2019s analyst is the person who interprets the machine\u2019s printout. This result makes no sense. The Confrontation Clause is not designed, and does not serve, to detect errors in scientific tests. That should instead be done by conducting a new test. Or, if a new test is impossible, the defendant may call his own expert to explain to the jury the test\u2019s flaws and the dangers of relying on it. And if, in an extraordinary case, the particular analyst\u2019s testimony is necessary to the defense, then, of course, the defendant may subpoena the analyst. The Court frets that the defendant may be unable to do so \u201cwhen the [analyst] is unavailable or simply refuses to appear.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 324. But laboratory analysts are not difficult to locate or to compel. As discussed below, analysts already devote considerable time to appearing in court when subpoenaed to do so. See Part I-C, <em>infra; </em>see also Brief for State of Alabama et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>26-28. Neither the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Court, petitioner, nor <em>amici </em>offer any reason to believe that defendants have trouble subpoenaing analysts in cases where the analysts\u2019 in-court testimony is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">The facts of this case illustrate the formalistic and point-' less nature of the Court\u2019s reading of the Clause. Petitioner knew, well in advance of trial, that the Commonwealth would introduce the tests against him. The bags of cocaine were in court, available for him to test, and entered into evidence. Yet petitioner made no effort, before or during trial, to mount a defense against the analysts\u2019 results. Petitioner could have challenged the tests\u2019 reliability by seeking discovery concerning the testing methods used or the qualifications of the laboratory analysts. See Mass. Rule Crim. Proc. 14(a)(2) (2009). He did not do so. Petitioner could have sought to conduct his own test. See Rule 41. Again, he did not seek a test; indeed, he did not argue that the drug was not cocaine. Rather than dispute the authenticity of the samples tested or the accuracy of the tests performed, petitioner argued to the jury that the prosecution had not shown that he had possessed or dealt in the drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Despite not having prepared a defense to the analysts\u2019 results, petitioner\u2019s counsel made what can only be described as a <em>pro forma </em>objection to admitting the results without in-court testimony, presumably from one particular analyst. Today the Court, by deciding that this objection should have been sustained, transforms the Confrontation Clause from a sensible procedural protection into a distortion of the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">It is difficult to perceive how the Court\u2019s holding will advance the purposes of the Confrontation Clause. One purpose of confrontation is to impress upon witnesses the gravity of their conduct. See <em>Coy </em>v. <em>Iowa, </em>487 U. S. 1012, 1019-1020 (1988). A witness, when brought to face the person his or her words condemn, might refine, reformulate, reconsider, or even recant earlier statements. See <em>ibid. </em>A further purpose is to alleviate the danger of one-sided inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>rogations by adversarial government officials who might distort a witness\u2019 testimony. The Clause guards against this danger by bringing the interrogation into the more neutral and public forum of the courtroom. See <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Craig, </em>497 U. S. 836, 869-870 (1990) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (discussing the \u201cvalue of the confrontation right in guarding against a child\u2019s distorted or coerced recollections\u201d); see also Comment, 96 Cal. L. Rev., at 1120-1122 (\u201cDuring private law-enforcement questioning, police officers or prosecutors can exert pressure on the witness without a high risk of being discovered. Courtroom questioning, in contrast, is public and performed in front of the jury, judge and defendant. Pressure is therefore harder to exert in court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">But neither purpose is served by the rule the Court announces today. It is not plausible that a laboratory analyst will retract his or her prior conclusion upon catching sight of the defendant the result condemns. After all, the analyst is far removed from the particular defendant and, indeed, claims no personal knowledge of the defendant\u2019s guilt. And an analyst performs hundreds if not thousands of tests each year and will not remember a particular test or the link it had to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">This is not to say that analysts are infallible. They are not. It may well be that if the State does not introduce the machine printout or the raw results of a laboratory analysis; if it does not call an expert to interpret a test, particularly if that test is complex or little known; if it does not establish the chain of custody and the reliability of the laboratory; then the State will have failed to meet its burden of proof. That result follows because the State must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, without relying on presumptions, unreliable hearsay, and the like. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>United States Gypsum Co., </em>438 U. S. 422, 446 (1978) (refusing to permit a \u201c \u2018conclusive presumption [of intent],\u2019 \u201d which \u201c \u2018would effectively eliminate intent as an ingredient of the offense\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Morissette </em>v. <em>United States, </em>342 U. S. 246, 275 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>(1952))). The State must permit the defendant to challenge the analyst\u2019s result. See <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>South Carolina, </em>547 U. S. 319, 331 (2006) (affirming the defendant\u2019s right to \u201chave a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). The rules of evidence, including those governing reliability under hearsay principles and the latitude to be given expert witnesses; the rules against irrebutable presumptions; and the overriding principle that the prosecution must make its case beyond a reasonable doubt \u2014 all these are part of the protections for the accused. The States, however, have some latitude in determining how these rules should be defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The Confrontation Clause addresses who must testify. It simply does not follow, however, that this clause, in lieu of the other rules set forth above, controls who the prosecution must call on every issue. Suppose, for instance, that the defense challenges the procedures for a secure chain of custody for evidence sent to a laboratory and then returned to the police. The defense has the right to call its own witnesses to show that the chain of custody is not secure. But that does not mean it can demand that, in the prosecution\u2019s case in chief, each person who is in the chain of custody \u2014 and who had an undoubted opportunity to taint or tamper with the evidence \u2014 must be called by the prosecution under the Confrontation Clause. And the same is true with laboratory technicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The Confrontation Clause is simply not needed for these matters. Where, as here, the defendant does not even dispute the accuracy of the analyst\u2019s work, confrontation adds nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">For the sake of these negligible benefits, the Court threatens to disrupt forensic investigations across the country and to put prosecutions nationwide at risk of dismissal based on erratic, all-too-frequent instances when a particular laboratory technician, now invested by the Court\u2019s new constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>tional designation as the analyst, simply does not or cannot appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Consider first the costs today\u2019s decision imposes on criminal trials. Our own Court enjoys weeks, often months, of notice before cases are argued. We receive briefs well in advance. The argument itself is ordered. A busy trial court, by contrast, must consider not only attorneys\u2019 schedules but also those of witnesses and juries. Trial courts have huge caseloads to be processed within strict time limits. Some cases may unexpectedly plead out at the last minute; others, just as unexpectedly, may not. Some juries stay out longer than predicted; others must be reconstituted. An analyst cannot hope to be the trial court\u2019s top priority in scheduling. The analyst must instead face the prospect of waiting for days in a hallway outside the courtroom before being called to offer testimony that will consist of little more than a rote recital of the written report. See Part I-B, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">As matters stood before today\u2019s opinion, analysts already spent considerable time appearing as witnesses in those few cases where the defendant, unlike petitioner in this case, contested the analyst\u2019s result and subpoenaed the analyst. See Brief for State of Alabama et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>26-28 (testifying takes time); <em>ante, </em>at 328 (before today\u2019s opinion, it was \u201c\u2018almost always the case that [analysts\u2019 certificates] [we]re admitted without objection\u2019 \u201d in Massachusetts courts). By requiring analysts also to appear in the far greater number of cases where defendants do not dispute the analyst\u2019s result, the Court imposes enormous costs on the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Setting aside, for a moment, all the other crimes for which scientific evidence is required, consider the costs the Court\u2019s ruling will impose on state drug prosecutions alone. In 2004, the most recent year for which data are available, drug possession and trafficking resulted in 362,850 felony convictions in state courts across the country. See Dept, of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, M. Durose &amp; P. Langan, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Felony Sentences in State Courts, 2004, p. 2 (July 2007). Roughly 95% of those convictions were products of plea bargains, see <em>id., </em>at 1, which means that state courts saw more than 18,000 drug trials in a single year.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The analysts responsible for testing the drugs at issue in those cases now bear a crushing burden. For example, the district attorney in Philadelphia prosecuted 25,000 drug crimes in 2007. Brief for National Dist. Attorneys Association et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>12-13. Assuming that number remains the same, and assuming that 95% of the cases end in a plea bargain, each of the city\u2019s 18 drug analysts, <em>ibid., </em>will be required to testify in more than 69 trials next year. Cleveland\u2019s district attorney prosecuted 14,000 drug crimes in 2007. <em>Ibid. </em>Assuming that number holds, and that 95% of the eases end in a plea bargain, each of the city\u2019s six drug analysts (two of whom work only part time) must testify in 117 drug cases next year. <em>Id., </em>at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The Federal Government may face even graver difficulties than the States because its operations are so widespread. For example, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) laboratory at Quantico, Virginia, supports federal, state, and local investigations across the country. Its 500 employees conduct over 1 million scientific tests each year. Dept, of Justice, FBI Laboratory 2007, Message from the FBI Laboratory Director, http://www.fbi.gov/hq/lab/lab2007/ labannual07.pdf (as visited June 22, 2009, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s ease file). The Court\u2019s decision means that before any of those million tests reaches a jury, at least one of the laboratory\u2019s analysts must board a plane, find his or her way to an unfamiliar courthouse, and sit there waiting to read aloud notes made months ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">The Court purchases its meddling with the Confrontation Clause at a dear price, a price not measured in taxpayer dollars alone. Guilty defendants will go free, on the most technical grounds, as a direct result of today\u2019s decision, adding nothing to the truth-finding process. The analyst will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>not always make it to the courthouse in time. He or she may be ill; may be out of the country; may be unable to travel because of inclement weather; or may at that very moment be waiting outside some other courtroom for another defendant to exercise the right the Court invents today. If for any reason the analyst cannot make it to the courthouse in time, then, the Court holds, the jury cannot learn of the analyst\u2019s findings (unless, by some unlikely turn of events, the defendant previously cross:examined the analyst). <em>Ante, </em>at 309. The result, in many cases, will be that the prosecution cannot meet its burden of proof, and the guilty defendant goes free on a technicality that, because it results in an acquittal, cannot be reviewed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The Court\u2019s holding is a windfall to defendants, one that is unjustified by any demonstrated deficiency in trials, any well-understood historical requirement, or any established constitutional precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">All of the problems with today\u2019s decision \u2014 the imprecise definition of \u201canalyst,\u201d the lack of any perceptible benefit, the heavy societal costs \u2014 would be of no moment if the Constitution did, in fact, require the Court to rule as it does today. But the Constitution does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">The Court\u2019s fundamental mistake is to read the Confrontation Clause as referring to a kind of out-of-court statement\u2014 namely, a testimonial statement \u2014 that must be excluded from evidence. The Clause does not refer to kinds of statements. Nor does the Clause contain the word \u201ctestimonial.\u201d The text, instead, refers to kinds of persons, namely, to \u201cwitnesses against\u201d the defendant. Laboratory analysts are not \u201cwitnesses against\u201d the defendant as those words would have been understood at the framing. There is simply no authority for this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">Instead, the Clause refers to a conventional \u201cwitness\u201d\u2014 meaning one who witnesses (that is, perceives) an event that gives him or her personal knowledge of some aspect of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>defendant\u2019s guilt. Both <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis </em>concerned just this kind of ordinary witness \u2014 and nothing in the Confrontation Clause\u2019s text, history, or precedent justifies the Court\u2019s decision to expand those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The Clause states: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U. S. Const., Amdt. 6. Though there is \u201cvirtually no evidence of what the drafters of the Confrontation Clause intended it to mean,\u201d <em>White </em>v. Illinois, 502 U. S. 346, 359 (1992) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), it is certain the Framers did not contemplate that an analyst who conducts a scientific test far removed from the crime would be considered a \u201cwitnes[s] against\u201d the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">The Framers were concerned with a typical witness \u2014 one who perceived an event that gave rise to a personal belief in some aspect of the defendant\u2019s guilt. There is no evidence that the Framers understood the Clause to extend to unconventional witnesses. As discussed below, there is significant evidence to the contrary. See Part II-B, <em>infra. </em>In these circumstances, the historical evidence in support of the Court\u2019s position is \u201c Too meager ... to form, a solid basis in history, preceding and contemporaneous with the framing of the Constitution.\u2019\u201d <em>Boumediene </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>553 U. S. 723, 752 (2008) (quoting <em>Reid </em>v. <em>Covert, </em>354 U. S. 1, 64 (1957) (Frankfurter, J., concurring in result)). The Court goes dangerously wrong when it bases its constitutional interpretation upon historical guesswork.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">The infamous treason trial of Sir Walter Raleigh provides excellent examples of the kinds of witnesses to whom the Confrontation Clause refers. <em>Raleigh\u2019s Case, 2 </em>How. St. Tr. 1 (1603); see <em>Crawford, </em>541 U. S., at 44-45 (Raleigh\u2019s trial informs our understanding of the Clause because it was, at the time of the framing, one of the \u201cmost notorious in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>stances\u201d of the abuse of witnesses\u2019 out-of-court statements); <em>ante, </em>at 315 (same). Raleigh\u2019s accusers claimed to have heard Raleigh speak treason, so they were witnesses in the conventional sense. We should limit the Confrontation Clause to witnesses like those in Raleigh\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The Court today expands the Clause to include laboratory analysts, but analysts differ from ordinary witnesses in at least three significant ways. First, a conventional witness recalls events observed in the past, while an analyst\u2019s report contains near-contemporaneous observations of the test. An observation recorded at the time it is made is unlike the usual act of testifying. A typical witness must recall a previous event that he or she perceived just once, and thus may have misperceived or misremembered. But an analyst making a contemporaneous observation need not rely on memory; he or she instead reports the observations at the time they are made. We gave this consideration substantial weight in <em>Davis. </em>There, the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of the victim\u2019s 911 call was \u201cto enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency,\u201d rather than \u201cto establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d 547 U. S., at 822, 827. See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Geier, </em>41 Cal. 4th 555, 605-609, 161 P. 3d 104, 139-141 (2007). The Court cites no authority for its holding that an observation recorded at the time it is made is an act of \u201cwitness[ing]\u201d for purposes of the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Second, an analyst observes neither the crime nor any human action related to it. Often, the analyst does not know the defendant\u2019s identity, much less have personal knowledge of an aspect of the defendant\u2019s guilt. The analyst\u2019s distance from the crime and the defendant, in both space and time, suggests the analyst is not a witness against the defendant in the conventional sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Third, a conventional witness responds to questions under interrogation. See, <em>e.g., Raleigh\u2019s Case, supra, </em>at 15-20. But laboratory tests are conducted according to scientific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>protocols; they are not dependent upon or controlled by interrogation of any sort. Put differently, out-of-court statements should only \u201crequire confrontation if they are produced by, or with the involvement of, adversarial government officials responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.\u201d Comment, 96 Cal. L. Rev., at 1118. There is no indication that the analysts here \u2014 who work for the State Laboratory Institute, a division of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health \u2014 were adversarial to petitioner. Nor is there any evidence that adversarial officials played a role in formulating the analysts\u2019 certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Rather than acknowledge that it expands the Confrontation Clause beyond conventional witnesses, the Court relies on our recent opinions in <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis. Ante, </em>at 309-311. The Court assumes, with little analysis, that <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis </em>extended the Clause to any person who makes a \u201ctestimonial\u201d statement. But the Court\u2019s confident tone cannot disguise the thinness of these two reeds. Neither <em>Crawford </em>nor <em>Davis </em>considered whether the Clause extends to persons far removed from the crime who have no connection to the defendant. Instead, those cases concerned conventional witnesses. <em>Davis, supra, </em>at 826-830 (witnesses were victims of defendants\u2019 assaults); <em>Crawford, supra, </em>at 38 (witness saw defendant stab victim).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">It is true that <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis </em>employed the term \u201ctestimonial,\u201d and thereby suggested that any testimonial statement, by any person, no matter how distant from the defendant and the crime, is subject to the Confrontation Clause.. But that suggestion was not part of the holding of <em>Crawford </em>or <em>Davis. </em>Those opinions used the adjective \u201ctestimonial\u201d to avoid the awkward phrasing required by reusing the noun \u201cwitness.\u201d The Court today transforms that turn of phrase into a new and sweeping legal rule, by holding that anyone who makes a formal statement for the purpose of later prosecution \u2014 no matter how removed from the crime\u2014 must be considered a \u201cwitnes[s] against\u201d the defendant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number><em>Ante, </em>at 309-311. The Court cites no authority to justify this expansive new interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">No historical evidence supports the Court\u2019s conclusion that the Confrontation Clause was understood to extend beyond conventional witnesses to include analysts who conduct scientific tests far removed from the crime and the defendant. Indeed, what little evidence there is contradicts this interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Though the Framers had no forensic scientists, they did use another kind of unconventional witness \u2014 the copyist. A copyist\u2019s work may be as essential to a criminal prosecution as the forensic analyst\u2019s. To convict a man of bigamy, for example, the State often requires his marriage records. See, <em>e. g., Williams </em>v. <em>State, </em>54 Ala. 131, 134, 135 (1875); <em>State </em>v. Potter, 52 Vt. 33, 38 (1879). But if the original records cannot be taken from the archive, the prosecution must rely on copies of those records, made for the purpose of introducing the copies into evidence at trial. See <em>ibid. </em>In that case, the copyist\u2019s honesty and diligence are just as important as the analyst\u2019s here. If the copyist falsifies a copy, or even misspells a name or transposes a date, those flaws could lead the jury to convict. Because so much depends on his or her honesty and diligence, the copyist often prepares an affidavit certifying that the copy is true and accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Such a certificate is beyond question a testimonial statement under the Court\u2019s definition: It is a formal out-of-court statement offered for the truth of two matters (the copyist\u2019s honesty and the copy\u2019s accuracy), and it is prepared for a criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">During the Framers\u2019 era copyists\u2019 affidavits were accepted without hesitation by American courts. See, <em>e. g., United States </em>v. <em>Percheman, </em>7 Pet. 51, 85 (1833) (opinion for the Court by Marshall, C. J.); see also Advisory Committee\u2019s Note on Fed. Rule Evid. 902(4), 28 U. S. C. App., p. 390 (\u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>common law . . . recognized the procedure of authenticating copies of public records by certificate\u201d); 5 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7\u00a71677, 1678 (J. Chadbourn rev. 1974). And courts admitted copyists\u2019 affidavits in criminal as well as civil trials. See <em>Williams, supra; Potter, supra. </em>This demonstrates that the framing generation, in contrast to the Court today, did not consider the Confrontation Clause to require in-court confrontation of unconventional authors of testimonial statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The Court attempts to explain away this historical exception to its rule by noting that a copyist\u2019s authority is \u201cnarrowly circumscribed.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 322. But the Court does not explain why that matters, nor, if it does matter, why laboratory analysts\u2019 authority should not also be deemed \u201cnarrowly circumscribed\u201d so that they, too, may be excused from testifying. And drawing these fine distinctions cannot be squared with the Court\u2019s avowed allegiance to formalism. Determining whether a witness\u2019 authority is \u201cnarrowly circumscribed\u201d has nothing to do with <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>testimonial framework. It instead appears much closer to the pre-<em>Crawford </em>rule of <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>under which a statement could be admitted without testimony if it \u201cbears adequate indicia of reliability.\u201d 448 U. S., at 66 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">In keeping with the traditional understanding of the Confrontation Clause, this Court in <em>Dowdell </em>v. <em>United States, </em>221 U. S. 325 (1911), rejected a challenge to the use of certificates, sworn out by a clerk of court, a trial judge, and a court reporter, stating that defendants had been present at trial. Those certificates, like a copyist\u2019s certificate, met every requirement of the Court\u2019s current definition of \u201ctestimonial.\u201d In rejecting the defendants\u2019 claim that use of the certificates violated the Confrontation Clause, the Court in <em>Dowdell </em>explained that the officials who executed the certificates \u201cwere not witnesses against the accused\u201d because they \u201cwere not asked to testify to facts concerning [the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>fendants\u2019] guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 330. Indeed, as recently as <em>Davis, </em>the Court reaffirmed <em>Dowdell. </em>547 U. S., at 825.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">By insisting that every author of a testimonial statement appear for confrontation, on pain of excluding the statement from evidence, the Court does violence to the Framers\u2019 sensible, and limited, conception of the right to confront \u201cwitnesses against\u201d the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">In addition to lacking support in historical practice or in this Court\u2019s precedent, the Court\u2019s decision is also contrary to authority extending over at least 90 years, 35 St\u00e1tes, and six Federal Courts of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Almost 100 years ago three State Supreme Courts held that their State Constitutions did not require analysts to testify in court. In a case much like this one, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court upheld the admission of a certificate stating that the liquid seized from the defendant contained alcohol, even though the author of the certificate did not testify. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Slavski, </em>245 Mass. 405, 413, 140 N. E. 465, 467 (1923). The highest courts in Connecticut and Virginia reached similar conclusions under their own Constitutions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Torello, </em>103 Conn. 511, 131 A. 429 (1925); <em>Bracy </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>119 Va. 867, 89 S. E. 144 (1916). Just two state courts appear to have read a State Constitution to require a contrary result. <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>1998 MT 221, \u00b6\u00b6 18-25, 290 Mont. 479, 484-489, 964 P. 2d 766, 770-772 (laboratory drug report requires confrontation under Montana\u2019s Constitution, which is \u201c[u]nlike its federal counterpart\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Birchfield, </em>342 Ore. 624, 157 P. 3d 216 (2007), but see <em>id., </em>at 631-632, 157 P. 3d, at 220 (suggesting that a \u201ctypical notice requirement\u201d would be lawful).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">As for the Federal Constitution, before <em>Crawford </em>the authority was stronger still: The Sixth Amendment does not require analysts to testify in court. All Federal Courts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Appeals to consider the issue agreed. <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>62 F. 3d 136, 139-142 (CA5 1995); <em>Minner </em>v. <em>Kerby, </em>30 F. 3d 1311, 1313-1315 (CA10 1994); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>855 F. 2d 1353, 1359-1360 (CA8 1988); <em>Reardon </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>806 F. 2d 39 (CA2 1986); <em>Kay </em>v. <em>United States, </em>255 F. 2d 476, 480-481 (CA4 1958); see also <em>Manocchio </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>919 F. 2d 770, 777-782 (CA1 1990) (autopsy report stating cause of victim\u2019s death). Some 24 state courts, and the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, were in accord. See Appendix A, <em>infra. </em>(Some cases cited in the appendixes concern doctors, coroners, and calibrators rather than laboratory analysts, but their reasoning is much the same.) Eleven more state courts upheld burden-shifting statutes that reduce, if not eliminate, the right to confrontation by requiring the defendant to take affirmative steps prior to trial to summon the analyst. See <em>ibid. </em>Because these burden-shifting statutes may be invalidated by the Court\u2019s reasoning, these 11 decisions, too, appear contrary to today\u2019s opinion. See Part III-B, <em>infra. </em>Most of the remaining States, far from endorsing the Court\u2019s view, appear not to have addressed the question prior to <em>Crawford. </em>Against this weight of authority, the Court proffers just two cases from intermediate state courts of appeals. <em>Ante, </em>at 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">On a practical level, today\u2019s ruling would cause less disruption if the States\u2019 hearsay rules had already required analysts to testify. But few States require this. At least 16 state courts have held that their evidentiary rules permit scientific test results, calibration certificates, and the observations of medical personnel to enter evidence without in-court testimony. See Appendix B, <em>infra. </em>The Federal Courts of Appeals have reached the same conclusion in applying the federal hearsay rule. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Garnett, </em>122 F. 3d 1016, 1018-1019 (CA11 1997) <em>(per curiam); United States </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>774 F. 2d 962, 965 (CA9 1985) <em>(per curiam); United States </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>247 F. 2d 698, 699-700 (CA7 1957); but see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Oates, </em>560 F. 2d 45, 82 (CA2 1977) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>(report prepared by law enforcement not admissible under public-records or business-records exceptions to federal hearsay rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The modern trend in the state courts has been away from the Court\u2019s rule and toward the admission of scientific test results without testimony \u2014 perhaps because the States have recognized the increasing reliability of scientific testing. See Appendix B, <em>infra </em>(citing cases from three States overruling or limiting previous precedents that had adopted the Court\u2019s rule as a matter of state law). It appears that- a mere six courts continue to interpret their States\u2019 hearsay laws to require analysts to testify. See <em>ibid. </em>And, of course, where courts have grounded their decisions in state law, rather than the Constitution, the legislatures in those States have had, until now, the power to abrogate the courts\u2019 interpretation if the costs were shown to outweigh the benefits. Today the Court strips that authority from the States by carving the minority view into the constitutional text.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">State legislatures, and not the Members of this Court, have the authority to shape the rules of evidence. The Court therefore errs when it relies in such great measure on the recent report of the National Academy of Sciences. <em>Ante, </em>at 318-320 (discussing National Research Council of the National Academies, Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward (2009)). That report is not directed to this Court, but rather to the elected representatives in Congress and the state legislatures, who, unlike Members of this Court, have the power and competence to determine whether scientific tests are unreliable and, if so, whether testimony is the proper solution to the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The Court rejects the well-established understanding\u2014 extending across at least 90 years, 35 States, and six Federal Courts of Appeals \u2014 that the Constitution does not require analysts to testify in court before their analysis may be introduced into evidence. The only authority on which the Court can rely is its own speculation on the meaning of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>word \u201ctestimonial,\u201d made in two recent opinions that said nothing about scientific analysis or scientific analysts.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">In an attempt to show that the \u201csky will not fall after today\u2019s decision,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 325, the Court makes three arguments, none of which withstands scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">In an unconvincing effort to play down the threat that today\u2019s new rule will disrupt or even end criminal prosecutions, the Court professes a hope that defense counsel will decline to raise what will soon be known as the <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>objection. <em>Ante, </em>at 328. The Court bases this expectation on its understanding that defense attorneys surrender constitutional rights because the attorneys do not \u201cwant to antagonize the judge or jury by wasting their time.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">The Court\u2019s reasoning is troubling on at least two levels. First, the Court\u2019s speculation rests on the apparent belief that our Nation\u2019s trial judges and jurors are unwilling to accept zealous advocacy and that, once \u201cantagonize[d]\u201d by it, will punish such advocates with adverse rulings. <em>Ibid. </em>The Court offers no support for this stunning slur on the integrity of the Nation\u2019s courts. It is commonplace for the defense to request, at the conclusion of the prosecution\u2019s opening case, a directed verdict of acquittal. If the prosecution has failed to prove an element of the crime \u2014 even an element that is technical and rather obvious, such as movement of a car in interstate commerce \u2014 then the case must be dismissed. Until today one would not have thought that judges should be angered at the defense for making such motions, nor that counsel has some sort of obligation to avoid being troublesome when the prosecution has not done all the law requires to prove its case.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">Second, even if the Court were right to expect trial judges to feel \u201cantagonize[d]\u201d by <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>objections and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>then vent their anger by punishing the lawyer in some way, there is no authority to support the Court\u2019s suggestion that a lawyer may shirk his or her professional duties just to avoid judicial displeasure. There is good reason why the Court cites no authority for this suggestion \u2014 it is contrary to what some of us, at least, have long understood to be defense counsel\u2019s duty to be a zealous advocate for every client. This Court has recognized the bedrock principle that a competent criminal defense lawyer must put the prosecution to its proof:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\">\u201c[T]he adversarial process protected by the Sixth Amendment requires that the accused have \u2018counsel acting in the role of an advocate.\u2019 <em>Anders </em>v. California, 386 U. S. 738, 743 (1967). The right to the effective assistance of counsel is thus the right of the accused to require the prosecution\u2019s case to survive the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing. When a true adversarial criminal trial has been conducted . . . the kind of testing envisioned by the Sixth Amendment has occurred. But if the process loses its character as a confrontation between adversaries, the constitutional guarantee is violated.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cronic, </em>466 U. S. 648, 656-657 (1984) (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">See also ABA Model Code of Professional Responsibility, Canon 7-1, in ABA Compendium of Professional Responsibility Rules and Standards (2008) (\u201cThe duty of a lawyer, both to his client and to the legal system, is to represent his client zealously within the bounds of the law ...\u201d (footnotes omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">The instant case demonstrates how zealous defense counsel will defend their clients. To convict, the prosecution must prove the substance is cocaine. Under the Court\u2019s new rule, apparently only an analyst\u2019s testimony suffices to prove that fact. (Of course there will also be a large universe of other crimes, ranging from homicide to robbery, where scien<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>tifie evidence is necessary to prove an element.) In cases where scientific evidence is necessary to prove an element of the crime, the Court\u2019s rule requires the prosecution to call the person identified as the analyst; this requirement has become a new prosecutorial duty linked with proving the State\u2019s case beyond a reasonable doubt. Unless the Court is ashamed of its new rule, it is inexplicable that the Court seeks to limit its damage by hoping that defense counsel will be derelict in their duty to insist that the prosecution prove its case. That is simply not the way the adversarial system works.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">In any event, the Court\u2019s hope is sure to prove unfounded. The Court surmises that \u201c[i]t is unlikely that defense counsel will insist on live testimony whose effect will be merely to highlight rather than cast doubt upon the forensic analysis.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 328. This optimistic prediction misunderstands how criminal trials work. If the defense does not plan to challenge the test result, \u201chighlighting]\u201d that result through testimony does not harm the defense as the Court supposes. If the analyst cannot reach the courtroom in time to testify, however, a <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>objection grants the defense a great windfall: The analyst\u2019s work cannot come into evidence. Given the prospect of such a windfall (which may, in and of itself, secure an acquittal) few zealous advocates will pledge, prior to trial, not to raise a <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>objection. Defense counsel will accept the risk that the jury may hear the analyst\u2019s live testimony, in exchange for the chance that the analyst fails to appear and the government\u2019s case collapses. And if, as here, the defense is not that the substance was harmless, but instead that the accused did not possess it, the testimony of the technician is a formalism that does not detract from the defense case.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">In further support of its unlikely hope, the Court relies on the Brief for Law Professors as Amici <em>Curiae </em>7-8, which reports that nearly 95% of convictions are obtained via guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>plea and thus do not require in-court testimony from laboratory analysts. <em>Ante, </em>at 325. What the Court does not consider is how its holding will alter these statistics. The defense bar today gains the formidable power to require the government to transport the analyst to the courtroom at the time of trial. Zealous counsel will insist upon concessions: a plea bargain, or a more lenient sentence in exchange for relinquishing this remarkable power.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">As further reassurance that the \u201csky will not fall after today\u2019s decision,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>the Court notes that many States have enacted burden-shifting statutes that require the defendant to assert his Confrontation Clause right prior to trial or else \u201cforfeit\u201d it \u201cby silence,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 326. The Court implies that by shifting the burden to the defendant to take affirmative steps to produce the analyst, these statutes reduce the burden on the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">The Court holds that these burden-shifting statutes are valid because, in the Court\u2019s view, they \u201cshift no burden whatever.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 327. While this conclusion is welcome, the premise appears flawed. Even what the Court calls the \u201csimplest form\u201d of burden-shifting statutes, <em>ante, </em>at 326, do impose requirements on the defendant, who must make a formal demand, with proper service, well before trial. Some statutes impose more requirements, for instance by requiring defense counsel to subpoena the analyst, to show good cause for demanding the analyst\u2019s presence, or even to affirm under oath an intent to cross-examine the analyst. See generally Metzger, Cheating the Constitution, 59 Vand. L. Rev. 475, 481-485 (2006). In a future case, the Court may find that some of these more onerous burden-shifting statutes violate the Confrontation Clause because they \u201cimpos[e] a burden ... on the defendant to bring . . . adverse witnesses into court.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>The burden-shifting statutes thus provide little reassurance that this case will not impose a meaningless formalism across the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">In a further effort to support its assessment that today\u2019s decision will not cause disruption, the Court cites 10 decisions from States that, the Court asserts, \u201chave already adopted the constitutional rule we announce today.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 325-326, and n. 11. The Court assures us that \u201cthere is no evidence that the criminal justice system has ground to a halt in the[se] States.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">On inspection, the citations prove far less reassuring than promised. Seven were decided by courts that considered themselves bound by <em>Crawford. </em>These cases thus offer no support for the Court\u2019s assertion that the state jurists independently \u201cadopted\u201d the Court\u2019s interpretation as a matter of state law. Quite the contrary, the debate in those seven courts was over just how far this Court intended <em>Crawford </em>to sweep. See, <em>e. g., State </em>v. <em>Belvin, </em>986 So. 2d 516, 526 (Fla. 2008) (Wells, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\u201cI believe that the majority has extended the <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis </em>decisions beyond their intended reach\u201d (citations omitted)). The Court should correct these courts\u2019 overbroad reading of <em>Crawford, </em>not endorse it. Were the Court to do so, these seven jurisdictions might well change their position.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Moreover, because these seven courts only \u201cadopted\u201d the Court\u2019s position in the wake of <em>Crawford, </em>their decisions are all quite recent. These States have not yet been subject to the widespread, adverse results of the formalism the Court mandates today,</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">The citations also fail to reassure for a different reason. Five of the Court\u2019s ten citations \u2014 including all three pre<em>Crawford </em>cases \u2014 come from States that have reduced the confrontation right. Four States have enacted a burden-shifting statute requiring the defendant to give early notice of his intent to confront the analyst. See Part III-B, <em>supra; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Colorado: <em>Hinojos-Mendoza </em>v. <em>People, </em>169 P. 3d 662, 668-671 (Colo. 2007), Colo.

Stat., ch. 725, \u00a75/115-15 (West 2006) (defendant must give notice \u201cwithin 7 days\u201d of \u201creceipt of the report\u201d); Oregon: <em>State </em>v. <em>Birchfield, </em>342 Ore., at 631-632, 157 P. 3d, at 220 (suggesting that a \u201ctypical notice requirement\u201d would be lawful), see Ore. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 475.235 (2007) (defendant must give notice 15 days before trial). A fifth State, Mississippi, excuses the prosecution from producing the analyst who conducted the test, so long as it produces someone. Compare <em>Barnette </em>v. <em>State, </em>481 So. 2d 788, 792 (Miss. 1985) (cited by the Court), with <em>McGowen </em>v. <em>State, </em>859 So. 2d 320, 339-340 (Miss. 2003) (the Sixth Amendment does not require confrontation with the particular analyst who conducted the test). It is possible that neither Mississippi\u2019s practice nor the burden-shifting statutes can be reconciled with the Court\u2019s holding.

E. 2d 420 (1944) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The following authorities hold that State Rules of Evidence permit certificates, which state that scientific instruments were in good working order, to be admitted into evidence without confrontation: <em>Wester </em>v. <em>State, </em>528 P. 2d 1179, 1183 (Alaska 1974) (certificate stating that breathalyzer machine was in working order); <em>Best </em>v. <em>State, </em>328 A. 2d 141, 143 (Del. 1974) (certificate that breathalyzer was in working order); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rines, </em>269 A. 2d 9, 13-15 (Me. 1970) (manufacturer\u2019s certificate stating that blood-alcohol test kit was in working order admissible under the business-records exception); McI<em>lwain </em>v. <em>State, </em>700 So. 2d 586, 590-591 (Miss. 1997) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Taking the minority view, the following authorities interpret state hearsay rules to require confrontation of the results of routine scientific tests or observations of medical personnel: <em>State </em>v. <em>Sandoval-Tena, </em>138 Idaho 908, 912, 71 P. 3d 1055, 1059 (2003) (laboratory drug report inadmissible under state hearsay rule); <em>Spears </em>v. <em>State, </em>241 So. 2d 148 (Miss. 1970) (nurse\u2019s observation of victim inadmissible under state hearsay rule and Constitution); <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>255 S. C. 365, 179 S. E. 2d 41 (1971) (chemical analysis of victim\u2019s bodily fluid inadmissible under state hearsay rule); <em>Cole </em>v. <em>State, </em>839 S. W. 2d 798 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990) (laboratory drug report inadmissible under state hearsay rule); <em>State </em>v. <em>Workman, </em>2005 UT 66, \u00b6\u00b69-20, 122 P. 3d 639, 642-643 (same); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>2002 WI 58, \u00b6 \u00b6 32-62, 253 Wis. 2d 99, 118-127, 644 N. W. 2d 919, 928-932 (same), but see <em>id., </em>at 109-117, 644 N. W. 2d, at 924-927 (no confrontation violation where expert testified based on test results prepared by an out-of-court analyst).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>This summary does not include decisions that find test results inadmissible because the State failed to lay a proper foundation. Rather than endorse the minority view, those cases merely reaffirm the government\u2019s burden to prove the authenticity of its evidence and the applicability of an exception to the state hearsay rule. See, <em>e. g., State </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>178 N. W. 2d 380 (Iowa 1970) (laboratory test of victim\u2019s bodily fluid inadmissible under business-records exception because the prosecution did not show that it was kept in regular course of business); <em>State </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>198 Kan. 52, 422 P. 2d 964 (1967) (no foundation laid for introduction of blood-alcohol test because the prosecution did not show that the test was conducted in the usual course of business); <em>Moon </em>v. <em>State, </em>300 Md. 354, 367-371, 478 A. 2d 695, 702-703 (1984) (blood-alcohol test inadmissible because insufficient foundational evidence that the test was conducted in a reliable manner); cf. <em>Davis, supra, </em>at 440 (laboratory test of victim\u2019s bodily fluid admitted under business-records exception to state hearsay rule); <em>Garlick, supra, </em>at 215, n. 2, 223-225, 545 A. 2d, at 30, n. 2, 34 (laboratory test of defendant\u2019s blood falls within \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d hearsay exception).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Three States once espoused the minority view but appear to have changed course to some degree: <em>People </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>294 Mich. 684, 293 N. W. 907 (1940) (hospital record describing victim\u2019s injuries inadmissible hearsay), overruled by <em>Kirtdoll, </em>391 Mich., at 372, 217 N. W. 2d, at 39 (noting that \u201c[i]n its 35-year-long history, <em>Lewis </em>... has never been relied upon to actually deny admission into evidence of a business entry record in a criminal case\u201d), but see <em>People </em>v. <em>McDaniel, </em>469 Mich. 409, 670 N. W. 2d 659 (2003) <em>(per curiam) </em>(police laboratory report inadmissible hearsay); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tims, </em>9 Ohio St. 2d 136, 137-138, 224 N. E. 2d 348, 350 (1967) (hospital record describing victim\u2019s injuries inadmissible hearsay), overruled by <em>Spikes, </em>67 Ohio St. 2d, at 411-415, 423 N. E. 2d, at 1128-1130; <em>State </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>554 S. W. 2d 117 (Tenn. 1977) (laboratory drug report inadmissible absent confronta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>tion), abrogated by statute as recognized by <em>Hughes, </em>713 S. W. 2d 58 (statute permitted defendant to subpoena analyst who prepared blood-alcohol report; by not doing so, defendant waived his right to confront the analyst).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
