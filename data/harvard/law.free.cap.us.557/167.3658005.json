S. C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq. </em>Because we hold that such a jury instruction is never proper in an ADEA case, we vacate the decision below.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Petitioner Jack Gross began working for respondent FBL Financial Group, Inc. (FBL), in 1971. As of 2001, Gross held the position of claims administration director. But in 2003, when he was 54 years old, Gross was reassigned to .the position of claims project coordinator. At that same time, FBL transferred many of Gross\u2019 job responsibilities to a newly created position \u2014 claims administration manager. That position was given to Lisa Kheeskern, who had previously been supervised by Gross and who was then in her early forties. App. to Pet. for Cert. 15a, 23a (District Court opinion). Although Gross (in his new position) and Kheeskern received the same compensation, Gross considered the reassignment a demotion because of FBL\u2019s reallocation of his former job responsibilities to Kheeskern.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">In April 2004, Gross filed suit in District Court, alleging that his reassignment to the position of claims project coordinator violated the ADEA, which makes it unlawful for an employer to take adverse action against an employee \u201cbecause of such individual\u2019s age.\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 623(a). The case proceeded to trial, where Gross introduced evidence suggesting that his reassignment was based at least in part on his age. FBL defended its decision on the grounds that Gross\u2019 reassignment was part of a corporate restructuring and that Gross\u2019 new position was better suited to his skills. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a (District Court opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">At the close of trial, and over FBL\u2019s objections, the District Court instructed the jury that it must return a verdict for Gross if he proved, by a preponderance of the evidence, that FBL \u201cdemoted [him] to claims projec[t] coordinator\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>that his \u201cage was a motivating factor\u201d in FBL\u2019s decision to demote him. App. 9-10. The jury was further instructed that Gross\u2019 age would qualify as a \u201c \u2018motivating factor,\u2019 if [it] played a part or a role in [FBL]\u2019s decision to demote [him].\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 10. The jury was also instructed regarding FBL\u2019s burden of proof. According to the District Court, the \u201cverdict must be for [FBL] ... if it has been proved by the preponderance of the evidence that [FBL] would have demoted [Gross] regardless of his age.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The jury returned a verdict for Gross, awarding him $46,945 in lost compensation. <em>Id., </em>at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">FBL challenged the jury instructions on appeal. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed and remanded for a new trial, holding that the jury had been incorrectly instructed under the standard established in <em>Price Waterhouse </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>490 U. S. 228 (1989). See 526 F. 3d 356, 358 (2008). In <em>Price Waterhouse, </em>this Court addressed the proper allocation of the burden of persuasion in cases brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e <em>et seq., </em>when an employee alleges that he suffered an adverse employment action because of both permissible and impermissible <em>considerations </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>a \u201cmixed-motives\u201d case. 490 U. S., at 232, 244-247 (plurality opinion). The <em>Price Waterhouse </em>decision was splintered. Four Justices joined a plurality opinion, see <em>id., </em>at 231-258, Justices White and O\u2019Con-nor separately concurred in the judgment, see <em>id., </em>at 258-261 (opinion of White, J.); <em>id., </em>at 261-279 (opinion of O\u2019Connor, J.), and three Justices dissented, see <em>id., </em>at 279-295 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). Six Justices ultimately agreed that if a Title VII plaintiff shows that discrimination was a \u201cmotivating\u201d or a \u201c \u2018substantial\u2019 \u201d factor in the employer\u2019s action, the burden of persuasion should shift to the employer to show that it would have taken the same action regardless of that impermissible consideration. See <em>id., </em>at 258 (plurality opinion); <em>id., </em>at 259-260 (opinion of White, J.); <em>id., </em>at 276 (opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>of O\u2019Connor, J.). Justice O\u2019Connor further found that to shift the burden of persuasion to the employer, the employee must present \u201cdirect evidence that an illegitimate criterion was a substantial factor in the [employment] decision.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">In accordance with Circuit precedent, the Court of Appeals identified Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s opinion as controlling. See 526 F. 3d, at 359 (citing <em>Erickson </em>v. <em>Farmland Industries, Inc., </em>271 F. 3d 718, 724 (CA8 2001)). Applying that standard, the Court of Appeals found that Gross needed to present \u201c[d]irect evidence ... sufficient to support a finding by a reasonable fact finder that an illegitimate criterion actually motivated the adverse employment action.\u201d 526 F. 3d, at 359 (internal quotation marks omitted). In the Court of Appeals\u2019 view, \u201cdirect evidence\u201d is only that evidence that \u201cshow[s] a specific link between the alleged discriminatory animus and the challenged decision.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Only upon a presentation of such evidence, the Court of Appeals held, should the burden shift to the employer \u201c \u2018to convince the trier of fact that it is more likely than not that the decision would have been the same absent consideration of the illegitimate factor.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Price Waterhouse, supra, </em>at 276 (opinion of O\u2019Con-nor, J.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The Court of Appeals thus concluded that the District Court\u2019s jury instructions were flawed because they allowed the burden to shift to FBL upon a presentation of a preponderance of <em>any </em>category of evidence showing that age was a motivating factor \u2014 not just \u201cdirect evidence\u201d related to FBL\u2019s alleged consideration of age. See 526 F. 3d, at 360. Because Gross conceded that he had not presented direct evidence of discrimination, the Court of Appeals held that the District Court should not have given the mixed-motives instruction. <em>Ibid. </em>Rather, Gross should have been held to the burden of persuasion applicable to typical, non-mixed-motives claims; the jury thus should have been instructed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>only to determine whether Gross had carried his burden of \u201cproving] that age was the determining factor in FBL\u2019s employment action.\u201d See <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. 1066 (2008), and now vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">The parties have asked us to decide whether a plaintiff must \u201cpresent direct evidence of discrimination in order to obtain a mixed-motive instruction in a non-Title VII discrimination case.\u201d Pet. for Cert. i. Before reaching this question, however, we must first determine whether the burden of persuasion ever shifts to the party defending an alleged mixed-motives discrimination claim brought under the ADEA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">Petitioner relies on this Court\u2019s decisions construing Title VII for his interpretation of the ADEA. Because Title VII is materially different with respect to the relevant burden of persuasion, however, these decisions do not control our construction of the ADEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">In <em>Price Waterhouse, </em>a plurality of the Court and two Justices concurring in the judgment determined that once a \u201cplaintiff in a Title VII case proves that [the plaintiff\u2019s membership in a protected class] played a motivating part in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>employment decision, the defendant may avoid a finding of liability only by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have made the same decision even if it had not taken [that factor] into account.\u201d 490 U. S., at 258; see also <em>id,., </em>at 259-260 (opinion of White, J.); <em>id., </em>at 276 (opinion of O\u2019Connor, J.). But as we explained in <em>Desert Palace, Inc. </em>v. <em>Costa, </em>539 U. S. 90, 94-95 (2003), Congress has since amended Title VII by explicitly authorizing discrimination claims in which an improper consideration was \u201ca motivating factor\u201d for an adverse employment decision. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000e-2(m) (providing that \u201can unlawful employment practice is established when the complaining party demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was <em>a motivating factor </em>for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice\u201d (emphasis added)); \u00a7 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) (restricting the remedies available to plaintiffs proving violations of \u00a7 2000e-2(m)).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">This Court has never held that this burden-shifting framework applies to ADEA claims. And, we decline to do so now. When conducting statutory interpretation, we \u201cmust be careful not to apply rules applicable under one statute to a different statute without careful and critical examination.\u201d <em>Federal Express Corp. </em>v. <em>Holowecki, </em>552 U. S. 389, 393 (2008). Unlike Title VII, the ADEA\u2019s text does not provide that a plaintiff may establish discrimination by showing that age was simply a motivating factor. Moreover, Congress neglected to add such a provision to the ADEA when it amended Title VII to add \u00a7\u00a72000e-2(m) and 2000e-5(g)(2)(B), even though it contemporaneously amended the ADEA in several ways, see Civil Rights Act of 1991, \u00a7 115, 105 Stat. 1079; <em>id., </em>\u00a7302, at 1088.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">We cannot ignore Congress\u2019 decision to amend Title VII\u2019s relevant provisions but not make similar changes to the ADEA. When Congress amends one statutory provision but not another, it is presumed to have acted intentionally. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>See <em>EEOC </em>v. <em>Arabian American Oil Co., </em>499 U. S. 244, 256 (1991). Furthermore, as the Court has explained, \u201cnegative implications raised by disparate provisions are strongest\u201d when the provisions were \u201cconsidered simultaneously when the language raising the implication was inserted.\u201d <em>Lindh </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>521 U. S. 320, 330 (1997). As a result, the Court\u2019s interpretation of the ADEA is not governed by Title VII decisions such as <em>Desert Palace </em>and <em>Price Waterhouse.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Our inquiry therefore must focus on the text of the ADEA to decide whether it authorizes a mixed-motives age discrimination claim. It does not. \u201cStatutory construction must begin with the language employed by Congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Engine Mfrs. Assn. </em>v. <em>South Coast Air Quality Management Dist., </em>541 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>U. S. 246, 252 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). The ADEA provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for an employer ... to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, <em>because of </em>such individual\u2019s age.\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 623(a)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The words \u201cbecause of\u201d mean \u201cby reason of: on account of.\u201d 1 Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 194 (1966); see also 1 Oxford English Dictionary 746 (1933) (defining \u201cbecause of\u201d to mean \u201c[b]y reason <em>of </em>on account <em>of </em>\u201d (italics in original)); The Random House Dictionary of the English Language 132 (1966) (defining \u201cbecause\u201d to mean \u201cby reason; on account\u201d). Thus, the ordinary meaning of the ADEA\u2019s requirement that an employer took adverse action \u201cbecause of\u201d age is that age was the \u201creason\u201d that the employer decided to act. See <em>Hazen Paper Co. </em>v. <em>Biggins, </em>507 U. S. 604, 610 (1993) (explaining that the claim \u201ccannot succeed unless the employee\u2019s protected trait actually played a role in [the employer\u2019s decisionmaking] process <em>and had a determinative influence on the outcome\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). To establish a disparate-treatment claim under the plain language of the ADEA, therefore, a plaintiff must prove that age was the \u201cbut-for\u201d cause of the employer\u2019s adverse decision. See <em>Bridge </em>v. <em>Phoenix Bond &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>553 U. S. 639, 653-654 (2008) (recognizing that the phrase, \u201cby reason of,\u201d requires at least a showing of \u201cbut for\u201d causation (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of America </em>v. <em>Burr, </em>551 U. S. 47, 63-64, and n. 14 (2007) (observing that \u201c[i]n common talk, the phrase 'based on\u2019 indicates a but-for causal relationship and thus a necessary logical condition\u201d and that the statutory phrase, \u201cbased on,\u201d has the same meaning as the phrase, \u201cbecause of\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf. W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts 265 (5th ed. 1984) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>(\u201cAn act or omission is not regarded as a cause of an event if the particular event would have occurred without it\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">It follows, then, that under \u00a7 623(a)(1), the plaintiff retains the burden of persuasion to establish that age was the \u201cbut-for\u201d cause of the employer\u2019s adverse action. Indeed, we have previously held that the burden is allocated in this manner in ADEA cases. See <em>Kentucky Retirement Systems </em>v. <em>EEOC, </em>554 U.S. 135, 139-143, 148-150 (2008); <em>Reeves </em>v. <em>Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., </em>530 U. S. 133, 141, 143 (2000). And nothing in the statute\u2019s text indicates that Congress has carved out an exception to that rule for a subset of ADEA cases. Where the statutory text is \u201csilent on the allocation of the burden of persuasion,\u201d we \u201cbegin with the ordinary default rule that plaintiffs bear the risk of failing to prove their claims.\u201d <em>Schaffer </em>v. <em>Weast, </em>546 U. S. 49, 56 (2005); see also <em>Meacham </em>v. <em>Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory, </em>554 U. S. 84, 92 (2008) (\u201cAbsent some reason to believe that Congress intended otherwise,... we will conclude that the burden of persuasion lies where it usually falls, upon the party seeking relief\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). We have no warrant to depart from the general rule in this setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Hence, the burden of persuasion necessary to establish employer liability is the same in alleged mixed-motives cases as in any other ADEA disparate-treatment action. A plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence (which may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>be direct or circumstantial) that age was the \u201cbut-for\u201d cause of the challenged employer decision. See <em>Reeves, supra, </em>at 141-143,147.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Finally, we reject petitioner\u2019s contention that our interpretation of the ADEA is controlled by <em>Price Waterhouse, </em>which initially established that the burden of persuasion shifted in alleged mixed-motives Title VII claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In any event, it is far from clear that the Court would have the same approach were it to consider the question today in the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>instance. Cf. <em>14 Penn Plaza LLC </em>v. <em>Pyett, </em>556 U. S. 247, 270 (2009) (declining to \u201cintroduc[e] a qualification into the ADEA that is not found in its text\u201d); <em>Meacham, supra, </em>at 102 (explaining that the ADEA must be \u201cread ... the way Congress wrote it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Whatever the deficiencies of <em>Price Waterhouse </em>in retrospect, it has become evident in the years since that case was decided that its burden-shifting framework is difficult to apply. For example, in cases tried to a jury, courts have found it particularly difficult to craft an instruction to explain its burden-shifting framework. See, <em>e.g., Tyler </em>v. <em>Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>958 F. 2d 1176, 1179 (CA2 1992) (referring to \u201cthe murky water of shifting burdens in discrimination cases\u201d); <em>Visser </em>v. <em>Packer Engineering Associates, Inc., </em>924 F. 2d 655, 661 (CA7 1991) (en banc) (Flaum, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe difficulty judges have in formulating [burden-shifting] instructions and jurors have in applying them can be seen in the fact that jury verdicts in ADEA cases are supplanted by judgments notwithstanding the verdict or reversed on appeal more frequently than jury verdicts generally\u201d). Thus, even if <em>Price Waterhouse </em>was doetrinally sound, the problems associated with its application have eliminated any perceivable benefit to extending its framework to ADEA claims. Cf. <em>Continental T. V., Inc. </em>v. <em>GTE Sylvania Inc., </em>433 U. S. 36, 47 (1977) (reevaluating precedent that was subject to criticism and \u201ccontinuing controversy and confusion\u201d); <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Tennessee, </em>501 U. S. 808, 839-844 (1991) (Souter, J., concurring).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A_x\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">We hold that a plaintiff bringing a disparate-treatment. claim pursuant to the ADEA must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that age was the \u201cbut-for\u201d cause of the challenged adverse employment action. The burden of persuasion does not shift to the employer to show that it would have taken the action regardless of age, even when a plaintiff has produced some evidence that age was one motivating factor in that decision. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq., </em>makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any employee \u201cbecause of\u201d that individual\u2019s age, \u00a7 623(a). The most natural reading of this statutory text prohibits adverse employment actions motivated in whole or in part by the age of the employee. The \u201cbut-for\u201d causation standard endorsed by the .Court today was advanced in Justice Kennedy\u2019s dissenting opinion in <em>Price Waterhouse </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>490 U. S. 228, 279 (1989), a case construing identical language in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). Not only did the Court reject the but-for standard in that case, but so too did Congress when it amended Title VII in 1991. Given this unambiguous history, it is particularly inappropriate for the Court, on its own initiative, to adopt an interpretation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>causation requirement in the ADEA that differs from the established reading of Title VIL I disagree not only with the Court\u2019s interpretation of the statute, but also with its decision to engage in unnecessary lawmaking. I would simply answer the question presented by the certiorari petition and hold that a plaintiff need not present direct evidence of age discrimination to obtain a mixed-motives instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The Court asks whether a mixed-motives instruction is ever appropriate in an ADEA ease.

In the usual course, this Court would not entertain such a request raised only in a merits brief: \u201c \u2018We would normally expect notice of an intent to make so far-reaching an argument in the respondent\u2019s opposition to a petition for certiorari, cf. this Court\u2019s Rule 15.2, thereby assuring adequate preparation time for those likely affected and wishing to participate.\u2019\u201d <em>Alabama </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>585 U. S. 654, 660, n. 3 (2002) (quoting <em>South Central Bell Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>526 U. S. 160, 171 (1999)). Yet the Court is unconcerned that the question it chooses to answer has not been briefed by the parties or interested <em>amici curiae. </em>Its failure to consider the views of the United States, which represents the agency charged with administering the ADEA, is especially irresponsible.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Unfortunately, the majority\u2019s inattention to prudential Court practices is matched by its utter disregard of our precedent and Congress\u2019 intent. The ADEA provides that \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for an employer ... to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, <em>because of </em>such individual\u2019s age.\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 623(a)(1) (emphasis added). As we recognized in <em>Price Waterhouse </em>when we construed the identical \u201cbecause of\u201d language of Title VII, see 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l) (making it unlawful for an employer \u201cto fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual... with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, <em>because of </em>such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin\u201d (emphasis added)), the most natural reading of the text proscribes adverse employment actions motivated in whole or in part by the age of the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">In <em>Price Waterhouse, </em>we concluded that the words \u201c \u2018because of\u2019 such individual\u2019s ... sex... mean that gender must be irrelevant to employment decisions.\u201d 490 U. S., at 240 (plurality opinion) (emphasis deleted); see also <em>id., </em>at 260 (White, J., concurring in judgment). To establish a violation of Title VII, we therefore held, a plaintiff had to prove that her sex was a motivating factor in an adverse employment decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We recognized that the employer had an affirmative defense: It could avoid a finding of liability by proving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>that it would have made the same decision even if it had not taken the plaintiff\u2019s sex into account. <em>Id., </em>at 244-245 (plurality opinion). But this affirmative defense did not alter the meaning of \u201cbecause of.\u201d As we made clear, when \u201can employer considers both gender and legitimate factors at the time of making a decision, that decision was \u2018because of\u2019 sex.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 241; see also <em>id., </em>at 260 (White, J., concurring in judgment). We readily rejected the dissent\u2019s contrary assertion. \u201cTo construe the words \u2018because of\u2019 as colloquial shorthand for \u2018but-for\u2019 causation,\u201d we said, \u201cis to misunderstand them.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 240 (plurality opinion).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Today, however, the Court interprets the words \u201cbecause of\u201d in the ADEA \u201cas colloquial shorthand for \u2018but-for\u2019 causation.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>That the Court is construing the ADEA rather than Title VII does not justify this departure from precedent. The relevant language in the two statutes is identical, and we have long recognized that our interpretations of Title VII\u2019s language apply \u201cwith equal force in the context of age discrimination, for the substantive provisions of the ADEA \u2018were derived <em>in haec verba </em>from Title VII.\u2019\u201d <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Thurston, </em>469 U. S. 111, 121 (1985) (quoting <em>Lorillard </em>v. <em>Pons, </em>434 U. S. 575, 584 (1978)). See generally <em>Northcross </em>v. <em>Board of Ed. of Memphis City Schools, </em>412 U. S. 427, 428 (1973) <em>(per curiam). </em>For this reason, Justice Kennedy\u2019s dissent in <em>Price Waterhouse </em>assumed the plurality\u2019s mixed-motives framework extended to the ADEA, see 490 U. S., at 292, and the Courts of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>to have considered the issue unanimously have applied <em>Price Waterhouse </em>to ADEA claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The Court nonetheless suggests that applying <em>Price Waterhouse </em>would be inconsistent with our ADEA precedents. In particular, the Court relies on our statement in <em>Hazen Paper Co. </em>v. <em>Biggins, </em>507 U. S. 604, 610 (1993), that \u201c[a disparate-treatment] claim \u2018cannot succeed unless the employee\u2019s protected trait actually played a role in [the employer\u2019s decisionmaking] process <em>and had a determinative influence on the </em>outcome.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 176. The italicized phrase is at best inconclusive as to the meaning of the ADE A\u2019s \u201cbecause of\u201d language, however, as other passages in <em>Hazen Paper Co. </em>demonstrate. We also stated, for instance, that the ADEA \u201crequires the employer to <em>ignore </em>an employee\u2019s age,\u201d 507 U. S., at 612 (emphasis added), and noted that \u201c[w]hen the employer\u2019s decision is <em>wholly motivated </em>by factors other than age,\u201d there is no violation, <em>id., </em>at 611 (emphasis altered). So too, we indicated the \u201cpossibility of dual liability under [the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974] and the ADEA where the decision to fire the employee was motivated both by the employee\u2019s age and by his pension status,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 613 \u2014 a classic mixed-motives scenario.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Moreover, both <em>Hazen Paper Co. </em>and <em>Reeves </em>v. <em>Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., </em>530 U. S. 133 (2000), on which the majority also relies, support the conclusion that the ADEA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>should be interpreted consistently with Title VII. In those non-mixed-motives ADEA cases, the Court followed the standards set forth in non-mixed-motives Title VII cases including <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>411 U. S. 792 (1973), and <em>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs </em>v. <em>Burdine, </em>450 U. S. 248 (1981). See, <em>e. g., Reeves, </em>530 U. S., at 141-143; <em>Hazen Paper Co., </em>507 U. S., at 610. This by no means indicates, as the majority reasons, that <em>mixed-motives </em>ADEA cases should follow those standards. Rather, it underscores that ADEA standards are generally understood to conform to Title VII standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The conclusion that \u201cbecause of\u201d an individual\u2019s age means that age was a motivating factor in an employment decision is bolstered by Congress\u2019 reaction to <em>Price Waterhouse </em>in the 1991 Civil Rights Act. As part of its response to \u201ca number of recent decisions by the United States Supreme Court that sharply cut back on the scope and effectiveness of [civil rights] laws,\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 102-40, pt. 2, p. 2 (1991) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.), Congress eliminated the affirmative defense to liability that <em>Price Waterhouse </em>had furnished employers and provided instead that an employer\u2019s same-decision showing would limit only a plaintiff\u2019s remedies. See \u00a7 2000e-5(g)(2)(B). Importantly, however, Congress ratified <em>Price Waterhouse\u2019s </em>interpretation of the plaintiff\u2019s burden of proof, rejecting the dissent\u2019s suggestion in that case that but-for causation was the proper standard. See \u00a72000e-2(m) (\u201c[A]n unlawful employment practice is established when the complaining party demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Because the 1991 Act amended only Title VII and not the ADEA with respect to mixed-motives claims, the Court reasonably declines to apply the amended provisions to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>ADEA.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But it proceeds to ignore the conclusion compelled by this interpretation of the Act: <em>Price Waterhouse\u2019s </em>construction of \u201cbecause of\u201d remains the governing law for ADEA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Our recent decision in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>City of Jackson, </em>544 U. S. 228,240 (2005), is precisely on point, as we considered in that case the effect of Congress\u2019 failure to amend the disparate-impact provisions of the ADEA when it amended the corresponding Title VII provisions in the 1991 Act. Noting that \u201cthe relevant 1991 amendments expanded the coverage of Title VII [but] did not amend the ADEA or speak to the subject of age discrimination,\u201d we held that <em>\u201cWards Cove\u2019s </em>pre-1991 interpretation of Title VII\u2019s identical language remains applicable to the ADEA.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(discussing Wards <em>Cove Packing Co. </em>v. <em>Atonio, </em>490 U. S. 642 (1989)); see also <em>Meacham </em>v. <em>Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory, </em>554 U. S. 84, 98 (2008). If the <em>Wards Cove </em>disparate-impact framework that Congress flatly repudiated in the Title VII context continues to apply to ADEA claims, the mixed-motives framework that Congress substantially endorsed surely applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Curiously, the Court reaches the opposite conclusion, relying on Congress\u2019 partial ratification of <em>Price Waterhouse </em>to argue against that case\u2019s precedential value. It reasons that if the 1991 amendments do not apply to the ADEA, <em>Price Waterhouse </em>likewise must not apply because Congress effectively codified <em>Price Waterhouse\u2019s </em>holding in the amendments. <em>Ante, </em>at 173-175. This does not follow. To the contrary, the fact that Congress endorsed this Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>interpretation of the \u201cbecause of\u201d language in <em>Price Water-house </em>(even as it rejected the employer\u2019s affirmative defense to liability) provides all the more reason to adhere to that decision\u2019s motivating-factor test. Indeed, Congress emphasized in passing the 1991 Act that the motivating-factor test was consistent with its original intent in enacting Title VII. See, <em>e. g., </em>H. R. Rep., pt. 2, at 17 (\u201cWhen enacting the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress made clear that it intended to prohibit all invidious consideration of sex, race, color, religion, or national origin in employment decisions\u201d (emphasis deleted)); <em>id., </em>at 2 (stating that the Act \u201creaffirm[ed] that any reliance on prejudice in making employment decisions is illegal\u201d); see also H. R. Rep., pt. 1, at 45; S. Rep. No. 101-315, pp. 6, 22 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The 1991 amendments to Title VII also provide the answer to the majority\u2019s argument that the mixed-motives approach has proved unworkable. <em>Ante, </em>at 179. Because Congress has codified a mixed-motives framework for Title VII cases \u2014 the vast majority of antidiscrimination lawsuits \u2014 the Court\u2019s concerns about that framework are of no moment. Were the Court truly worried about difficulties faced by trial courts and juries, moreover, it would not reach today\u2019s decision, which will further complicate every case in which a plaintiff raises both ADEA and Title VII claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The Court\u2019s resurrection of the but-for causation standard is unwarranted. <em>Price Waterhouse </em>repudiated that standard 20 years ago, and Congress\u2019 response to our decision further militates against the crabbed interpretation the Court adopts today. The answer to the question the Court has elected to take up \u2014 whether a mixed-motives jury instruction is ever proper in an ADEA case \u2014 is plainly yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Although the Court declines to address the question we granted certiorari to decide, I would answer that question by following our unanimous opinion in <em>Desert Palace, Inc. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number><em>Costa, </em>539 U. S. 90 (2003). I would accordingly hold that a plaintiff need not present direct evidence of age discrimination to obtain a mixed-motives instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The source of the direct-evidence debate is Justice O\u2019Con-nor\u2019s opinion concurring in the judgment in <em>Price Water-house. </em>Writing only for herself, Justice O\u2019Connor argued that a plaintiff should be required to introduce \u201cdirect evidence\u201d that her sex motivated the decision before the plurality\u2019s mixed-motives framework would apply. 490 U. S., at 276.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Many courts have treated Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s opinion in <em>Price Waterhouse </em>as controlling for both Title VII and ADEA mixed-motives cases in light of our statement in <em>Marks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>430 U. S. 188, 193 (1977), that \u201c[w]hen a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, The holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.\u2019\u201d Unlike the cases <em>Marks </em>addressed, however, <em>Price Waterhouse </em>garnered five votes for a single rationale: Justice White agreed with the plurality as to the motivating-factor test, see <em>supra, </em>at 182, n. 3; he disagreed only as to the type of evidence an employer was required to submit to prove that the same result would have occurred absent the unlawful motivation. Taking the plurality to demand objective evidence, he wrote separately to express his view that an employer\u2019s credible testimony could suffice. 490 U. S., at 261. Because Justice White provided a fifth vote for the \u201crationale explaining the result\u201d of the <em>Price Waterhouse </em>decision, <em>Marks, </em>430 U. S., at 193, his concurrence is properly understood as controlling, and he, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>like the plurality, did not require the introduction of direct evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Any questions raised by <em>Price Waterhouse </em>as to a direct-evidence requirement were settled by this Court\u2019s unanimous decision in <em>Desert Palace, </em>in which we held that a plaintiff need not introduce direct evidence to meet her burden in a mixed-motives case under Title VII, as amended by the Civil Rights Act of 1991. In construing the language of \u00a7 2000e-2(m), we reasoned that the statute did not mention, much less require, a heightened showing through direct evidence and that \u201cCongress has been unequivocal when imposing heightened proof requirements.\u201d 539 U. S., at 99. The statute\u2019s silence with respect to direct evidence, we held, meant that \u201cwe should not depart from the \u2018[conventional rul[e] of civil litigation ... [that] requires a plaintiff to prove his case by a preponderance of the evidence\u2019,... using \u2018direct or circumstantial evidence.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Price Waterhouse, </em>490 U. S., at 253 (plurality opinion), and <em>Postal Service Bd. of Governors </em>v. <em>Aikens, </em>460 U. S. 711 (1983)). We also recognized the Court\u2019s consistent acknowledgment of the utility of circumstantial evidence in discrimination cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Our analysis in <em>Desert Palace </em>applies with equal force to the ADEA. Cf. <em>ante, </em>at 178, n. 4. As with the 1991 amendments to Title VII, no language in the ADEA imposes a heightened direct-evidence requirement, and we have specifically recognized the utility of circumstantial evidence in ADEA cases. See <em>Reeves, </em>530 U. S., at 147 (cited by <em>Desert Palace, </em>539 U. S., at 99-100). Moreover, in <em>Hazen Paper Co., </em>we held that an award of liquidated damages for a \u201cwillful\u201d violation of the ADEA did not require proof of the employer\u2019s motivation through direct evidence, 507 U. S., at 615, and we have similarly rejected the imposition of special evidentiary rules in other ADEA cases. See, <em>e. g., Swierkiewicz </em>v. <em>Sorema N. A., </em>534 U. S. 506 (2002); <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Consolidated Coin Caterers Corp., </em>517 U. S. 308 (1996). <em>Desert Palace </em>thus confirms the answer provided by the plurality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>and Justice White in <em>Price Waterhouse: </em>An ADEA plaintiff need not present direct evidence of discrimination to obtain a mixed-motives instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The Court\u2019s endorsement of a different construction of the same critical language in the ADEA and Title VII is both unwise and inconsistent with settled law. The but-for standard the Court adopts was rejected by this Court in <em>Price Waterhouse </em>and by Congress in the Civil Rights Act of 1991. Yet today the Court resurrects the standard in an unabashed display of judicial lawmaking. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-11\"> Although the parties did not specifically frame the question to include this threshold inquiry, \u201c[t]he statement of any question presented is deemed to comprise every subsidiary question fairly included therein.\u201d This Court\u2019s Rule 14.1; see also <em>City of Sherrill </em>v. <em>Oneida Indian Nation of N.

But the Court\u2019s approach to interpreting the ADEA in light of Title VII has not been uniform. In <em>General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cline, </em>540 U. S. 581 (2004), for example, the Court declined to interpret the phrase \u201cbecause of... age\u201d in 29 U. S.

S., at 584, 592, n. 5. And the Court has not definitively decided whether the evidentiary framework of <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>411 U. S. 792 (1973), utilized in Title VII cases is appropriate in the ADEA context. See <em>Reeves </em>v. <em>Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., </em>530 U. S. 133, 142 (2000); <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Consolidated Coin Caterers Corp., </em>517 U. S. 308, 311 (1996). In this instance, it is the textual differences between Title VII and the ADEA that prevent us from applying <em>Price Waterhouse </em>and <em>Desert Palace </em>to federal age discrimination claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b225-7\"> Justice Breyer contends that there is \u201cnothing unfair or impractical\u201d about hinging liability on whether \u201cforbidden motive ... play[ed] a role in the employer\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 191, 192 (dissenting opinion).

In <em>Smith, </em>the Court applied to the ADEA its pre-1991 interpretation of Title VII with respect to disparate-impact claims despite Congress\u2019 1991 amendment adding disparate-impact claims to Title VII but not the ADEA. 544 U. S., at 240. But the amendments made by Congress in this same legislation, which added the \u201cmotivating factor\u201d language to Title VII, undermine Justice Stevens\u2019 argument. Congress not only explicitly added \u201cmotivating factor\u201d liability to Title VII, see <em>supra, </em>at 173-175, but it also partially abrogated <em>Price Waterhouse\u2019s </em>holding by eliminating an employer\u2019s complete affirmative defense to \u201cmotivating factor\u201d claims, see 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e-5(g)(2)(B). If such \u201cmotivating factor\u201d claims were already part of Title VII, the addition of \u00a72000e-5(g)(2)(B) alone would have been sufficient. Congress\u2019 careful tailoring of the \u201cmotivating factor\u201d claim in Title VII, as well as the absence of a provision parallel to \u00a72000e-2(m) in the ADEA, confirms that we cannot transfer the <em>Price Waterhouse </em>burden-shifting framework into the ADEA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b227-6\"> Gross points out that the Court has also applied a burden-shifting framework to certain claims brought in contexts other than pursuant to Title VII.

That Justice O\u2019Connor might have intended a different definition does not affect my conclusion, as I do not believe a plaintiff is required to introduce any special type of evidence to obtain a mixed-motives instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b238-7\">Justice Breyer,</author>\n<p id=\"AgD\">with whom Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">I agree with Justice Stevens that mixed-motive instructions are appropriate in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 context. And I join his opinion. The Court rejects this conclusion on the ground that the words \u201cbecause of\u201d require a plaintiff to prove that age was the \u201cbut-for\u201d cause of his employer\u2019s adverse employment action. <em>Ante, </em>at 176-177. But the majority does not explain why this is so. The words \u201cbecause of\u201d do not inherently require a showing of \u201cbut-for\u201d causation, and I see no reason to read them to require such a showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">It is one thing to require a typical tort plaintiff to show \u201cbut-for\u201d causation. In that context, reasonably objective scientific or commonsense theories of physical causation make the concept of \u201cbut-for\u201d causation comparatively easy to understand and relatively easy to apply. But it is an entirely different matter to determine a \u201cbut-for\u201d relation when we consider, not physical forces, but the mind-related characterizations that constitute motive. Sometimes we speak of <em>determining </em>or <em>discovering </em>motives, but more often we <em>ascribe </em>motives, after an event, to an individual in light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>of the individual\u2019s thoughts and other circumstances present at the time of decision. In a ease where we characterize an employer\u2019s actions as having been taken out of multiple motives, say, both because the employee was old and because he wore loud clothing, to apply \u201cbut-for\u201d causation is to engage in a hypothetical inquiry about what would have happened if the employer\u2019s thoughts and other circumstances had been different. The answer to this hypothetical inquiry will often be far from obvious, and, since the employee likely knows less than does the employer about what the employer was thinking at the time, the employer will often be in a stronger position than the employee to provide the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">All that a plaintiff can know for certain in such a context is that the forbidden motive did play a role in the employer\u2019s decision. And the fact that a jury has found that age did play a role in the decision justifies the use of the word \u201cbecause,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>the employer dismissed the employee because of his age (and other things). See <em>Price Waterhouse </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>490 U. S. 228, 239-242 (1989) (plurality opinion). I therefore would see nothing wrong in concluding that the plaintiff has established a violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">But the law need not automatically assess liability in these circumstances. In <em>Price Waterhouse, </em>the plurality recognized an affirmative defense where the defendant could show that the employee would have been dismissed regardless. The law permits the employer this defense, not because the forbidden motive, age, had no role in the <em>actual </em>decision, but because the employer can show that he would have dismissed the employee anyway in the <em>hypothetical </em>circumstance in which his age-related motive was absent. And it makes sense that this would be an affirmative defense, rather than part of the showing of a violation, precisely because the defendant is in a better position than the plaintiff to establish how he would have acted in this hypothetical situation. See <em>id., </em>at 242; cf. <em>ante, </em>at 185 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (describing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>the Title VII framework). I can see nothing unfair or impractical about allocating the burdens of proof in this way.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The instruction that the District Court gave seems appropriate and lawful. It says, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">\u201cYour verdict must be for plaintiff if all the following elements have been proved by the preponderance of the evidence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">\u201c[The] plaintiff\u2019s age was a motivating factor in defendant\u2019s decision to demote plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-8\">\u201cHowever, your verdict must be for defendant ... if it has been proved by the preponderance of the evidence that defendant would have demoted plaintiff regardless of his age.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-9\">\u201cAs used in these instructions, plaintiff\u2019s age was <em>\u2018a </em>motivating factor,\u2019 if plaintiff\u2019s age played a part or a role in the defendant\u2019s decision to demote plaintiff. However, plaintiff\u2019s age need not have been the only reason for defendant\u2019s decision to demote plaintiff.\u201d App. 9-10.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">For these reasons as well as for those set forth by JUSTICE Stevens, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
