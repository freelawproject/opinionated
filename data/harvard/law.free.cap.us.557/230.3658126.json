S. C. \u00a7 1400 <em>et seq., </em>requires States receiving federal funding to make a \u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d (EAPE) available to all children with disabilities residing in the State, \u00a7 1412(a)(1)(A). We have previously held that when a public school fails to provide a FAPE and a child\u2019s parents place the child in an appropriate private school without the school district\u2019s consent, a court may require the district to reimburse the parents for the cost of the private education. See <em>School Comm, of Burlington </em>v. <em>Department of Ed. of Mass., </em>471 U. S. 359, 370 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>(1985). The question presented in this ease is whether the IDEA Amendments of 1997 (Amendments), 111 Stat. 37, categorically prohibit reimbursement for private-education costs if a child has not \u201cpreviously received special education and related services under the authority of a public agency.\u201d \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii). We hold that the Amendments impose no such categorical bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Respondent T. A. attended public schools in the Forest Grove School District (School District or District) from the time he was in kindergarten through the winter of his junior year of high school. From kindergarten through eighth grade, respondent\u2019s teachers observed that he had trouble paying attention in class and completing his assignments. When respondent entered high school, his difficulties increased.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">In December 2000, during respondent\u2019s freshman year, his mother contacted the school counselor to discuss respondent\u2019s problems with his schoolwork. At the end of the school year, respondent was evaluated by a school psychologist. After interviewing him, examining his school records, and administering cognitive ability tests, the psychologist concluded that respondent did not need further testing for any learning disabilities or other health impairments, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The psychologist and two other school officials discussed the evaluation results with respondent\u2019s mother in June 2001, and all agreed that respondent did not qualify for special-education services. Respondent\u2019s parents did not seek review of that decision, although the hearing examiner later found that the School District\u2019s evaluation was legally inadequate because it failed to address all areas of suspected disability, including ADHD.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">With extensive help from his family, respondent completed his sophomore year at Forest Grove High School, but his problems worsened during his junior year. In February <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>2003, respondent\u2019s parents discussed with the School District the possibility of respondent completing high school through a partnership program with the local community college. They also sought private professional advice, and in March 2003 respondent was diagnosed with ADHD and a number of disabilities related to learning and memory. Advised by the private specialist that respondent would do best in a structured, residential learning environment, respondent\u2019s parents enrolled him at a private academy that focuses on educating children with special needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Four days after enrolling him in private school, respondent\u2019s parents hired a lawyer to ascertain their rights and to give the School District written notice of respondent\u2019s private placement. A few weeks later, in April 2003, respondent\u2019s parents requested an administrative due process hearing regarding respondent\u2019s eligibility for special-education services. In June 2003, the District engaged a school psychologist to assist in determining whether respondent had a disability that significantly interfered with his educational performance. Respondent\u2019s parents cooperated with the District during the evaluation process. In July 2003, a multidisciplinary team met to discuss whether respondent satisfied IDEA\u2019S disability criteria and concluded that he did not because his ADHD did not have a sufficiently significant adverse impact on his educational performance. Because the School District maintained that respondent was not eligible for special-education services and therefore declined to provide an individualized education program (IEP),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> respondent\u2019s parents left him enrolled at the private academy for his senior year.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The administrative review process resumed in September 2003. After considering the parties\u2019 evidence, including the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>testimony of numerous experts, the hearing officer issued a decision in January 2004 finding that respondent\u2019s ADHD adversely affected his educational performance and that the School District failed to meet its obligations under IDEA in not identifying respondent as a student eligible for special-education services. Because the District did not offer respondent a FAPE and his private-school placement was appropriate under IDEA, the hearing officer ordered the District to reimburse respondent\u2019s parents for the cost of the private-school tuition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The School District sought judicial review pursuant to \u00a7 1415(i)(2), arguing that the hearing officer erred in granting reimbursement. The District Court accepted the hearing officer\u2019s findings of fact but set aside the reimbursement award after finding that the 1997 Amendments categorically bar reimbursement of private-school tuition for students who have not \u201cpreviously received special education and related services under the authority of a public agency.\u201d \u00a7612(a)(10)(C)(ii), 111 Stat. 63, 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii). The District Court further held that, \u201c[e]ven assuming that tuition reimbursement may be ordered in an extreme case for a student not receiving special education services, under general principles of equity where the need for special education was obvious to school authorities,\u201d the facts of this case do not support equitable relief. App. to Pet. for Cert. 53a.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded for further proceedings. The court first noted that, prior to the 1997 Amendments, \u201cIDEA was silent on the subject of private school reimbursement, but courts had granted such reimbursement as \u2018appropriate\u2019 relief under principles of equity pursuant to 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C).\u201d 523 F. 3d 1078, 1085 (2008) (citing <em>Burlington, </em>471 U. S., at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>370). It then held that the Amendments do not impose a categorical bar to reimbursement when a parent unilaterally places in private school a child who has not previously received special-education services through the public school. Rather, such students \u201care eligible for reimbursement, to the same extent as before the 1997 amendments, as \u2018appropriate\u2019 relief pursuant to \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C).\u201d 523 F. 3d, at 1087-1088.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The Court of Appeals also rejected the District Court\u2019s analysis of the equities as resting on two legal errors. First, because it found that \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) generally bars relief in these circumstances, the District Court wrongly stated that relief was appropriate only if the equities were sufficient to \u201c \u2018override\u2019 \u201d that statutory limitation. The District Court also erred in asserting that reimbursement is limited to \u201c \u2018extreme\u2019 \u201d cases. <em>Id., </em>at 1088 (emphasis deleted). The Court of Appeals therefore remanded with instructions to reexamine the equities, including the failure of respondent\u2019s parents to notify the School District before removing respondent from public school. In dissent, Judge Rymer stated her view that reimbursement is not available as an equitable remedy in this case because respondent\u2019s parents did not request an IEP before removing him from public school, and respondent\u2019s right to a FAPE was therefore not at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Because the Courts of Appeals that have considered this question have reached inconsistent results,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we granted certiorari to determine whether \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C) establishes a categorical bar to tuition reimbursement for students who have not previously received special-education services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>under the authority of a public education agency. 555 U. S. 1130 (2009).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Justice Rehnquist\u2019s opinion for a unanimous Court in <em>Burlington </em>provides the pertinent background for our analysis of the question presented. In that case, respondent challenged the appropriateness of the IEP developed for his child by public-school officials. The child had previously received special-education services through the public school. While administrative review was pending, private specialists advised respondent that the child would do best in a specialized private educational setting, and respondent enrolled the child in private school without the school district\u2019s consent. The hearing officer concluded that the IEP was not adequate to meet the child\u2019s educational needs and that the school district therefore failed to provide the child a FAPE. Finding also that the private-school placement was appropriate under IDEA, the hearing officer ordered the school district to reimburse respondent for the cost of the private-school tuition.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">We granted certiorari in <em>Burlington </em>to determine whether IDEA authorizes reimbursement for the cost of private education when a parent or guardian unilaterally enrolls a child in private school because the public school has proposed an inadequate IEP and thus failed to provide a FAPE. The Act at that time made no express reference to the possibility of reimbursement, but it authorized a court to \u201cgrant such relief as the court determines is appropriate.\u201d \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In determining the scope of the relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>authorized, we noted that \u201cthe ordinary meaning of these words confers broad discretion on the court\u201d and that, absent any indication to the contrary, what relief is \u201cappropriate\u201d must be determined in light of the Act\u2019s broad purpose of providing children with disabilities a FAPE, including through publicly funded private-school placements when necessary. 471 U. S., at 369. Accordingly, we held that the provision\u2019s grant of authority includes \u201cthe power to order school authorities to reimburse parents for their expenditures on private special education for a child if the court ultimately determines that such placement, rather than a proposed IEP, is proper under the Act.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Our decision rested in part on the fact that administrative and judicial review of a parent\u2019s complaint often takes years. We concluded that, having mandated that participating States provide a FAPE for every student, Congress could not have intended to require parents to either accept an inadequate public-school education pending adjudication of their claim or bear the cost of a private education if the court ultimately determined that the private placement was proper under the Act. <em>Id., </em>at 370. Eight years later, we unanimously reaffirmed the availability of reimbursement in <em>Florence County School Dish Four </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>510 U. S. 7 (1993) (holding that reimbursement may be appropriate even when a child is placed in a private school that has not been approved by the State).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The dispute giving rise to the present litigation differs from those in <em>Burlington </em>and <em>Carter </em>in that it concerns not the adequacy of a proposed IEP but the School District\u2019s failure to provide an IEP at all. And, unlike respondent, the children in those cases had previously received public special-education services. These differences are insignificant, however, because our analysis in the earlier cases depended on the language and purpose of the Act and not the particular facts involved. Moreover, when a child requires special-education services, a school district\u2019s failure to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>pose an IEP of any kind is at least as serious a violation of its responsibilities under IDEA as a failure to provide an adequate IEP. It is thus clear that the reasoning of <em>Burlington </em>and <em>Carter </em>applies equally to this case. The only question is whether the 1997 Amendments require a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Congress enacted IDEA in 1970<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to ensure that all children with disabilities are provided \u201c <em>\u2018a </em>free appropriate public education which emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs [and] to assure that the rights of [such] children and their parents or guardians are protected.\u2019\u201d <em>Burlington, </em>471 U. S., at 367 (quoting 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1400(c) (1982 ed.), now codified as amended at \u00a7\u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A), (B)). After examining the States\u2019 progress under IDEA, Congress found in 1997 that substantial gains had been made in the area of special education but that more needed to be done to guarantee children with disabilities adequate access to appropriate services. See S. Rep. No. 105-17, p. 5 (1997). The 1997 Amendments were intended \u201cto place greater emphasis on improving student performance and ensuring that children with disabilities receive a quality public education.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Consistent with that goal, the Amendments preserved the Act\u2019s purpose of providing a FAPE to all children with disabilities. And they did not change the text of the provision we considered in <em>Burlington, </em>\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii), which gives courts broad authority to grant \u201cappropriate\u201d relief, including reimbursement for the cost of private special education when a school district fails to provide a FAPE. \u201cCongress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>when it re-enacts a statute without change.\u201d <em>Lorillard </em>v. <em>Pons, </em>434 U. S. 575, 580 (1978). Accordingly, absent a clear expression elsewhere in the Amendments of Congress\u2019 intent to repeal some portion of that provision or to abrogate our decisions in <em>Burlington </em>and <em>Carter, </em>we will continue to read \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) to authorize the relief respondent seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The School District and the dissent argue that one of the provisions enacted by the Amendments, \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C), effects such a repeal. Section 1412(a)(10)(C) is entitled \u201cPayment for education of children enrolled in private schools without consent of or referral by the public agency,\u201d and it sets forth a number of principles applicable to public reimbursement for the costs of unilateral private-school placements. Section 1412(a)(10)(C)(i) states that IDEA \u201cdoes not require a local educational agency to pay for the cost of education ... of a child with a disability at a private school or facility if that agency made a free appropriate public education available to the child\u201d and his parents nevertheless elected to place him in a private school. Section 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) then provides that a \u201ccourt or hearing officer may require [a public] agency to reimburse the parents for the cost of [private-school] enrollment if the court or hearing officer finds that the agency had not made a free appropriate public education available\u201d and the child has \u201cpreviously received special education and related services under the authority of [the] agency.\u201d Finally, \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii) discusses circumstances under which the \u201ccost of reimbursement described in clause (ii) may be reduced or denied,\u201d as when a parent fails to give 10 days\u2019 notice before removing a child from public school or refuses to make a child available for evaluation, and \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(iv) lists circumstances in which a parent\u2019s failure to give notice may or must be excused.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Looking primarily to clauses (i) and (ii), the School District argues that Congress intended \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C) to provide the exclusive source of authority for courts to order reimbursement when parents unilaterally enroll a child in private school. According to the District, clause (i) provides a safe harbor for school districts that provide a FAPE by foreclosing reimbursement in those circumstances. Clause (ii) then sets forth the circumstance in which reimbursement is appropriate \u2014 namely, when a school district fails to provide a FAPE to a child who has previously received special-education services through the public school. The District contends that because \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C) only discusses reimbursement for children who have previously received special-education services through the public school, IDEA only authorizes reimbursement in that circumstance. The dissent agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">For several reasons, we find this argument unpersuasive. First, the School District\u2019s reading of the Act is not supported by its text and context, as the 1997 Amendments do not expressly prohibit reimbursement under the circumstances of this case, and the District offers no evidence that Congress intended to supersede our decisions in <em>Burlington </em>and <em>Carter. </em>Clause (i)\u2019s safe harbor explicitly bars reimbursement only when a school district makes a FAPE available by correctly identifying a child as having a disability and proposing an IEP adequate to meet the child\u2019s needs. The clause says nothing about the availability of reimbursement when a school district fails to provide a FAPE. Indeed, its statement that reimbursement <em>is not </em>authorized when a school district provides a FAPE could be read to indicate that reimbursement <em>is </em>authorized when a school district does not fulfill that obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Clause (ii) likewise does not support the District\u2019s position. Because that clause is phrased permissively, stating only that courts \u201cmay require\u201d reimbursement in those circumstances, it does not foreclose reimbursement awards in other circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>stances. Together with clauses (iii) and (iv), clause (ii) is best read as elaborating on the general rule that courts may order reimbursement when a school district fails to provide a FAPE by listing factors that may affect a reimbursement award in the common situation in which a school district has provided a child with some special-education services and the child\u2019s parents believe those services are inadequate. Referring as they do to students who have previously received special-education services through a public school, clauses (ii) through (iv) are premised on a history of cooperation and together encourage school districts and parents to continue to cooperate in developing and implementing an appropriate IEP before resorting to a unilateral private placement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The clauses of \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C) are thus best read as elucidative rather than exhaustive. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Atlantic Research Corp., </em>551 U. S. 128, 137 (2007) (noting that statutory language may \u201cperfor[m] a significant function simply by clarifying\u201d a provision\u2019s meaning).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>This reading of \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C) is necessary to avoid the conclusion that Congress abrogated <em>sub silentio </em>our decisions in <em>Burlington </em>and <em>Carter. </em>In those cases, we construed \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) to authorize reimbursement when a school district fails to provide a FAPE and a child\u2019s private-school placement is appropriate, without regard to the child\u2019s prior receipt of services.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It would take more than Congress\u2019 failure to comment on the category of cases in which a child has not previously received special-education services for us to conclude that the Amendments substantially superseded our decisions and in large part repealed \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii). See <em>Branch </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>538 U. S. 254, 273 (2003) (plurality opinion) (\u201c[A]bsent a clearly expressed congressional intention, repeals by implication are not favored\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>ted)).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We accordingly adopt the reading of \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C) that is consistent with those decisions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The School District\u2019s reading of \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C) is also at odds with the general remedial purpose underlying IDEA and the 1997 Amendments. The express purpose of the Act is to \u201censure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs,\u201d \u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A) \u2014 a factor we took into account in construing the scope of \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii), see <em>Burlington, </em>471 U. S., at 369. Without the remedy respondent seeks, a \u201cchild\u2019s right to a <em>free </em>appropriate education . . . would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>less than complete.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 370. The District\u2019s position similarly conflicts with IDEA\u2019S \u201cchild find\u201d requirement, pursuant to which States are obligated to \u201cidentif[y], locat[e], and evaluat[e]\u201d \u201c[a]ll children with disabilities residing in the State\u201d to ensure that they receive needed special-education services. \u00a7 1412(a)(3)(A); see \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(A)(ii). A reading of the Act that left parents without an adequate remedy when a school district unreasonably failed to identify a child with disabilities would not comport with Congress\u2019 acknowledgment of the paramount importance of properly identifying each child eligible for services.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Indeed, by immunizing a school district\u2019s refusal to find a child eligible for special-education services no matter how compelling the child\u2019s need, the School District\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C) would produce a rule bordering on the irrational. It would be particularly strange for the Act to provide a remedy, as all agree it does, when a school district offers a child inadequate special-education services but to leave parents without relief in the more egregious situation in which the school district unreasonably denies a child access to such services altogether. That IDEA affords parents substantial procedural safeguards, including the right to challenge a school district\u2019s eligibility determination and obtain prospective relief, see <em>post, </em>at 258-259, is no answer. We roundly rejected that argument in <em>Burlington, </em>observing that the \u201creview process is ponderous\u201d and therefore inadequate to ensure that a school\u2019s failure to provide a FAPE is remedied with the speed necessary to avoid detriment to the child\u2019s education. 471 U. S., at 370. Like <em>Burlington, </em>see <em>ibid., </em>this case vividly demonstrates the problem of delay, as respondent\u2019s parents first sought a due process hearing in April 2003, and the District Court issued its decision in May 2005 \u2014 almost a year after respondent graduated from high school. The dissent all but ignores these shortcomings of IDEA\u2019S procedural safeguards.</p>\n<p id=\"A7g\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">The School District advances two additional arguments for reading the Act to foreclose reimbursement in this case. First, the District contends that because IDEA was an exercise of Congress\u2019 authority under the Spending Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 1, any conditions attached to a State\u2019s acceptance of funds must be stated unambiguously. See <em>Pennhurst State School and Hospital </em>v. <em>Halderman, </em>451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981). Applying that principle, we held in <em>Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed. </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>548 U. S. 291, 304 (2006), that IDEA\u2019S fee-shifting provision, \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B), does not authorize courts to award expert-services fees to prevailing parents in IDEA actions because the Act does not put States on notice of the possibility of such awards. But <em>Arlington </em>is readily distinguishable from this case. In accepting IDEA funding, States expressly agree to provide a FAPE to all children with disabilities. See \u00a7 1412(a)(1)(A). An order awarding reimbursement of private-education costs when a school district fails to provide a FAPE merely requires the district \u201cto belatedly pay expenses that it should have paid all along.\u201d <em>Burlington, </em>471 U. S., at 370-371. And States have in any event been on notice at least since our decision in <em>Burlington </em>that IDEA authorizes courts to order reimbursement of the costs of private special-education services in appropriate circumstances. Pennhurst\u2019s notice requirement is thus clearly satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Finally, the District urges that respondent\u2019s reading of the Act will impose a substantial financial burden on public-school districts and encourage parents to immediately enroll their children in private school without first endeavoring to cooperate with the school district. The dissent echoes this concern. See <em>post, </em>at 258. For several reasons, those fears are unfounded. Parents \u201care entitled to reimbursement <em>only </em>if a federal court concludes both that the public placement violated IDEA and the private school placement was proper under the Act.\u201d <em>Carter, </em>510 U. S., at 15. And even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>then courts retain discretion to reduce the amount of a reimbursement award if the equities so warrant \u2014 for instance, if the parents failed to give the school district adequate notice of their intent to enroll the child in private school. In considering the equities, courts should generally presume that public-school officials are properly performing their obligations under IDEA. See <em>Schaffer </em>v. <em>Weast, </em>546 U. S. 49, 62-63 (2005) (Stevens, J., concurring). As a result of these criteria and the fact that parents who \u201c \u2018unilaterally change their child\u2019s placement during the pendency of review proceedings, without the consent of state or local school officials, do so at their own financial risk,\u2019 \u201d <em>Carter, </em>510 U. S., at 15 (quoting <em>Burlington, </em>471 U. S., at 373-374), the incidence of private-school placement at public expense is quite small, see Brief for National Disability Rights Network et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>13-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The IDEA Amendments of 1997 did not modify the text of \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii), and we do not read \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C) to alter that provision\u2019s meaning. Consistent with our decisions in <em>Burlington </em>and <em>Carter, </em>we conclude that IDEA authorizes reimbursement for the cost of private special-education services when a school district fails to provide a FAPE and the private-school placement is appropriate, regardless of whether the child previously received special education or related services through the public school.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">When a court or hearing officer concludes that a school district failed to provide a PAPE and the private placement was suitable, it must consider all relevant factors, including the notice provided by the parents and the school district\u2019s opportunities for evaluating the child, in determining whether reimbursement for some or all of the cost of the child\u2019s private education is warranted. As the Court of Appeals noted, the District Court did not properly consider the equities in this case and will need to undertake that analysis on remand. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>peals is affirmed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Title 20 U.

The fact that clause (iii) <em>permits </em>a court to reduce a reimbursement award when a parent whose child has previously received special-education services fails to give the school adequate notice of an intended private placement does not mean that it <em>prohibits </em>courts from similarly reducing the amount of reimbursement when a parent whose child has not previously received services fails to give such notice.

See <em>id., </em>at 369; see <em>Florence County School Dish Four </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>510 U. S. 7, 12-13 (1993). The latter requirement is essential to ensuring that reimbursement awards are granted only when such relief furthers the purposes of the Act. See <em>Burlington, </em>471 U. S., at 369. That \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C) did not codify that requirement further indicates that Congress did not intend that provision to supplant \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) as the sole authority on reimbursement awards but rather meant to augment the latter provision and our decisions construing it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b291-6\"> As discussed above, although the children in <em>Burlington </em>and <em>Carter </em>had previously received special-education services in public school, our decisions in no way depended on their prior receipt of services. Those holdings rested instead on the breadth of the authority conferred by \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii), the interest in providing relief consistent with the Act\u2019s purpose, and the injustice that a contrary reading would produce, see <em>Burlington, </em>471 U.

That argument ignores our decision in <em>Burlington, </em>471 U. S., at 363, 370, which interpreted \u00a7 1415(i) (2) (C) (iii) to authorize hearing officers as well as courts to award reimbursement notwithstanding the provision\u2019s silence with regard to hearing officers. When Congress amended IDEA without altering the text of \u00a7 1415 (i) (2) (C)(iii), it implicitly adopted that construction of the statute. See <em>Lorillard </em>v. <em>Pons, </em>434 U.

S. 359 (1985), held that the Education of the Handicapped Act, 84 Stat. 175, now known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA or Act), 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1400 <em>et seq., </em>authorized a district court to order reimbursement of private school tuition and expenses to parents who took their disabled child from public school because the school\u2019s special education services did not meet the child\u2019s needs. We said that, for want of any specific limitation, this remedy was within the general authorization for courts to award \u201csuch relief as [they] determine] is appropriate.\u201d \u00a7 1415(e)(2) (1982 ed.) (now codified at \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) (2006 ed.)). In 1997, however, Congress amended the IDEA with a number of provisions explicitly addressing the issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>\u201c[p]ayment for education of children enrolled in private schools without consent of or referral by the public agency.\u201d \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C). These amendments generally prohibit reimbursement if the school district made a \u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d (FAPE) available, \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(i), and if they are to have any effect, there is no exception except by agreement, \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(B), or for a student who previously received special education services that were inadequate, \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The majority says otherwise and holds that \u00a7 1412(a) (10)(C)(ii) places no limit on reimbursements for private tuition. The Court does not find the provision clear enough to affect the rule in <em>Burlington, </em>and it does not believe Congress meant to limit public reimbursement for unilaterally incurred private school tuition. But there is no authority for a heightened standard before Congress can alter a prior judicial interpretation of a statute, and the assessment of congressional policy aims falls short of trumping what seems to me to be the clear limitation imposed by \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">In <em>Burlington, </em>parents of a child with a learning disability tried for over eight years to work out a satisfactory individualized education plan (IEP) for their son. 471 U. S., at 361-362. They eventually gave up and sent the boy to a private school for disabled children, <em>id., </em>at 362, and we took the ensuing case to decide whether the Education of the Handicapped Act authorized courts to order reimbursement for private special education \u201cif the court ultimately determines that such placement, rather than a proposed IEP, is proper under the Act,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 369. After noting various sections that \u201cemphasiz[e] the participation of the parents in developing the child\u2019s [public] educational program,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 368, we inferred that the Act authorized reimbursement by providing that a district court shall \u201c\u2018grant such relief as [it] determines is appropriate,\u2019\u201d <em>id., </em>at 369 (quoting what is now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii); alteration in original). We emphasized that the Act did not speak specifically to the issue of reimbursement, and held that \u201c[a]bsent other reference,\u201d reimbursement for private tuition and expenses would be an \u201c \u2018appropriate\u2019 \u201d remedy in light of the purposes of the Act. <em>Id., </em>at 369-370. In short, we read the general provision for ordering equitable remedies in \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) as authorizing a reimbursement order, in large part because Congress had not spoken more specifically to the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">But Congress did speak explicitly when it amended the IDEA in 1997. It first said that whenever the State or a local educational agency refers a student to private special education, the bill is a public expense. See 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(B). It then included several clauses addressing \u201c[p]ayment for education of children enrolled in private schools without consent of or referral by the public agency.\u201d \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C). The first contrasts with the provision covering an agency referral:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">\u201c(i) In general</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-7\">\u201c ... this subchapter does not require a local educational agency to pay for the cost of education ... of a child with a disability at a private school or facility if that agency made a free appropriate public education available to the child and the parents elected to place the child in such private school or facility.\u201d \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">The second clause covers the case in which the school authority failed to make a FAPE available in its schools. It does not, however, provide simply that the authority must pay in this case, no matter what. Instead it provides this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-9\">\u201c(ii) Reimbursement for private school placement</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANF\">\u201cIf the parents of a child with a disability, who previously received special education and related services under the authority of a public agency, enroll the child in a private elementary school or secondary school without the consent of or referral by the public agency, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>a court or a hearing officer may require the agency to reimburse the parents for the cost of that enrollment if the court or hearing officer finds that the agency had not made a free appropriate public education available to the child in a timely manner prior to that enrollment.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Two additional clauses spell out in some detail various facts upon which the reimbursement described in clause (ii) may be \u201creduced or denied.\u201d See \u00a7\u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii) and (iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">As a purely semantic matter, these provisions are ambiguous in their silence about the case with no previous special education services and no FAPE available. As the majority suggests, <em>ante, </em>at 241-242, clause (i) could theoretically be understood to imply that reimbursement may be ordered whenever a school district fails to provide a FAPE, and clause (ii) could be read as merely taking care to mention one of a variety of circumstances in which such reimbursement is permitted. But this is overstretching. When permissive language covers a special case, the natural sense of it is taken to prohibit what it fails to authorize. When a mother tells a boy that he may go out and play after his homework is done, he knows what she means.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">So does anyone who reads the authorization of a reimbursement order in the case of \u201ca child with a disability, who previously received special education and related services under the authority of a public agency.\u201d \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If the mother did not mean that the homework had to be done, why did she mention it at all, and if Congress did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>mean to restrict reimbursement authority by reference to previous receipt of services, why did it even raise the subject? \u201c[0]ne of the most basic interpretive canons [is] that [a] statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void or insignificant . . . <em>Corley </em>v. <em>United States, </em>556 U. S. 303, 314 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). But not on the Court\u2019s reading, under which clause (ii) does nothing but describe a particular subset of cases subject to remedial authority already given to courts by \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) and recognized in <em>Burlington: </em>a court may order reimbursement for a child who previously received special education related services, but it may do this for any other child, too.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But this is just not plausible, the notion that Congress added a new provision to the IDEA entitled \u201cReimbursement for private school placement\u201d that had no effect whatsoever on reimbursement for private school placement. I would read clause (i) as written on the assumption that the school authorities can be expected to honor their obligations and as stating the general rule that unilateral placement cannot be reimbursed. See \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(i) (\u201cIn general... \u201d). And I would read clause (ii) as imposing a receipt of prior services limit on any exceptions to that general rule when school officials fall short of providing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>FAPE. See \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) (\u201cReimbursement for private school placement ...\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">This reading can claim the virtue of avoiding a further anomaly. Section 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii), which limits otherwise available reimbursement, is expressly directed to \u201c[t]he cost of reimbursement described in clause (ii).\u201d This makes perfect sense under my reading. Since clause (ii) is now the exclusive source of authority, to order reimbursement, it is natural to refer to it in the clause setting out the conditions for reducing or even denying reimbursement otherwise authorized. Yet, as T. A. and the Government concede, Brief for Respondent 22; Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>4, 17, under the majority\u2019s reading, Congress has called for reducing reimbursement only for the most deserving (parents described in clause (ii) who consult with the school district and give public special education services a try before demanding payment for private education), but provided no mechanism to reduce reimbursement to the least deserving (parents who have not given public placement a chance).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The Court responds to this point by doubling down. According to the majority, the criteria listed in clause (iii) can justify a reduction not only of \u201creimbursement described in clause (ii),\u201d \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii), but can also do so for a reimbursement order authorized elsewhere as well, <em>ante, </em>at 242, n. 8. That is, the majority avoids ascribing perverse motives to Congress by concluding that in both clause (ii) and clause (iii), Congress meant to add nothing to the statutory scheme. This simply leads back to the question of why Congress in \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C) would have been so concerned with cases in which children had not previously received special education services when, on the majority\u2019s reading, the prior receipt of services has no relevance whatsoever to the subject of that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Because any other interpretation would render clause (ii) pointless and clause (iii) either pointless or perverse, \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) must be read to allow reimbursement only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>for \u201cparents of a child with a disability, who previously received special education and related services under the authority of a public agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Neither the majority\u2019s clear statement rule nor its policy considerations prevail over the better view of the 1997 amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">The majority says that, because of our previous interpretation of the Act as authorizing reimbursement for unilateral private placement, Congress was obliged to speak with added clarity to alter the statute as so understood. <em>Ante, </em>at 239-244. The majority refers to two distinct principles for support: first, statutes are to be read with a presumption against implied repeals, <em>e. g., ante, </em>at 243-244 (citing <em>Branch </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>538 U. S. 254, 273 (2003) (plurality opinion)), and second, congressional reenactment of statutory text without change is deemed to ratify a prior judicial interpretation of it, <em>e. g., ante, </em>at 239-240 (citing <em>Lorillard </em>v. <em>Pons, </em>434 U. S. 575, 580 (1978)). I think neither principle is up to the task.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Section 1412(a)(10)(C) in no way repealed the provision we considered in <em>Burlington.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The relief that \u201cis appropriate\u201d under \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) depends on the substantive provisions of the IDEA as surely as if the provision authorized equitable relief \u201cconsistent with the provisions of this statute.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When we applied \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) in <em>Burlington, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>we expressly referred to those provisions and concluded that, in the absence of a specific rule, \u201cappropriate\u201d relief included the reimbursement sought. By introducing new restrictions on reimbursement, the 1997 amendments produce a different conclusion about what relief is \u201cappropriate.\u201d But \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) remains in effect, just as it would remain in effect if Congress had explicitly amended the IDEA to prohibit reimbursement absent prior receipt of services.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">As for the rule that reenactment incorporates prior interpretation, the Court\u2019s reliance on it to preserve <em>Burlington\u2019s </em>reading of \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) faces two hurdles. First, so far as I can tell, this maxim has never been used to impose a clear statement rule. If Congress does not suggest otherwise, reenacted statutory language retains its old meaning; but when a new enactment includes language undermining the prior reading, there is no presumption favoring the old, and the only course open is simply to read the revised statute as a whole. This is so because there is no reason to distinguish between amendments that occur in a single clause (as if Congress had placed all the changes in \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii)), and those that take the form of a separate section (here, \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)). If Congress had added a caveat within \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii), or in an immediately neighboring provision, I assume the majority would not approach it with skepticism on the ground that it purported to modify a prior judicial interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Second, nothing in my reading of \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) is inconsistent with the holdings of <em>Burlington </em>and the other prior decision on the subject, <em>Florence County School Dish Four </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>510 U. S. 7 (1993). Our opinion in <em>Burlington </em>was expressly premised on there being no \u201cother reference\u201d that would govern reimbursement for private tuition, 471 U. S., at 369, and this all but invited Congress to provide one. Congress\u2019s provision of such a reference in 1997 is, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>say the very least, no reason for skepticism that Congress wished to alter the law on reimbursement. The 1997 legislation, read my way, would not, however, alter the result in either <em>Burlington </em>or <em>Carter. </em>In each case, the school district had agreed that the child was disabled, the parents had cooperated with the district and tried out an IEP, and the only question was whether parents who later resorted to a private school could be reimbursed \u201c 'if the court ultimately determines that such placement, rather than a proposed IEP, is proper under the Act.\u2019\u201d <em>Carter, supra, </em>at 12 (quoting <em>Burlington, supra, </em>at 369). In ordering reimbursement, the Court in both <em>Burlington </em>and <em>Carter </em>emphasized that the parents took part in devising an IEP, 471 U. S., at 368; 510 U. S., at 12, and expressed concern for parents who had sought an IEP before placing their child in private school, but received one that was inadequate, 471 U. S., at 370; 510 U. S., at 12. The result in each case would have been the same under my reading of the amended Act, both sets of parents being \u201cparents of a child with a disability, who previously received special education and related services under the authority of a public agency.\u201d \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii). It is therefore too much to suggest that my reading of \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) would \u201cabrogat[e] <em>sub silentio </em>our decisions in <em>Burlington </em>and <em>Carter,\u201d ante, </em>at 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The majority argues that the policy concerns vindicated in <em>Burlington </em>and <em>Carter </em>justify reading those cases to authorize a reimbursement authority going beyond their facts, <em>ante, </em>at 238-239, and would hold reimbursement possible even for parents who, like those here, unilaterally resort to a private school without first establishing at the administrative or appellate level that the child is disabled, or engaging in a collaborative process with the school officials. But how broadly one should read <em>Burlington </em>and <em>Carter </em>is beside the point, Congress having explicitly addressed the subject with statutory language that precludes the Court\u2019s result today.</p>\n<p id=\"A2x\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">The Court also rejects the natural sense of \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C) as an interpretation that would be \u201cat odds with the general remedial purpose underlying IDEA and the 1997 Amendments.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 244. The majority thinks my reading would place the school authorities in total control of parents\u2019 eligibility for reimbursement: just refuse any request for special education or services in the public school, and the prior service condition for eligibility under clause (ii) can never be satisfied. Thus, as the majority puts it, it would \u201cborde[r] on the irrational\u201d to \u201cimmuniz[e] a school district\u2019s refusal to find a child eligible for special-education services no matter how compelling the child\u2019s need.\u201d Ante, at 245. I agree that any such scheme would be pretty absurd, but there is no absurdity here. The majority\u2019s suggestion overlooks the terms of the IDEA process, the substantial procedures protecting a child\u2019s substantive rights under the IDEA, and the significant costs of its rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">To start with the costs, special education can be immensely expensive, amounting to tens of billions of dollars annually and as much as 20% of public schools\u2019 general operating budgets. See Brief for Council of the Great City Schools as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>22-23. The more private placement there is, the higher the special education bill, a fact that lends urgency to the IDEA\u2019S mandate of a collaborative process in which an IEP is \u201cdeveloped jointly by a school official qualified in special education, the child\u2019s teacher, the parents or guardian, and, where appropriate, the child.\u201d <em>Burlington, supra, </em>at 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The Act\u2019s repeated emphasis on the need for cooperative joint action by school and parent does not, however, leave the school in control if officials should wish to block effective (and expensive) action for the child\u2019s benefit, for if the collaborative approach breaks down, the IDEA provides for quick review in a \u201cdue process hearing\u201d of the parents\u2019 claim that more services are needed to provide a FAPE than the school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>is willing to give. See \u00a7 1415(c)(2) (district must respond to due process hearing complaint within 10 days and hearing officer must assess facial validity of complaint within 5 days); \u00a7 1415(e) (mediation is available, provided it does not delay due process hearing); \u00a7 1415(f)(1)(B) (district must convene a meeting with parents within 15 days to attempt to resolve complaint); 34 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 300.510(b)(l)-(2) (2008) (if complaint is not resolved, a hearing must be held within 30 days of complaint and a decision must be issued within 75 days of complaint). Parents who remain dissatisfied after these first two levels of process may have a right of appeal to the state educational agency and in any case may bring a court action in federal district court. See 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2). This scheme of administrative and judicial review is the answer to the Court\u2019s claim that reading the prior services condition as restrictive, not illustrative, immunizes a school district\u2019s intransigence, giving it an effective veto on reimbursement for private placement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">That said, the Court of course has a fair point that the prior services condition qualifies the remedial objective of the statute, and pursuing appeals to get a satisfactory IEP with special services worth accepting could be discouraging. The child who needs help does not stop needing it, or stop growing, while schools and parents argue back and forth. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>But we have to decide this case on the premise that most such arguments will be carried on in good faith, and even on the assumption that disagreements about the adequacy of IEPs will impose some burdens on the Act\u2019s intended beneficiaries, there is still a persuasive reason for Congress to have written the statute to mandate just what my interpretation requires. Given the burden of private school placement, it makes good sense to require parents to try to devise a satisfactory alternative within the public schools, by taking part in the collaborative process of developing an IEP that is the <em>\u201cmodus operandi\u201d </em>of the IDEA. <em>Burlington, </em>471 U. S., at 368. And if some time, and some educational opportunity, is lost in consequence, this only shows what we have realized before, that no policy is ever pursued to the ultimate, single-minded limit, and that \u201c[t]he IDEA obviously does not seek to promote [its] goals at the expense of all considerations, including fiscal considerations,\u201d <em>Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed. </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>548 U.

See also <em>Carlisle </em>v. <em>United States, </em>517 U.

But this is just another way of reading the provision off the books. On the majority\u2019s reading, clause (ii) states only that a court may award reimbursement when (1) there is a previous receipt of special education services and (2) a failure to provide a FAPE. Such a description of the most common subset of a category already described may be called elaboration, but it still has no effect on the statutory scheme.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b303-9\"> The presumption against implied repeals would not justify reading the later provision as useless even if it applied since, when two provisions are irreconcilable, the presumption against implied repeals gives way to the later enactment.

With no statement to the contrary from Congress, the Court expressed concern over the possible length of the IDEA review process and surmised that Congress would have intended for reimbursement to be authorized. <em>Ibid. </em>But Congress provided a statement to the contrary in 1997; the only reading that gives effect to \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) is that reimbursement is not permitted absent prior placement, and the only question for the Court now is whether Congress could have meant what it said.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b308-5\"> See 143 Cong.
