He sought this information to determine whether the banks had violated the State\u2019s fair-lending laws. Spitzer\u2019s successor in office, Andrew Cuomo, is the petitioner here. Respondents, the federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (Comptroller or OCC) and the Clearing House Association, a banking trade group, brought suit to enjoin the information request, claiming that the Comptroller\u2019s regulation promulgated under the National Bank Act prohibits that form of state law enforcement against national banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered an injunction in favor of respondents, prohibiting the Attorney General from enforcing state fair-lending laws through demands for records or judicial proceedings. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed. 510 F. 3d 105 (2007). We granted certiorari. 555 U. S. 1130 (2009). The question presented is whether the Comptroller\u2019s regulation purporting to pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>empt state law enforcement can be upheld as a reasonable interpretation of the National Bank Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Section 484(a) of Title 12 U. S. C., a provision of the National Bank Act, 13 Stat. 99, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">\u201cNo national bank shall be subject to any visitorial powers except as authorized by Federal law, vested in the courts of justice or such as shall be, or have been exercised or directed by Congress or by either House thereof or by any committee of Congress or of either House duly authorized.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">The Comptroller, charged with administering the National Bank Act, adopted, through notice-and-comment rulemaking, the regulation at issue here designed to implement the statutory provision. Its principal provisions read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-9\">\u201c\u00a7 7.4000 Visitorial powers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-10\">\u201c(a) <em>General rule. </em>(1) Only the OCC or an authorized representative of the OCC may exercise visitorial powers with respect to national banks, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. State officials may not exercise visitorial powers with respect to national banks, such as conducting examinations, inspecting or requiring the production of books or records of national banks, or prosecuting enforcement actions, except in limited circumstances authorized by federal law. However, production of a bank\u2019s records (other than nonpublic OCC information under 12 CFR part 4, subpart C) may be required under normal judicial procedures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-11\">\u201c(2) For purposes of this section, visitorial powers include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-12\">\u201c(i) Examination of a bank;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-13\">\u201c(ii) Inspection of a bank\u2019s books and records;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-14\">\u201c(iii) Regulation and supervision of activities authorized or permitted pursuant to federal banking law; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>\u201c(iv) Enforcing compliance with any applicable federal or state laws concerning those activities.\u201d 12 CFR \u00a77.4000 (2009).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">By its clear text, this regulation prohibits the States from \u201cprosecuting enforcement actions\u201d except in \u201climited circumstances authorized by federal law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Under the familiar <em>Chevron </em>framework, we defer to an agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of a statute it is charged with administering. <em>Chevron U S. A. Inc. </em>v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U. S. 837 (1984). There is necessarily some ambiguity as to the meaning of the statutory term \u201cvisitorial powers,\u201d especially since we are working in an era when the prerogative writs \u2014 through which visitorial powers were traditionally enforced \u2014 are not in vogue. The Comptroller can give authoritative meaning to the statute within the bounds of that uncertainty. But the presence of some uncertainty does not expand <em>Chevron </em>deference to cover virtually any interpretation of the National Bank Act. We can discern the outer limits of the term \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d even through the clouded lens of history. They do not include, as the Comptroller\u2019s expansive regulation would provide, ordinary enforcement of the law. Evidence from the time of the statute\u2019s enactment, a long line of our own cases, and application of normal principles of construction to the National Bank Act make that clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">Historically, the sovereign\u2019s right of visitation over corporations paralleled the right of the church to supervise its institutions and the right of the founder of a charitable institution \u201cto see that [his] property [was] rightly employed,\u201d 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 469 (1765). By extension of this principle, \u201c[t]he king [was] by law the visitor of all civil corporations,\u201d <em>ibid. </em>A visitor could inspect and control the visited institution at will.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>When the National Bank Act was enacted in 1864, \u201cvisitation\u201d was accordingly understood as \u201c[t]he act of examining into the affairs of a corporation\u201d by \u201cthe government itself.\u201d 2 J. Bouvier, A Law Dictionary 790 (15th ed. 1883). Lower courts understood \u201cvisitation\u201d to mean \u201cthe act of a superior or superintending officer, who visits a corporation to examine into its manner of conducting business, and enforce an observance of its laws and regulations.\u201d <em>First Nat. Bank of Youngstown </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>6 F. 737, 740 (CC ND Ohio 1881). A State was the \u201cvisitor\u201d of all companies incorporated in the State, simply by virtue of the State\u2019s role as sovereign: The \u201clegislature is the visitor of all corporations founded by it.\u201d <em>Guthrie </em>v. <em>Harkness, </em>199 U. S. 148, 157 (1905) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">This relationship between sovereign and corporation was understood to allow the States to use prerogative writs\u2014 such as mandamus and <em>quo warranto </em>\u2014 to exercise control \u201cwhenever a corporation [wa]s abusing the power given it ... or acting adversely to the public, or creating a nuisance.\u201d H. Wilgus, Private Corporations, in 8 American Law and Procedure \u00a7 157, pp. 224-225 (J. Hall ed. 1910). State visitorial commissions were authorized to \u201cexercise a general supervision\u201d over companies in the State. I. Wormser, Private Corporations \u00a7 80, pp. 100, 101, in 4 Modern American Law (1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Our cases have always understood \u201cvisitation\u201d as this right to oversee corporate affairs, quite separate from the power to enforce the law. In the famous <em>Dartmouth College </em>case, Justice Story, describing visitation of a charitable corporation, wrote that Dartmouth was \u201csubject to the controling authority of its legal visitor, who.. . . may amend and repeal its statutes, remove its officers, correct abuses, and generally superintend the management of [its] trusts,\u201d and who is \u201cliable to no supervision or control.\u201d <em>Trustees of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number><em>Dartmouth College </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>4 Wheat. 518, 676, 681 (1819) (concurring opinion). This power of \u201cgenera[l] superintend[ence]\u201d stood in contrast to action by the court of chancery, which acted \u201cnot as itself possessing a visitorial power . . . but as possessing a general jurisdiction ... to redress grievances, and frauds.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 676.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">In <em>Guthrie, supra, </em>we held that a shareholder acting in his role as a private individual was not exercising a \u201cvisitorial power\u201d under the National Bank Act when he petitioned a court to force the production of corporate records, <em>id., </em>at 159. \u201c[Cjontrol in the courts of justice,\u201d we said, is not visitorial, and we drew a contrast between the nonvisitorial act of \u201csu[ing] in the courts of the State\u201d and the visitorial \u201csupervision of the Comptroller of the Currency,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 159, 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">In <em>First Nat. Bank in St. Louis </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>263 U. S. 640 (1924), we upheld the right of the Attorney General of Missouri to bring suit to enforce a state anti-bank-branching law against a national bank. We said that only the United States may perform visitorial administrative oversight, such as \u201cinquiring] by <em>quo warranto </em>whether a national bank is acting in excess of its charter powers.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 660. But if a state statute of general applicability is not substantively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>pre-empted, then \u201cthe power of enforcement must rest with the [State] and not with\u201d the National Government, <em>ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Our most recent decision, <em>Watters </em>v. <em>Wachovia Bank, N. A., </em>550 U. S. 1 (2007), does not, as the dissent contends, <em>post, </em>at 552, \u201csuppor[t] OCC\u2019s construction of the statute.\u201d To the contrary, it is fully in accord with the well established distinction between supervision and law enforcement. <em>Watters </em>held that a State may not exercise \u201c \u2018general supervision and control\u2019 \u201d over a subsidiary of a national bank, 550 U. S., at 8, because \u201cmultiple audits and surveillance under rival oversight regimes\u201d would cause uncertainty, <em>id., </em>at 21. \u201c[G]eneral supervision and control\u201d and \u201coversight\u201d are worlds apart from law enforcement. All parties to the case agreed that Michigan\u2019s general oversight regime could not be imposed on national banks; the sole question was whether operating subsidiaries of national banks enjoyed the same immunity from state visitation. The opinion addresses and answers no other question.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The foregoing cases all involve enforcement of state law. But if the Comptroller\u2019s exclusive exercise of visitorial powers precluded law enforcement by the States, it would also preclude law enforcement by federal agencies. Of course it does not. See, <em>e. g., Bank of America Nat. Trust &amp; Sav. Assn. </em>v. <em>Douglas, </em>105 F. 2d 100, 105-106 (CADC 1939) (Secu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>rities Exchange Commission investigation of bank fraud is not an exercise of \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d); <em>Peoples Bank of Danville </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>449 F. Supp. 254, 260 (WD Va. 1978) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">In sum, the unmistakable and utterly consistent teaching of our jurisprudence, both before and after enactment of the National Bank Act, is that a sovereign\u2019s \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d and its power to enforce the law are two different things. There is not a credible argument to the contrary. And contrary to what the Comptroller\u2019s regulation says, the National Bank Act pre-empts only the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">The consequences of the regulation also cast doubt upon its validity. No one denies that the National Bank Act leaves in place some state substantive laws affecting banks. See Brief for Federal Respondent 20; Brief for Respondent Clearing House Association, L. L. C. 29; <em>post, </em>at 552. But the Comptroller\u2019s rule says that the State may not <em>enforce </em>its valid, non-pre-empted laws against national banks. <em>Post, </em>at 552-553. The bark remains, but the bite does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">The dissent admits, with considerable understatement, that such a result is \u201cunusual,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 556. \u201cBizarre\u201d would be more apt. As the Court said in <em>St. Louis:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-9\">\u201cTo demonstrate the binding quality of a statute but deny the power of enforcement involves a fallacy made apparent by the mere statement of the proposition, for such power is essentially inherent in the very conception of law.\u201d 263 U. S., at 660.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">In sharp contrast to the \u201cunusual\u201d reading propounded by the Comptroller\u2019s regulation, reading \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d as limiting only sovereign oversight and supervision would produce an entirely commonplace result \u2014 the precise result contemplated by our opinion in <em>St. Louis, </em>which said that if a state statute is valid as to national banks, \u201cthe corollary that it is obligatory <em>and enforceable </em>necessarily results.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number><em>Id., </em>at 659-660 (emphasis added). Channeling state attorneys general into judicial law-enforcement proceedings (rather than allowing them to exercise \u201cvisitorial\u201d oversight) would preserve a regime of exclusive administrative oversight by the Comptroller while honoring in fact rather than merely in theory Congress\u2019s decision not to pre-empt substantive state law. This system echoes many other mixed state/federal regimes in which the Federal Government exercises general oversight while leaving state substantive law in place. See, <em>e. g., Wyeth </em>v. <em>Levine, </em>555 U. S. 555 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">This reading is also suggested by \u00a7 484(a)\u2019s otherwise inexplicable reservation of state powers \u201cvested in the courts of justice.\u201d As described earlier, visitation was normally conducted through use of the prerogative writs of mandamus and <em>quo warranto. </em>The exception could not possibly exempt that manner of exercising visitation, or else the exception would swallow the rule. Its only conceivable purpose is to preserve normal civil and criminal lawsuits. To be sure, the reservation of powers \u201cvested in the courts of justice\u201d is phrased as an exception from the prohibition of visitorial powers. But as we have just discussed, it cannot possibly be that, and it is explicable only as an attempt to make clear that the courts\u2019 ordinary powers of enforcing the law are not affected.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>On a pragmatic level, the difference between visitation and law enforcement is clear. If a State chooses to pursue enforcement of 'its laws in court, then it is not exercising its power of visitation and will be treated like a litigant. An attorney general acting as a civil litigant must file a lawsuit, survive a motion to dismiss, endure the rules of procedure and discovery, and risk sanctions if his claim is frivolous or his discovery tactics abusive. Judges are trusted to prevent \u201cfishing expeditions\u201d or an undirected rummaging through bank books and records for evidence of some unknown wrongdoing. In New York, civil discovery is far more limited than the full range of \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d that may be exercised by a sovereign. Courts may enter protective orders to prevent \u201cunreasonable annoyance, expense, embarrassment, disadvantage, or other prejudice,\u201d N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. \u00a7 3103(a) (West 2005), and may supervise discovery <em>sua sponte, </em>\u00a7 3104(a). A visitor, by contrast, may inspect books and records at any time for any or no reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The Comptroller\u2019s regulation, therefore, does not comport with the statute. Neither does the Comptroller\u2019s <em>interpretation </em>of its regulation, which differs from the text and must be discussed separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Evidently realizing that exclusion of state enforcement of <em>all </em>state laws against national banks is too extreme to be contemplated, the Comptroller sought to limit the sweep of its regulation by the following passage set forth in the agency\u2019s statement of basis and purpose in the Federal Register:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-8\">\u2018What the case law <em>does </em>recognize is that \u2018states retain some power to regulate national banks in areas such as contracts, debt collection, acquisition and transfer of property, and taxation, zoning, criminal, and tort law.\u2019 [citing a Ninth Circuit case.] Application of these laws to national banks and their implementation by state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>authorities typically does not affect the content or extent of the Federally-authorized business of banking ... but rather establishes the legal infrastructure that surrounds and supports the ability of national banks . . . to do business.\u201d 69 Fed. Reg. 1896 (2004) (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">This cannot be reconciled with the regulation\u2019s almost categorical prohibition in 12 CFR \u00a7 7.4000(a)(1) of \u201cprosecuting enforcement actions.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nor can it be justified by the provision in subsection (a)(2)(iv) which defines visitorial powers to include \u201c[e]nforcing compliance with any applicable . . . state laws concerning\u201d \u201cactivities authorized or permitted pursuant to federal banking law,\u201d \u00a7 7.4000(a)(2)(iii). The latter phrase cannot be interpreted to include only distinctively banking activities (leaving the States free to enforce non-banking state laws), because if it were so interpreted subsection (a)(2)(iii), which uses the same terminology, would limit the Comptroller\u2019s exclusive visitorial power of \u201c[rjegulation and supervision\u201d to distinctively banking activities \u2014 which no one thinks is the case. Anyway, the National Bank Act <em>does </em>specifically authorize and permit activities that fall within what the statement of basis and purpose calls \u201cthe legal infrastructure that surrounds and supports the ability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>of national banks ... to do business.\u201d See, <em>e. g., </em>12 U. S. C. \u00a7 24 Third (power to make contracts); \u00a7 24 Seventh (\u201call such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking\u201d). And of course a distinction between \u201cimplementation\u201d of \u201cinfrastructure\u201d and judicial enforcement of other laws can be found nowhere within the text of the statute. This passage in the statement of basis and purpose, resting upon neither the text of the regulation nor the text of the statute, attempts to do what Congress declined to do: exempt national banks from all state banking laws, or at least state enforcement of those laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The dissent fails to persuade us. Its fundamental contention \u2014 that the exclusive grant of visitorial powers can be interpreted to preclude state enforcement of state laws \u2014 rests upon a logical fallacy. The dissent establishes, <em>post, </em>at 541-543 (and we do not at all contest), that in the course of exercising visitation powers the sovereign can compel compliance with the law. But it concludes from that, <em>post, </em>at 545, that <em>any </em>sovereign attempt to compel compliance with the law can be deemed an exercise of the visitation power. That conclusion obviously does not follow. For example, in the course of exercising its visitation powers, the sovereign can assuredly compel a bank to honor obligations that are in default. Does that mean that the sovereign\u2019s taking the same action in executing a civil judgment for payment of those obligations can be considered an exercise of the visitation power? Of course not. Many things can be compelled through the visitation power that can be compelled through, the exercise of other sovereign power as well. The critical question is not what is being compelled, but what sovereign power has been invoked to compel it. And the power to enforce the law exists separate and apart from the power of visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The dissent argues that the Comptroller\u2019s expansive reading of \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d does not intrude upon \u201c \u2018the his<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>toric police powers of the States/ \u201d <em>post, </em>at 554 (quoting <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Santa Fe Elevator Corp., </em>331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947)), because, like federal maritime law, federal involvement in this field dates to \u201c \u2018the earliest days of the Republic/ \u201d <em>post, </em>at 555 (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Locke, </em>529 U. S. 89,108 (2000)). For that reason, the dissent concludes, this case does not raise the sort of federalism concerns that prompt a presumption against pre-emption. We have not invoked the presumption against pre-emption, and think it unnecessary to do so in giving force to the plain terms of the National Bank Act. Neither, however, should the incursion that the Comptroller\u2019s regulation makes upon traditional state powers be minimized. Although the sovereign visitorial power of assuring national-bank compliance with <em>all </em>laws inhered in the Federal Government from the time of its creation of national banks, the Comptroller was not given authority to enforce non-pre-empted state laws until 1966. See Financial Institutions Supervisory Act of 1966, Tit. III, 80 Stat. 1046-1055. A power first exercised during the lifetime of every current Justice is hardly involvement \u201cfrom the earliest days of the Republic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">States, on the other hand, have always enforced their general laws against national banks \u2014 and have enforced their banking-related laws against national banks for at least 85 years, as evidenced by <em>St. Louis, </em>in which we upheld enforcement of a state anti-bank-branching law, 263 U. S., at 656. See also <em>Anderson Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Luckett, </em>321 U. S. 233, 237, 248-249 (1944) (state commissioner of revenue may enforce abandoned-bank-deposit law against national bank through \u201cjudicial proceedings\u201d); <em>State ex rel.

That is much too kind. It is not without reason that the regulation is contained within a subpart of the Comptroller\u2019s regulations on \u201cBank Activities and Operations\u201d that is entitled \u201cPreemption.\u201d The purpose and function of the statutory term \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d is to define and thereby limit, the category of action reserved to the Federal Government and forbidden to the States. Any interpretation of \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d necessarily \u201cdeclares the preemptive scope of the NBA,\u201d <em>ibid. </em>What is clear from logic is also clear in application: The regulation declares that \u201c[s]tate officials may not . . . proseeut[e] enforcement actions.\u201d 12 CFR \u00a7 7.4000(a). If that is not pre-emption, nothing is.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Applying the foregoing principles to this case is not difficult. \u201cVisitorial powers\u201d in the National Bank Act refers to a sovereign\u2019s supervisory powers over corporations. They include any form of administrative oversight that allows a sovereign to inspect books and records on demand, even if the process is mediated by a court through prerogative writs or similar means. The Comptroller reasonably interpreted this statutory term to include \u201cconducting examinations [and] inspecting or requiring the production of books or rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>ords of national banks,\u201d \u00a77.4000, when the State conducts those activities in its capacity as supervisor of corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">When, however, a state attorney general brings suit to enforce state law against a national bank, he is not acting in the role of sovereign-as-supervisor, but rather in the role of sovereign-as-law-enforcer. Such a lawsuit is not an exercise of \u201cvisitorial powers,\u201d and thus the Comptroller erred by extending the definition of \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d to include \u201cprosecuting enforcement actions\u201d in state courts, \u00a77.4000.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The request for information in the present case was stated to be \u201cin lieu of\u201d other action; implicit was the threat that if the request was not voluntarily honored, that other action would be taken. All parties have assumed, and we agree, that if the threatened action would have been unlawful the request-cum-threat could be enjoined. Here the threatened action was not the bringing of a civil suit, or the obtaining of a judicial search warrant based on probable cause, but rather the Attorney General\u2019s issuance of subpoena on his own authority under New York Executive Law, which permits such subpoenas in connection with his investigation of \u201crepeated fraudulent or illegal acts ... in the carrying on, conducting or transaction of business.\u201d See N. Y. Exec. Law Ann. \u00a763(12) (West 2002). That is not the exercise of the power of law enforcement \u201cvested in the courts of justice\u201d which 12 U. S. C. \u00a7 484(a) exempts from the ban on exercise of supervisory power.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Accordingly, the injunction below is affirmed as applied to the threatened issuance of executive subpoenas by the Attorney General for the State of New York, but vacated insofar as it prohibits the Attorney General from bringing judicial enforcement actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b575-7\"> Justice Thomas\u2019s opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part (hereinafter the dissent) attempts to distinguish <em>Dartmouth College </em>on the ground that the college was a charitable corporation, whose visitors (unlike the State as visitor of for-profit corporations) had no law-enforcement power.

Respondents contend that <em>St. Louis </em>holds only that States can enforce their law when federal law grants the national bank no authority to engage in the activity at issue. Even if that were true it would make no difference.

S. C. \u00a7 36(f)(1)(B), establishes that the Comptroller\u2019s visitorial power pre-empts state law enforcement. That provision states that some state laws respecting bank branching \u201cshall be enforced\u201d by the Comptroller. We need not decide here whether converting the Comptroller's visitorial <em>power </em>to assure compliance with all applicable laws, see <em>infra, </em>at 534, into an <em>obligation </em>to assure compliance with certain state laws preempts state enforcement of those particular laws. Even if it had that effect it would shed no light on the meaning of \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d in the National Bank Act, a statute that it does not refer to and that was enacted more than a century earlier.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b580-6\"> The prohibition is not entirely categorical only because it is subject to the phrase at the end of the sentence (applicable to all of the regulation\u2019s enumerated \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d forbidden to the States): \u201cexcept in limited circumstances authorized by federal law.\u201d This replicates a similar exception contained in 12 U.

The statutory term \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d is susceptible to more than one meaning, and the agency\u2019s construction is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Because the NBA does not define \u201cvisitorial powers,\u201d the ordinary meaning of the words chosen by Congress provides the starting point for interpreting the statute. See <em>Dean </em>v. <em>United States, </em>556 U. S. 568, 572 (2009) (\u201cWe start, as always, with the language of the statute\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Asgrow Seed Co. </em>v. <em>Winterboer, </em>513 U.

In 1864, when the NBA was enacted, \u201cvisitation\u201d was generally defined as \u201c[ijnspection; superintendence; direction; [and] regulation.\u201d 2 A. Burrill, A Law Dictionary and Glossary 598 (2d ed. 1860); see also 2 J. Bouvier, A Law Dictionary 633 (rev. 4th ed. 1852) (defining \u201cvisitation\u201d as \u201c[t]he act of examining into the affairs of a corporation\u201d). With respect to civil corporations, \u201cvisitation\u201d was conducted \u201cby the government itself, through the medium of the courts of justice.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 634. The Court has previously looked to these definitions in examining the meaning of \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d for purposes of the NBA. See <em>Guthrie </em>v. <em>Harkness, </em>199 U.

To support this argument, the majority briefly alludes to the common-law history of visitation. See <em>ante, </em>at 525-526; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Shabani, </em>513 U. S. 10, 13 (1994) (\u201c[A]bsent contrary indications, Congress intends to adopt the common law definition of statutory terms\u201d). In so doing, the majority fully accepts petitioner\u2019s argument that \u201cCongress invoked a then-familiar common law term of corporate governance \u2014 visitation\u2014to clarify that the States, traditionally the supervisors of private corporations doing business within their jurisdictions, had no authority to examine the condition of a national bank, respond to any perceived financial risk, or hold the bank to its charter or the laws of its creation.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 21-22. Under the majority\u2019s view, any construction of \u00a7 484(a) that fails to preserve the right of the States to enforce through judicial action their generally applicable laws against national banks is unreasonable and, therefore, not entitled to deference. See <em>ante, </em>at 528-529.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">But contrary to the majority\u2019s determination, the common-law tradition does not compel the conclusion that petitioner\u2019s definition of visitation is the only permissible in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>terpretation of the term. Indeed, a more thorough examination of \u00a7484(a)\u2019s common-law ancestry suggests the opposite. As the majority notes, see <em>ante, </em>at 525-526, the concept of visitation originated in Roman and canon law in which the term was used to describe the church hierarchy\u2019s authority over its own institutions, see Pound, Visitatorial Jurisdiction Over Corporations in Equity, 49 Harv. L. Rev. 369, 369-370 (1936). The practice of visitation later expanded to include the supervision of charities, universities, and civil corporations. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">With respect to churches, charities, and universities, a visitor\u2019s duties were narrow. In the university setting, for example, the \u201cpower of the visitor [was] confined to offences against the <em>private </em>laws of the college; he ha[d] no cognizance of acts of disobedience to the general laws of the land.\u201d 2 S. Kyd, Law of Corporations 276 (1794) (emphasis in original). The visitor\u2019s duties were equally narrow in the governance of ecclesiastical and charitable institutions. See 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 467-472 (1765); <em>Trustees of Dartmouth College </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>4 Wheat. 518, 673-677 (1819) (Story, J., concurring). If the sweep of a visitor\u2019s authority with respect to civil corporations was the same, the majority would have a stronger argument that the \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d prohibition was similarly limited. See <em>ante, </em>at 525-526. However, the common-law tradition instead suggests that visitorial powers were broader with respect to civil corporations, including banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Historically, visitorial authority over civil corporations was exercised only by the sovereign who had broad authority to assure compliance with generally applicable laws. See Blackstone, <em>supra, </em>at 469 (\u201cThe king being thus constituted by law the visitor of all civil corporations, the law has also appointed the place, wherein he shall exercise this jurisdiction: which is the court of king\u2019s bench; where, and where only, all misbehaviors of this kind of corporations are enquired into and redressed, and all their controversies de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>cided\u201d); 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law 241 (1827) (explaining that \u201cvisitation of civil corporations is by the government itself, through the medium of the courts of justice\u201d). \u201cCivil corporations, whether public, as the corporations of towns and cities; or private, as bank, insurance, manufacturing, and other companies of the like nature, are not subject to [private] visitation.

Acts p. 303 (authorizing banking commissioners to \u201cvisit\u201d a bank and \u201cexamine all [its] affairs\u201d to determine whether it had \u201ccomplied with the provisions of law applicable to [its] transactions\u201d); Act of May 14, eh. 363, \u00a712, 1840 N. Y. Laws pp. 307-308 (authorizing banking commissioners to bring judicial actions against banks \u201cfound to have violated any law of this state ... in the same manner and with the like effect as any incorporated bank may be proceeded against for a violation of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>charter\u201d). Indeed, Congress modeled the NBA after New York\u2019s supervisory regime. See J. Knox, A History of Banking in the United States 422 (1903) (reprint 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Petitioner contends, and the majority agrees, that this understanding of the common law confuses the sovereign\u2019s \u201cenforcement of general laws that apply equally to all actors within a State, like the ban on discrimination found in New York Executive Law \u00a7 296-a\u201d with \u201can exercise of visitorial powers.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 24; see also <em>ante, </em>at 529 (concluding that \u201ca sovereign\u2019s Visitorial powers\u2019 and its power to enforce the law are two different things\u201d). But this narrow conception of visitorial powers does not fully capture the common law. In a section entitled \u201cVisitorial power,\u201d one treatise explained that \u201c[a]s a general rule the state has the same control, in this respect, over corporations that it has over individuals.\u201d C. Elliott, Law of Private Corporations \u00a790, p. 80 (rev. 3d ed. 1900); see also 1 S. Thompson, Commentaries on the Law of Private Corporations \u00a7 475, p. 580 (J. Thompson rev. 2d ed. 1908) (\u201cIn its visitorial capacity the state checks and controls corporate affairs, even for the protection of those who deal with them\u201d). If the sovereign\u2019s power of visitation was limited to oversight of \u201ccorporate affairs,\u201d visitation would not parallel the sovereign\u2019s control over individuals or allow the sovereign to protect through judicial action the rights of individuals who \u201cdeal with\u201d the corporation. See <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Chicago &amp; Northwestern R. Co., </em>35 Wis. 425 (1874)\u2014 which has been referred to as \u201cthe leading American case for the visitorial jurisdiction of equity,\u201d Pound, 49 Harv. L. Rev., at 380 \u2014 illustrates the point. In that case, the state attorney general sought a writ of injunction to \u201crestrain the two defendant companies from exacting tolls for the carriage of passengers or freight in excess of the maximum rates established by\u201d Wisconsin law, 35 Wis., at 432. The attorney general \u201capplied] for the writ on behalf of the public,\u201d <em>id., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>at 531, in order \u201c\u2018to correct abuses and save the rights of the people,\u2019 \u201d <em>id., </em>at 572. The court found that the attorney general\u2019s visitorial power included enforcement of generally applicable law against civil corporations through courts of equity. See <em>id,., </em>at 529-530. As the court explained, the common-law understanding of visitorial powers had expanded beyond its ecclesiastical roots to include such authority. See <em>id., </em>at 530 (\u201cThe grounds on which this jurisdiction rests are ancient; but the extent of its application has grown rapidly of late years, until a comparatively obscure and insignificant jurisdiction has become one of great magnitude and public import\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">As a result, the majority\u2019s conclusion that when \u201ca state attorney general brings suit to enforce state law against a national bank, he is not acting in the role of sovereign-as-supervisor, but rather in the role of sovereign-as-law-enforcer,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 536, cannot be reconciled with this leading case or the general common-law understanding on which the decision rests. At common law, all attempts by the sovereign to compel civil corporations to comply with state law \u2014 whether through administrative subpoenas or judicial actions \u2014 were visitorial in nature. Thus, even if the sovereign\u2019s law enforcement and visitorial powers were at one time distinct, by common law, they had merged at least with respect to the enforcement of generally applicable public laws against civil corporations. See Thompson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 460, at 556 (\u201cThe police power, <em>in its visitorial aspect, </em>as exercised by congress and the several states, extends to the minutest details of the banking business\u201d (emphasis added)). By construing visitation so narrowly, the majority implicitly rejects the efforts of William Blackstone, James Kent, and Roscoe Pound, see <em>supra, </em>at 541-542, in elucidating the historical meaning of this concept. Like OCC, each of these venerable legal scholars understood visitation of civil corporations to include the power to enforce generally applicable laws through judicial actions. See <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>In the end, OCC was presented with a broad dictionary definition of \u201cvisitation\u201d and a common-law history suggesting that the scope of the visitor\u2019s authority varied in accordance with the nature of the organization under supervision. It is possible that the \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d are narrower than OCC concluded. But a visitor\u2019s powers could also be broader. There is support for the proposition that visitation includes enforcement of all generally applicable laws. See <em>supra, </em>at 540-545 and this page. OCC instead interpreted \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d to prohibit only enforcement of laws concerning \u201cactivities authorized or permitted pursuant to federal banking law.\u201d 12 CFR \u00a7\u00a77.4000(a)(2)(iii) and (iv). States are thus free to enforce applicable laws that do not regulate federally authorized banking activities, see \u00a7 7.4000(a)(3), \u201cincluding, for example, criminal, tax, zoning, and labor and employment laws,\u201d Brief for Federal Respondent 15 (citing 69 Fed. Reg. 1896).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Thus, although the text and history of visitation do not authoritatively support either party\u2019s construction of the statute, OCC\u2019s decision to adopt a more modest construction than could have been supported by the common-law and dictionary definition reinforces the reasonableness of its regulation. Put simply, OCC selected a permissible construction of a statutory term that was susceptible to multiple interpretations.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Petitioner nonetheless argues that the original structure of the NBA compels us to adopt his reading of \u201cvisitorial powers.\u201d When enacted in 1864, the \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d clause was preceded by a statutory provision directing the Comptroller of the Currency to appoint persons \u201cto make a thorough examination into all the affairs of [every banking] association\u201d and to \u201cmake a full and detailed report of the condition of the association to the comptroller.\u201d Act of June 3,1864, ch. 106, \u00a7 54,13 Stat. 116. In addition, the \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d clause was succeeded by a sentence concerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>compensation due to the examiners. See <em>ibid. </em>Petitioner contends that the placement of the \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d clause between these two provisions indicates that it originally meant to ban States only from conducting the particular type of \u201cthorough examination\u201d of banking affairs described in the neighboring provisions. And, petitioner adds, \u00a7484 currently resides in the subchapter of the statute entitled \u201cBank Examinations,\u201d which still includes a provision directing the Comptroller to appoint examiners \u201cto make a thorough examination of all the affairs of the bank and . . . make a full and detailed report of the condition of said bank to the Comptroller of the Currency.\u201d 12 U. S. C. \u00a7481.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Petitioner\u2019s argument is undermined, however, by other structural attributes of this subchapter. In \u00a7 484(b), for example, Congress provided that \u201c[notwithstanding\u201d the statute\u2019s visitorial-powers prohibition, \u201cState auditors and examiners may . . . review [a national bank\u2019s] records solely to ensure compliance with applicable State unclaimed property or escheat laws.\u201d Such review does not fall within petitioner\u2019s definition of \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d because the enforcement of state property laws is in no way associated with national bank examinations or internal operations. Thus, were \u00a7 484(a) to have the meaning petitioner assigns, there would have been no reason for Congress to identify the \u00a7 484(b) authority as an exception to \u00a7484(a)\u2019s \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d prohibition, as the authority granted in \u00a7 484(b) would never have been eliminated by \u00a7 484(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Other exceptions in \u00a7 484 also support OCC\u2019s construction of the statute. For example, \u00a7 484(a) includes an exception for visitations \u201cauthorized by Federal law.\u201d One type of visitation authorized by law is described in 26 U. S. C. \u00a7 3305(c), which provides that \u201c[n]othing contained in [\u00a7 484] shall prevent any State from requiring any national\u201d bank to provide payroll records and reports for unemployment tax purposes. Similarly, 12 U. S. C. \u00a7 62 permits state tax officials to inspect national bank shareholder lists. Both provisions would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>unnecessary if \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d were limited to bank examinations and internal operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">In sum, the NBA\u2019s structure does not compel the construction of \u00a7 484(a)\u2019s text that petitioner advocates. If anything, given the manner in which Congress crafted exceptions to the \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d ban in the statute, the opposite is true.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">The majority also accepts petitioner\u2019s contention that OCC\u2019s construction of \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d is unreasonable because it conflicts with several of this Court\u2019s decisions. See <em>ante, </em>at 526-529. But petitioner cannot prevail by simply showing that this Court previously adopted a construction of \u00a7 484 that differs from the interpretation later chosen by the agency. \u201cA court\u2019s prior judicial construction of a statute trumps an agency construction otherwise entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number><em>Chevron </em>deference only if the prior court decision holds that its construction follows from the unambiguous terms of the statute and thus leaves no room for agency discretion.\u201d <em>Brand X, </em>545 U. S., at 982. These decisions do not construe \u00a7 484 in a manner that trumps OCC\u2019s regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">This Court\u2019s <em>only </em>decision directly addressing the meaning of \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d is <em>Guthrie, </em>which held that the NBA did not prohibit a suit brought by a private shareholder seeking to inspect the books of a national bank, 199 U. S., at 157. In so holding, the Court contrasted \u201cthe private right of the shareholder to have an examination of the business in which he is interested\u201d with a visitor\u2019s \u201cpublic right\u201d to examine \u201cthe conduct of the corporation with a view to keeping it within its legal powers.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 158-159. <em>Guthrie </em>thus draws a line between enforcement of private rights and the public act of visitation that is consistent with the definition of visitation embraced by OCC. See <em>id., </em>at 158 (\u201cIn no ease or authority that we have been able to find has there been a definition of this right, which would include the private right of the shareholder to have an examination of the business in which he is interested . . . \u201d). The agency has never taken the position that the \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d prohibition extends to private action.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Nor does this Court\u2019s decision in <em>First Nat. Bank in St. Louis </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>263 U. S. 640 (1924) <em>(St. Louis), </em>foreclose OCC\u2019s construction of the statute. In that case, the State of Missouri brought a <em>quo warranto </em>proceeding in state court \u201cto determine [the national bank\u2019s] authority to establish and conduct a branch bank in the City of St. Louis.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 655. The Court first held that federal law did not authorize national banks to engage in branch banking. See <em>id., </em>at 656-659. \u201cHaving determined that the power sought to be exercised by the bank finds no justification in any law or authority of the United States,\u201d the Court then concluded that \u201cthe way is open for the enforcement of the state statute.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Petitioner contends, and the majority agrees, see <em>ante, </em>at 527-528, and n. 2, that <em>St. Louis </em>stands for the proposition that a State retains the right to enforce any state law that is not substantively pre-empted with respect to national banks, see 263 U. S., at 660 (\u201cTo demonstrate the binding quality of a statute but deny the power of enforcement involves a fallacy made apparent by the mere statement of the proposition, for such power is essentially inherent in the very conception of law. . . . What the State is seeking to do is to vindicate and enforce its own law . . . \u201d). Under this view, then, because the New York fair lending laws are not substantively pre-empted, he is not exercising \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d by enforcing them.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Respondents counter that the holding of <em>St. Louis </em>is not so broad. In their view, the Court held only that a State may enforce its laws against a national bank when federal law grants the bank no authority to engage in the underlying activity at issue. See Brief for Respondent Clearing House Association 33-34. Here, federal law expressly authorizes national banks to make mortgage loans. See 12 U. S. C. \u00a7 371(a). Thus, unlike in <em>St. Louis </em>\u2014 in which the relevant state-law-proscribed conduct in a category that was wholly beyond the powers granted to national banks \u2014 petitioner seeks to superintend the manner in which the national banks engage in activity expressly authorized by federal law. According to respondents, then, \u00a7 484(a)\u2019s ban on unauthorized visitation provides the \u201ccontrolling reason\u201d forbidding state enforcement that was absent from <em>St. Louis, </em>see 263 U. S., at 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">. There is no need to decide which party has the better argument. The <em>St. Louis </em>decision nowhere references \u00a7 484(a) or addresses \u201cvisitorial powers.\u201d Thus, as noted above, even if the decision is best read to support petitioner\u2019s view of the statute, that conclusion is insufficient to deny <em>Chevron </em>deference to OCC\u2019s construction of \u00a7 484(a). \u201cSince <em>Chevron </em>teaches that a court\u2019s opinion as to the best reading of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>ambiguous statute an agency is charged with administering is not authoritative, the agency\u2019s decision to construe that statute differently from a court does not say that the court\u2019s holding was legally wrong. Instead, the agency may, consistent with the court\u2019s holding, choose a different construction, since the agency remains the authoritative interpreter (within the limits of reason) of such statutes.\u201d <em>Brand X, supra, </em>at 983. A judicial decision that fails to directly confront the provision at issue cannot be deemed to have adopted the \u201cauthoritative\u201d construction of the statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Petitioner\u2019s reliance on other decisions of this Court is misplaced for this very same reason. See <em>First Nat. Bank in Plant City </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>396 U. S. 122 (1969); <em>Anderson Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Luckett, </em>321 U. S. 233 (1944); <em>First Nat. Bank of Bay City </em>v. <em>Fellows, </em>244 U. S. 416 (1917); <em>Easton </em>v. <em>Iowa, </em>188 U. S. 220 (1903); <em>Waite </em>v. <em>Dowley, </em>94 U. S. 527 (1877); <em>National Bank </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>9 Wall. 353 (1870). None of these decisions addressed the meaning of \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 484(a), let alone provided a definitive construction of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Finally, this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Watters </em>v. <em>Wachovia Bank, N. A., </em>550 U. S. 1 (2007), supports OCC\u2019s construction of the statute. <em>Watters </em>addressed whether the NBA pre-empted the application of certain Michigan laws to the mortgage-lending activities of an operating subsidiary of a national bank. See <em>id., </em>at 7-8. In deciding that issue, the Court did not reach the question presented here. But the Court was fully aware that the Michigan statutes granted state banking commissioners the very enforcement authority that petitioner seeks to exert over the national banks in this case. See <em>id., </em>at 9-10 (citing Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7\u00a7445.1661 (West 2002), 493.56b (West Supp. 2005)); see also 550 U. S., at 34 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (describing \u00a7\u00a7445.1661 and 493.56b as \u201cstate visitorial oversight\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">As the Court explained, although \u201cthe Michigan provisions at issue exempted] national banks from coverage . . . [t]his [was] not simply a matter of the Michigan Legislature\u2019s grace. For, as the parties recognize, the NBA would have preemptive force, <em>i. e., </em>it would spare a national bank from state controls of the kind here involved.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 13 (citations omitted); see <em>ibid, </em>(explaining that \u201creal estate lending, when conducted by a national bank, is immune from state visitorial control\u201d). The Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Watters </em>that \u00a7 484(a) deprives the States of inspection and enforcement authority over the mortgage-lending practices of national <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>banks lends weight to the agency\u2019s construction of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Petitioner also argues that three different background principles trigger a clear-statement rule that overcomes any <em>Chevron </em>deference to which OCC\u2019s construction of \u00a7 484 otherwise might be entitled. I disagree. None of petitioner\u2019s arguments provide a doctrinal basis for refusing to defer to the agency\u2019s reasonable construction of this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">First, petitioner contends that OCC\u2019s regulation, which interprets \u00a7 484(a) to pre-empt state enforcement of state law but not the substantive state law itself, undermines important federalism principles and therefore triggers a requirement th\u00e1t Congress clearly state its pre-emptive intentions, see <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>501 U. S. 452, 460 (1991) (\u201c[I]f Congress intends to alter the usual constitutional balance between the States and the Federal Government, it must make its intention to do so unmistakably clear in the language of the statute\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original)). Petitioner is incorrect because OCC\u2019s construction of the statute does not alter the balance of power established by the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">National banks are created by federal statute and therefore are subject to full congressional control. The States \u201ccan exercise no control over them, nor in any wise affect their operation, except in so far as Congress may see proper to permit.\u201d <em>Farmers\u2019 and Mechanics\u2019 Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Dearing, </em>91 U. S. 29, 34 (1875); see also <em>Watters, </em>550 U. S., at 10 (\u201cNearly 200 years ago, in <em>McCulloch </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>4 Wheat. 316 (1819), this Court held federal law supreme over state law with respect to national banking\u201d). As a result, the only question presented by this case is whether Congress has seen it \u201cproper to permit\u201d the States to enforce state fair lending laws against national banks. OCC\u2019s reasonable conclusion that \u00a7 484(a) answers that question in the negative does not alter the federal-state balance; it simply pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>serves for OCC the oversight responsibilities assigned to it by Congress. See <em>id., </em>at 22 (\u201cRegulation of national bank operations is a prerogative of Congress under the Commerce and Necessary and Proper Clauses. The Tenth Amendment, therefore, is not implicated here\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Second, petitioner argues that a clear statement is required because \u201cthe historic police powers of the States [are] not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress,\u201d <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Santa Fe Elevator Corp., </em>331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947). There should be no presumption against pre-emption because Congress has expressly pre-empted state law in this case. See <em>Altria Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Good, </em>555 U. S. 70, 98 (2008) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (\u201c[T]he presumption against pre-emption \u2018dissolves once there is conclusive evidence of intent to pre-empt in the express words of the statute itself\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Cipollone </em>v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc., </em>505 U. S. 504, 545 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part))); \u25a0 see, <em>e. g., Riegel </em>v. <em>Medtronic, Inc., </em>552 U. S. 312, 315-316 (2008) (construing the express pre-emption provision of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 360c <em>et seq., </em>without any reliance on the presumption against pre-emption).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">In any event, this presumption is \u201cnot triggered when the State regulates in an area where there has been a history of significant federal presence.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Locke, </em>529 U. S. 89, 108 (2000). National banking is the paradigmatic example. \u201cIn defining the pre-emptive scope of statutes and regulations granting a power to national banks,\u201d this Court has taken the firm view that \u201cnormally Congress would not want States to forbid, or to impair significantly, the exercise of a power that Congress explicitly granted.\u201d <em>Barnett Bank of Marion Cty., N. A. </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>517 U. S. 25, 33 (1996). As a result, federal legislation concerning national banks is \u201cnot normally limited by, but rather ordinarily pre-empt[s], contrary state law.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 32. As with general maritime law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Congress\u2019 \u201clegislation] in th[is] field from the earliest days of the Republic\u201d and its creation of an \u201cextensive federal statutory.and regulatory scheme\u201d mean that an \u201c\u2018assumption\u2019 of nonpre-emption is not triggered.\u201d <em>Locke, supra, </em>at 108. That the States may also have legislated alongside Congress in this area, see <em>ante, </em>at 534-535, does not alter this conclusion, see, <em>e. g., Franklin Nat. Bank of Franklin Square </em>v. <em>New York, </em>347 U. S. 373 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Last, petitioner argues that <em>Chevron </em>deference is inapplicable because OCC\u2019s regulation declares the pre-emptive scope of the NBA. And, the majority flatly asserts that \u201c[i]f that is not pre-emption, nothing is.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 535. But OCC did not declare the pre-emptive scope of the statute; rather, it interpreted the term \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d to encompass state enforcement of state fair lending laws. The preemption of state enforcement authority to which petitioner objects thus follows from the statute itself \u2014 not agency action. See <em>Smiley, </em>517 U. S., at 744 (\u201cThis argument confuses the question of the substantive (as opposed to pre-emptive) <em>meaning </em>of a statute with the question of <em>whether </em>a statute is pre-emptive. We may assume (without deciding) that the latter question must always be decided <em>de novo </em>by the courts. That is <em>not </em>the question at issue here; there is no doubt that \u00a7 85 pre-empts state law\u201d (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Here, Congress \u2014 not the agency \u2014 has decided that \u201c[n]o national bank shall be subject to any visitorial powers except as authorized by Federal law.\u201d 12 U. S. C. \u00a7 484(a). Indeed, the majority agrees that it is the \u201cstatutory term\u201d \u2014 and not OCC\u2019s regulation \u2014 that \u201cdefine[s] and thereby limit[s] the category of action reserved to the Federal Government and forbidden to the States.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 535. As a result, OCC has simply interpreted that term to encompass petitioner\u2019s decision to demand national bank records and threaten judicial enforcement of New York fair lending laws as a means of obtaining them. As <em>Smiley </em>showed, a federal agency\u2019s construction of an ambiguous statutory term may clarify the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>pre-emptive scope of enacted federal law, but that fact alone does not mean that it is the agency, rather than Congress, that has effected the pre-emption.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Petitioner\u2019s federalism-based objections to <em>Chevron </em>deference ultimately turn on a single proposition: It is doubtful that Congress pre-empted state enforcement of state laws but not the underlying state laws themselves. But it is not this Court\u2019s task to decide whether the statutory scheme established by Congress is unusual or even \u201c'[b]izarre.\u2019\u201d See <em>ante, </em>at 529. The Court must <em>decide </em>only whether the construction adopted by the agency is unambiguously foreclosed by the statute\u2019s text. Here, the text, structure, and history of \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d support the agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of \u00a7484. Petitioner has not identified any constitutional principle that would require Congress to take the greater step of pre-empting all enforcement of state lending laws (including private enforcement) even though its central concern was the allocation of the right to exercise public visitation over national bank activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">For all these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b591-6\"> By looking to Justice Story\u2019s concurrence in <em>Trustees of Dartmouth College </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>4 Wheat. 518 (1819), for authoritative guidance, see <em>ante, </em>at 526-527, the majority seemingly rejects the distinction between the visitor\u2019s role in supervising civil corporations and the visitor\u2019s far more limited role in supervising private institutions such as churches, universities, and charitable organizations. See <em>ante, </em>at 527, n. 1. In <em>Woodward, </em>the Court addressed the scope of the visitor\u2019s authority over a private college \u2014 not a civil corporation. See 4 Wheat., at 562-563 (\u201cThe corporation in question is not a <em>civil, </em>although it is a <em>lay </em>corporation. It is an <em>eleemosynary </em>corporation. . . . Eleemosynary corporations are for the management of private property, according to the will of the donors. They are private corporations\u201d (emphasis in original)). Visitors historically did not have \u201claw enforcement power\u201d over churches, universities, and charitable organizations. See <em>supra, </em>at 540-541. But there is strong evidence that visitors of civil <em>corporations </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>sovereigns \u2014 were so empowered. See <em>supra, </em>at 541-542 and this page. The distinction between these species of visitation is crucial because it yields divergent understandings as to the scope of the visitor\u2019s power to enforce generally applicable laws in court. Moreover, the majority\u2019s failure to confront this important difference leaves a gap in its historical analysis that, in turn, undermines its conclusion that OCC\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 484(a) was unreasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b596-8\"> Contrary to the majority\u2019s conclusion, see <em>ante, </em>at 530, n. 3, petitioner\u2019s structural argument is also undermined by the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (Riegle-Neal), 108 Stat. 2338, which authorized national banks to operate interstate branches. The statute provides that \u201c[t]he laws of the host State regarding community reinvestment, consumer protection, fair lending, and establishment of intrastate branches shall apply to any branch in the host State of an out-of-State national bank to the same extent as such State laws apply to a branch of a bank chartered by that State\u201d unless federal law separately pre-empts their application or the Comptroller determines that application of the state law would have a \u201cdiscriminatory effect\u201d on the national bank branch. See <em>id., </em>at 2349-2350, 12 U. S. C. \u00a7 36(f)(1)(A). Riegle-Neal further provides that \u201c[t]he provisions of any State law to which a branch of a national bank is subject under this paragraph shall be enforced, with respect to such branch, by the Comptroller of the Currency.\u201d See <em>id., </em>at 2350, 12 U. S. C. \u00a7 36(f)(1)(B). The United States has interpreted the \u201cshall be enforced\u201d language to provide OCC with exclusive enforcement authority. See Brief for Federal Respondent 46-48. This construction reinforces OCC's interpretation of \u00a7 484(a). If OCC has exclusive authority to enforce state law with respect to interstate branches of national banks, it would be reasonable to interpret the statute to operate similarly with respect to the national banks themselves.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b599-5\"> The majority\u2019s suggestion that the Court\u2019s decision in <em>First Nat. Bank in St. Louis </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>263 U. S. 640 (1924), is not \u201cauthoritative\u201d falls short of the mark. See <em>ante, </em>at 528, n. 2; see, <em>e. g., ante, </em>at 529 (\u201c[Rjeading \u2018visitorial powers\u2019 as limiting only sovereign oversight and supervision would produce an entirely commonplace result \u2014 the precise result contemplated by our opinion in <em>St. Louis\u201d). </em>According to the majority, irrespective of which party has the better reading of that case, it \u201cwould still stand for the proposition that the exclusive federal power of visitation does not prevent States from enforcing their law.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 528, n. 2. But that conclusion rests on the assumption that the <em>St. Louis </em>Court shared the majority\u2019s conception of law enforcement and visitation as categorically distinct for purposes of \u00a7 484(a). It is impossible to verify that assumption, however, because the bank never raised the \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d defense in that ease. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 6. If the <em>Chevron </em>doctrine is to have any interpretative value, an agency\u2019s construction of a statute cannot be foreclosed by a prior judicial decision in which the provision in question was neither raised by the parties nor passed upon by the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b600-6\"> The majority contends that <em>Watters </em>is \u201cfully in accord with the well established distinction between supervision and law enforcement.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 528.
