S. C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (emphasis added). A related statute defines \u201caggravated felony\u201d in terms of a set of listed offenses that includes \u201can offense that . . . involves fraud or deceit <em>in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.\u201d </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i) (emphasis added). See Appendix A, <em>infra. </em>The question before us is whether the italicized language refers to an element of the fraud or deceit \u201coffense\u201d as set forth in the particular fraud or deceit statute defining the offense of which the alien was previously convicted. If so, then in order to determine whether a prior conviction is for the kind of offense described, the immigration judge must look to the criminal fraud or deceit statute to see whether it contains a monetary threshold of $10,000 or more. See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>United States, </em>495 U. S. 575 (1990) (so interpreting the Armed Career Criminal Act). We conclude, however, that the italicized language does not refer to an element of the fraud or deceit crime. Rather it refers to the particular circumstances in which an offender committed a (more broadly defined) fraud or deceit crime on a particular occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Petitioner, an alien, immigrated to the United States in 1985. In 2002 he was indicted for conspiring to commit mail fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud, and money laundering. 18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7371, 1341, 1343, 1344, 1956(h). A jury found him guilty. But because none of these statutes requires a finding of any particular amount of victim loss, the jury made no finding about the amount of the loss. At sentencing petitioner stipulated that the loss exceeded $100 million. The court then imposed a sentence of 41 months in prison and required restitution of $683 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>In 2005 the Government, claiming that petitioner had been convicted of an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d sought to remove him from the United States. The Immigration Judge found that petitioner\u2019s conviction was for crimes of fraud and deceit; that the sentencing stipulation and restitution order showed that the victims\u2019 loss exceeded $10,000; and that petitioner\u2019s conviction consequently fell within the immigration statute\u2019s \u201caggravated felony\u201d definition. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i), (U) (including within the definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d any \u201cattempt or conspiracy to commit\u201d a listed \u201coffense\u201d). The Board of Immigration Appeals agreed. App. to Pet. for Cert. 44a-51a. So did the Third Circuit. 523 F. 3d 387 (2008). The Third Circuit noted that the statutes of conviction were silent as to amounts, but, in its view, the determination of loss amounts for \u201caggravated felony\u201d purposes \u201crequires an inquiry into the underlying facts of the case.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 396 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">The Courts of Appeals have come to different conclusions as to whether the $10,000 threshold in subparagraph (M)(i) refers to an element of a fraud statute or to the factual circumstances surrounding commission of the crime on a specific occasion. Compare <em>Conteh </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>461 F. 3d 45, 55 (CA1 2006) (fact-based approach); 523 F. 3d 387 (case below) (same); <em>Arguelles-Olivares </em>v. <em>Mukasey, </em>526 F. 3d 171, 178 (CA5 2008) (same), with <em>Dulal-Whiteway </em>v. <em>United States Dept. of Homeland Security, </em>501 F. 3d 116, 131 (CA2 2007) (definitional approach); <em>Kawashima </em>v. <em>Mukasey, </em>530 F. 3d 1111, 1117 (CA9 2008) (same); <em>Obasohan </em>v. <em>United States Atty. Gen., </em>479 F. 3d 785, 791 (CA11 2007) (same). We granted certiorari to decide the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The interpretive difficulty before us reflects the linguistic fact that in ordinary speech words such as \u201ccrime,\u201d \u201cfelony,\u201d \u201coffense,\u201d and the like sometimes refer to a generic crime, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>say, the crime of fraud or theft in general, and sometimes refer to the specific acts in which an offender engaged on a specific occasion, say, <em>the </em>fraud that the defendant planned and executed last month. See <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>United States, </em>555 U. S. 122, 125 (2009). The question here, as we have said, is whether the italicized statutory words \u201coffense that involves fraud or deceit <em>in which the loss to the . . . victims exceeds $10,000\u201d </em>should be interpreted in the first sense (which we shall call \u201ccategorical\u201d), <em>i. </em>as referring to a generic crime, or in the second sense (which we shall call \u201ccircumstance-specific\u201d), as referring to the specific way in which an offender committed the crime on a specific occasion. If the first, we must look to the statute defining the offense to determine whether it has an appropriate monetary threshold; if the second, we must look to the facts and circumstances underlying an offender\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The basic argument favoring the <em>first </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>the \u201cgeneric\u201d or \u201ccategorical\u201d \u2014 interpretation rests upon <em>Taylor, Chambers, </em>and <em>James </em>v. <em>United States, </em>550 U. S. 192 (2007). Those cases concerned the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), a statute that enhances the sentence imposed upon certain firearm-law offenders who also have three prior convictions for \u201ca violent felony.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 924(e). See Appendix B, <em>infra. </em>ACCA defines \u201cviolent felony\u201d to include, first, felonies with elements that involve the use of physical force against another; second, felonies that amount to \u201cburglary, arson, or extortion\u201d or that involve the use of explosives; and third, felonies that \u201cotherwise involv[e] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">In <em>Taylor </em>and <em>James </em>we held that ACCA\u2019s language read naturally uses the word \u201cfelony\u201d to refer to a generic crime as <em>generally </em>committed. <em>Chambers, supra, </em>at 125 (discussing <em>Taylor, supra, </em>at 602); <em>James, supra, </em>at 201-202. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Court noted that such an interpretation of the statute avoids \u201cthe practical difficulty of trying to ascertain\u201d in a later proceeding, \u201cperhaps from a paper record\u201d containing only a citation (say, by number) to a statute and a guilty plea, \u201cwhether the [offender\u2019s] prior crime ... did or did not involve,\u201d say, violence. <em>Chambers, supra, </em>at 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">Thus in <em>James, </em>referring to <em>Taylor, </em>we made clear that courts must use the \u201ccategorical method\u201d to determine whether a conviction for \u201cattempted burglary\u201d was a conviction for a crime that, in ACCA\u2019s language, \u201cinvolve[d] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). That method required the court to \u201cexamine, not the unsuccessful burglary the defendant attempted on a particular occasion, but the generic crime of attempted burglary.\u201d <em>Chambers, supra, </em>at 125 (discussing <em>James, supra, </em>at 204-206).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">We also noted that the categorical method is not always easy to apply. That is because sometimes a separately numbered subsection of a criminal statute will refer to several different crimes, each described separately. And it can happen that some of these crimes involve violence while others do not. A single Massachusetts statute section entitled \u201cBreaking and Entering at Night,\u201d for example, criminalizes breaking into a \u201cbuilding, ship, vessel or vehicle.\u201d Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266, \u00a7 16 (West 2006). In such an instance, we have said, a court must determine whether an offender\u2019s prior conviction was for the violent, rather than the nonviolent, break-ins that this single five-word phrase describes <em>(e. g., </em>breaking into a building rather than into a vessel), by examining \u201cthe indictment or information and jury instructions,\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>495 U. S., at 602, or, if a guilty plea is at issue, by examining the plea agreement, plea colloquy, or \u201csome comparable judicial record\u201d of the factual basis for the plea, <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>United States, </em>544 U. S. 13, 26 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Petitioner argues that we should interpret the subsection of the \u201caggravated felony\u201d statute before us as requiring use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>of this same \u201ccategorical\u201d approach. He says that the statute\u2019s language, read naturally as in <em>Taylor, </em>refers to a generic kind of crime, not a crime as committed on a particular occasion. He adds that here, as in <em>Taylor, </em>such a reading avoids the practical difficulty of determining the nature of prior conduct from what may be a brief paper record, perhaps noting only a statutory section number and a guilty plea; or, if there is a more extensive record, combing through that record for evidence of underlying conduct. Also, the categorical approach, since it covers only criminal statutes with a relevant monetary threshold, not only provides assurance of a finding on the point, but also assures that the defendant had an opportunity to present evidence about the amount of loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Despite petitioner\u2019s arguments, we conclude that the \u201cfraud and deceit\u201d provision before us calls for a \u201ccircumstance-specific,\u201d not a \u201ccategorical,\u201d interpretation. The \u201caggravated felony\u201d statute of which it is a part differs in general from ACCA, the statute at issue in <em>Taylor. </em>And the \u201cfraud and deceit\u201d provision differs specifically from ACCA\u2019s provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">Consider, first, ACCA in general. That statute defines the \u201cviolent\u201d felonies it covers to include \u201cburglary, arson, or extortion\u201d and \u201ccrime[s]\u201d that have \u201cas an element\u201d the use or threatened use of force. 18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i)-(ii). This language refers directly to generic crimes. The statute, however, contains other, more ambiguous language, covering \u201ccrime[s]\u201d that <em>\u201cinvolv[eJ conduct </em>that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis added). While this language poses greater interpretive difficulty, the Court held that it too refers to crimes as generically defined. <em>James, supra, </em>at 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Now compare the \u201caggravated felony\u201d statute before us. 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). We concede that it resembles ACC A in certain respects. The \u201caggravated felony\u201d statute lists several of its \u201coffenses\u201d in language that must refer to generic crimes. Subparagraph (A), for example, lists \u201cmurder, rape, or sexual abuse of a minor.\u201d See, <em>e. g., Estrada-Espinoza </em>v. <em>Mukasey, </em>546 F. 3d 1147, 1152 (CA9 2008) (en banc) (applying the categorical approach to \u201csexual abuse\u201d); <em>Singh </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>383 F. 3d 144, 164 (CA3 2004) (same); <em>Santos </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>436 F. 3d 323, 324 (CA2 2005) <em>(per curiam) </em>(same). Subparagraph (B) lists \u201cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance.\u201d See <em>Gousse </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>339 F. 3d 91, 95-96 (CA2 2003) (applying categorical approach); <em>Fernandez </em>v. <em>Mukasey, </em>544 F. 3d 862, 871-872 (CA7 2008) (same); <em>Steele </em>v. <em>Blackman, </em>236 F. 3d 130, 136 (CA3 2001) (same). And subparagraph (C) lists \u201cillicit trafficking in firearms or destructive devices.\u201d Other sections refer specifically to an \u201coffense described in\u201d a particular section of the Federal Criminal Code. See, <em>e. g., </em>subparagraphs (E), (H), (I), (J), (L).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">More importantly, however, the \u201caggravated felony\u201d statute differs from ACCA in that it lists certain other \u201coffenses\u201d using language that almost certainly does not refer to generic crimes but refers to specific circumstances. For example, subparagraph (P), after referring to \u201can offense\u201d that amounts to \u201cfalsely making, forging, counterfeiting, mutilating, or altering a passport,\u201d adds, <em>\u201cexcept in the case of a first offense for which the alien . . . committed the offense for the purpose of assisting ... the alien\u2019s spouse, child, or parent... to violate a provision of this chapter.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The language about (for example) \u201cforging . . . passport[s]\u201d may well refer to a generic crime, but the italicized exception cannot possibly refer to a generic crime. That is because there is no such generic crime; there is no criminal statute that contains any such exception. Thus if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>the provision is to have any meaning at all, the exception must refer to the particular circumstances in which an offender committed the crime on a particular occasion. See also subparagraph (N) (similar exception).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The statute has other provisions that contain qualifying language that certainly seems to call for circumstance-specific application. Subparagraph (K)(ii), for example, lists \u201coffense[s]... described in section 2421, 2422, or 2423 of title 18 (relating to transportation for the purpose of prostitution) <em>if committed for commercial advantage.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Of the three specifically listed criminal statutory sections only one subsection (namely, \u00a7 2423(d)) says anything about <em>commercial advantage. </em>Thus, unless the \u201ccommercial advantage\u201d language calls for circumstance-specific application, the statute\u2019s explicit references to \u00a7\u00a72421 and 2422 would be pointless. But see <em>Gertsenshteyn </em>v. <em>United States Dept. of Justice, </em>544 F. 3d 137, 144-145 (CA2 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Subparagraph (M)(ii) provides yet another example. It refers to an offense \u201cdescribed in section 7201 of title 26 (relating to tax evasion) <em>in which the revenue loss to the Government exceeds $10,000.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) There is no offense \u201cdescribed in section 7201 of title 26\u201d that has a specific loss amount as an element. Again, unless the \u201crevenue loss\u201d language calls for circumstance-specific application, the tax-evasion provision would be pointless.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The upshot is that the \u201caggravated felony\u201d statute, unlike ACCA, contains some language that refers to generic crimes and some language that almost certainly refers to the specific circumstances in which a crime was committed. The question before us then is to which category subparagraph (M)(i) belongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">Subparagraph (M)(i) refers to \u201can offense that... involves fraud or deceit <em>in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The language of the provision is consistent with a circumstance-specific approach. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>The words \u201cin which\u201d (which modify \u201coffense\u201d) can refer to the conduct involved \u201cm\u201d the commission of the offense of conviction, rather than to the elements <em>of </em>the offense. Moreover, subparagraph (M)(i) appears just prior to subparagraph (M)(ii), the internal revenue provision we have just discussed, and it is identical in structure to that provision. Where, as here, Congress uses similar statutory language and similar statutory structure in two adjoining provisions, it normally intends similar interpretations. <em>IBP, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>546 U. S. 21, 34 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Moreover, to apply a categorical approach here would leave subparagraph (M)(i) with little, if any, meaningful application. We have found no widely applicable federal fraud statute that contains \u00e1 relevant monetary loss threshold. See, <em>e. g., </em>18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341 (mail fraud), 1343 (wire fraud), 1344 (bank fraud), 371 (conspiracy to defraud the United States), 666 (theft in federally funded programs), 1028 (fraud in connection with identification documents), 1029 (fraud in connection with access devices), 1030 (fraud in connection with computers), 1347 (health care fraud), and 1348 (securities fraud). Petitioner has found only three federal fraud statutes that do so, and those three contain thresholds not of $10,000, but of $100,000 or $1 million, \u00a7\u00a7 668 (theft by fraud of an artwork worth $100,000 or more), 1031(a) (contract fraud against the United States where the contract is worth at least $1 million), and 1039(d) (providing enhanced penalties for fraud in obtaining telephone records, where the scheme involves more than $100,000). Why would Congress intend subparagraph (M)(i) to apply to only these three federal statutes, and then choose a monetary threshold that, on its face, would apply to other, nonexistent statutes as well?</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">We recognize, as petitioner argues, that Congress might have intended subparagraph (M)(i) to apply almost exclusively to those who violate certain state fraud and deceit statutes. So we have examined state law. See Appendix <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>C, <em>infra. </em>We have found, however, that in 1996, when Congress added the $10,000 threshold in subparagraph (M)(i), see Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility-Act \u00a7 321(a)(7), 110 Stat. 3009-628, 29 States had no major fraud or deceit statute with any relevant monetary threshold. In 13 of the remaining 21 States, fraud and deceit statutes contain relevant monetary thresholds but with amounts significantly higher than $10,000, leaving only 8 States with statutes in respect to which subparagraph (M)(i)\u2019s $10,000 threshold, as categorically interpreted, would have full effect. We do not believe Congress would have intended (M)(i) to apply in so limited and so haphazard a manner. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hayes, 555 </em>U. S. 415, 427 (2009) (reaching similar conclusion for similar reason in respect to a statute referring to crimes involving \u201cdomestic violence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Petitioner next points to 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1326, which criminalizes illegal entry after removal and imposes a higher maximum sentence when an alien\u2019s removal was \u201csubsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony.\u201d \u00a7 1326(b)(2). Petitioner says that a circumstance-specific approach to subparagraph (M)(i) could create potential constitutional problems in a subsequent criminal prosecution under that statute, because loss amount would not have been found beyond a reasonable doubt in the prior criminal proceeding. The Government, however, stated in its brief and at oral argument that the later jury, during the illegal reentry trial, would have to find loss amount beyond a reasonable doubt, Brief for Respondent 49-50; Tr. of Oral Arg. 39-40, eliminating any constitutional concern. Cf. <em>Hayes, supra, </em>at 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">We conclude that Congress did not intend subparagraph (M)(i)\u2019s monetary threshold to be applied categorically, <em>i. e., </em>to only those fraud and deceit crimes generically defined to include that threshold. Rather, the monetary threshold applies to the specific circumstances surrounding an offender\u2019s commission of a fraud and deceit crime on a specific occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Petitioner, as an alternative argument, says that we should nonetheless borrow from <em>Taylor </em>what that case called a \u201cmodified categorical approach.\u201d He says that, for reasons of fairness, we should insist that a jury verdict, or a judge-approved equivalent, embody a determination that the loss involved in a prior fraud or deceit conviction amounted to at least $10,000. To determine whether that is so, petitioner says, the subsequent immigration court applying subparagraph (M)(i) should examine only charging documents, jury instructions, and any special jury finding (if one has been requested). If there was a trial but no jury, the subsequent court should examine the equivalent judge-made findings. If there was a guilty plea (and no trial), the subsequent court should examine the written plea documents or the plea colloquy. To authorize any broader examination of the prior proceedings, petitioner says, would impose an unreasonable administrative burden on immigration judges and would unfairly permit him to be deported on the basis of circumstances that were not before <em>judicially determined </em>to have been present and which he may not have had an opportunity, prior to conviction, to dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">We agree with petitioner that the statute foresees the use of fundamentally fair procedures, including procedures that give an alien a fair opportunity to dispute a Government claim that a prior conviction involved a fraud with the relevant loss to victims. But we do not agree that fairness requires the evidentiary limitations he proposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">For one thing, we have found nothing in prior law that so limits the immigration court. <em>Taylor, James, </em>and <em>Shepard, </em>the cases that developed the evidentiary list to which petitioner points, developed that list for a very different purpose, namely, that of determining which statutory phrase (contained within a statutory provision that covers several different generic crimes) covered a prior conviction. See <em>supra, </em>at 34-35; <em>Taylor, </em>495 U. S., at 602; <em>Shepard, </em>544 U. S., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>at 26. For another, petitioner\u2019s proposal itself can prove impractical insofar as it requires obtaining from a jury a special verdict on a fact that (given our Part II determination) is not an element of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Further, a deportation proceeding is a civil proceeding in which the Government does not have to prove its claim \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d At the same time the evidence that the Government offers must meet a \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard. 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(3)(A). And, as the Government points out, the \u201closs\u201d must \u201cbe tied to the specific counts covered by the conviction.\u201d Brief for Respondent 44; see, <em>e. g., Alaka </em>v. <em>Attorney General of United States, </em>456 F. 3d 88, 107 (CA3 2006) (loss amount must be tethered to offense of conviction; amount cannot be based on acquitted or dismissed counts or general conduct); <em>Knutsen </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>429 F. 3d 733, 739-740 (CA7 2005) (same). And the Government adds that the \u201csole purpose\u201d of the \u201caggravated felony\u201d inquiry \u201cis to ascertain the nature of a prior conviction; it is not an invitation to relitigate the conviction itself.\u201d Brief for Respondent 44 (internal quotation marks omitted). Finally, the Board of Immigration Appeals, too, has recognized that immigration judges must assess findings made at sentencing \u201cwith an eye to what losses are covered and to the burden of proof employed.\u201d <em>In re Babaisakov, 24 I. &amp; </em>N. Dec. 306, 319 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">These considerations, taken together, mean that petitioner and those in similar circumstances have at least one and possibly two opportunities to contest the amount of loss, the first at the earlier sentencing and the second at the deportation hearing itself. They also mean that, since the Government must show the amount of loss by clear and convincing evidence, uncertainties caused by the passage of time are likely to count in the alien\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">We can find nothing unfair about the Immigration Judge\u2019s having here relied upon earlier sentencing-related material. Petitioner\u2019s own stipulation, produced for sentencing purposes, shows that the conviction involved losses considerably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>greater than $10,000. The court\u2019s restitution order shows the same. In the absence of any conflicting evidence (and petitioner mentions none), this evidence is clear and convincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The Court of Appeals concluded that petitioner\u2019s prior federal conviction consequently falls within the scope of subparagraph (M)(i).
