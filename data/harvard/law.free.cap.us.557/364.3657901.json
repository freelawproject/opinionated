Because there were no reasons to suspect the drugs presented a danger or were concealed in her underwear, we hold that the search did violate the Constitution, but because there is reason to question the clarity with which the right was established, the official who ordered the unconstitutional search is entitled to qualified immunity from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The events immediately prior to the search in question began in 13-year-old Savana Redding\u2019s math class at Safford Middle School one October day in 2003. The assistant principal of the school, Kerry Wilson, came into the room and asked Savana to go to his office. There, he showed her a day planner, unzipped and open flat on his desk, in which there were several knives, lighters, a permanent marker, and a cigarette. Wilson asked Savana whether the planner was hers; she said it was, but that a few days before she had lent it to her Mend, Marissa Glines. Savana stated that none of the items in the planner belonged to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Wilson then showed Savana four white prescription-strength ibuprofen 400-mg pills, and one over-the-counter blue naproxen 200-mg pill, all used for pain and inflammation but banned under school rules without advance permission. He asked Savana if she knew anything about the pills. Savana answered that she did not. Wilson then told Savana that he had received a report that she was giving these pills to fellow students; Savana denied it and agreed to let Wilson search her belongings. Helen Romero, an administrative assistant, came into the office, and together with Wilson they searched Savana\u2019s backpack, finding nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>At that point, Wilson instructed Romero to take Savana to the school nurse\u2019s office to search her clothes for pills. Romero and the nurse, Peggy Sehwallier, asked Savana to remove her jacket, socks, and shoes, leaving her in stretch pants and a T-shirt (both without pockets), which she was then asked to remove. Finally, Savana was told to pull her bra out and to the side and shake it, and to pull out the elastic on her underpants, thus exposing her breasts and pelvic area to some degree. No pills were found.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Savana\u2019s mother filed suit against Safford Unified School District #1, Wilson, Romero, and Sehwallier for conducting a strip search in violation of Savana\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. The individuals (hereinafter petitioners) moved for summary judgment, raising a defense of qualified immunity. The District Court for the District of Arizona granted the motion on the ground that there was no Fourth Amendment violation, and a panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 504 F. 3d 828 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">A closely divided Circuit sitting en bane, however, reversed. Following the two-step protocol for evaluating claims of qualified immunity, see <em>Saucier </em>v. <em>Katz, </em>533 U. S. 194, 200 (2001), the Ninth Circuit held that the strip search was unjustified under the Fourth Amendment test for searches of children by school officials set out in <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>T. L. O., </em>469 U. S. 325 (1985). 531 F. 3d 1071, 1081-1087 (2008). The Circuit then applied the test for qualified immunity, and found that Savana\u2019s right was clearly established at the time of the search: \u201c '[tjhese notions of personal privacy are \u201cclearly established\u201d in that they inhere in all of us, particularly middle school teenagers, and are inherent in the privacy component of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s proscription against unreasonable searches.\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1088-1089 (quoting <em>Brannum </em>v. <em>Overton Cty. School Bd., </em>516 F. 3d 489, 499 (CA6 2008)). The upshot was reversal of summary judgment as to Wilson, while affirming the judgments in favor of Sehwallier, the school nurse, and Romero, the administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>assistant, since they had not acted as independent decision-makers. 531 F. 3d, at 1089.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. 1130 (2009), and now affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The Fourth Amendment \u201cright of the people to be secure in their persons . . . against unreasonable searches and seizures\u201d generally requires a law enforcement officer to have probable cause for conducting a search. \u201cProbable cause exists where \u2018the facts and circumstances within [an officer\u2019s] knowledge and of which [he] had reasonably trustworthy information [are] sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that\u2019 an offense has been or is being committed,\u201d <em>Brinegar </em>v. <em>United States, </em>338 U. S. 160, 175-176 (1949) (quoting <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>United States, </em>267 U. S. 132, 162 (1925)), <em>and </em>that evidence bearing on that offense will be found in the place to be searched.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">In <em>T. L. O., </em>we recognized that the school setting \u201crequires some modification of the level of suspicion of illicit activity needed to justify a search,\u201d 469 U. S., at 340, and held that for searches by school officials \u201ca careful balancing of governmental and private interests suggests that the public interest is best served by a Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness that stops short of probable cause,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 341. We have thus applied a standard of reasonable suspicion to determine the legality of a school administrator\u2019s search of a student, <em>id., </em>at 342, 345, and have held that a school search \u201cwill be permissible in its scope when the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the search and not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">A number of our cases on probable cause have an implicit bearing on the reliable knowledge element of reasonable suspicion, as we have attempted to flesh out the knowledge com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>ponent by looking to the degree to which known facts imply prohibited conduct, see, <em>e. g., Adams </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>407 U. S. 143, 148 (1972); <em>id., </em>at 160, n. 9 (Marshall, J., dissenting), the specificity of the information received, see, <em>e. g., Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U. S. 410, 416-417 (1969), and the reliability of its source, see, <em>e. g., Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U. S. 108, 114 (1964). At the end of the day, however, we have realized that these factors cannot rigidly control, <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>462 U. S. 213, 230 (1983), and we have come back to saying that the standards are \u201cfluid concepts that take their substantive content from the particular contexts\u201d in which they are being assessed, <em>Ornelas </em>v. <em>United States, </em>517 U. S. 690, 696 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Perhaps the best that can be said generally about the required knowledge component of probable cause for a law enforcement officer\u2019s evidence search is that it raise a \u201cfair probability,\u201d <em>Gates, </em>462 U. S., at 238, or a \u201csubstantial chance,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 244, n. 13, of discovering evidence of criminal activity. The lesser standard for school searches could as readily be described as a moderate chance of finding evidence of wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">In this case, the school\u2019s policies strictly prohibit the non-medical use, possession, or sale of any drug on school grounds, including \u201c\u2018[a]ny prescription or over-the-counter drug, except those for which permission to use in school has been granted pursuant to Board policy.\u2019 \u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 128a.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A week before Savana was searched, another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>student, Jordan Romero (no relation of the school\u2019s administrative assistant), told the principal and Assistant Principal Wilson that \u201ccertain students were bringing drugs and weapons on campus,\u201d and that he had been sick after taking some pills that \u201che got from a classmate.\u201d App. 8a. On the morning of October 8, the same boy handed Wilson a white pill that he said Marissa Glines had given him. He told Wilson that students were planning to take the pills at lunch.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Wilson learned from Peggy Schwallier, the school nurse, that the pill was ibuprofen 400 mg, available only by prescription. Wilson then called Marissa out of class. Outside the classroom, Marissa\u2019s teacher handed Wilson the day planner, found within Marissa\u2019s reach, containing various contraband items. Wilson escorted Marissa back to his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">In the presence of Helen Romero, Wilson requested Marissa to turn out her pockets and open her wallet. Marissa produced a blue pill, several white ones, and a razor blade. Wilson asked where the blue pill came from, and Marissa answered, \u201c \u2018I guess it slipped in when <em>she </em>gave me the IBU 400s.\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 13a. When Wilson asked whom she meant, Marissa replied, \u201c\u2018Savana Redding.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Wilson then enquired about the day planner and its contents; Marissa denied knowing anything about them. Wilson did not ask Marissa any followup questions to determine whether there was any likelihood that Savana presently had pills: neither asking when Marissa received the pills from Savana nor where Savana might be hiding them.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Sehwallier did not immediately recognize the blue pill, but information provided through a poison control hotline<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> indicated that the pill was a 200-mg dose of an antiinflammatory drug, generically called naproxen, available over the counter. At Wilson\u2019s direction, Marissa was then subjected to a search of her bra and underpants by Romero and Sehwallier, as Savana was later on. The search revealed no additional pills.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">It was at this juncture that Wilson called Savana into his office and showed her the day planner. Their conversation established that Savana and Marissa were on friendly terms: while she denied knowledge of the contraband, Savana admitted that the day planner was hers and that she had lent it to Marissa. Wilson had other reports of their friendship from staff members, who had identified Savana and Marissa as part of an unusually rowdy group at the school\u2019s opening dance in August, during which alcohol and cigarettes were found in the girls\u2019 bathroom. Wilson had reason to connect the girls with this contraband, for Wilson knew that Jordan Romero had told the principal that before the dance, he had been at a party at Savana\u2019s house where alcohol was served. Marissa\u2019s statement that the pills came from Savana was thus sufficiently plausible to warrant suspicion that Savana was involved in pill distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">This suspicion of Wilson\u2019s was enough to justify a search of Savana\u2019s backpack and outer clothing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If a student is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>reasonably suspected of giving out contraband pills, she is reasonably suspected of carrying them on her person and in the carryall that has become an item of student uniform in most places today. If Wilson\u2019s reasonable suspicion of pill distribution were not understood to support searches of outer clothes and backpack, it would not justify any search worth making. And the look into Savana\u2019s bag, in her presence and in the relative privacy of Wilson\u2019s office, was not excessively intrusive, any more than Romero\u2019s subsequent search of her outer clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Here it is that the parties part company, with Savana\u2019s claim that extending the search at Wilson\u2019s behest to the point of making her pull out her underwear was constitutionally unreasonable. The exact label for this final step in the intrusion is not important, though strip search is a fair way to speak of it. Romero and Schwallier directed Savana to remove her clothes down to her underwear, and then \u201cpull out\u201d her bra and the elastic band on her underpants. <em>Id., </em>at 23a. Although Romero and Schwallier stated that they did not see anything when Savana followed their instructions, App. to Pet. for Cert. 135a, we would not define strip search and its Fourth Amendment consequences in a way that would guarantee litigation about who was looking and how much was seen. The very fact of Savana\u2019s pulling her underwear away from her body in the presence of the two officials who were able to see her necessarily exposed her breasts and pelvic area to some degree, and both subjective and reasonable societal expectations of personal privacy support the treatment of such a search as categorically distinct, requiring distinct elements of justification on the part of school authorities for going beyond a search of outer clothing and belongings.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Savana\u2019s subjective expectation of privacy against such a search is inherent in her account of it as embarrassing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>frightening, and humiliating. The reasonableness of her expectation (required by the Fourth Amendment standard) is indicated by the consistent experiences of other young people similarly searched, whose adolescent vulnerability intensifies the patent intrusiveness of the exposure. See Brief for National Association of Social Workers et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>6-14; Hyman &amp; Perone, The Other Side of School Violence: Educator Policies and Practices that may Contribute to Student Misbehavior, 36 J. School Psychology 7, 13 (1998) (strip search can \u201cresult in serious emotional damage\u201d). The common reaction of these adolescents simply registers the obviously different meaning of a search exposing the body from the experience of nakedness or near undress in other school circumstances. Changing for gym is getting ready for play; exposing for a search is responding to an accusation reserved for suspected wrongdoers and fairly understood as so degrading that a number of communities have decided that strip searches in schools are never reasonable and have banned them no matter what the facts may be, see, <em>e.g., </em>New York City Dept. of Education, Reg. No. A-432, p. 2 (2005), online at http://docs.nycenet.edu/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-21/A-432.pdf (\u201cUnder no circumstances shall a strip-search of a student be conducted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The indignity of the search does not, of course, outlaw it, but it does implicate the rule of reasonableness as stated in <em>T. L. O., </em>that \u201cthe search as actually conducted [be] reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.\u201d 469 U. S., at 341 (internal quotation marks omitted). The scope will be permissible, that is, when it is \u201cnot excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Here, the content of the suspicion failed to match the degree of intrusion. Wilson knew beforehand that the pills were prescription-strength ibuprofen and over-the-counter naproxen, common pain relievers equivalent to two Advil, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>one Aleve.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He must have been aware of the nature and limited threat of the specific drugs he was searching for, and while just about anything can be taken in quantities that will do real harm, Wilson had no reason to suspect that large amounts of the drugs were being passed around, or that individual students were receiving great numbers of pills.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Nor could Wilson have suspected that Savana was hiding common painkillers in her underwear. Petitioners suggest, as a truth universally acknowledged, that \u201cstudents ... hid[e] contraband in or under their clothing,\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioners 8, and cite a smattering of eases of students with contraband in their underwear, <em>id., </em>at 8-9. But when the categorically extreme intrusiveness of a search down to the body of an adolescent requires some justification in suspected facts, general background possibilities fall short; a reasonable search that extensive calls for suspicion that it will pay off. But nondangerous school contraband does not raise the specter of stashes in intimate places, and there is no evidence in the record of any general practice among Safford Middle School students of hiding that sort of thing in underwear; neither Jordan nor Marissa suggested to Wilson that Savana was doing that, and the preceding search of Marissa that Wilson ordered yielded nothing. Wilson never even determined when Marissa had received the pills from Savana; if it had been a few days before, that would weigh heavily against any reasonable conclusion that Savana presently had the pills on her person, much less in her underwear.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">In sum, what was missing from the suspected facts that pointed to Savana was any indication of danger to the students from the power of the drugs or their quantity, and any reason to suppose that Savana was carrying pills in her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>underwear. We think that the combination of these deficiencies was fatal to finding the search reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">In so holding, we mean to cast no ill reflection on the assistant principal, for the record raises no doubt that his motive throughout was to eliminate drugs from his school and protect students from what Jordan Romero had gone through. Parents are known to overreact to protect their children from danger, and a school official with responsibility for safety may tend to do the same. The difference is that the Fourth Amendment places limits on the official, even with the high degree of deference that courts must pay to the educator\u2019s professional judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">We do mean, though, to make it clear that the <em>T L. O. </em>concern to limit a school search to reasonable scope requires the support of reasonable suspicion of danger or of resort to underwear for hiding evidence of wrongdoing before a search can reasonably make the quantum leap from outer clothes and backpacks to exposure of intimate parts. The meaning of such a search, and the degradation its subject may reasonably feel, place a search that intrusive in a category of its own demanding its own specific suspicions.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">A school official searching a student is \u201centitled to qualified immunity where clearly established law does not show that the search violated the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>555 U. S. 223, 243-244 (2009). To be established clearly, however, there is no need that \u201cthe very action in question [have] previously been held unlawful.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Layne, </em>526 U. S. 603, 615 (1999). The unconstitutionality of outrageous conduct obviously will be unconstitutional, this being the reason, as Judge Posner has said, that \u201c[t]he easiest cases don\u2019t even arise.\u201d <em>K. H. </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>914 F. 2d 846, 851 (CA7 1990). But even as to action less than an outrage, \u201cofficials can still be on notice that their conduct violates es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>tablished law ... in novel factual circumstances.\u201d <em>Hope </em>v. <em>Pelzer, </em>536 U. S. 730, 741 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><em>T. L. O. </em>directed school officials to limit the intrusiveness of a search, \u201cin light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction,\u201d 469 U. S., at 342, and as we have just said at some length, the intrusiveness of the strip search here cannot be seen as justifiably related to the circumstances. But we realize that the lower courts have reached divergent conclusions regarding how the <em>T L. O. </em>standard applies to such searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">A number of judges have read <em>T L. O. </em>as the en banc minority of the Ninth Circuit did here. The Sixth Circuit upheld a strip search of a high school student for a drug, without any suspicion that drugs were hidden next to her body. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Ellington, </em>936 F. 2d 881, 882-883, 887 (1991). And other courts considering qualified immunity for strip searches have read <em>T. L. O. </em>as \u201ca series of abstractions, on the one hand, and a declaration of seeming deference to the judgments of school officials, on the other,\u201d <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Talladega City Bd. of Ed., </em>115 F. 3d 821, 828 (CA11 1997) (en banc), which made it impossible \u201cto establish clearly the contours of a Fourth Amendment right... [in] the wide variety of possible school settings different from those involved in <em>T. L. </em>O.\u201d itself, <em>ibid. </em>See also <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>323 F. 3d 950 (CA11 2003) (granting qualified immunity to a teacher and police officer who conducted a group strip search of a fifth grade class when looking for a missing $26).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">We think these differences of opinion from our own are substantial enough to require immunity for the school officials in this case. We would not suggest that entitlement to qualified immunity is the guaranteed product of disuniform views of the law in the other federal, or state, courts, and the fact that a single judge, or even a group of judges, disagrees about the contours of a right does not automatically render the law unclear if we have been clear. That said, however, the cases viewing school strip searches differently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>from the way we see them are numerous enough, with well-reasoned majority and dissenting opinions, to counsel doubt that we were sufficiently clear in the prior statement of law. We conclude that qualified immunity is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The strip search of Savana Redding was unreasonable and a violation of the Fourth Amendment, but petitioners Wilson, Romero, and Schwallier are nevertheless protected from liability through qualified immunity. Our conclusions here do not resolve, however, the question of the liability of petitioner Safford Unified School District #1 under <em>Monell </em>v. <em>New York City Dept. of Social Servs., </em>436 U. S. 658, 694 (1978), a claim the Ninth Circuit did not address. The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is therefore affirmed in part and reversed in part, and this case .is remanded for consideration of the <em>Monell </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b419-9\"> When the object of a school search is the enforcement of a school rule, a valid search assumes, of course, the rule\u2019s legitimacy. But the legitimacy of the rule usually goes without saying as it does here. The Court said plainly in <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>T. L. O., </em>469 U. S. 325, 342, n. 9 (1985), that standards of conduct for schools are for school administrators to determine \u25a0without second-guessing by courts lacking the experience to appreciate what may be needed. Except in patently arbitrary instances, Fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Amendment analysis takes the rule as a given, as it obviously should do in this ease. There is no need here either to explain the imperative of keeping drugs out of schools, or to explain the reasons for the school\u2019s rule banning all drugs, no matter how benign, without advance permission. Teachers are not pharmacologists trained to identify pills and powders, and an effective drug ban has to be enforceable fast. The plenary ban makes sense, and there is no basis to claim that the search was unreasonable owing to some defect or shortcoming of the rule it was aimed at enforcing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b421-7\"> Poison control centers across the country maintain 24-hour help hotlines to provide \u201cimmediate access to poison exposure management instructions and information on potential poisons.\u201d American Association of Poison Control Centers, online at http://www.aapcc.org/dnn/About/ tabid/74/Default.aspx (all Internet materials as visited June 19, 2009, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s ease file).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b421-13\"> There is no question here that justification for the school officials\u2019 search was required in accordance with the <em>T.

L. O., </em>469 U. S. 325 (1985), the Court established a two-step inquiry for determining the reasonableness of a school official\u2019s decision to search a student. First, the Court explained, the search must be \u201c \u2018justified at its inception\u2019 \u201d by the presence of \u201creasonable grounds for suspecting that the search will turn up evidence that the student has violated or is violating either the law or the rules of the school.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 342. Second, the search must be \u201cpermissible in its scope,\u201d which is achieved \u201cwhen the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the search and <em>not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the </em>infraction.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">Nothing the Court decides today alters this basic framework. It simply applies <em>T. L. O. </em>to declare unconstitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>a strip search of a 13-year-old honors student that was based on a groundless suspicion that she might be hiding medicine in her underwear. This is, in <em>essence, a case </em>in which clearly established law meets clearly outrageous conduct. I have long believed that \u201c \u2018[i]t does not require a constitutional scholar to conclude that a nude search of a 13-year-old child is an invasion of constitutional rights of some magnitude.\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 382, n. 25 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part) (quoting <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Renfrow, </em>631 F. 2d 91, 92-93 (CA7 1980)). The strip search of Savana Redding in this case was both more intrusive and less justified than the search of the student\u2019s purse in <em>T. L. O. </em>Therefore, while I join Parts I \u2014 III of the Court\u2019s opinion, I disagree with its decision to extend qualified immunity to the school official who authorized this unconstitutional search.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">The Court reaches a contrary conclusion about qualified immunity based on the fact that various Courts of Appeals have adopted seemingly divergent views about <em>T L. </em>O.\u2019s application to strip searches. <em>Ante, </em>at 377-378. But the clarity of a well-established right should not depend on whether jurists have misread our precedents. And while our cases have previously noted the \u201cdivergence of views\u201d among courts in deciding whether to extend qualified immunity, <em>e. g., Pearson </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>555 U. S. 223, 245 (2009) (noting the unsettled constitutionality of the so-called \u201ceonsentonce-removed\u201d doctrine); <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Layne, </em>526 U. S. 603, 618 (1999) (considering conflicting views on the constitutionality of law enforcement\u2019s practice of allowing the media to enter a private home to observe and film attempted arrests), we have relied on that consideration only to spare officials from having \u201c\u2018to predict <em>the future course </em>of constitutional law,\u2019\u201d <em>id., </em>at 617 (quoting <em>Procunier </em>v. <em>Navarette, </em>434 U. S. 555, 562 (1978); emphasis added). In this case, by contrast, we chart no new constitutional path. We merely decide whether the decision to strip search Savana Redding, on these facts, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>prohibited under <em>T L. O. </em>Our conclusion leaves the boundaries of the law undisturbed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The Court of Appeals properly rejected the school official\u2019s qualified immunity defense, and I would affirm that court\u2019s judgment in its entirety.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b429-9\">In fact, in <em>T.

But I also agree with Justice Stevens, <em>ante, </em>at 379-380 and this page (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part), that our opinion in <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>T. L. O., </em>469 U. S. 325 (1985), \u201cclearly established\u201d the law governing this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">Fellow student Marissa Glines, caught with pills in her pocket, accused Redding of supplying them. App. 13a. Asked where the blue pill among several white pills in Glines\u2019s pocket came from, Glines answered: \u201cI guess it slipped in when <em>she </em>gave me the IBU 400s.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Asked next \u201cwho is <em>sheV\u2019, </em>Glines responded: \u201cSavana Redding.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>As the Court observes, <em>ante, </em>at 372, 376, no followup questions were asked. Wilson did not test Glines\u2019s accusation for veracity by asking Glines when did Redding give her the pills, where, for what purpose. Any reasonable search for the pills would have ended when inspection of Redding\u2019s backpack and jacket pockets yielded nothing. Wilson had no cause to suspect, based on prior experience at the school or clues in this case, that Redding had hidden pills \u2014 containing the equivalent of two Advils or one Aleve \u2014 in her underwear or body. To make matters worse, Wilson did not release Redding, to return to class or to go home, after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>search. Instead, he made her sit on a chair outside his office for over two hours. At no point did he attempt to call her parent. Abuse of authority of that order should not be shielded by official immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">In contrast to <em>T. L. O., </em>where a teacher discovered a student smoking in the lavatory, and where the search was confined to the student\u2019s purse, the search of Redding involved her body and rested on the bare accusation of another student whose reliability the Assistant Principal had no reason to trust. The Court\u2019s opinion in <em>T. L. O. </em>plainly stated the controlling Fourth Amendment law: A search ordered by a school official, even if \u201cjustified at its inception,\u201d crosses the constitutional boundary if it becomes \u201cexcessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction.\u201d 469 U. S., at 342 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Here, \u201cthe nature of the [supposed] infraction,\u201d the slim basis for suspecting Savana Redding, and her \u201cage and sex,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>establish beyond doubt that Assistant Principal Wilson\u2019s order cannot be reconciled with this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>T. L. O. </em>Wilson\u2019s treatment of Redding was abusive, and it was not reasonable for him to believe that the law permitted it. I join Justice Stevens in dissenting from the Court\u2019s acceptance of Wilson\u2019s qualified immunity plea, and would affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment in all respects.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b430-6\">Justice Thomas,</author>\n<p id=\"AY5\">concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">I agree with the Court that the judgment against the school officials with respect to qualified immunity should be reversed. See <em>ante, </em>at 377-379. Unlike the majority, however, I would hold that the search of Savana Redding did not violate the Fourth Amendment. The majority imposes a vague and amorphous standard on school administrators. It also grants judges sweeping authority to second-guess the measures that these officials take to maintain discipline in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>their schools and ensure the health and safety of the students in their charge. This deep intrusion into the administration of public schools exemplifies why the Court should return to the common-law doctrine of <em>in loco parentis </em>under which \u201cthe judiciary was reluctant to interfere in the routine business of school administration, allowing schools and teachers to set and enforce rules and to maintain order.\u201d <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Frederick, </em>551 U. S. 393, 414 (2007) (Thomas, J., concurring). But even under the prevailing Fourth Amendment test established by <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>T. L. O., </em>469 U. S. 325 (1985), all petitioners, including the school district, are entitled to judgment as a matter of law in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">\u201cAlthough the underlying command of the Fourth Amendment is always that searches and seizures be reasonable, what is reasonable depends on the context within which a search takes place.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 337. Thus, although public school students retain Fourth Amendment rights under this Court\u2019s precedent, see <em>id., </em>at 333-337, those rights \u201care different . . . than elsewhere; the \u2018reasonableness\u2019 inquiry cannot disregard the schools\u2019 custodial and tutelary responsibility for children,\u201d <em>Vernonia School Disk 47J </em>v. <em>Acton, </em>515 U. S. 646, 656 (1995); see also <em>T. L. O., </em>469 U. S., at 339 (identifying \u201cthe substantial interest of teachers and administrators in maintaining discipline in the classroom and on school grounds\u201d). For nearly 25 years this Court has understood that \u201cMaintaining order in the classroom has never been easy, but in recent years, school disorder has often taken particularly ugly forms: drug use and violent crime in the schools have become major social problems.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In schools, \u201c[e]vents calling for discipline are frequent occurrences and sometimes require immediate, effective action.\u201d <em>Goss </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>419 U. S. 565, 580 (1975); see also <em>T. L. O., </em>469 U. S., at 340 (explaining that schools have a \u201clegitimate need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>to maintain an environment in which learning can take place\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">For this reason, school officials retain broad authority to protect students and preserve \u201corder and a proper educational environment\u201d under the Fourth Amendment. <em>Id., </em>at 339. This authority requires that school officials be able to engage in the \u201cclose supervision of schoolchildren, as well as . . . enforc[e] rules against conduct that would be perfectly permissible if undertaken by an adult.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Seeking to reconcile the Fourth Amendment with this unique public school setting, the Court in <em>T. L. O. </em>held that a school search is \u201creasonable\u201d if it is \u201c \u2018justified at its inception\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 341-342 (quoting <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U. S. 1, 20 (1968)). The search under review easily meets this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">A \u201csearch of a student by a teacher or other school official will be \u2018justified at its inception\u2019 when there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search will turn up evidence that the student has violated or is violating either the law or the rules of the school.\u201d <em>T. L. O., supra, </em>at 341-342 (footnote omitted). As the majority rightly concedes, this search was justified at its inception because there were reasonable grounds to suspect that Redding possessed medication that violated school rules. See <em>ante, </em>at 373. A finding of reasonable suspicion \u201cdoes not deal with hard certainties, but with probabilities.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cortez, 449 </em>U. S. 411, 418 (1981); see also <em>T. L. O., supra, </em>at 346 (\u201c[T]he requirement of reasonable suspicion is not a requirement of absolute certainty\u201d). To satisfy this standard, more than a mere \u201chunch\u201d of wrongdoing is required, but \u201cconsiderably\u201d less suspicion is needed than would be required to \u201csatisf[y] a preponderance of the evidence standard.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number><em>Arvizu, </em>534 U. S. 266, 274 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Furthermore, in evaluating whether there is a reasonable \u201cparticularized and objective\u201d basis for conducting a search based on suspected wrongdoing, government officials must consider the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 273 (internal quotation marks omitted). School officials have a specialized understanding of the school environment, the habits of the students, and the concerns of the community, which enables them to \u201c \u2018formulat[e] certain common-sense conclusions about human behavior.\u2019\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sokolow, </em>490 U. S. 1, 8 (1989) (quoting <em>Cortez, supra, </em>at 418). And like police officers, school officials are \u201centitled to make an assessment of the situation in light of [this] specialized training and familiarity with the customs of the [school].\u201d See <em>Arvizu, supra, </em>at 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Here, petitioners had reasonable grounds to suspect that Redding was in possession of prescription and nonprescription drugs in violation of the school\u2019s prohibition of the \u201cnon-medical use, possession, or sale of a drug\u201d on school property or at school events. 531 F. 3d 1071, 1076 (CA9 2008) (en banc); see also <em>id., </em>at 1107 (Hawkins, J., dissenting) (explaining that the school policy defined \u201cdrugs\u201d to include \u201c \u2018[a]ny prescription or over-the-counter drug, except those for which permission to use in school has been granted\u2019 \u201d). As an initial matter, school officials were aware that a few years earlier, a student had become \u201cseriously ill\u201d and \u201cspent several days in intensive care\u201d after ingesting prescription medication obtained from a classmate. App. 10a. Fourth Amendment searches do not occur in a vacuum; rather, context must inform the judicial inquiry. See <em>Cortez, supra, </em>at 417-418. In this instance, the suspicion of drug possession arose at a middle school that had \u201ca history of problems with students using and distributing prohibited and illegal substances on campus.\u201d App. 7a, 10a.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>The school\u2019s substance-abuse problems had not abated by the 2003-2004 school year, which is when the challenged search of Redding took place. School officials had found alcohol and cigarettes in the girls\u2019 bathroom during the first school dance of the year and noticed that a group of students including Redding and Marissa Glines smelled of alcohol. <em>Ibid. </em>Several weeks later, another student, Jordan Romero, reported that Redding had hosted a party before the dance where she served whiskey, vodka, and tequila. <em>Id., </em>at 8a, 11a. Romero had provided this report to school officials as a result of a meeting his mother scheduled with the officials after Romero \u201cbec[a]me violent\u201d and \u201csick to his stomach\u201d one night and admitted that \u201che had taken some pills that he had got[ten] from a classmate.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 7a-8a, 10a-lla. At that meeting, Romero admitted that \u201ccertain students were bringing drugs and weapons on campus.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 8a, 11a. One week later, Romero handed the assistant principal a white pill that he said he had received from Glines. <em>Id., </em>at 11a. He reported \u201cthat a group of students [were] planning on taking the pills at lunch.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">School officials justifiably took quick action in light of the lunchtime deadline. The assistant principal took the pill to the school nurse who identified it as prescription-strength 400-mg ibuprofen. <em>Id., </em>at 12a. A subsequent search of Glines and her belongings produced a razor blade, a naproxen 200-mg pill, and several ibuprofen 400-mg pills. <em>Id., </em>at 13a. When asked, Glines claimed that she had received the pills from Redding. <em>Ibid. </em>A search of Redding\u2019s planner, which Glines had borrowed, then uncovered \u201cseveral knives, several lighters, a cigarette, and a permanent marker.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 12a, 14a, 22a. Thus, as the majority acknowledges, <em>ante, </em>at 373-374, the totality of relevant circumstances justified a search of Redding for pills.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The remaining question is whether the search was reasonable in scope. Under <em>T L. 0., \u201ca </em>search will be permissible in its scope when the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the search and not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction.\u201d 469 U. S., at 842. The majority concludes that the school officials\u2019 search of Redding\u2019s underwear was not \u201c\u2018reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place,\u2019\u201d see <em>ante, </em>at 374-377, notwithstanding the officials\u2019 reasonable suspicion that Redding \u201cwas involved in pill distribution,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 373. According to the majority, to be reasonable, this school search required a showing of \u201cdanger to the students from the power of the drugs or their quantity\u201d or a \u201creason to suppose that [Redding] was carrying pills in her underwear.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 376-377. Each of these additional requirements is an unjustifiable departure from bedrock Fourth Amendment law in the school setting, where this Court has heretofore read the Fourth Amendment to grant considerable leeway to school officials. Because the school officials searched in a location where the pills could have been hidden, the search was reasonable in scope under <em>T. L. O.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">The majority finds that \u201csubjective and reasonable societal expectations of personal privacy support... treating]\u201d this type of search, which it labels a \u201cstrip search,\u201d as \u201ccategorically distinct, requiring distinct elements of justification on the part of school authorities for going beyond a search of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>outer clothing and belongings.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 374.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, in the majority\u2019s view, although the school officials had reasonable suspicion to believe that Redding had the pills on her person, see <em>ante, </em>at 373-374, they needed some greater level of particularized suspicion to conduct this \u201cstrip search.\u201d There is no support for this contortion of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"A5J\">The Court has generally held that the reasonableness of a search\u2019s scope depends only on whether it is limited to the area that is capable of concealing the object of the search. See, <em>e. g., Wyoming </em>v. <em>Houghton, 526 </em>U. S. 295, 307 (1999) (Police officers \u201cmay inspect passengers\u2019 belongings found in the car that ar\u00e9 capable of concealing the object of the search\u201d); <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Jimeno, </em>500 U. S. 248, 251 (1991) (\u201cThe scope of a search is generally defined by its expressed object\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johns, </em>469 U. S. 478, 487 (1985) (search reasonable because \u201cthere is no plausible argument that the object of the search could not have been concealed in the packages\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>456 U. S. 798, 820 (1982) (\u201cA lawful search . . . generally extends to the entire area in which the object of the search may be found\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">In keeping with this longstanding rule, the \u201cnature of the infraction\u201d referenced in <em>T. L. O. </em>delineates the proper scope of a search of students in a way that is identical to that per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>mitted for searches outside the <em>school </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>the search must be limited to the areas where the object of that infraction could be concealed. See <em>Horton </em>v. <em>California, </em>496 U. S. 128, 141 (1990) (\u201cPolice with a warrant for a rifle may search only places where rifles might be\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Ross, supra, </em>at 824 (\u201c[Pjrobable cause to believe that undocumented aliens are being transported in a van will not justify a warrantless search of a suitcase\u201d). A search of a student therefore is permissible in scope under <em>T L. O. </em>so long as it is objectively reasonable to believe that the area searched could conceal the contraband. The dissenting opinion below correctly captured this Fourth Amendment standard, noting that \u201cif a student were rumored to have brought a baseball bat on campus in violation of school policy, a search of that student\u2019s shirt pocket would be patently unjustified.\u201d 531 F. 3d, at 1104 (opinion of Hawkins, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The analysis of whether the scope of the search here was permissible under that standard is straightforward. Indeed, the majority does not dispute that \u201cgeneral background possibilities\u201d establish that students conceal \u201ccontraband in their underwear.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 376. It acknowledges that school officials had reasonable suspicion to look in Red-ding\u2019s backpack and outer clothing because if \u201cWilson\u2019s reasonable suspicion of pill distribution were not understood to support searches of outer clothes and backpack, it would not justify any search worth making.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 374. The majority nevertheless concludes that proceeding any further with the search was unreasonable. See <em>ante, </em>at 374-377; see also <em>ante, </em>at 381 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\u201cAny reasonable search for the pills would have ended when inspection of Redding\u2019s backpack and jacket pockets yielded nothing\u201d). But there is no support for this conclusion. The reasonable suspicion that Redding possessed the pills for distribution purposes did not dissipate simply because the search of her backpack turned up nothing. It was eminently reasonable to conclude that the back<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>pack was empty because Redding was secreting the pills in a place she thought no one would look. See <em>Ross, supra, </em>at 820 (\u201cContraband goods rarely are strewn\u201d about in plain view; \u201cby their very nature such goods must be withheld from public view\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Redding would not have been the first person to conceal pills in her undergarments.

L. O. </em>test as a license to limit searches based on a judge\u2019s assessment of a particular school policy. According to the majority, the scope of the search was impermissible because the school official \u201cmust have been aware of the nature and limited threat of the specific drugs he was searching for\u201d and because he \u201chad no reason to suspect that large amounts of the drugs were being passed around, or that individual students were receiving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>great numbers of pills.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 376. Thus, in order to locate a rationale for finding a Fourth Amendment violation in this case, the majority retreats from its observation that the school\u2019s firm no-drug policy \u201cmakes sense, and there is no basis to claim that the search was unreasonable owing to some defect or shortcoming of the rule it was aimed at enforcing.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 372, n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Even accepting the majority\u2019s assurances that it is not attacking the rule\u2019s reasonableness, it certainly is attacking the rule\u2019s importance. This approach directly conflicts with <em>T. L. O. </em>in which the Court was \u201cunwilling to adopt a standard under which the legality of a search is dependent upon a judge\u2019s evaluation of the relative importance of various school rules.\u201d 469 U. S., at 342, n. 9. Indeed, the Court in <em>T. L. O. </em>expressly rejected the proposition that the majority seemingly endorses \u2014 that \u201csome rules regarding student conduct are by nature too \u2018trivial\u2019 to justify a search based upon reasonable suspicion.\u201d <em>Ibid.; </em>see also <em>id., </em>at 343, n. 9 (\u201cThe promulgation of a rule forbidding specified conduct presumably reflects a judgment on the part of school officials that such conduct is destructive of school order or of a proper educational environment. Absent any suggestion that the rule violates some substantive constitutional guarantee, the courts should, as a general matter, defer to that judgment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">The majority\u2019s decision in this regard also departs from another basic principle of the Fourth Amendment: that law enforcement officials can enforce with the same vigor all rules and regulations irrespective of the perceived importance of any of those rules. \u201cIn a long line of cases, we have said that when an officer has probable cause to believe a person committed even a. minor crime in his presence, the balancing of private and public interests is not in doubt. The arrest is constitutionally reasonable.\u201d <em>Virginia </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>553 U. S. 164, 171 (2008). The Fourth Amendment rule for searches is the same: Police officers are entitled to search regardless of the perceived triviality of the underlying law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>As we have explained, requiring police to make \u201csensitive, case-by-case determinations of government need,\u201d <em>Atwater </em>v. <em>Lago Vista, </em>532 U. S. 318, 347 (2001), for a particular prohibition before conducting a search would \u201cplace police in an almost impossible spot,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">The majority has placed school officials in this \u201cimpossible spot\u201d by questioning whether possession of ibuprofen and naproxen causes a severe enough threat to warrant investigation. Had the suspected infraction involved a street drug, the majority implies that it would have approved the scope of the search. See <em>ante, </em>at 376 (relying on the \u201climited threat of the specific drugs he was searching for\u201d); <em>ibid, </em>(relying on the limited \u201cpower of the drugs\u201d involved). In effect, then, the majority has replaced a school rule that draws no distinction among drugs with a new one that does. As a result, a full search of a student\u2019s person for prohibited drugs will be permitted only if the Court agrees that the drug in question was sufficiently dangerous. Such a test is unworkable and unsound. School officials cannot be expected to halt searches based on the possibility that a court might later find that the particular infraction at issue is not severe enough to warrant an intrusive investigation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>A rule promulgated by a school board represents the judgment of school officials that the rule is needed to maintain \u201cschool order\u201d and \u201ca proper educational environment.\u201d <em>T. L. O., </em>469 U. S., at 343, n. 9. Teachers, administrators, and the local school board are called upon both to \u201cprotect the... safety of students and school personnel\u201d and \u201cmaintain an environment conducive to learning.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 353 (Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment).

In such an environment, something as simple as a \u201cwater pistol or peashooter can wreak [havoc] until it is taken away.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The danger posed by unchecked distribution and consumption of prescription pills by students certainly needs no elaboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Judges are not qualified to second-guess the best manner for maintaining quiet and order in the school environment. Such institutional judgments, like those concerning the selection of the best methods for \u201crestraining students] from assaulting one another, abusing drugs and alcohol, and committing other crimes,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 342, n. 9, \u201cinvolve a host of policy choices that must be made by locally elected representatives, rather than by federal judges interpreting the basic charter of Government for the entire country,\u201d <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Harker Heights, </em>503 U.

It is a mistake for judges to assume the responsibility for deciding which school rules are important enough to allow for invasive searches and which rules are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Even if this Court were authorized to second-guess the importance of school rules, the Court\u2019s assessment of the importance of this district\u2019s policy is flawed. It is a crime to possess or use prescription-strength ibuprofen without a prescription. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 13-3406(A)(1) (West Supp. 2008) (\"A person shall not knowingly . . . [possess or use a prescription-only drug unless the person obtains the prescription-only drug pursuant to a valid prescription of a prescriber who is licensed pursuant to [state law]\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> By prohibiting unauthorized prescription drugs on school grounds \u2014 and conducting a search to ensure students abide by that prohibition \u2014 the school rule here was consistent with a routine provision of the state criminal code. It hardly seems unreasonable for school officials to enforce a rule that, in effect, proscribes conduct that amounts to a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Moreover, school districts have valid reasons for punishing the unauthorized possession of prescription drugs on school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>property as severely as the possession of street drugs; \u201c[tjeenage abuse of over-the-counter and prescription drugs poses an increasingly alarming national crisis.\u201d Get Teens Off Drugs, 72 The Education Digest, No. 4, p. 75 (Dec. 2006). As one study noted, \u201cmore young people ages 12-17 abuse prescription drugs than any illicit drug except marijuana\u2014 more than cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine combined.\u201d Executive Office of the President, Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), Prescription for Danger 1 (Jan. 2008) (hereinafter Prescription for Danger). And according to a 2005 survey of teens, \u201cnearly one in five (19 percent or 4.5 million) admit abusing prescription drugs in their lifetime.\u201d Columbia University, The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA), \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Drugs!\u201d V: Prescription Drug Pushers on the Internet 2 (July 2008); see also Dept, of Health and Human Services, National Institute on Drug Abuse, High School and Youth Trends 2 (Dec. 2008) (\u201cIn 2008, 15.4 percent of 12th-graders reported using a prescription drug nonmedically within the past year\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">School administrators can reasonably conclude that this high rate of drug abuse is being fueled, at least in part, by the increasing presence of prescription drugs on school campuses. See, <em>e. g., </em>Gibson, Grand Forks Schools See Rise in Prescription Drug Abuse, Grand Forks Herald, Nov. 16, 2008, pp. Al, A6 (explaining that \u201cprescription drug abuse is growing into a larger problem\u201d as students \u201c \u2018bring them to school and sell them or just give them to their friends\u2019 \u201d).

At least some of these injuries and deaths are likely due to the fact that \u201c[m]ost controlled prescription drug abusers are poly-substance abusers,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 3, a habit that is especially likely to result in deadly drug combinations. Furthermore, even if a child is not immediately harmed by the abuse of prescription drugs, research suggests that prescription drugs have become \u201cgateway drugs to other substances of abuse.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 4; Healy, Skipping the Street, Los Angeles Times, Sept. 15,2008, p.

See Prescription for Danger 3 (\u201cPain relievers like Vicodin and OxyContin are the prescription drugs most commonly abused by teens\u201d). But they are not without their own dangers. As nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), they pose a risk of death from overdose. The Pill Book 821, 827 (H. Silverman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>ed., 13th ed. 2008) (observing that ibuprofen and naproxen are NSAIDs and \u201c[p]eople have died from NSAID overdoses\u201d). Moreover, the side effects caused by the use of NSAIDs can be magnified if they are taken in combination with other drugs. See, <em>e.g., </em>Reactions Weekly, No. 1235, p. 18 (Jan. 17, 2009) (\u201cA 17-year-old girl developed allergic interstitial nephritis and renal failure while receiving escitalopram and ibuprofen\u201d); <em>id., </em>No. 1232, at 26 (Dec. 13, 2008) (\u201cA 16-month-old boy developed iron deficiency anaemia and hypoalbuminaemia during treatment with naproxen\u201d); <em>id., </em>No. 1220, at 15 (Sept. 20, 2008) (18-year-old \u201cwas diagnosed with pill-induced oesophageal perforation\u201d after taking ibuprofen \u201cand was admitted to the [intensive care unit]\u201d); <em>id., </em>No. 1170, at 20 (Sept. 22, 2007) (\u201cA 12-year-old boy developed anaphylaxis following ingestion of ibuprofen\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">If a student with a previously unknown intolerance to ibuprofen or naproxen were to take either drug and become ill, the public outrage would likely be directed toward the school for failing to take steps to prevent the unmonitored use of the drug. In light of the risks involved, a school\u2019s decision to establish and enforce a school prohibition on the possession of any unauthorized drug is thus a reasonable judgment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">* *</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">In determining whether the search\u2019s scope was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, it is therefore irrelevant whether officials suspected Redding of possessing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>prescription-strength ibuprofen, nonprescription-strength naproxen, or some harder street drug. Safford prohibited its possession on school property. Reasonable suspicion that Redding was in possession of drugs in violation of these policies, therefore, justified a search extending to any area where small pills could be concealed. The search did not violate the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">By declaring the search unreasonable in this case, the majority has \u201c \u2018surrender[ed] control of the American public school system to public school students\u2019\u201d by invalidating school policies that treat all drugs equally and by second-guessing swift disciplinary decisions made by school officials. See <em>Morse, </em>551 U. S., at 421 (Thomas, J., concurring) (quoting <em>Tinker </em>v. <em>Des Moines Independent Community School Dist., </em>393 U. S. 503, 526 (1969) (Black, J., dissenting)). The Court\u2019s interference in these matters of great concern to teachers, parents, and students illustrates why the most constitutionally sound approach to the question <em>of </em>applying the Fourth Amendment in local public schools would in fact be the complete restoration of the common-law doctrine of <em>in loco parentis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">\u201c[I]n the early years of public schooling,\u201d courts applied the doctrine of <em>in loco parentis </em>to transfer to teachers the authority of a parent to \u201c'command obedience, to control stubbornness, to quicken diligence, and to reform bad habits.\u2019\u201d <em>Morse, supra, </em>at 413-414 (Thomas, J., concurring) (quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Pendergrass, </em>19 N. C. 365, 365-366 (1837)). So empowered, schoolteachers and administrators had almost complete discretion to establish and enforce the rules they believed were necessary to maintain control over their classrooms. See 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *205 (\u201cSo the power allowed by law to the parent over the person of the child may be delegated to a tutor or instructor, the better to accomplish the purpose of education\u201d); 1 W. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 441 (1765) (\u201cHe may also delegate part of his parental authority, during his life, to the tutor or schoolmaster of his child; who is then <em>in loco parentis, </em>and has such a portion of the power of the parent committed to his charge, viz. that of restraint and correction, as may be necessary to answer the purposes for which he is employed\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The perils of judicial policy-making inherent in applying Fourth Amendment protections to public schools counsel in favor of a return to the understanding that existed in this Nation\u2019s first public schools, which gave teachers discretion to craft the rules needed to carry out the disciplinary responsibilities delegated to them by parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">If the common-law view that parents delegate to teachers their authority to discipline and maintain order were to be applied in this case, the search of Redding would stand. There can be no doubt that a parent would have had the authority to conduct the search at issue in this ease. Parents have \u201cimmunity from the strictures of the Fourth Amendment\u201d when it comes to searches of a child or that child\u2019s belongings. <em>T. L. O., </em>469 U. S., at 337; see also <em>id., </em>at 336 (A parent\u2019s authority is \u201cnot subject to the limits of the Fourth Amendment\u201d); <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Wisconsin, </em>483 U. S. 868, 876 (1987) (\u201c[P]arental custodial authority\u201d does not require \u201cjudicial approval for [a] search of a minor child\u2019s room\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">As acknowledged by this Court, this principle is based on the \u201csocietal understanding of superior and inferior\u201d with respect to the \u201cparent and child\u201d relationship. <em>Georgia </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>547 U. S. 103, 114 (2006). In light of this relation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>ship, the Court has indicated that a parent can authorize a third-party search of a child by consenting to such a search, even if the child denies his consent. See <em>ibid.; </em>see also 4 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 8.3(d), p. 160 (4th ed. 2004) (\u201c[A] father, as the head of the household with the responsibility and the authority for the discipline, training and control of his children, has a superior interest in the family residence to that of his minor son, so that the father\u2019s consent to search would be effective notwithstanding the son\u2019s contemporaneous on-the-scene objection\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Certainly, a search by the parent himself is no different, regardless of whether or not a child would prefer to be left alone. See <em>id., </em>\u00a7 8.4(b), at 202 (\u201c[E]ven [if] a minor child . . . may think of a room as \u2018his,\u2019 the overall dominance will be in his parents\u201d (some internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\">Restoring the common-law doctrine of <em>in loco parentis </em>would not, however, leave public schools entirely free to impose any rule they choose. \u201cIf parents do not like the rules imposed by those schools, they can seek redress in school boards or legislatures; they can send their children to private schools or homeschool them; or they can simply move.\u201d See <em>Morse, supra, </em>at 420 (Thomas, J., concurring). Indeed, parents and local government officials have proved themselves quite capable of challenging overly harsh school rules or the enforcement of sensible rules in insensible ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">For example, one community questioned a school policy that resulted in \u201can 11-year-old [being] arrested, handcuffed and taken to jail for bringing a plastic butter knife to school.\u201d Downey, Zero Tolerance Doesn\u2019t Always Add Up, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Apr. 6, 2009, p.

Parents, teachers, school administrators, local politicians, and state officials are all better suited than judges to determine the appropriate limits on searches conducted by school officials. Preservation of order, discipline, and safety in public schools is simply not the domain of the Constitution. And, common sense is not a judicial monopoly or a constitutional imperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">\u201c[T]he nationwide drug epidemic makes the war against drugs a pressing concern in every school.\u201d <em>Board of Ed. of Independent School Dist. No. 92 of Pottawatomie Cty. </em>v. <em>Earls, </em>536 U. S. 822, 834 (2002). And yet the Court has limited the authority of school officials to conduct searches for the drugs that the officials believe pose a serious safety risk to their students. By doing so, the majority has confirmed that a return to the doctrine of <em>in loco parentis </em>is required to keep the judiciary from essentially seizing control of public schools. Only then will teachers again be able to \u201c 'govern the[ir] pupils, quicken the slothful, spur the indolent, restrain the impetuous, and control the stubborn\u2019 \u201d by making \u201c 'rules, giv[ing] commands, and punish[ing] disobedience\u2019\u201d without interference from judges. <em>Morse, </em>551 U.

Even more trou<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>bling, it has done so in a case in which the underlying response by school administrators was reasonable and justified.

But the school was under no constitutional obligation to call Redding\u2019s parents before conducting the search: \u201c[Reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment does not require employing the least intrusive means, because the logic of such elaborate less-restrictive-alternative arguments could raise insuperable barriers to the exercise of virtually all search-and-seizure powers.\u201d <em>Board of Ed. of Independent School Dist.

For the same reason, the Constitution did not require sehool officials to ask \u201cfollowup questions\u201d after they had already developed reasonable suspicion that Redding possessed drugs.
