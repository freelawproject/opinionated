S. C. \u00a7 1703(f), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>which requires a State \u201cto take appropriate action to overcome language barriers that impede equal participation by its students in its instructional programs.\u201d In 2000, the District Court entered a declaratory judgment with respect to Nogales, and in 2001, the court extended the order to apply to the entire State. Over the next eight years, petitioners repeatedly sought relief from the District Court\u2019s orders, but to no avail. We granted certiorari after the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the denial of petitioners\u2019 motion for relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5), and we now reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">As we explain, the District Court and the Court of Appeals misunderstood both the obligation that the EEOA imposes on States and the nature of the inquiry that is required when parties such as petitioners seek relief under Rule 60(b)(5) on the ground that enforcement of a judgment is \u201cno longer equitable.\u201d Both of the lower courts focused excessively on the narrow question of the adequacy of the State\u2019s incremental funding for ELL instruction instead of fairly considering the broader question whether, as a result of important changes during the intervening years, the State was fulfilling its obligation under the EEOA by other means. The question at issue in these cases is not whether Arizona must take \u201cappropriate action\u201d to overcome the language barriers that impede ELL students. Of course it must. But petitioners argue that Arizona is now fulfilling its statutory obligation by new means that reflect new policy insights and other changed circumstances. Rule 60(b)(5) provides the vehicle for petitioners to bring such an argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">In 1992, a group of students enrolled in the ELL program in Nogales and their parents (plaintiffs) filed suit in the District Court for the District of Arizona on behalf of \u201call minor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>ity \u2018at risk\u2019 and limited English proficient children . . . now or hereafter, enrolled in [the] Nogales Unified School District . . . as well as their parents and guardians.\u201d <em>Flores </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>172 F. Supp. 2d 1225, 1226 (2000). Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment holding that the State of Arizona, its board of education, and its superintendent of public instruction (defendants) were violating the EEOA by providing inadequate ELL instruction in Nogales.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The relevant portion of the EEOA states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">\u201cNo State shall deny equal educational opportunity to an individual on account of his or her race, color, sex, or national origin, by\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">\u201c(f) the failure by an educational agency to take <em>appropriate action </em>to overcome language barriers that impede equal participation by its students in its instructional programs.\u201d 20 U. S. C. \u00a71703 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">By simply requiring a State \u201cto take appropriate action to overcome language barriers\u201d without specifying particular actions that a State must take, \u201cCongress intended to leave state and local educational authorities a substantial amount of latitude in choosing the programs and techniques they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>would use to meet their obligations under the EEOA.\u201d <em>Castaneda </em>v. <em>Pickard, </em>648 F. 2d 989, 1009 (CA5 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">In August 1999, after seven years of pretrial proceedings and after settling various claims regarding the structure of Nogales\u2019 ELL curriculum, the evaluation and monitoring of Nogales\u2019 students, and the provision of tutoring and other compensatory instruction, the parties proceeded to trial. In January 2000, the District Court concluded that defendants were violating the EEOA because the amount of funding the State allocated for the special needs of ELL students (ELL incremental funding) was arbitrary and not related to the actual funding needed to cover the costs of ELL instruction in Nogales. 172 F. Supp. 2d, at 1239. Defendants did not appeal the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">In the years following, the District Court entered a series of additional orders and injunctions. In October 2000, the court ordered the State to \u201cprepare a cost study to establish the proper appropriation to effectively implement\u201d ELL programs. <em>Flores </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>160 F. Supp. 2d 1043, 1047. In June 2001, the court applied the declaratory judgment order statewide and granted injunctive relief accordingly. No. CIV. 92-596TUCACM, 2001 WL 1028369, *2 (June 25, 2001). The court took this step even though the certified class included only Nogales students and parents and even though the court did not find that any districts other than Nogales were in violation of the EEOA. The court set a deadline of January 31,2002, for the State to provide funding that \u201cbear[s] a rational relationship to the actual funding needed.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">In January 2005, the court gave the State 90 days to \u201cappropriately and constitutionally fun[d] the state\u2019s ELL programs taking into account the [Rule\u2019s] previous orders.\u201d No. CIV. 92-596-TUC-ACM, p. 5, App. 393. The State failed to meet this deadline, and in December 2005, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>held the State in contempt. Although the legislature was not then a party to the suit, the court ordered that \u201cthe legislature has 15 calendar days after the beginning of the 2006 legislative session to comply with the January 28,2005 Court order. Everyday thereafter ... that the State fails to comply with this Order, [fines] will be imposed until the State is in compliance.\u201d <em>Flores </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>405 F. Supp. 2d 1112, 1120. The schedule of fines that the court imposed escalated from $500,000 to $2 million per day. <em>Id., </em>at 1120-1121.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Defendants did not appeal any of the District Court\u2019s orders, and the record suggests that some state officials supported their continued enforcement. In June 2001, the state attorney general acquiesced in the statewide extension of the declaratory judgment order, a step that the State has explained by reference to the Arizona constitutional requirement of uniform statewide school funding. See Brief for Appellee State of Arizona et al. in No. 07-15603 etc. (CA9), p. 60 (citing Ariz. Const., Art. 11, \u00a7 1(A)). At a hearing in February 2006, a new attorney general opposed the superintendent\u2019s request for a stay of the December 2005 order imposing sanctions and fines, and filed a proposed distribution of the accrued fines.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">In March 2006, after accruing over $20 million in fines, the state legislature passed HB 2064, which was designed to implement a permanent funding solution to the problems identified by the District Court in 2000. Among other things, HB 2064 increased ELL incremental funding (with a 2-year per-student limit on such funding) and created two new funds \u2014 a structured English immersion fund and a compensatory instruction fund \u2014 to cover additional costs of ELL programming. Moneys in both newly created funds were to be offset by available federal moneys. HB 2064 also instituted several programming and structural changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>The Governor did not approve of HB 2064\u2019s funding provisions, but she allowed the bill to become law without her signature. Because HB 2064\u2019s incremental ELL funding increase required court approval to become effective, the Governor requested the attorney general to move for accelerated consideration by the District Court. In doing so, she explained: \u201c \u2018After nine months of meetings and three vetoes, it is time to take this matter to a federal judge. I am convinced that getting this bill into court now is the most expeditious way ultimately to bring the state into compliance with federal law.\u2019\u201d <em>Flores </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>516 F. 3d 1140, 1153, n. 16 (CA9 2008). The state board of education joined the Governor in opposing HB 2064. Together, the state board of education, the State of Arizona, and the plaintiffs are respondents here.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">With the principal defendants in the action siding with the plaintiffs, the Speaker of the State House of Representatives and the President of the State Senate (Legislators) filed a motion to intervene as representatives of their respective legislative bodies. App. 55. In support of their motion, they stated that although the attorney general had a \u201clegal duty\u201d to defend HB 2064, the attorney general had shown \u201clittle enthusiasm\u201d for advancing the legislature\u2019s interests. <em>Id., </em>at 57. Among other things, the Legislators noted that the attorney general \u201cfailed to take an appeal of the judgment entered in this case in 2000 and has failed to appeal any of the injunctions and other orders issued in aid of the judgment.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 60. The District Court granted the Legislators\u2019 motion for permissive intervention, and the Legislators and superintendent (together, petitioners here) moved to purge the District Court\u2019s contempt order in light of HB 2064. Alternatively, they moved for relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5) based on changed circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">In April 2006, the District Court denied petitioners\u2019 motion, concluding that HB 2064 was fatally flawed in three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>respects. First, while HB 2064 increased ELL incremental funding by approximately $80 per student, the court held that this increase was not rationally related to effective ELL programming. Second, the court concluded that <em>imposing </em>a 2-year limit on funding for each ELL student was irrational. Third, according to the court, HB 2064 violated federal law by using federal funds to \u201csupplant\u201d rather than \u201csupplement\u201d state funds. No. CV-92-596-TUC-RCC, pp. 4-8 (Apr. 25, 2006), App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 08-294, pp. 176a, 181a-182a. The court did not address petitioners\u2019 Rule 60(b)(5) claim that changed circumstances rendered continued enforcement of the original declaratory judgment order inequitable. Petitioners appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">In an unpublished decision, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated the District Court\u2019s April 2006 order, the sanctions, and the imposition of fines, and remanded for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether Rule 60(b)(5) relief was warranted. <em>Flores </em>v. <em>Rzeslawski, </em>204 Fed. Appx. 580 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">On remand, the District Court denied petitioners\u2019 Rule 60(b)(5) motion. <em>Flores </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>480 F. Supp. 2d 1157, 1167 (Ariz. 2007). Holding that HB 2064 did not establish \u201ca funding system that rationally relates funding available to the actual costs of all elements of ELL instruction,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 1165, the court gave the State until the end of the legislative session to comply with its orders. The State failed to do so, and the District Court again held the State in contempt. No. CV 92-596 TUC-RCC (Oct. 10, 2007), App. 86. Petitioners appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The Court of Appeals affirmed. 516 F. 3d 1140. It acknowledged that Nogales had \u201cmade significant strides since 2000,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 1156, but concluded that the progress did not warrant Rule 60(b)(5) relief. Emphasizing that Rule 60(b)(5) is not a substitute for a timely appeal, and characterizing the original declaratory judgment order as centering on the adequacy of ELL incremental funding, the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Appeals explained that relief would be appropriate only if petitioners had shown \u201ceither that there are no longer incremental costs associated with ELL programs in Arizona\u201d or that Arizona had altered its funding model. <em>Id., </em>at 1169. The Court of Appeals concluded that petitioners had made neither showing, and it rejected petitioners\u2019 other arguments, including the claim that Congress\u2019 enactment of the No. Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB), 115 Stat. 1425, codified in Title 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 6842, constituted a changed legal circumstance that warranted Rule 60(b)(5) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. 1092 (2009), and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Before addressing the merits of petitioners\u2019 Rule 60(b)(5) motion, we consider the threshold issue of standing \u2014 \u201can essential and unchanging part of the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III.\u201d <em>Lujan </em>v. <em>Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U. S. 555, 560 (1992). To establish standing, a plaintiff must present an injury that is concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent; fairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s challenged action; and redressable by a favorable ruling. <em>Id., </em>at 560-561. Here, as in all standing inquiries, the critical question is whether at least one petitioner has \u201calleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to warrant <em>his </em>invocation of federal-court jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Summers </em>v. <em>Earth Island Institute, </em>555 U. S. 488, 493 (2009) (quoting <em>Warth </em>v. <em>Seldin, </em>422 U. S. 490, 498 (1975); internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">We agree with the Court of Appeals that the superintendent has standing because he \u201cis a named defendant in the case[,] the Declaratory Judgment held him to be in violation of the EEOA, and the current injunction runs against him.\u201d 516 F. 3d, at 1164 (citation omitted). For these reasons alone, he has alleged a sufficiently \u201c\u2018personal stake in the outcome of the controversy\u2019 \u201d to support standing. <em>Warth, supra, </em>at 498; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sweeney, </em>914 F. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>1260, 1263 (CA9 1990) (rejecting as \u201cfrivolous\u201d the argument that a party does not have \u201cstanding to object to orders specifically directing it to take or refrain from taking action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Respondents\u2019 only argument to the contrary is that the superintendent answers to the state board of education, which in turn answers to the Governor, and that the Governor is the only Arizona official who \u201ccould have resolved the conflict within the Executive Branch by directing an appeal.\u201d Brief for Respondent Flores et al. 22. We need not consider whether respondents\u2019 chain-of-command argument has merit because the Governor has, in fact, directed an appeal. See App. to Reply Brief for Petitioner Superintendent 1 (\u201cI hereby direct [the state attorney general] to file a brief at the [Supreme] Court on behalf of the State of Arizona adopting and joining in the positions taken by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, the Speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives, and the President of the Arizona Senate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Because the superintendent clearly has standing to challenge the lower courts\u2019 decisions, we need not consider whether the Legislators also have standing to do so.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See, <em>e.g., Arlington Heights </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., </em>429 U. S. 252, 264, and n. 9 (1977) (\u201c[W]e have at least one individual plaintiff who has demonstrated standing .... Because of the presence of this plaintiff, we need not consider whether the other individual and corporate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>plaintiffs have standing to maintain the suit\u201d). Accordingly, we proceed to the merits of petitioners\u2019 Rule 60(b)(5) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5) permits a party to obtain relief from a judgment or order if, among other things, \u201capplying [the judgment or order] prospectively is no longer equitable.\u201d Rule 60(b)(5) may not be used to challenge <em>the </em>legal conclusions on which a prior judgment or order rests, but the Rule provides a means by which a party can ask a court to modify or vacate a judgment or order if \u201ca significant change either in factual conditions or in law\u201d renders continued enforcement \u201cdetrimental to the public interest.\u201d <em>Rufo </em>v. <em>Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, </em>502 U. S. 367, 384 (1992). The party seeking relief bears the burden of establishing that changed circumstances warrant relief, <em>id., </em>at 383, but once a party carries this burden, a court abuses its discretion \u201cwhen it refuses to modify an injunction or consent decree in light of such changes,\u201d <em>Agostini </em>v. <em>Felton, </em>521 U. S. 203, 215 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Rule 60(b)(5) serves a particularly important function in what we have termed \u201cinstitutional reform litigation.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Rufo, supra, </em>at 380. For one thing, injunctions issued in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>such cases often remain in force for many years, and the passage of time frequently brings about changed circumstances \u2014 changes in the nature of the underlying problem, changes in governing law or its interpretation by the courts, and new policy insights \u2014 that warrant reexamination of the original judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Second, institutional reform injunctions often raise sensitive federalism concerns. Such litigation commonly involves areas of core state responsibility, such as public education. See <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>515 U. S. 70, 99 (1995) (\u201c[O]ur cases recognize that local autonomy of school districts is a vital national tradition, and that a district court must strive to restore state and local authorities to the control of a school system operating in compliance with the Constitution\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>514 U. S. 549, 580 (1995) (Kennedy, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Federalism concerns are heightened when, as in these cases, a federal-court decree has the effect of dictating state or local budget priorities. States and local governments have limited funds. When a federal court orders that money be appropriated for one program, the effect is often to take funds away from other important programs. See <em>Jenkins, supra, </em>at 131 (Thomas, J., concurring) (\u201cA structural reform decree eviscerates a State\u2019s discretionary authority over its own program and budgets and forces state officials to reallocate state resources and funds\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Finally, the dynamics of institutional reform litigation differ from those of other cases. Scholars have noted that public officials sometimes consent to, or refrain from vigorously opposing, decrees that go well beyond what is required by federal law. See, <em>e.g., </em>McConnell, Why Hold Elections? Using Consent Decrees To Insulate Policies From Political Change, 1987 U. Chi. Legal Forum 295, 317 (noting that government officials may try to use consent decrees to \u201cblock ordinary avenues of political change\u201d or to \u201csidestep political constraints\u201d); Horowitz, Decreeing Organizational Change: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Judicial Supervision of Public Institutions, 1983 Duke L. J. 1265, 1294-1295 (\u201cNominal defendants [in institutional reform cases] are sometimes happy to be sued and happier still to lose\u201d); R. Sandler &amp; D.

But in recognition of the features of institutional reform decrees, we have held that courts must take a \u201cflexible approach\u201d to Rule 60(b)(5) motions addressing such decrees. <em>Rufo, </em>502 U. S., at 381. A flexible approach allows courts to ensure that \u201cresponsibility for discharging the State\u2019s obligations is returned promptly to the State and its officials\u201d when the circumstances warrant. <em>Frew, supra, </em>at 442. In applying this flexible approach, courts must remain attentive to the fact that \u201cfederal-court decrees exceed appropriate limits if they are aimed at eliminating a condition that does not violate [federal law] or does not flow from such a violation.\u201d <em>Milliken </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>433 U. S. 267, 282 (1977). \u201cIf [a federal consent decree is] not limited to reasonable and necessary implementations of federal law,\u201d it may \u201cimproperly deprive future officials of their designated legislative and executive powers.\u201d <em>Frew, </em>540 U. S., at 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">For these reasons, a critical question in this Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry is whether the objective of the District Court\u2019s 2000 declaratory judgment <em>order </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>satisfaction of the EEOA\u2019s \u201cappropriate action\u201d standard \u2014 has been achieved. See <em>id., </em>at 442. If a durable remedy has been implemented, continued enforcement of the order is not only unnecessary, but improper. See <em>Milliken, supra, </em>at 282. We note that the EEOA itself limits court-ordered remedies to those that \u201care <em>essential </em>to correct particular denials of equal educational opportunity or equal protection of the laws.\u201d 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1712 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">The Court of Appeals did not engage in the Rule 60(b)(5) analysis just described. Rather than applying a flexible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>standard that seeks to return control to state and local officials as soon as a violation of federal law has been remedied, the Court of Appeals used a heightened standard that paid insufficient attention to federalism concerns. And rather than inquiring broadly into whether changed conditions in Nogales provided evidence of an ELL program that complied with the EEOA, the Court of Appeals concerned itself only with determining whether increased ELL funding complied with the original declaratory judgment order. The court erred on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The Court of Appeals began its Rule 60(b)(5) discussion by citing the correct legal standard, see 516 F. 3d, at 1163 (noting that relief is appropriate upon a showing of <em>\u201c\u2018a </em>significant change either in factual conditions or in law\u2019 \u201d), but it quickly strayed. It referred to the situations in which changed circumstances warrant Rule 60(b)(5) relief as \u201clikely rare,\u201d <em>id, </em>at 1167, and explained that, to succeed on these grounds, petitioners would have to make a showing that conditions in Nogales had so changed as to \u201csweep away\u201d the District Court\u2019s incremental funding determination, <em>id, at </em>1168. The Court of Appeals concluded that the District Court had not erred in determining that \u201cthe landscape was not so <em>radically </em>changed as to justify relief from judgment without compliance.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1172 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Moreover, after recognizing that review of the denial of Rule 60(b)(5) relief should generally be \u201csomewhat closer in the context of institutional injunctions against states \u2018due to federalism concerns,\u2019\u201d the Court of Appeals incorrectly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>reasoned that \u201cfederalism concerns are substantially lessened here, as the state of Arizona and the state Board of Education wish the injunction to remain in place.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1164. This statement is flatly incorrect, as even respondents acknowledge. Brief for Respondent State of Arizona et al. 20-21. Precisely because different state actors have taken contrary positions in this litigation, federalism concerns are elevated. And precisely because federalism concerns are heightened, a flexible approach to Rule 60(b)(5) relief is critical. \u201c[Wjhen the objects of the decree have been attained\u201d \u2014 namely, when EEOA compliance has been achieved \u2014 \u201cresponsibility for discharging the State\u2019s obligations [must be] returned promptly to the State and its officials.\u201d <em>Frew, supra, </em>at 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">In addition to applying a Rule 60(b)(5) standard that was too strict, the Court of Appeals framed a Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry that was too narrow \u2014 one that focused almost exclusively on the sufficiency of incremental funding. In large part, this was driven by the significance the Court of Appeals attributed to petitioners\u2019 failure to appeal the District Court\u2019s original order. The Court of Appeals explained that \u201cthe central idea\u201d of that order was that without sufficient ELL incremental funds, \u201cELL programs would necessarily be inadequate.\u201d 516 F. 3d, at 1167-1168. It felt bound by this conclusion, lest it allow petitioners to \u201creopen matters made final when the Declaratory Judgment was not appealed.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1170. It repeated this refrain throughout its opinion, emphasizing that the \u201c \u2018interest in finality must be given great weight,\u2019\u201d <em>id., </em>at 1163, and explaining that petitioners could not now ask for relief \u201con grounds that could have been raised on appeal from the Declaratory Judgment and from earlier injunctive orders but were not,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 1167. \u201cIf [petitioners] believed that the district court erred and should have looked at all funding sources differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>ently in its EEOA inquiry,\u201d the court wrote, \u201cthey should have appealed the Declaratory Judgment.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1171.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">In attributing such significance to the defendants\u2019 failure to appeal the District Court\u2019s original order, the Court of Appeals turned the risks of institutional reform litigation into reality. By confining the scope of its analysis to that of the original order, it insulated the policies embedded in the order \u2014 specifically, its incremental funding requirement\u2014 from challenge and amendment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But those policies were supported by the very officials who could have appealed them \u2014 the state defendants \u2014 and, as a result, were never subject to true challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Instead of focusing on the failure to appeal, the Court of Appeals should have conducted the type of Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry prescribed in <em>Rufo. </em>This inquiry makes no reference to the presence or absence of a timely appeal. It takes the original judgment as a given and asks only whether \u201ca significant change either in factual conditions or in law\u201d renders continued enforcement of the judgment \u201cdetrimental to the public interest.\u201d <em>Rufo, </em>502 U. S., at 384. It allows a court to recognize that the longer an injunction or consent decree stays in place, the greater the risk that it will improperly interfere with a State\u2019s democratic processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">The Court of Appeals purported to engage in a \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d inquiry, but it asked only whether changed circumstances affected ELL funding and, more specifically, ELL incremental funding. Relief was appropriate, in the court\u2019s view, only if petitioners \u201cdemonstrate[d] either that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>there [we]re no longer incremental costs associated with ELL programs in Arizona or that Arizona\u2019s \u2018base plus incremental costs\u2019 educational funding model was so altered that focusing on ELL-specific incremental costs funding has become irrelevant and inequitable.\u201d 516 F. 3d, at 1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">This was a Rule 60(b)(5) \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d inquiry in name only. In reality, it was an inquiry into whether the deficiency in ELL incremental funding that the District Court identified in 2000 had been remedied. And this, effectively, was an inquiry into whether the original order had been satisfied. Satisfaction of an earlier judgment is <em>one </em>of the enumerated bases for Rule 60(b)(5) relief \u2014 but it is not the only basis for such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Rule 60(b)(5) permits relief from a judgment where \u201c[i] the judgment has been satisfied, released or discharged; [ii] it is based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated; <em>or </em>[iii] applying it prospectively is no longer equitable.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Use of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d makes it clear that each of the provision\u2019s three grounds for relief is independently sufficient and therefore that relief may be warranted even if petitioners have not \u201csatisfied\u201d the original order. As petitioners argue, they may obtain relief if prospective enforcement of that order \u201cis no longer equitable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">To determine the merits of this claim, the Court of Appeals needed to ascertain whether ongoing enforcement of the original order was supported by an ongoing violation of federal law (here, the EEOA). See <em>Milliken, </em>433 U. S., at 282. It failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">As previously noted, the EEOA, while requiring a State to take \u201cappropriate action to overcome language barriers,\u201d 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1703(f), \u201cleave[s] state and local educational authorities a substantial amount of latitude in choosing\u201d how this obligation is met. <em>Castaneda, </em>648 F. 2d, at 1009. Of course, any educational program, including the \u201cappropriate action\u201d mandated by the EEOA, requires funding, but fund<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>ing is simply a means, not the end. By focusing so intensively on Arizona\u2019s incremental ELL funding, the Court of Appeals misapprehended the EEOA\u2019s mandate. And by requiring petitioners to demonstrate \u201cappropriate action\u201d through a particular funding mechanism, the Court of Appeals improperly substituted its own educational and budgetary policy judgments for those of the state and local officials to whom such decisions are properly entrusted. Cf. <em>Jenkins, </em>515 U. S., at 131 (Thomas, J., concurring) (\u201cFederal courts do not possess the capabilities of state and local governments in addressing difficult educational problems\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The underlying District Court opinion reveals similar errors. In an August 2006 remand order, a different Ninth Circuit panel had instructed the District Court to hold an evidentiary hearing \u201cregarding whether changed circumstances required modification of the original court order or otherwise had a bearing on the appropriate remedy.\u201d 204 Fed. Appx., at 582. The Ninth Circuit panel observed that \u201cfederal courts must be sensitive to the need for modification [of permanent injunctive relief] when circumstances change.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">The District Court failed to follow these instructions. Instead of determining whether changed circumstances warranted modification of the original order, the District Court asked only whether petitioners had satisfied the original declaratory judgment order through increased incremental funding. See 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1165 (explaining that a showing of \u201cmere amelioration\u201d of the specific deficiencies noted in the District Court\u2019s original order was \u201cinadequate\u201d and that <em>\u201ccompliance </em>would require a funding system that rationally relates funding available to the actual costs of all elements of ELL instruction\u201d (emphasis added)). The District Court stated: \u201cIt should be noted that the Court finds the same problems today that it saw last year, because HB <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>2064 is the same, the problems themselves are the same.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>at 1161. The District Court thus rested its postremand decision on its preremand analysis of HB 2064. It disregarded the remand instructions to engage in a broad and flexible Rule 60(b)(5) analysis as to whether changed circumstances warranted relief. In taking this approach, the District Court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The dissent defends the narrow approach of the lower courts with four principal conclusions that it draws from the record. All of these conclusions, however, are incorrect and mirror the fundamental error of the lower courts \u2014 a fixation on the issue of incremental funding and a failure to recognize the proper scope of a Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">First, the dissent concludes that \u201cthe Rule 60(b)(5) 'changes' upon which the District Court focused\u201d were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>limited to changes in funding, and included \u201c \u2018changed teaching methods\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018changed administrative systems.\u2019 \u201d <em>Post, </em>at 483. The District Court did note a range of changed circumstances, concluding that as a result of these changes, Nogales was \u201cdoing substantially better.\u201d 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1160. But it neither focused on these changes nor made up-to-date factual findings. To the contrary, the District Court explained that \u201cit would be premature to make an assessment of some of these changes.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Accordingly, of the 28 findings of fact that the court proceeded to make, the first 20 addressed funding directly and exclusively. See <em>id., </em>at 1161-1163. The last eight addressed funding indirectly\u2014 discussing reclassification rates because of their relevance to HB 2064\u2019s funding restrictions for ELL and reclassified students. See <em>id., </em>at 1163-1165. None of the District Court\u2019s findings of fact addressed either \u201c\u2018changed teaching methods\u2019\u201d or \u201c\u2018changed administrative systems.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The dissent\u2019s second conclusion is that \u201c \u2018incremental funding\u2019 costs . . . [were] the basic contested issue at the 2000 trial and the sole basis for the District Court\u2019s finding of a statutory violation.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 483. We fail to see this conclusion\u2019s relevance to this Rule 60(b)(5) motion, where the question is whether any change in factual or legal circumstances renders continued enforcement of the original order inequitable. As the dissent itself acknowledges, petitioners \u201cpointed to three sets of changed circumstances [in their Rule 60(b)(5) motion] which, in their view, showed that the judgment and the related orders were no longer necessary.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 482. In addition to \u201cincreases in the amount of funding available to Arizona school districts,\u201d these included \u201cchanges in the method of English-learning instruction,\u201d and \u201cchanges in the administration of the Nogales school district.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Third, the dissent concludes that \u201cthe type of issue upon which the District Court and Court of Appeals focused\u201d \u2014 the incremental funding issue \u2014 \u201clies at the heart of the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>demand for equal educational opportunity.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 484. In what we interpret to be a restatement of this point, the dissent also concludes that sufficient funding <em>(\u201cthe </em>\u25a0resource\u2019 <em>issue\u201d) </em>and the presence or absence of an EEOA violation <em>(\u201cthe statutory subsection (f) issue\u201d) \u201care one and the same. </em>\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 485 (emphasis in original). \u201cIn focusing upon the one,\u201d the dissent asserts, \u201cthe District Court and Court of Appeals were focusing upon the other.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertion, these two issues are decidedly not <em>\u201cone and the same.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> Ibid. </em>Nor is it the case, as the dissent suggests, that the EEOA targets States\u2019 provision of resources for ELL programming. <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Post, </em>at 484. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>What the statute forbids is a failure to take \u201cappropriate action to overcome language barriers.\u201d 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1703(f). Funding is merely one tool that may be employed to achieve the statutory objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Fourth, the dissent concludes that the District Court did not order increased ELL incremental funding and did not dictate state and local budget priorities. <em>Post, </em>at 486. The dissent\u2019s point \u2014 and it is a very small one \u2014 is that the District Court did not set a specific amount that the legislature was required to appropriate. The District Court did, however, hold the State in contempt and impose heavy fines because the legislature did not provide sufficient funding. These orders unquestionably imposed important restrictions on the legislature\u2019s ability to set budget priorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Because the lower courts \u2014 like the dissent \u2014 misperceived both the nature of the obligation imposed by the EEOA and the breadth of the inquiry called for under Rule 60(b)(5), these cases must be remanded for a proper examination of at least four important factual and legal changes that may warrant the granting of relief from the judgment: the State\u2019s adoption of a new ELL instructional methodology, Congress\u2019 enactment of NCLB, structural and management reforms in Nogales, and increased overall education funding.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">At the time of the District Court\u2019s original declaratory judgment order, ELL instruction in Nogales was based primarily on \u201cbilingual education,\u201d which teaches core content areas in a student\u2019s native language while providing English instruction in separate language classes. In November 2000, Arizona voters passed Proposition 203, which man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>dated statewide implementation of a \u201cstructured English immersion\u201d (SEI) approach. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 08-294, at 369a. Proposition 203 defines this methodology as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">\u201c\u2018Sheltered English immersion\u2019 or \u2018structured English immersion\u2019 means an English language acquisition process for young children in which nearly all classroom instruction is in English but with the curriculum and presentation designed for children who are learning the language. . . . Although teachers may use a minimal amount of the child\u2019s native language when necessary, no subject matter shall be taught in any language other than English, and children in this program learn to read and write solely in English.\u201d Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 15-751(5) (West 2009).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">In HB 2064, the state legislature attended to the successful and uniform implementation of SEI in a variety of ways.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It created an \u201cArizona English language learners task force\u201d within the state department of education to \u201cdevelop and adopt research based models of structured English immersion programs for use by school districts and charter schools.\u201d \u00a715-756.01(0). It required that all school districts and charter schools select one of the adopted SEI models, \u00a7 15-756.02(A), and it created an \u201cOffice of English language acquisition services\u201d to aid school districts in implementation of the models, \u00a715-756.07(1). It also required the state board of education to institute a uniform and mandatory training program for all SEI instructors. \u00a7 15-756.09.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Research on ELL instruction indicates there is documented, academic support for the view that SEI is signifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>cantly more effective than bilingual education.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Findings of the Arizona State Department of Education in 2004 strongly support this conclusion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In light of this, a proper analysis of petitioners\u2019 Rule 60(b)(5) motion should include further factual findings regarding whether Nogales\u2019 implementation of SEI methodology \u2014 completed in all of its schools by 2005 \u2014 constitutes a \u201csignificantly changed circumstance\u201d that warrants relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Congress\u2019 enactment of NCLB represents another potentially significant \u201cchanged circumstance.\u201d NCLB marked a dramatic shift in federal education policy. It reflects Congress\u2019 judgment that the best way to raise the level of education nationwide is by granting state and local officials flexibility to develop and implement educational programs that address local needs, while holding them accountable for the results. NCLB implements this approach by requiring States receiving federal funds to define performance standards and to make regular assessments of progress toward the attainment of those standards. 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 6311(b)(2). NCLB conditions the continued receipt of funds on demonstrations of \u201cadequate yearly progress.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>As relevant here, Title III (which includes the English Language Acquisition, Language Enhancement, and Academic Achievement Act) requires States to ensure that ELL students \u201cattain English proficiency, develop high levels of academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and student academic achievement standards as all children are expected to meet.\u201d \u00a7 6812(1). It requires States to set annual objective achievement goals for the number of students who will annually progress toward proficiency, achieve proficiency, and make \u201cadequate yearly progress\u201d with respect to academic achievement, \u00a7 6842(a), and it holds local schools and agencies accountable for meeting these objectives, \u00a7 6842(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Petitioners argue that through compliance with NCLB, the State has established compliance with the EEOA. They note that when a State adopts a compliance plan under NCLB \u2014 as the State of Arizona has \u2014 it must provide adequate assurances that ELL students will receive assistance \u201cto achieve at high levels in the core academic subjects so that those children can meet the same . . . standards as all children are expected to meet.\u201d \u00a7 6812(2). They argue that when the Federal Department of Education approves a State\u2019s plan \u2014 as it has with respect to Arizona\u2019s \u2014 it offers definitive evidence that the State has taken \u201cappropriate action to overcome language barriers\u201d within the meaning of the EEOA. \u00a7 1703(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The Court of Appeals concluded, and we agree, that because of significant differences in the two statutory schemes, compliance with NCLB will not necessarily constitute \u201cappropriate action\u201d under the EEOA. 516 F. 3d, at 1172-1176. Approval of an NCLB plan does not entail substantive review of a State\u2019s ELL programming or a determination that the programming results in equal educational opportunity for ELL students. See \u00a76823. Moreover, NCLB contains a saving clause, which provides that \u201c[njothing in this part shall be construed in a manner inconsistent with any Federal law guaranteeing a civil right.\u201d \u00a7 6847.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>This does not mean, however, that NCLB is not relevant to petitioners\u2019 Rule 60(b)(5) motion. To the contrary, we think it is probative in four principal ways.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> First, it prompted the State to institute significant structural and programming changes in its delivery of ELL education,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> leading the Court of Appeals to observe that \u201cArizona has significantly improved its ELL infrastructure.\u201d 516 F. 3d, at 1154. These changes should not be discounted in the Rule 60(b)(5) analysis solely because they do not require or result from increased funding. Second, NCLB significantly increased federal funding for education in general and ELL programming in particular.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> These funds should not be disregarded just because they are not state funds. Third, through its assessment and reporting requirements, NCLB <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>provides evidence of the progress and achievement of No-gales\u2019 ELL students.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This evidence could provide persuasive evidence of the current effectiveness of Nogales\u2019 ELL programming.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Fourth and finally, NCLB marks a shift in federal education policy. See Brief for Petitioner Speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives et al. 7-16. NCLB grants States \u201cflexibility\u201d to adopt ELL programs they believe are \u201cmost effective for teaching English.\u201d \u00a76812(9). Reflecting a growing consensus in education research that increased funding alone does not improve student achievement,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>NCLB expressly refrains from dictating funding levels. Instead, it focuses on the demonstrated progress of students through accountability reforms.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The original declaratory judgment order, in contrast, withdraws the authority of state and local officials to fund and implement ELL programs that best suit Nogales\u2019 needs, and measures effective programming solely in terms of adequate incremental funding. This conflict with Congress\u2019 determination of federal policy may constitute a significantly changed circumstance, warranting relief. See <em>Railway Employees </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>364 U. S. 642, 651 (1961) (noting that a court decree should be modified when \u201ca change in law brings [the decree] in conflict with statutory objectives\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Structural and management reforms in Nogales constitute another relevant change in circumstances. These reforms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>were led by Kelt Cooper, the Nogales superintendent from 2000 to 2005, who \u201cadopted policies that ameliorated or eliminated many of the most glaring inadequacies discussed by the district court.\u201d 516 F. 3d, at 1156. Among other things,, Cooper \u201creduce[d] class sizes,\u201d \u201csignificantly improv[ed] student/teacher ratios,\u201d \u201cimproved teacher quality,\u201d \u201cpioneered a uniform system of textbook and curriculum planning,\u201d and \u201clargely eliminated what had been a severe shortage of instructional materials.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1156-1157. The Court of Appeals recognized that by \u201c[u]sing careful financial management and applying for \u2018all funds available,\u2019 Cooper was able to achieve his reforms with limited resources.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1157. But the Court of Appeals missed the legal import of this observation \u2014 that these reforms might have brought Nogales\u2019 ELL programming into compliance with the EEOA even without sufficient ELL incremental funding to satisfy the District Court\u2019s original order. Instead, the Court of Appeals concluded that to credit Cooper\u2019s reforms would \u201cpenaliz[e]\u201d Nogales \u201cfor doing its best to make do, despite Arizona\u2019s failure to comply with the terms of the judgment,\u201d and would \u201cabsolve the state from providing adequate ELL incremental funding as required by the judgment.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1168. The District Court similarly discounted Cooper\u2019s achievements, acknowledging that Nogales was \u201cdoing substantially better than it was in 2000,\u201d but concluding that because the progress resulted from management efforts rather than increased funding, its progress was \u201cfleeting at best.\u201d 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1160.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Entrenched in the framework of incremental funding, both courts refused to consider that Nogales could be taking .\u201cappropriate action\u201d to address language barriers even without having satisfied the original order. This was error. The EEOA seeks to provide \u201cequal educational opportunity\u201d to \u201call children enrolled in public schools.\u201d \u00a7 1701(a). Its ultimate focus is on the quality of educational programming and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>services provided to students, not the amount of money-spent on them. Accordingly, there is no statutory basis for precluding petitioners from showing that Nogales has achieved EEOA-compliant programming by means other than increased funding \u2014 for example, through Cooper\u2019s structural, curricular, and accountability-based reforms. The weight of research suggests that these types of local reforms, much more than court-imposed funding mandates, lead to improved educational opportunities.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Cooper even testified that, without the structural changes he imposed, \u201cadditional money\u201d would not \u201chave made any difference to th[e] students\u201d in Nogales. Addendum to Reply Brief for Petitioner Speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives et al. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The Court of Appeals discounted Cooper\u2019s reforms for other reasons as well. It explained that while they \u201cdid ameliorate many of the specific examples of resource shortages that the district court identified in 2000,\u201d they did not \u201cresult in such success as to call into serious question [No-gales\u2019] need for increased incremental funds.\u201d 516 F. 3d, at 1169. Among other things, the Court of Appeals referred to \u201cthe persistent achievement gaps documented in [Nogales\u2019] AIMS test data\u201d between ELL students and native speakers, <em>id, </em>at 1170, but any such comparison must take into account other variables that may explain the gap. In any event, the EEOA requires \u201cappropriate action\u201d to remove language barriers, \u00a7 1703(f), not the equalization of results between native and nonnative speakers on tests administered in English \u2014 a worthy goal, to be sure, but one that may be exceedingly difficult to achieve, especially for older ELL students.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>The Court of Appeals also referred to the subpar performance of Nogales\u2019 high schools. There is no doubt that No-gales\u2019 high schools represent an area of weakness, but the District Court made insufficient factual findings to support a conclusion that the high schools\u2019 problems stem from a failure to take \u201cappropriate action,\u201d and constitute a violation of the EEOA.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The EEOA\u2019s \u201cappropriate action\u201d requirement grants States broad latitude to design, fund, and implement ELL programs that suit local needs and account for local conditions. A proper Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry should recognize this and should ask whether, as a result of structural and managerial improvements, Nogales is now providing equal educational opportunities to ELL students.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">4</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">A fourth potentially important change is an overall increase in the education funding available in Nogales. The original declaratory judgment order noted five sources of funding that collectively financed education in the State: (1) the State\u2019s \u201cbase level\u201d funding, (2) ELL incremental funding, (3) federal grants, (4) regular district and county taxes, and (5) special voter-approved district and county taxes called \u201coverrides.\u201d 172 F. Supp. 2d, at 1227. All five sources have notably increased since 2000.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Nbtwithstand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>ing these increases, the Court of Appeals rejected petitioners\u2019 claim that overall education funds were sufficient to support EEOA-compliant programming in Nogales. The court reasoned that diverting base-level education funds would necessarily hurt other state educational programs, and was not, therefore, an \u201c\u2018appropriate\u2019 step.\u201d 516 F. 3d, at 1171. In so doing, it foreclosed the possibility that petitioners could establish changed circumstances warranting relief through an overall increase in education funding available in Nogales.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">This was clear legal error. As we have noted, the EEOA\u2019s \u201cappropriate action\u201d requirement does not necessarily require any particular level of funding, and to the extent that funding is relevant, the EEOA certainly does not require that the money come from any particular source. In addition, the EEOA plainly does not give the federal courts the authority to judge whether a State or a school district is providing \u201cappropriate\u201d instruction in other subjects. That remains the province of the States and the local schools. It is unfortunate if a school, in order to fund ELL programs, must divert money from other worthwhile programs, but such decisions fall outside the scope of the EEOA. Accordingly, the analysis of petitioners\u2019 Rule 60(b)(5) motion should evaluate whether the State\u2019s budget for general education funding, in addition to any local revenues,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> is currently supporting EEOA-compliant ELL programming in Nogales.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Because the lower courts engaged in an inadequate Rule 60(b)(5) analysis, and because the District Court failed to make up-to-date factual findings, the analysis of the lower <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>courts was incomplete and inadequate with respect to all of the changed circumstances just noted. These changes are critical to a proper Rule 60(b)(5) analysis, however, as they may establish that Nogales is no longer in violation of the EEOA and, to the contrary, is taking \u201cappropriate action\u201d to remove language barriers in its schools. If this is the case, continued enforcement of the District Court\u2019s original order is inequitable within the meaning of Rule 60(b)(5), and relief is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">We turn, finally, to the District Court\u2019s entry of statewide relief.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The Nogales district, which is situated along the Mexican border, is one of 239 school districts in the State of Arizona. Nogales students make up about one-half of 1 percent of the entire State\u2019s school population.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The record contains no factual findings or evidence that any school district other than Nogales failed (much less continues to fail) to provide equal educational opportunities to ELL students. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 08-294, at 177a-l78a. Nor have respondents explained how the EEOA could justify a statewide injunction when the only violation claimed or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>proved was limited to a single district. See <em>Jenkins, </em>515 U. S., at 89-90; <em>Milliken, </em>433 U. S., at 280. It is not even clear that the District Court had jurisdiction to issue a statewide injunction when it is not apparent that plaintiffs \u2014 a class of Nogales students and their parents \u2014 had standing to seek such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The only , explanation proffered for the entry of statewide relief was based on an interpretation of the Arizona Constitution. We are told that the former attorney general \u201caffirmatively urged a statewide remedy because a \u2018Nogales only\u2019 remedy would run afoul of the Arizona Constitution\u2019s requirement of \u2018a general and uniform public school system.\u2019\u201d Brief for Respondent Flores et al. 38 (quoting Ariz. Const., Art. 11, \u00a7 1(A); some internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">This concern did not provide a valid basis for a statewide <em>federal </em>injunction. If the state attorney general believed that a federal injunction requiring increased ELL spending in one district necessitated, as a matter of state law, a similar increase in every other district in the State, the attorney general could have taken the matter to the state legislature or the state courts. But the attorney general did not do so. Even if she had, it is not clear what the result would have been. It is a question of state law, to be determined by state authorities, whether the equal funding provision of the Arizona Constitution would require a statewide funding increase to match Nogales\u2019 ELL funding, or would leave Nogales as a federally compelled exception. By failing to recognize this, and by entering a statewide injunction that intruded deeply into the State\u2019s budgetary processes based solely on the attorney general\u2019s interpretation of state law, the District Court obscured accountability for the drastic remedy that it entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">When it is unclear whether an onerous obligation is the work of the Federal or State Government, accountability is diminished. See <em>New York </em>v. <em>United States</em>, 505 U. S. 144, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>169 (1992). Here, the District Court \u201cimproperly prevented] the citizens of the State from addressing the issue [of statewide relief] through the processes provided by the State\u2019s constitution.\u201d <em>Hawaii </em>v. <em>Office of Hawaiian Affairs, </em>556 U. S. 163, 176-177 (2009). Assuming that petitioners, on remand, press their objection to the statewide extension of the remedy, the District Court should vacate the injunction insofar as it extends beyond Nogales unless the court concludes that Arizona is violating the EEOA on a statewide basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">There is no question that the goal of the EEOA \u2014 overcoming language barriers \u2014 is a vitally important one, and our decision will not in any way undermine efforts to achieve that goal. If petitioners are ultimately granted relief from the judgment, it will be because they have shown that the Nogales School District is doing exactly what this statute requires \u2014 taking \u201cappropriate action\u201d to teach English to students who grew up speaking another language.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the cases for the District Court to determine whether, in accordance with the standards set out in this opinion, petitioners should be granted relief from the judgment. .</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b488-9\"> We have previously held that Congress may validly abrogate the States\u2019 sovereign immunity only by doing so (1) unequivocally and (2) pursuant to certain valid grants of constitutional authority. See, <em>e. g., Kimel </em>v. <em>Florida Bd. of Regents, </em>528 U. S. 62, 73 (2000). With respect to the second requirement, we have held that statutes enacted pursuant to \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment must provide a remedy that is \u201ccongruent and proportional\u201d to the injury that Congress intended to address. See <em>City of Boerne </em>v. <em>Flores, </em>521 U. S. 507, 520 (1997). Prior to <em>City of Boerne, </em>the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the EEOA, which was enacted pursuant to \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, see 20 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1702(a)(1), (b), validly abrogates the States\u2019 sovereign immunity. See <em>Los Angeles Branch NAACP </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Unified School Dish, </em>714 F. 2d 946, 950-951 (1983); see also <em>Flores </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>516 F. 3d 1140, 1146, n. 2 (CA9 2008) (relying on <em>Los Angeles NAACP). </em>That issue is not before us in these cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b494-7\"> We do not agree with the conclusion of the Court of Appeals that \u201cthe Superintendent\u2019s standing is limited\u201d to seeking vacatur of the District Court\u2019s orders \u201conly as they run against him.\u201d 516 F. 3d, at 1165. Had the superintendent sought relief based on satisfaction of the judgment, the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion might have been correct. But as discussed infra, at 453, petitioners\u2019 Rule 60(b)(5) claim is not based on satisfaction of the judgment. Their claim is that continued enforcement of the District Court\u2019s orders would be inequitable. This claim implicates the orders in their entirety, and not solely as they run against the superintendent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b495-9\"> The dissent is quite wrong in contending that these are not institutional reform eases because they involve a statutory, rather than a constitutional, claim and because the orders of the District Court do not micromanage the day-to-day operation of the schools. <em>Post, </em>at 496 (opinion of Breyer, J.). For nearly a decade, the orders of a Federal District Court have substantially restricted the ability of the State of Arizona to make basic decisions regarding educational policy, appropriations, and budget priorities. The record strongly suggests that some state officials have welcomed the involvement of the federal court as a means of achieving appropriations objectives that could not be achieved through the ordinary democratic process. See <em>supra, </em>at 443. Because of these features, these cases implicate all of the unique features and risks of institutional reform litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b499-8\"> The dissent conveniently dismisses the Court of Appeals\u2019 statements by characterizing any error that exists as \u201cone of tone, not of law,\u201d and by characterizing our discussion as reading them out of context. <em>Post, </em>at 510-511. But we do read these statements in context \u2014 in the context of the Court of Appeals\u2019 overall treatment of petitioners\u2019 Rule 60(b)(5) arguments \u2014 and it is apparent that they accurately reflect the Court of Appeals\u2019 excessively narrow understanding of the role of Rule 60(b)(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b501-8\"> This does not mean, as the dissent misleadingly suggests, see <em>post, </em>at 492-493, that we are faulting the Court of Appeals for declining to decide whether the District Court\u2019s original order was correct in the first place. On the contrary, as we state explicitly in the paragraph following this statement, our criticism is that the Court of Appeals did not engage in the changed-circumstances inquiry prescribed by <em>Rufo </em>v. <em>Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, </em>502 U. S. 367 (1992). By focusing excessively on the issue of incremental funding, the Court of Appeals was not true to the <em>Rufo </em>standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b504-8\"> In addition to concluding that the law\u2019s increase in incremental funding was insufficient and that 2-year cutoff was irrational, both the District Court and the Court of Appeals held that HB 2064\u2019s funding mechanism violates NCLB, which provides in relevant part: \u201cA State shall not take into consideration payments under this chapter ... in determining the eligibility of any local educational agency in that State for State aid, or the amount of State aid, with respect to free public education of children.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a77902. See 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1166 (HB 2064\u2019s funding mechanism is \u201cabsolutely forbidden\u201d by \u00a7 7902); 516 F. 3d, at 1178 (\u201cHB 2064 . .. violates [\u00a7 7902] on its face\u201d). Whether or not HB 2064 violates \u00a7 7902, see Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>31-32, and n. 8 (suggesting it does), neither court below was empowered to decide the issue. As the Court of Appeals itself recognized, NCLB does not provide a private right of action. See 516 F. 3d, at 1175. \u201cWithout [statutory intent], a cause of action does not exist and courts may not create one, no matter how desirable that might be as a policy matter, or how compatible with the statute.\u201d <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Sandoval, </em>532 U. S. 275, 286-287 (2001). Thus, NCLB is enforceable only by the agency charged with administering it. See <em>id., </em>at 289-290; see also App. to Brief for Respondent State of Arizona et al. 1-4 (letter from U. S. Department of Education to petitioner superintendent concerning the legality <em>vel non </em>of HB 2064).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b506-6\"> The extent to which the dissent repeats the errors of the courts below is evident in its statement that \u201c[t]he question here is whether the State has shown that its <em>new funding program </em>amounts to a \u2018change\u2019 that satisfies subsection (f)\u2019s requirement.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 510 (emphasis added). The proper inquiry is not limited to the issue of funding. Rather, it encompasses the question whether the State has shown any factual or legal changes that establish compliance with the EEOA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b506-7\"> The dissent cites two sources for this proposition. The <em>first </em>\u2014 Cas<em>taneda </em>v. <em>Pickard, </em>648 F. 2d 989 (CA5 1981) \u2014 sets out a three-part test for \u201cappropriate action.\u201d Under that test, a State must (1) formulate a sound English language instruction educational plan, (2) implement that plan, and (3) achieve adequate results. See <em>id., </em>at 1009-1010. Whether or not this test provides much concrete guidance regarding the meaning of \u201cappropriate action,\u201d the test does not focus on incremental funding or on the provision of resources more generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">The second source cited by the dissent \u2014 curiously\u2014is a speech given by President Nixon in which he urged prompt action by Congress on legislation imposing a moratorium on new busing orders and on the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1972. See <em>post, </em>at 484 (citing Address to the Nation on Equal Educational Opportunity and Busing, 8 Weekly Comp, of Pres. Doc. 590, 591 (1972)). In the speech, President Nixon said that schools in poor neighborhoods should receive the \u201cfinancial support . . . that we know can make all the difference.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 593. It is likely that this statement had nothing to do with the interpretation of the EEOA\u2019s \u201cappropriate action\u201d requirement and instead referred to his proposal to \u201cdirec[t] over $2\u00bd billion in the next year mainly towards improving the education of children from poor families.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 591. But in any event, this general statement, made in a Presidential speech two years prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>to the enactment of the EEOA, surely sheds little light on the proper interpretation of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b508-8\"> By focusing on the adequacy of HB 2064\u2019s funding provisions, the courts below neglected to address adequately the potential relevance of these programming provisions, which became effective immediately upon enactment of the law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b509-7\"> See Brief for American Unity Legal Defense Fund et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>10-12 (citing sources, including New York City Board of Education, Educational Progress of Students in Bilingual and ESL Programs: a Longitudinal Study, 1990-1994 (1994); 2 K.

We do not think the District Court made sufficient factual findings to support its conclusions about the effectiveness of Nogales\u2019 ELL programming, and we question the Court of Appeals\u2019 interpretation of the data for three reasons. First, as the Court of Appeals recognized, the absence of longitudinal data in the record precludes useful comparisons. See <em>id., </em>at 1155.

The judgment held that the State of Arizona\u2019s plan for funding its English Language Learner program was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>arbitrary, and therefore the State had failed to take \u201cappropriate action to overcome language barriers that impede equal participation by its\u201d Spanish-speaking public school students \u201cin its instructional programs.\u201d 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1703(f); <em>Castaneda </em>v. <em>Pickard, </em>648 F. 2d 989, 1010 (CA5 1981) (interpreting \u201cappropriate action\u201d to include the provision of \u201cnecessary\u201d financial and other \u201cresources\u201d). The moving parties argued that \u201csignificant change[s] either in factual conditions or in law,\u201d <em>Rufo </em>v. <em>Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, </em>502 U. S. 367, 384 (1992), entitled them to relief. The State of Arizona, the Arizona Board of Education, and the original plaintiffs in the case (representing students from Nogales, Arizona) opposed the superintendent\u2019s Rule 60(b)(5) motion. They are respondents here.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The District Court, after taking evidence and holding eight days of hearings, considered all the changed circumstances that the parties called to its attention. The court concluded that some relevant \u201cchanges\u201d had taken place. But the court ultimately found those changes insufficient to warrant setting aside the original judgment. The Court of Appeals, in a carefully reasoned 41-page opinion, affirmed that district court determination. This Court now sets the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision aside. And it does so, it says, because \u201cthe lower courts focused excessively on the narrow question of the adequacy of the State\u2019s incremental funding for [English-learning] instruction instead of <em>fairly considering </em>the broader question, whether, as a result of important changes during the intervening years, the State was fulfilling its obligation\u201d under the Act \u201cby other means.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 439 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The Court reaches its ultimate conclusion \u2014 that the lower courts did not <em>\u201cfairly consider\u201d </em>the changed circumstances\u2014 in a complicated way. It begins by placing these cases in a category it calls \u201cinstitutional reform litigation.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 447. It then sets forth special \u201cinstitutional reform litigation\u201d standards applicable when courts are asked to modify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>judgments and decrees entered in such cases. It applies those standards, and finds that the lower courts committed error.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">I disagree with the Court for several reasons. For one thing, the \u201cinstitutional reform\u201d label does not easily fit these cases. For another, the review standards the Court enunciates for \u201cinstitutional reform\u201d cases are incomplete and, insofar as the Court applies those standards here, they effectively distort Rule 60(b)(5)\u2019s objectives. Finally, my own review of the record convinces me that the Court is wrong regardless. <em>The lower courts did \u201cfairly consider\u201d every change in circumstances that the parties called to their attention. </em>The record more than adequately supports this conclusion. In a word, I fear that the Court misapplies an inappropriate procedural framework, reaching a result that neither the record nor the law adequately supports. In doing so, it risks denying schoolchildren the English-learning instruction necessary \u201cto overcome language barriers that impede\u201d their \u201cequal participation.\u201d 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1703(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">To understand my disagreement with the Court, it is unfortunately necessary to examine the record at length and in detail. I must initially focus upon the Court\u2019s basic criticism of the lower courts\u2019 analysis, namely, that the lower courts somehow lost sight of the forest for the trees. In the majority\u2019s view, those courts \u2014 as well as this dissent \u2014 wrongly focused upon a subsidiary matter, \u201cincremental\u201d English-learning program \u201cfunding,\u201d rather than the basic matter, whether \u201cchanges\u201d had cured, or had come close to curing, the violation of federal law that underlay the original judgment. <em>Ante, </em>at 439. In the Court\u2019s view, it is as if a district court, faced with a motion to dissolve a school desegregation decree, focused only upon the school district\u2019s failure to pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>chase 50 decree-required school buses, instead of discussing the basic question, whether the schools had become integrated without need for those 50 buses.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Thus the Court writes that the lower courts focused so heavily on the original decree\u2019s \u201cincremental funding\u201d requirement that they failed to ask whether \u201cthe State was fillfilling its obligation under\u201d federal law \u201cby other means.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>And the Court frequently criticizes the Court of Appeals for having \u201cfocused almost exclusively on the sufficiency of incremental funding,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 452; for \u201cconfining the scope of its analysis to\u201d the \u201cincremental funding requirement,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 453; for having \u201casked only whether changed circumstances affected [English-learning] funding and, more specifically . . . incremental funding,\u201d <em>ibid.; </em>for inquiring only \u201cinto whether the deficiency in ... incremental funding that the District Court identified in 2000 had been remedied,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 454; and (in case the reader has not yet gotten the point) for \u201cfocusing so intensively on Arizona\u2019s incremental... funding,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 455. The Court adds that the District Court too was wrong to have \u201casked only whether petitioners had satisfied the original declaratory judgment order through increased incremental funding.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The problem with this basic criticism is that the State\u2019s provision of adequate resources to its English-learning students, <em>i. e., </em>what the Court refers to as \u201cincremental funding,\u201d has always been the basic contested issue in these cases. That is why the lower courts continuously focused attention directly upon it. In the context of these cases they looked directly at the forest, not the trees. To return to the school desegregation example, the court focused upon the heart of the matter, the degree of integration, and not upon the number of buses the school district had purchased. A description of the statutory context and the history of these eases makes clear that the Court cannot sensibly drive a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>wedge (as it wishes to do) between what it calls the \u201cincremental funding\u201d issue and the uncured failure to comply with the requirements of federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The lawsuit filed in these cases charged a violation of subsection (f) of \u00a7204 of the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974, 88 Stat. 515, 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1703(f). Subsection (f) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">\u201cNo State shall deny equal educational opportunity to an individual on account of his or her race, color, sex, or national origin by\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">\u201c(f) the failure by an educational agency to take appropriate action to overcome language barriers that impede equal participation by its students in its instructional programs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">The provision is part of a broader Act that embodies principles that President Nixon set forth in 1972, when he called upon the Nation to provide \u201cequal educational opportunity to every person,\u201d including the many \u201cpoor\u201d and minority children long \u201cdoomed to inferior education\u201d as well as those <em>\u201cwho start their education under language handicaps.\u201d </em>See Address to the Nation on Equal Educational Opportunity and Busing, 8 Weekly Comp, of Pres. Doc. 590, 591 (emphasis added) (hereinafter Nixon Address).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">In 1974, this Court wrote that to provide all students \u201cwith the same facilities, textbooks, teachers, and curriculum\u201d will \u201ceffectively <em>foreclos[eJ\u201d those \u201cstudents who do not understand English . . . from any meaningful education,\u201d </em>making a \u201cmockery of public education.\u201d <em>Lau. </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>414 U. S. 563, 566 (emphasis added). The same year Congress, reflecting these concerns, enacted subsection (f) of the Act \u2014 a subsection that seeks to \u201cremove language ... barri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>ers\u201d that impede \u201ctrue equality of educational opportunity.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 92-1335, p. 6 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">In 1981, in <em>Castaneda </em>v. <em>Pickard, </em>648 F. 2d 989, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit interpreted subsection (f). It sought to construe the statutory word \u201cappropriate\u201d so as to recognize both the obligation to take account of \u201cthe need of limited English speaking children for language assistance\u201d and the fact that the \u201cgovernance\u201d of primary and secondary education ordinarily \u201cis properly reserved to . . . state and local educational agencies.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1008, 1009.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The court concluded that a court applying subsection (f) should engage in three inquiries. <em>First, </em>the court should \u201cascertain\u201d whether the school system, in respect to students who are not yet proficient in English, \u201cis pursuing\u201d an English-learning program that is \u201cinformed by an educational theory recognized as sound by some experts in the field or, at least, deemed a legitimate experimental strategy.\u201d <em>Ibid. Second, </em>that court should determine \u201cwhether the programs and practices actually used by [the] school system are reasonably calculated to implement effectively the educational theory adopted by the school,\u201d which is to say that the school system must <em>\u201cfollow through with practices, resources and personnel necessary to transform\u201d </em>its chosen educational theory <em>\u201cinto reality.\u201d Id., </em>at 1010 (emphasis added). <em>Third, </em>if practices, resources, and personnel are adequate, the court should go on to ascertain whether there is some indication that the programs produce \u201cresults,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>that \u201cthe language barriers confronting students are actually being overcome.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Courts in other Circuits have followed <em>Castaneda\u2019s </em>approach. See, <em>e. g., Gomez </em>v. <em>Illinois State Bd. of Educ., </em>811 F. 2d 1030, 1041 (CA7 1987); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>680 F. 2d 356, 371 (CA5 1982); <em>Valeria G. </em>v. <em>Wilson, 12 </em>F. Supp. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>1007, 1017-1018 (ND Cal. 1998). No Circuit has denied its validity. And no party in these cases contests the District Court\u2019s decision to use Castaneda\u2019s three-part standard in these cases before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The plaintiffs in these cases are a class of English language learner students, <em>i. e., </em>students with limited proficiency in English, who are enrolled in the school district in Nogales, a small city along the Mexican border in Arizona in which the vast majority of students come from homes where Spanish is the primary language. In 1992, they filed the present lawsuit against the State of Arizona, its board of education, and the superintendent, claiming that the State had violated subsection (f), not by failing to adopt proper English-learning programs, but by failing \u201cto provide <em>financial and other resources </em>necessary\u201d to make those programs a practical reality for Spanish-speaking students. App. 7, \u00b620 (emphasis added); see <em>Castaneda, supra, </em>at 1010 (second, <em>i. e., </em>\u201cresource,\u201d requirement). In particular, they said, \u201c[t]he cost\u201d of programs that would allow those students to learn effectively, say, to read English at a proficient level, \u201cfar exceeds the only financial assistance the State theoretically provides.\u201d App. 7, \u00b6 20(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">The students sought a declaration that the State had \u201csystematically . . . failed or refused to provide fiscal as well as other resources sufficient to enable\u201d the Nogales Unified School District and other \u201csimilarly situated [school] districts\u201d to \u201cestablish and maintain\u201d successful programs for English learners. <em>Id., </em>at 10, \u00b6 28. And they sought an appropriate injunction requiring the provision of such resources. The state defendants answered the complaint. And after resolving disagreements on various subsidiary issues, see <em>id., </em>at 19-30, the parties proceeded to trial on the remaining disputed issue in the case, namely, whether the State and its education authorities <em>\u201cadequately fund and oversee\u201d </em>their English-learning program. <em>Flores </em>v. <em>Ari</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number><em>zona, </em>172 F. Supp. 2d 1225, 1226 (Ariz. 2000) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">In January 2000, after a 3-day bench trial, the District Court made 64 specific factual findings, including the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">(1) The State assumes that its school districts need (and will obtain from local and statewide sources) funding equal to a designated \u201cbase level amount\u201d per child \u2014 reflecting the funding required to educate a \u201ctypical\u201d student, <em>Flores </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>516 F. 3d 1140, 1147 (CA9 2008) \u2014 along with an additional amount needed to educate each child with special educational needs, including those children who are not yet proficient in English. 172 F. Supp. 2d, at 1227-1228.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">(2) In the year 2000, the \u201cbase level amount\u201d the State assumed necessary to educate a typical child amounted to roughly $3,174 (in year 2000 dollars). <em>Id., </em>at 1227.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">(3) A cost study conducted by the State in 1988 showed that, at that time, English-learning programming cost school districts an additional $424 per English-learning child. <em>Id., </em>at 1228. Adjusted for inflation to the year 2000, the extra cost per student of the State\u2019s English-learning program was $617 per English-learning child.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">(4) In the year 2000, the State\u2019s funding formula provided school districts with only $150 to pay for the $617 in extra costs per child that the State assumed were needed to pay for its English-learning program. <em>Id., </em>at 1229.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">The record contains no suggestion that Nogales, or any other school district, could readily turn anywhere but to the State to find the $467 per-student difference between the amount the State assumed was needed and the amount that it made available. See <em>id., </em>at 1230. Nor does the record contain any suggestion that Nogales or any other school district could have covered additional costs by redistributing \u201cbase level,\u201d typical-child funding it received. (In the year 2000, Arizona, compared with other States, provided the third-lowest amount of funding per child. U. S.

Supp. 2d, at 1239. The court added that the State\u2019s provision of financial resources was \u201cnot reasonably calculated to effectively implement\u201d the English-learning program chosen by the State. <em>Ibid. </em>Hence, the State had failed to take \u201cappropriate action\u201d to teach English to non-English-speaking students, in that it had failed (in Castaneda\u2019s words) to provide the \u201cpractices, resources, and personnel\u201d necessary to make its chosen educational theory a \u201creality.\u201d 172 F. Supp. 2d, at 1238-1239; see also \u00a7 1703(f); <em>Castaneda, </em>648 F. 2d, at 1010.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The District Court consequently entered judgment in the students\u2019 favor. The court later entered injunctions (1) requiring the State to \u201cprepare a cost study to establish the proper appropriation to effectively implement\u201d the State\u2019s own English-learning program, and (2) requiring the State to develop a funding mechanism that would bear <em>some \u201creasonably]\u201d </em>or <em>\u201crational </em>relatio[n] to the actual funding needed\u201d to ensure that non-English-speaking students would \u201cachieve mastery\u201d of the English language. See, <em>e. g., Flores </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>160 F. Supp. 2d 1043, 1045, 1047 (Ariz. 2000); No. CV-92-596-TUCACM, 2001 WL 1028369, *2 (D. Ariz., June 25, 2001) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">The State neither appealed nor complied with the 2000 declaratory judgment or any of the injunctive orders. When, during the next few years, the State failed to produce either a study of the type ordered or a funding program rationally related to need for financial resources, the court imposed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>series of fines upon the State designed to lead the State to comply with its orders. <em>Flores </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>405 F.

The bill would also increase the appropriation for teaching English to students who needed to learn it (though it prohibited the spending of any increase upon any particular student for more than two years). In March 2006, the petitioners here (the Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction, the President of Arizona\u2019s Senate, and the Speaker of its House of Representatives) asked the District Court (1) to consider whether HB 2064, as enacted, would satisfy its judgment and injunctive orders, (2) to forgive the contempt fine liability that the State had accrued, and (3) to dissolve the injunctive orders and grant relief from the 2000 judgment.

No. 422, pp. 1-2 (hereinafter Motion To Purge).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The dissolution request, brought under Rule 60(b)(5), sought relief in light of changed circumstances. <em>The \u201csignificant changed circumstances\u201d identified amounted to changes in the very circumstances that underlay the initial finding of violation, namely, Arizona\u2019s funding-based failure to provide adequate English-learning educational resources. </em>The moving parties asserted that \u201cArizona has poured money\u201d into Nogales as a result of various funding changes, <em>id, </em>at 5. They pointed to a 0.6% addition to the state sales tax; to the dedication of a portion of the State\u2019s share of Indian gaming proceeds to Arizona school districts; to the increase in federal funding since 2001; and to HB 2064\u2019s increase in state-provided funding. <em>Id, </em>at 5-8. The parties said that, in light of these \u201cdramatic\u201d additions to the funding available for education in Arizona, the court should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>\u201cdeclare the judgment and orders satisfied, and ... relieve defendants from the judgment and orders under Rule 60(b)(5).\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">In April 2006, the District Court held that HB 2064 by itself did not adequately satisfy the court\u2019s orders; it denied the request to forgive the fines; but it did not decide the petitioners\u2019 Rule 60(b)(5) motion. In August 2006, the Court of Appeals ordered the District Court to decide that motion, and, in particular, to consider whether changes to \u201cthe landscape of educational funding ... required modification of the original court order or otherwise had a bearing on the appropriate remedy.\u201d <em>Flores </em>v. <em>Rzeslawski, </em>204 Fed. Appx. 580, 582 (CA9 2006) (memorandum).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">In January 2007, the District Court held a hearing that lasted eight days and produced an evidentiary transcript of 1,684 pages. The hearing focused on the changes that the petitioners said had occurred and justified setting aside the original judgment. The petitioners pointed to three sets of changed circumstances \u2014 all related to \u201cpractices, resources, and personnel\u201d \u2014 which, in their view, showed that the judgment and the related orders were no longer necessary. They argued that the changes had brought the State into compliance with the Act\u2019s requirements. The three sets of changes consisted of (1) increases in the amount of funding available to Arizona school districts; (2) changes in the method of English-learning instruction; and (3) changes in the administration of . the Nogales school district. These changes, the petitioners said, had cured the resource-linked deficiencies that were noted in the District Court\u2019s 2000 judgment, 172 F. Supp. 2d, at 1239, and rendered enforcement of the judgment and related orders unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Based on the hearing and the briefs, the District Court again found that HB 2064 by itself did not cure the \u201cresource\u201d problem; it found that all of the changes, resource-related and otherwise, including the new teaching and administrative methods, taken together, were not sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>to warrant setting aside the judgment or the injunctive orders; and it denied the Rule 60(b)(5) motion for relief. <em>Flores </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>480 F. Supp. 2d 1157, 1164-1167 (Ariz. 2007). The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court\u2019s conclusions, setting forth its reasons, as I have said, in a lengthy and detailed opinion. The state superintendent, along with the Speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives and the President of the Arizona Senate, sought certiorari, and we granted the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Five conclusions follow from the description of these cases I have just set forth. First, the Rule 60(b)(5) \u201cchanges\u201d upon which the District Court focused included the \u201cchanged teaching methods\u201d and the \u201cchanged administrative systems\u201d that the Court criticizes the District Court for ignoring. Compare <em>ante, </em>at 459-461, 465-467, with Parts III-A, III-C, <em>infra. </em>Those changes were, in the petitioners\u2019 view, related to the \u201cfunding\u201d issue, for those changes reduced the need for increased funding. See Motion To Purge 7. I concede that the majority of the District Court\u2019s factual findings focused on funding, see <em>ante, </em>at 455-456. But where is the <em>legal error, </em>given that the opinion clearly shows that the District Court considered, \u201cTocus[ed]\u2019\u201d upon, and wrote about <em>all </em>the matters the petitioners raised? <em>Ante, </em>at 456-457; 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1160-1161.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Second, the District Court and the Court of Appeals focused more heavily upon \u201cincremental funding\u201d costs, see <em>ante, </em>at 452-456, for the <em>reason </em>that the State\u2019s provision for those <em>costs </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>its provision of the resources necessary to run an adequate English-learning program \u2014 was the basic contested issue at the 2000 trial and the sole basis for the District Court\u2019s finding of a statutory violation. 172 F. Supp. 2d, at 1226. That is, the sole subsection (f) dispute in the cases originally was whether the State provides the \u201cpractices, resources and personnel necessary\u201d to implement its English-learning program. <em>Castaneda, </em>648 F. 2d, at 1010. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>To be sure, as the Court points out, changes other than to the State\u2019s funding system could demonstrate that Nogales was receiving the necessary resources. See, <em>e. g., ante, </em>at 459-461. But given the centrality of \u201cresources\u201d to these cases, it is hardly surprising that the courts below scrutinized the State\u2019s provision of \u201cincremental funding,\u201d <em>but without ignoring </em>the other related changes to which the petitioners pointed, such as changes in teaching methods and administration (all of which the District Court rejected as insufficient). See Part III, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Third, the type of issue upon which the District Court and Court of Appeals focused lies at the heart of the statutory demand for equal educational opportunity. A State\u2019s failure to provide the \u201cpractices, resources and personnel necessary\u201d to eliminate the educational burden that accompanies a child\u2019s inability to speak English is precisely what the statute forbids. See <em>Castaneda, supra, </em>at 1010 (emphasizing the importance of providing \u201cresources\u201d); Nixon Address 593 (referring to the importance of providing \u201cfinancial support\u201d). And no one in these cases suggests there is no need for those resources, <em>e. g., </em>that there are no extra costs associated with English-learning education irrespective of the teaching method used. English-learning students, after all, not only require the instruction in \u201cacademic content areas\u201d like math and science that \u201ctypical\u201d students require, but they also need to increase their proficiency in speaking, reading, and writing English. This language-acquisition instruction requires particular textbooks and other instructional materials, teachers trained in the school\u2019s chosen method for teaching English, special assessment tests, and tutoring and other individualized instruction \u2014 all of which resources cost money. Brief for Tucson Unified School District et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>10-13; Structured English Immersion Models of the Arizona English Language Learners Task Force, http://www.ade.state.az.us/ELLTaskForce/2008/SEIModels 05-14-08.pdf (describing Arizona\u2019s requirement that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>English-learning students receive four hours of language-acquisition instruction per day from specially trained teachers using designated English-learning materials); Imazeki, Assessing the Costs of Adequacy in California Public Schools, 3 Educ. Fin. &amp; Pol\u2019y 90, 100 (2008) (estimating that English-learning students require 74% more resources than typical students). That is why the petitioners, opposed as they are to the District Court\u2019s judgment and orders, admitted to the District Court that English learners \u201cneed extra help and that costs extra money.\u201d See 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1161.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Fourth, <em>the </em>\u201cresource\u201d <em>issue </em>that the District Court focused upon when it decided the Rule 60(b)(5) motion and <em>the statutory subsection (f) issue </em>that lies at the heart of the court\u2019s original judgment (and the plaintiffs\u2019 original complaint) are not <em>different </em>issues, as the Court claims. See <em>ante, </em>at 457-459. Rather, in all essential respects <em>they are one and the same issue. </em>In focusing upon the one, the District Court and Court of Appeals were focusing upon the other. For all practical purposes, changes that would have proved sufficient to show the statutory violation cured would have proved sufficient to warrant setting aside the original judgment and decrees, and vice versa. And in context, judges and parties alike were fully aware of the modification/ violation relationship. See, <em>e. g., </em>Intervenor-Defendants\u2019 Closing Argument Memorandum, No. CV-92-596-TUC-RCC (D. Ariz., Mar. 13,2007), Dkt. No. 631, p. 1 (arguing that factual changes had led to \u201csatisfaction]\u201d of the judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">To say, as the Court does, that \u201c[f]unding is merely one tool that may be employed to achieve the statutory objective,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 459, while true, is beside the point. Of course, a State might violate the Act in other ways. But one way in which a State can violate the Act is to fail to provide necessary \u201cpractices, resources and personnel.\u201d And that is the way the District Court found that the State had violated the Act here. Thus, whatever might be true of some other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>case, in these cases the failure to provide adequate resources and the underlying subsection (f) violation were one and the same thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Fifth, the Court is wrong when it suggests that the District Court ordered \u201cincreased incremental funding,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 455; when it faults the District Court for effectively \u201cdictating state or local budget priorities,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 448; when it claims that state officials welcomed the result \u201cas a means of achieving appropriations objectives,\u201d <em>ante, at </em>447, n. 3; and when it implies that the District Court\u2019s orders required the State to provide a \u201cparticular level of funding,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 469. The District Court ordered the State to produce a plan that set forth a \u201creasonable\u201d or \u201crational\u201d relationship between the needs of English-learning students and the resources provided to them. The orders expressed no view about what <em>kind </em>of English-learning program the State should use. Nor did the orders say anything about the <em>amount </em>of \u201cappropriations\u201d that the State must provide, <em>ante, </em>at 447, n. 3, or about any \u201cparticular funding mechanism,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 455, that the State was obligated to create. Rather, the District Court left it up to the State \u201cto recommend [to the legislature] the level of funding necessary to support the programs that it determined to be the most effective.\u201d 160 F. Supp. 2d, at 1044. It ordered no more than that the State <em>(whatever </em>kind of program it decided to use) must see that the chosen program benefits from a funding system that is not \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d but instead \u201cbear[s] a rational relationship\u201d to the resources needed to implement the State\u2019s method. No. CV-92-596-TUCACM, 2001 WL 1028369, *2.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Part I shows that there is nothing suspicious or unusual or unlawful about the lower courts having focused primarily upon changes related to the resources Arizona would devote to English-learning education (while also taking account of <em>all </em>the changes the petitioners raised). Thus the Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number><em>basic </em>criticism of the lower court decisions is without foundation. I turn next to the Court\u2019s discussion of the standards of review the Court finds applicable to \u201cinstitutional reform\u201d litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">To understand my concern about the Court\u2019s discussion of standards, it is important to keep in mind the well-known standards that ordinarily govern the evaluation of Rule 60(b)(5) motions. The Rule by its terms permits modification of a judgment or order (1) when \u201cthe judgment has been satisfied,\u201d (2) \u201creleased,\u201d or (3) \u201cdischarged\u201d; when the judgment or order (4) \u201cis based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated\u201d; or (5) \u201capplying [the judgment] prospectively is no longer equitable.\u201d No one can claim that the second, third, or fourth grounds are applicable here. The relevant judgment and orders have not been released or discharged; nor is there any relevant earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated. Thus the only Rule 60(b)(5) questions are whether the judgment and orders have been satisfied, or, if not, whether their continued application is \u201cequitable.\u201d And, as I have explained, in context these come down to the same question: Is continued enforcement inequitable because the defendants have satisfied the 2000 declaratory judgment or at least have come close to doing so, and, given that degree of satisfaction, would it work unnecessary harm to continue the judgment in effect? See <em>supra, </em>at 485-486.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">To show sufficient inequity to warrant Rule 60(b)(5) relief, a party must show that \u201ca significant change either in factual conditions or in law\u201d renders continued enforcement of the judgment or order \u201cdetrimental to the public interest.\u201d <em>Rufo, </em>502 U. S., at 384. The party can claim that \u201cthe statutory or decisional law has changed to make legal what the decree was designed to prevent.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 388; see also <em>Railway Employees </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>364 U. S. 642, 651 (1961). Or the party can claim that relevant facts have changed to the point where continued enforcement of the judgment, order, or de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>cree as written would work, say, disproportionately serious harm. See <em>Rufo, supra, </em>at 384 (modification may be appropriate when changed circumstances make enforcement \u201csubstantially more onerous\u201d or \u201cunworkable because of unforeseen obstacles\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The Court acknowledges, as do I, as did the lower courts, that <em>Rufo\u2019s </em>\u201cflexible standard\u201d for relief applies. The Court also acknowledges, as do I, as did the lower courts, that this \u201cflexible standard\u201d does not itself define the inquiry a court passing on a Rule 60(b)(5) motion must make. To give content to this standard, the Court refers to <em>Milliken </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>433 U. S. 267, 282 (1977), in which this Court said that a decree cannot seek to \u201celiminat[e] a condition that does not violate\u201d federal law or \u201cflow from such a violation,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 450 (internal quotation marks omitted), and to <em>Frew </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>540 U. S. 431, 441 (2004), in which this Court said that a <em>\u201cconsent decree\u201d </em>must be \u201climited to reasonable and necessary implementations of federal law,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 450 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted). The Court adds that in an \u201cinstitutional reform litigation\u201d case, a court must also take account of the need not to maintain decrees in effect for too long a time, <em>ante, </em>at 448-450, the need to take account of \u201csensitive federalism concerns,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 448, and the need to take care lest \u201cconsent decrees\u201d reflect collusion between the private plaintiffs and the state defendants at the expense of the legislative process, <em>ante, </em>at 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Taking these cases and considerations together, the majority says the critical question for the lower courts is \u201cwhether ongoing enforcement of the original order was supported by ah ongoing violation of federal law (here [subsection (f)]).\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 454. If not \u2014 i <em>e., </em>if a current violation of f\u00e9deral law cannot be detected \u2014 then \u201c \u2018responsibility for discharging the State\u2019s obligations [must be] returned promptly to the State.\u2019\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">One problem with the Court\u2019s discussion of its standards is that insofar as the considerations it mentions are widely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>accepted, the lower courts fully acknowledged and followed them. The decisions below, like most Rule 60(b)(5) decisions, reflect the basic factors the Court mentions. The lower court opinions indicate an awareness of the fact that equitable decrees are subject to a \u201cflexible standard\u201d permitting modification when circumstances, factual or legal, change significantly. 516 F. 3d, at 1163; 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1165 (citing <em>Rufo, supra, </em>at 383). The District Court\u2019s application of <em>Castaneda\u2019s </em>interpretation of subsection (f), 648 F. 2d, at 1009, along with its efforts to provide state officials wide discretionary authority (about the level of funding and the kind of funding plan), shows considerable sensitivity to \u201cfederalism concerns.\u201d And given the many years (at least seven) of state noncompliance, it is difficult to see how the decree can have remained in place too long.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Nor is the decree at issue here a \u201cconsent decree\u201d as that term is normally understood in the institutional litigation context. See <em>ante, </em>at 447-450. The State did consent to a few peripheral matters that have nothing to do with the present appeal. App. 19-30. But the State vigorously contested the plaintiffs\u2019 basic original claim, namely, that the State failed to take resource-related \u201cappropriate action\u201d within the terms of subsection (f). The State presented proofs and evidence to the District Court designed to show that no violation of federal law had occurred, and it opposed entry of the original judgment and every subsequent injunctive order, save the relief sought by the petitioners here. I can find no evidence, beyond the Court\u2019s speculation, showing that some state officials have \u201cwelcomed\u201d the District Court\u2019s decision \u201cas a means of achieving appropriations objectives that could not [otherwise] be achieved.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 447, n. 3. But even were that so, why would such a fact matter here more than in any other case in which some state employees believe a litigant who sues the State is right? I concede that the State did not appeal the District Court\u2019s original order or the ensuing injunctions. But the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>litigants refrain from appealing does not turn a litigated judgment into a \u201cconsent decree.\u201d At. least, I have never before heard that term so used.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Regardless, the Court\u2019s discussion of standards raises a far more serious problem. In addition to the standards I have discussed, <em>supra, </em>at 487-488, our precedents recognize <em>other, </em>here outcome-determinative, hornbook principles that apply when a court evaluates a Rule 60(b)(5) motion. The Court omits some of them. It mentions but fails to apply others. As a result, I am uncertain, and perhaps others will be uncertain, whether the Court has set forth a correct and workable method for analyzing a Rule 60(b)(5) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">First, a basic principle of law that the Court does not mention \u2014 a principle applicable in these cases as in others \u2014 is that, in the absence of special circumstances <em>(e. g., </em>plain error), a judge need not consider issues or factors that the parties themselves do not raise. That principle of law is longstanding, it is reflected in Blackstone, and it perhaps comes from yet an earlier age. 3 Commentaries on the Laws of England 455 (1768) (\u201c[I]t is a practice unknown to our law,\u201d when examining the decree of an inferior court, \u201cto examine the justice of the . . . decree by evidence that was never produced below\u201d); <em>Clements </em>v. <em>Macheboeuf, </em>92 U. S. 418, 425 (1876) (\u201cMatters not assigned for error will not be examined\u201d); see also <em>Savage </em>v. <em>United States, </em>92 U. S. 382, 388 (1876) (where a party with the \u201cburden ... to establish\u201d a \u201ccharge . . . fails to introduce any . . . evidence to support it, the presumption is that the charge is without any foundation\u201d); <em>McCoy </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Inst. of Technology, </em>950 F. 2d 13, 22 (CA1 1991) (\u201cIt is hornbook law that theories not raised squarely in the district court cannot be surfaced for the first time on appeal\u201d for \u201c[o]verburdened trial judges cannot be expected to be mind readers\u201d). As we have recognized, it would be difficult to operate an adversary system of justice without applying such a principle. See <em>Duignan </em>v. <em>United States, </em>274 U. S. 195, 200 (1927). But the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>repeatedly considers precisely such claims. See, <em>e. g., ante, </em>at 463-465 (considering significant matters not raised below); <em>ante, </em>at 470-472 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Second, a hornbook Rule 60(b)(5) principle, which the Court mentions, <em>ante, </em>at 447, is that the party seeking relief from a judgment or order <em>\u201cbears the burden </em>of establishing that a significant change in circumstances warrants\u201d that relief. <em>Rufo, </em>502 U. S., at 383 (emphasis added); cf. <em>Board of Ed. of Oklahoma City Public Schools </em>v. <em>Dowell, </em>498 U. S. 237, 249 (1991) (party moving for relief from judgment must make a \u201csufficient showing\u201d of change in circumstances). But the Court does not apply that principle. See, <em>e. g., ante, </em>at 466-468, and n. 20 (holding that movants potentially <em>win </em>because of <em>failure </em>of record to show that English-learning problems do <em>not </em>stem from causes other than funding); see also <em>ante, </em>at 463-464 (criticizing lower courts for failing to consider argument not made).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Third, the Court ignores the well-established distinction between a Rule 60(b)(5) request to <em>modify </em>an order and a request to set an unsatisfied judgment entirely aside\u2014 a distinction that this Court has previously emphasized. Cf. <em>Rufo, supra, </em>at 389, n. 12 (emphasizing that \u201cwe do not have before us the question whether the entire decree should be vacated\u201d). Courts normally do the latter only if the \u201cparty\u201d seeking \u201cto have\u201d the \u201cdecree set aside entirely\u201d shows \u201cthat the decree has served its purpose, and there is no longer any need for the injunction.\u201d 12 J. Moore et al., Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a760.47[2][e] (3d ed. 2009) (hereinafter Moore). Instead of applying the distinction, the majority says that the Court of Appeals \u201cstrayed\u201d when it referred to situations in which changes justified setting an unsatisfied judgment entirely aside as \u201c\u2018likely rare.\u2019\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Fourth, the Court says nothing about the well-established principle that a party moving under Rule 60(b)(5) for relief that amounts to having a \u201cdecree set aside entirely\u201d must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>show <em>both </em>(1) that the decree\u2019s objects have been \u201cattained,\u201d <em>Frew, </em>540 U. S., at 442, <em>and </em>(2) that it is unlikely, in the absence of the decree, that the unlawful acts it prohibited will again occur. This Court so held in <em>Dowell, </em>a case in which state defendants sought relief from a school desegregation decree on the ground that the district was presently operating in compliance with the Equal Protection Clause. The Court agreed with the defendants that \u201ca finding by the District Court that the Oklahoma City School District was being operated in compliance with . . . the Equal Protection Clause\u201d was indeed relevant to the question whether relief was appropriate. 498 U. S., at 247. But the Court added that, to show entitlement to relief, the defendants must <em>also </em>show that \u201cit was unlikely that the [school board] would return to its former ways.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Only then would the \u201cpurposes of the desegregation litigation ha[ve] been fully achieved.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The principle, as applicable here, simply underscores the petitioners\u2019 failure to show that the \u201cchanges\u201d to which they pointed were sufficient to warrant entirely setting aside the original court judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Fifth, the majority mentions, but fails to apply, the basic Rule 60(b)(5) principle that a party cannot dispute the legal conclusions of the judgment from which relief is sought. A party cannot use a Rule 60(b)(5) motion as a substitute for an appeal, say, by attacking the legal reasoning underlying the original judgment or by trying to show that the facts, as they were originally, did not then justify the order\u2019s issuance. <em>Browder </em>v. <em>Director, Dept. of Corrections of III., </em>434 U. S. 257, 263, n. 7 (1978); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Swift &amp; Co., </em>286 U. S. 106, 119 (1932) (party cannot claim that injunction could not lawfully have been applied \u201cto the conditions that existed at its making\u201d). Nor can a party require a court to retrace old legal ground, say, by remaking or rejustifying its original \u201cconstitutional decision every time an effort [is] made either to enforce or modify\u201d an order. <em>Rufo, supra, </em>at 389-390 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Frew, supra, </em>at 438 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>(rejecting argument that federal court lacks power to enforce an order \u201cunless the court first identifies, at the enforcement stage, a violation of federal law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Here, the original judgment rested upon a finding that the State had failed to provide Nogales with adequate <em>funding </em>\u201cresources,\u201d <em>Castaneda, </em>648 F. 2d, at 1010, in violation of subsection (f)\u2019s \u201cappropriate action\u201d requirement. How then can the Court fault the lower courts for first and foremost seeking to determine whether Arizona had developed a plan that would provide Nogales with adequate <em>funding </em>resources? How can it criticize the lower courts for having \u201cinsulated the policies embedded in the order ... from challenge and amendment,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 453, for having failed to appreciate that \u201cfunding is simply a means, not the end\u201d of the statutory requirement, <em>ante, </em>at 454-455, and for having misperceived \u201cthe nature of the obligation imposed by the\u201d Act, <em>ante, </em>at 459? When the Court criticizes the Court of Appeals for \u201cmisperceiv[ing]... the nature of the obligation imposed\u201d by the Act, <em>ibid., </em>when it second-guesses finding after finding of the District Court, see Part III, <em>infra, </em>when it early and often suggests that Arizona may well comply despite lack of a rational funding plan (and without discussing how the changes it mentions could show compliance), see <em>ante, </em>at 452, 454-455, what else is it doing but putting \u201cthe plaintiff [or] the court ... to the unnecessary burden of reestablishing what has once been decided\u201d? <em>Railway Employees, </em>364 U. S., at 647.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Sixth, the Court mentions, but fails to apply, the well-settled legal principle that appellate courts, including this Court, review district court denials of Rule 60(b) motions (of the kind before us) for abuse of discretion. See <em>Browder, supra, </em>at 263, n. 7; <em>Railway Employees, supra, </em>at 648-650. A reviewing court must not substitute its judgment for that of the district court. See <em>National Hockey League </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Hockey Club, Inc., </em>427 U. S. 639, 642 (1976) <em>(per curiam); </em>see also <em>Calderon </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>523 U. S. 538, 567-568 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>(1998) (Souter, J., dissenting) (\u201c[A] high degree of deference to the court exercising discretionary authority is the hallmark of [abuse of discretion] review\u201d). Particularly where, as here, entitlement to relief depends heavily upon fact-related determinations, the power to review the district court\u2019s decision \u201cought seldom to be called into action,\u201d namely, only in the rare instance where the Rule 60(b) standard \u201cappears to have been misapprehended or grossly misapplied.\u201d Cf. <em>Universal Camera Corp. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>340 U. S. 474, 490-491 (1951). The Court\u2019s bare assertion that a court abuses its discretion when it fails to order warranted relief, <em>ante, </em>at 447, fails to account for the deference due to the District Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">I have just described Rule 60(b)(5) standards that concern (1) the obligation (of lack of obligation) upon a court to take account of considerations the parties do not raise; (2) burdens of proof; (3) the distinction between setting aside and modifying a judgment; (4) the need to show that a decree\u2019s basic objectives have been attained; (5) the importance of not requiring relitigation of previously litigated matters; and (6) abuse of discretion review. Does the Court intend to ignore one or more of these standards or to apply them differently in cases involving what it calls \u201cinstitutional reform litigation\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">If so, the Court will find no support for its approach in the cases to which it refers, namely, <em>Rufo, Milliken, </em>and <em>Frew. Rufo </em>involved a motion to modify a complex court-monitor-supervised decree designed to prevent overcrowding in a local jail. The Court stressed the fact that the modification did not involve setting aside the entire decree. 502 U. S., at 389, n. 12. It made clear that the party seeking relief from an institutional injunction \u201cbears the burden of establishing that a significant change in circumstances warrants\u201d that relief. <em>Id., </em>at 383. And it rejected the argument that a reviewing court must determine, in every case, whether an ongoing violation of federal law exists. <em>Id., </em>at 389, 390, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>n. 12 <em>(refusing to require a new \u201c\u2018constitutional decision every time an effort [is] made either to enforce or modify\u2019 \u201d a judgment or decree </em>(emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\"><em>Frew </em>addressed the question whether the Eleventh Amendment permits a federal district court to enforce a <em>consent </em>decree against state officials seeking to bring the State into compliance with federal law. 540 U. S., at 434-435. The Court unanimously held that it does; and in doing so, the Court rejected the State\u2019s alternative argument that a federal court may only enforce such an order if it \u201cfirst identifies ... a violation of federal law\u201d existing at the time that enforcement is sought. <em>Id., </em>at 438. Rather, the Court explained that \u201c\u2018federal courts are not reduced to\u2019\u201d entering judgments or orders \u201c \u2018and hoping for compliance,\u2019 \u201d <em>id., </em>at 440, but rather retain the power to enforce judgments in order \u201cto ensure that... the objects\u201d of the court order are met, <em>id., </em>at 442. It also emphasized, like <em>Dowell, </em>that relief is warranted only when \u201cthe objects of the decree have been attained.\u201d 540 U. S., at 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">What of <em>Milliken? Milliken </em>involved direct review (rather than a motion for relief) of a district court\u2019s order requiring the Detroit school system to implement a host of remedial programs, including counseling and special reading instruction, aimed at schoolchildren previously required to attend segregated schools. 433 U. S., at 269, 272. The Court said that a court decree must aim at \u201celiminating a condition\u201d that violates federal law or which \u201cflow[s] from\u201d such a \u201cviolation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 282. And it unanimously found that the remedy at issue <em>was lawful.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">These cases confirm the unfortunate fact that the Court has failed fully to apply the six essential principles that I have mentioned. If the Court does not intend any such modifications of these traditional standards, then, as I shall show, it must affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision. But if it does intend to modify them, as stated or in application, it now applies a new set of new rules that are <em>not </em>faithful to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>our cases and which will create the dangerous possibility that orders, judgments, and decrees long final or acquiesced in, will be unwarrantedly subject to perpetual challenge, offering the defendants unjustifiable opportunities endlessly to relitigate underlying violations with the burden of proof imposed once again upon the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">I recognize that the Court\u2019s decision, to a degree, reflects one side of a scholarly debate about how courts should properly handle decrees in \u201cinstitutional reform litigation.\u201d Compare, in general, R. Sandler &amp; D. Schoenbrod, Democracy by Decree: What Happens When Courts Run Government (2003), with, <em>e. g., </em>Chayes, The Role of the Judge in Public Law Litigation, 89 Harv. L. Rev. 1281, 1307-1309 (1976). But whatever the merits of that debate, these cases do not involve the kind of \u201cinstitutional litigation\u201d that most commonly lies at its heart. See, <em>e. g., </em>M. Feeley <em>&amp; </em>E. Rubin, Judicial Policy Making and the Modern State: How the Courts Reformed America\u2019s Prisons (1998); but see <em>ante, </em>at 447, n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">These cases do not involve schools, prisons, or mental hospitals that have failed to meet basic constitutional standards. See, <em>e. g., Dowell, </em>498 U. S., at 240-241. They do not involve a comprehensive judicial decree that governs the running of a major institution. See, <em>e. g., Hutto </em>v. <em>Finney, </em>437 U. S. 678, 683-684 (1978). They do not involve a highly detailed set of orders. See, <em>e.g., Ramos </em>v. <em>Lamm, </em>639 F. 2d 559, 585-586 (CA10 1980). They do not involve a special master charged with the task of supervising a complex decree that will gradually bring a large institution into compliance with the law. See, <em>e. g., Ruiz v. Estelle, </em>679 F. 2d 1115, 1160-1161 (CA5 1982). Rather, they involve the more common complaint that a state or local government has failed to meet a federal statutory requirement. See, <em>e. g., Concilio de Salud Integral de Loiza, Inc. </em>v. <em>P\u00e9rez-Perdomo, </em>551 F. 3d 10, 16 (CA1 2008); <em>Association of Community Orgs. for Reform Now </em>v. <em>Edgar, </em>56 F. 3d 791, 797-798 (CA7 1995); <em>John B. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number><em>Menke, </em>176 F. Supp. 2d 786, 813-814 (MD Tenn. 2001). They involve a court imposition of a fine upon the State due to its lengthy failure to take steps to comply. See, <em>e. g., Hook </em>v. <em>Arizona Dept. of Corrections, </em>107 F. 3d 1397, 1404 (CA9 1997); <em>Alberti </em>v. <em>Klevenhagen, </em>46 F. 3d 1347, 1360 (CA5 1995). And they involve court orders that leave the State free to pursue the English-learning program of its choice while insisting only that the State come up with a funding plan that is rationally related to the program it chooses. These cases are more closely akin to <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>397 U. S. 254 (1970) (in effect requiring legislation to fund welfare-related \u201cdue process\u201d hearings); cf. <em>id., </em>at 277-279 (Black, J., dissenting), than they are to the school busing cases that followed <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>347 U. S. 483 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">As I have said, <em>supra, </em>at 487-489, the framework that I have just described, filling in those principles the Court neglects, is precisely the framework that the lower courts applied. 516 F. 3d, at 1163; 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1165. In the opinions below, I can find no misapplication of the legal standards relevant to these, cases. To the contrary, the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion is true to the record and fair to the decision of the District Court. And the majority is wrong to conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">If the Court\u2019s criticism of the lower courts cannot rest upon what they did do, namely, examine directly whether Arizona had produced a rational funding program, it must rest upon what it believes they did not do, namely, adequately consider the other changes in English-learning instruction, administration, and the like to which the petitioners referred. Indeed, the Court must believe this, for it orders the lower courts, on remand, to conduct a \u201cproper examination\u201d of \u201cfour important factual and legal changes that may warrant the granting of relief from the judgment:\u201d (1) the \u201cadoption of a new... instructional methodology\u201d for teaching English; (2) \u201cCongress\u2019 enactment\u201d of the No Child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Left Behind Act of 2001, codified in Title 20; (3) \u201cstructural and management reforms in Nogales,\u201d and (4) \u201cincreased overall education funding.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The Court cannot accurately hold, however, that the lower courts failed to conduct a \u201cproper examination\u201d of these claims, <em>ibid., </em>for the District Court considered three of them, in detail and at length, while the petitioners <em>nowhere raised </em>the remaining argument, which has sprung full grown from the Court\u2019s own brow, like Athena from the brow of Zeus.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">The first \u201cchange\u201d that the Court says the lower courts must properly \u201cexamin[e]\u201d consists of the \u201cchange\u201d of instructional methodology, from a method of \u201cbilingual education\u201d (teaching at least some classes in Spanish, while providing separate instruction in English) to a method of \u201c \u2018structured English immersion\u2019\u201d (teaching all or nearly all classes in English but with a specially designed curriculum and materials). <em>Ante, </em>at 459-461. How can the majority suggest that the lower courts failed properly to \u201cexamine\u201d this matter?</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">First, more than 2 days of the District Court\u2019s 8-day evidentiary hearing were devoted to precisely this matter, namely, the claim pressed below by the petitioners that \u201c[t]he adoption of English Immersion\u201d constitutes a \u201csubstantial advancemen[t] in assisting\u201d English learners \u201cto become English proficient.\u201d Hearing Memorandum in No. CV-92-596-TUC-RCC (D. Ariz., Jan. 4, 2007), Dkt. No. 588, pp. 4-5. The State\u2019s director of English acquisition, Irene Moreno, described the new method as \u201cthe most effective\u201d way to teach English. Tr. 19 (Jan. 9, 2007). An educational consultant, Rosalie Porter, agreed. <em>Id., </em>at 95-96. The petitioners\u2019 witnesses also described a new assessment test, the Arizona English Language Learner Assessment, <em>id., </em>at 50-51; they described new curricular models that would systematize instructional methods, <em>id., </em>at 78; they explained that all teachers would eventually be required to obtain an \u201cendorsement\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>demonstrating their expertise in the chosen instructional method, see Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in No. CV-92-596-TUC-RCC (D. Ariz., Jan 4, 2007), Dkt. No. 593, p. 7; and they pointed to data showing that the percentage of Nogales\u2019 English learners successfully completing the program had recently jumped from 1% of such students in 2004 to 35% in 2006, App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 08-289, p. 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The District Court in its opinion, referring to the several days of hearings, recognized the advances and acknowledged that the State had formulated new systems with new \u201cstandards, norms and oversight for Arizona\u2019s public schools and students with regard to\u201d English-learning programs. 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1160. It also indicated that it expected the orders would soon prove unnecessary as the State had taken \u201cstep[s] towards\u201d developing an \u201cappropriate\u201d funding mechanism, App. to Pet. for Cert, in No. 08-289, at 125 \u2014 a view it later reaffirmed, Order in No. CV-92-596-TUC-RCC (D. Ariz., Oct. 10, 2007), Dkt. No. 703, p. 4. The Court of Appeals, too, in its opinion acknowledged that the dispute \u201cmay finally be nearing resolution.\u201d 516 F. 3d, at 1180.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">But, at the same time, the District Court noted that \u201cmany of the new standards are still evolving.\u201d 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1160. It found that \u201cit would be premature to malee an assessment of some of these changes.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>And it held that, all in all, the changes were not yet sufficient to warrant relief. <em>Id., </em>at 1167. The Court of Appeals upheld the findings and conclusions as within the discretionary powers of the District Court, adding that the evidence showing that significantly more students were completing the program was \u201cnot reliable.\u201d 516 F. 3d, at 1157. What \u201cfurther factual findings,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 461, are needed? As I have explained, the District Court was not obligated to relitigate the case. See <em>supra, </em>at 492-493. And it <em>did </em>find that \u201cthe State has changed its primary model\u201d of English-learning instruction \u201cto structured English immersion.\u201d 480 F. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Supp. 2d, at 1161. How can the majority conclude that \u201cfurther factual findings\u201d are necessary?</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Perhaps the majority does not mean to suggest that the lower courts failed properly to examine these changes in teaching methods. Perhaps it means to express its belief that the lower courts reached the wrong conclusion. After all, the Court refers to a \u201cdocumented, academic support for the view that\u201d structured English immersion \u201cis significantly more effective than bilingual education.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 460-461.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">It is difficult to see how the majority can substitute its judgment for the District Court\u2019s judgment on this question, however, for that judgment includes a host of subsidiary fact-related determinations that warrant deference. <em>Railway Employees, </em>364 U. S., at 647-648 (\u201cWhere there is . . . a balance of imponderables there must be wide discretion in the District Court\u201d). And, despite considerable evidence showing improvement, there was also considerable evidence the other way, evidence that supported the District Court\u2019s view that it would be \u201cpremature\u201d to set aside the judgment of violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">The methodological change was introduced in Arizona in late 2000, and in Nogales it was a work in progress, \u201c[t]o one degree or another,\u201d as of June 2005. Tr. 10 (Jan. 12, 2007); <em>ante, </em>at 459-461. As of 2006, the State\u2019s newest structured English immersion models had not yet taken effect. Tr. 138 (Jan. 17, 2007) (\u201cWe\u2019re getting ready to hopefully put down some models for districts to choose from\u201d). The State had adopted its new assessment test only the previous year. App. 164-165. The testimony about the extent to which Nogales had adopted the new teaching system was unclear and conflicting. Compare Tr. 96 (Jan. 9, 2007) with <em>id., </em>at 10 (Jan. 12, 2007). And, most importantly, there was evidence that the optimistic improvement in the number of students completing the English-learning program was considerably overstated. See <em>id., </em>at 37 (Jan. 18, 2007) (stating that the <em>assessment test </em>used in 2005 and 2006, when dramatic im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>provements had been reported, <em>was significantly less \u201crig</em>orous\u201d <em>and consequently had been replaced). </em>The State\u2019s own witnesses were unable firmly to conclude that the new system had so far produced significantly improved results. <em>Id., </em>at 112-113 (Jan. 11, 2007) (stating that <em>\u201cat some point\u201d </em>it would be possible to tell how quickly the new system leads to English proficiency (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Faced with this conflicting evidence, the District Court concluded that it was \u201cpremature\u201d to dissolve the decree on the basis of changes in teaching (and related standards and assessment) methodology. Given the underlying factual disputes (about, <em>e. g., </em>the reliability of the testing method), how can this Court now hold that the District Court and the appellate court that affirmed its conclusions were legally wrong?</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The second change that the Court says the lower courts should properly \u201cexamine\u201d is the \u201cenactment\u201d of the No Child Left Behind Act. <em>Ante, </em>at 461. The Court concedes, however, that both courts did address the only argument about that \u201cenactment\u201d that the petitioners made, namely, that \u201ccompliance\u201d with that new law automatically constitutes compliance with subsection (f)\u2019s \u201c \u2018appropriate action\u2019 \u201d requirement. <em>Ante, </em>at 462; see also, <em>e. g., </em>App. 73 (arguing that the new law \u201cpreempts\u201d subsection (f)). And the Court today agrees (as do I) that the lower courts properly rejected that argument. <em>Ante, </em>at 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Instead, the Court suggests that the lower courts wrongly failed to take account of four other ways in which the new Act is \u201cprobative,\u201d namely, (1) its prompting \u201csignificant structural and programming\u201d changes, (2) its increases in \u201cfederal funding,\u201d (3) \u201cits assessment and reporting requirements,\u201d and (4) its \u201cshift in federal education policy.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 463-464. In fact, the lower courts did take account of the changes in structure, programming, and funding (including federal funding) relevant to the English-learning program in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Nogales and elsewhere in the State. See Part III-A, <em>supra; </em>Parts III-C and III-D, <em>infra. </em>But, I agree with the Court that the District Court did not explicitly relate its discussion to the new Act nor did it take account of what the majority calls a \u201cshift in federal education policy.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The District Court failed to do what the Court now demands for one simple reason. No one (with the possible exception of the legislators, who hint at the matter in their reply brief filed in this Court) has ever argued that the District Court should take account of any such \u201cchange.\u201d But see <em>ante, </em>at 463, and n. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">As I have explained, see <em>supra, </em>at 490-491, it is well established that a district court rarely commits legal error when it fails to take account of a \u201cchange\u201d that no one called to its attention or fails to reply to an argument that no one made. See, <em>e. g., Dowell, </em>498 U. S., at 249 (party seeking relief from judgment must make a \u201csufficient showing\u201d). A district court must construe fairly the arguments made to it; but it is not required to conjure up questions never squarely presented. That the <em>Court of Appeals </em>referred to an argument resembling the Court\u2019s new assertion does not change the underlying legal fact. The District Court committed no legal error in failing to consider it. The Court of Appeals could properly reach the same conclusion. And the Government, referring to the argument here, does not ask for reversal or remand on that, or on any other, basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">That is not surprising, since the lower courts have consistently and explicitly held that \u201cflexibility cannot be used to relieve the moving party of its burden to establish that\u201d dissolution is warranted. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>United States Dept. of Housing and Urban Development, </em>220 F. 3d 241, 248 (CA4 2000); <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Board of Ed., Bergenfield, N. J., </em>575 F. 2d 417, 423-424 (CA3 1978). There is no basis for treating these cases in this respect as somehow exceptional, particularly since publicly available documents indicate that, in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>event, Nogales is not \u201c\u2018reaching its own goals under Title III\u2019\u201d of the Act. <em>Ante, </em>at 463, n. 12; FY 2008 Statewide District/Charter Determinations for the Title III AMAOs (rev. Oct. 2008), http://www.azed.gov/oelas/downloads/ T3Determinations2008.pdf (showing that Nogales failed to meet the Act\u2019s \u201cAnnual Measurable Achievement Objectives,\u201d which track the progress of English-learning students).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The third \u201cchange\u201d that the Court suggests the lower courts failed properly to \u201cexamine\u201d consists of \u201cStructural and management reforms in Nogales.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 465. Again, the Court cannot mean that the lower courts failed to \u201cexamine\u201d these arguments, for the District Court heard extensive evidence on the matter. The Court itself refers to some (but only some) of the evidence introduced on this point, namely, the testimony of Kelt Cooper, the former No-gales district superintendent, who said that his administrative policies had \u201c\u2018ameliorated or eliminated many of the most glaring inadequacies\u2019 \u201d in Nogales\u2019 program. <em>Ante, </em>at 466. The Court also refers to the District Court\u2019s and Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusions about the matter. 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1160 (\u201cThe success or failure of the children of\u201d Nogales \u201cshould not depend on\u201d \u201cone person\u201d); 516 F. 3d, at 1156-1157 (recognizing that Nogales had achieved \u201creforms with limited resources\u201d but also pointing to evidence showing that \u201cthere are still significant resource constraints,\u201d and affirming the District Court\u2019s similar conclusion).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Rather, the Court claims that the lower courts improperly \u201cdiscounted\u201d this evidence. <em>Ante, </em>at 466. But what does the Court mean by \u201cdiscount\u201d? It cannot mean that the lower courts failed to take account of the possibility that these changes \u201cmight have brought Nogales[\u2019]\u201d program into \u201ccompliance\u201d with subsection (f). After all, that is precisely what the petitioners below argued. Intervenor-Defendants\u2019 Closing Argument Memorandum in No. CV-92-596-TUC-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>RCC (D. Ariz., Mar. 13, 2007), Dkt. No. 631, pp. 7-18. Instead the Court must mean that the lower courts should have given significantly more weight to the changes, <em>i. e., </em>the Court disagrees with the lower courts\u2019 conclusion about the likely effect these changes will have on the success of No-gales\u2019 English-learning programs (hence, on the need for the judgment and orders to remain in effect).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">It is difficult to understand the legal basis for the Court\u2019s disagreement about this fact-related matter. The evidence before the District Court was mixed. It consisted of some evidence showing administrative reform and managerial improvement in Nogales. <em>Ante, </em>at 465-466. At the same time other evidence, to which the Court does not refer, shows that these reforms did not come close to curing the problem. The record shows, for example, that the graduation rate in 2005 for English-learning students (59%) was significantly below the average for all students (75%). App. 195. It shows poor performance by English-learning students, compared with English-speaking students, on Arizona\u2019s content-based standardized tests. See Appendix A, <em>infra. </em>This was particularly true at Nogales\u2019 sole high school \u2014 which Arizona ranked 575th out of its 629 schools on an educational department survey, 516 F. 3d, at 1159\u2014 where only 28% of English-learning students passed those standardized tests. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The record also contains testimony from Guillermo Zamudio, who in 2005 succeeded Cooper as Nogales\u2019 superintendent, and who described numerous relevant \u201cresource-related\u201d deficiencies: Lack of funding meant that Nogales had to rely upon long-term substitute and \u201cemergency certified\u201d teachers without necessary training and experience. Tr. 45 (Jan. 18, 2007). Nogales needed additional funding to hire trained teachers\u2019 aides \u2014 a \u201cstrong component\u201d of its English-learning program, <em>id., </em>at 47. And Nogales\u2019 funding needs forced it to pay a starting base salary to its teachers about 14% below the state average, making it difficult to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>cruit qualified teachers. <em>Id., </em>at 48. Finally, Zamudio said that Nogales\u2019 lack of resources would likely lead in the near future to the cancellation of certain programs, including a remedial reading program, <em>id., </em>at 56, and would prevent the school district from providing appropriate class sizes and tutoring, which he characterized as \u201cessential and necessary for us to be able to have our students learn English,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 75-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The District Court, faced with all this evidence, found the management and structural \u201cchange\u201d insufficient to warrant dissolution of its decree. How can the Court say that this conclusion is unreasonable? What is the legal basis for concluding that the District Court acted beyond the scope of its lawful authority?</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">In fact, the Court does not even try to claim that the District Court\u2019s conclusion is unreasonable. Rather, it enigmatically says that the District Court made \u201cinsufficient factual findings\u201d to support the conclusion that an ongoing violation of law exists. <em>Ante, </em>at 468. By \u201cinsufficient,\u201d the Court does not mean nonexistent. See 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1163-1164. Nor can it mean that the District Court\u2019s findings were skimpy or unreasonable. That court simply drew conclusions on the basis of evidence it acknowledged was mixed. <em>Id., </em>at 1160-1161. What is wrong with those findings, particularly if viewed with appropriate deference?</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">At one point the Court says that there \u201care many possible causes\u201d of Nogales\u2019 difficulties and that the lower courts failed to \u201ctake into account other variables that may explain\u201d the ongoing deficiencies. <em>Ante, </em>at 467, 468, n. 20. But to find a flaw here is to claim that the plaintiffs have failed to negate the possibility that these other causes, not the State\u2019s resource failures, explain Nogales\u2019 poor performance. To say this is to ignore well-established law that accords deference to the District Court\u2019s fact-related judgments. See <em>supra, </em>at 493-494. The Court\u2019s statements reflect the acknowledgment that the evidence below was mixed. Given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>that acknowledgment, it is clear that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the. petitioners had not shown sufficient \u201cchanged circumstances.\u201d And it was the petitioners\u2019 job, as the moving party, to show that compliance with federal law has been achieved. Where \u201cother variables\u201d make it difficult to conclude that a present violation does or does not exist, what error does the District Court commit if it concludes that the moving party has failed to satisfy that burden?</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The fourth \u201cchange\u201d that the Court suggests the lower courts did not properly \u201cexamine\u201d consists of an \u201coverall increase in the education funding available in Nogales.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 468. Again, the Court is wrong to suggest that the District Court failed fully to examine the matter, for despite the Court\u2019s assertions to the contrary, it made a number of \u201cup-to-date factual findings,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 469, on the matter, see 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1161-1164. Those findings reflect that the State had developed an educational plan that raised the \u201cbase level amount\u201d for the typical student from $3,139 per pupil in 2000 to $3,570 in 2006 (in constant 2006 dollars), <em>ante, </em>at 468-469, n. 21; and that plan increased the additional <em>(i. e., </em>\u201cweighted\u201d) amount that would be available, per English-learning student from $182 to $349 (in 2006 dollars). The State contended that this new plan, with its explanation of how the money needed would be forthcoming from federal, as well as from state, sources, met subsection (f)\u2019s requirement for \u201cappropriate action\u201d (as related to \u201cresources\u201d) and the District Court\u2019s own insistence upon a mechanism that rationally funded those resources. See Appendix B, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Once again the Court\u2019s \u201cfactual-finding\u201d criticism seems, in context, to indicate its disagreement with the lower courts\u2019 resolution of this argument. That is to say, the Court seems to disagree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that, even with the new funding, the State failed to show that adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>resources for English-learning programs would likely be forthcoming; hence the new plan was not \u201crationally related\u201d to the underlying resource problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The record, however, adequately supports the District Court\u2019s conclusion. For one thing, the funding plan demonstrates that, in 2006, 69% of the available funding was targeted at \u201cbase level\u201d education, see Appendix B, <em>infra, i. e., </em>it was funding available to provide students with basic educational services like instruction in mathematics, science, and so forth. See Tr. 110 (Jan. 12, 2007). The District Court found that this funding likely would not become available for English-learning programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">How is that conclusion unreasonable? If these funds are provided for the provision of only basic services, how can the majority now decide that a school district \u2014 particularly a poor school district like Nogales \u2014 would be able to cover the additional expenses associated with English-learning education while simultaneously managing to provide for its students\u2019 basic educational needs? Indeed, the idea is particularly impractical when applied to a district like Nogales, which has a high percentage of students who need extra resources. See 516 F. 3d, at 1145 (approximately 90% of Nogales\u2019 students were, or had been, enrolled in the English-learning program in 2006). Where the vast majority of students in a district are those who \u201cneed extra help\u201d which \u201ccosts extra money,\u201d it is difficult to imagine where one could find an untapped stream of funding that could cover those additional costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">For another thing, the petitioners\u2019 witnesses conceded that the State had not yet determined the likely costs to school districts of teaching English learners using the structured English immersion method. See, <em>e. g., </em>Tr. 199-200 (Jan. 17, 2007). The legislators reported that the State had recently asked a task force to \u201cdetermine\u201d the extra costs associated with implementing the structured English immersion model. Speaker\u2019s Opening Appellate Brief in No. 07-15603 etc. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>(CA9), p. 31. But that task force had not yet concluded its work.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Further, the District Court doubted that the federal portion of the funding identified by the petitioners would be available for English-learning programs. It characterized certain federal grant money, included in the petitioners\u2019 calculus of available funds, as providing only \u201cshort-term\u201d assistance, 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1161. And testimony at the evidentiary hearing indicated that some of the funds identified by the petitioners might not in fact be available to Nogales\u2019 schools. See Tr. 59-61 (Jan. 10, 2007). It also noted that certain funds were restricted, meaning that no particular English-learning child could benefit from them for more than two years \u2014 despite the fact that English-learning students in Nogales'on average spend four to five years in that program. 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1163-1164 (Nogales will have to \u201cdilute\u201d the funds provided to cover students who remain English learners for more than two years).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Finally, the court pointed to federal law, which imposes a restriction forbidding the State to use a large portion of (what the State\u2019s plan considered to be) available funds in the manner the State proposed, <em>i. e., </em>to \u201csupplant,\u201d or substitute for, the funds the State would otherwise have spent on the program. <em>Id., </em>at 1162; see also 20 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 6314(a)(2)(B), 6315(b)(3), 6613(f), 6825(g). The District Court concluded that the State\u2019s funding plan was in large part unworkable in light of this restriction. In reaching this conclusion, the District Court relied in part upon the testimony of Thomas Fagan, a former United States Department of Education employee and an \u201cexpert\u201d on this type of federal funding. Fagan testified that Arizona\u2019s plan was a \u201c \u2018blatant violation\u2019 \u201d of the relevant laws, which could result in a loss to the State of over $600 million in federal funds\u2014 including those federal funds the State\u2019s plan would provide for English learners. 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1163.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>The Court says that the analysis I have just described, and in which the court engaged, amounts to \u201cclear legal error.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 469. What error? Where is the error? The Court does say earlier in its opinion that the lower courts \u201cshould not\u201d have \u201cdisregarded\u201d the relevant federal <em>(i. e., </em>No Child Left Behind Act) funds \u201cjust because they are not state funds.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 463. But the District Court did <em>not </em>disregard those funds \u201cjust because they are not state funds.\u201d Nor did it \u201cforeclos[e] the possibility that petitioners could\u201d show entitlement to relief by pointing to \u201can overall increase in education funding.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 469. Rather, the District Court treated those increased funds as potentially unavailable, primarily because their use as planned would violate federal law and would thereby threaten the State with total loss of the stream of federal funding it planned to use. It concluded that the State\u2019s plan amounted to \u201c <em>\u2018a </em>blatant violation\u2019 \u201d of federal law, and remarked that \u201cthe potential loss of federal funds is substantial.\u201d 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1163. Is there a better reason for \u201cdisregard[ing]\u201d those funds?</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The Court may have other \u201cerrors\u201d in mind as well. It does say, earlier in its opinion, that some believe that \u201cincreased funding <em>alone </em>does not improve student achievement,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 464 (emphasis added), and it refers to nine studies that suggest that increased funding does not always help, see <em>ante, </em>at 464-465,. 467, nn. 17-19; see also Brief for Educational-Policy Scholars as <em>Amici Curiae </em>7-11 (discussing such scholarship). I do not know what this has to do with the matter. But if it is relevant to today\u2019s decision, the Court should also refer to the many studies that cast doubt upon the results of the studies it cites. See, <em>e. g., </em>H. Ladd &amp; J. Hansen, Making Money Matter: Financing America\u2019s Schools 140-147 (1999); Hess, Understanding Achievement (and Other) Changes Under Chicago School Reform, 21 Educ. Eval. &amp; Pol\u2019y Analysis 67, 78 (1999); Card &amp; Payne, School Finance Reform, The Distribution of School Spending, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>the Distribution of Student Test Scores, 83 J. Pub. Econ. 49, 67 (2002); see also Rebell, Poverty, \u201cMeaningful\u201d Educational Opportunity, and the Necessary Role of. the Courts, 85 N. C. L. Rev. 1467, 1480 (2007); R. Greenwald, L. Hedges, &amp; R. Laine, The Effect of School Resources on Student Achievement, 66 Rev. Educ. Res. 361, 362 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Regardless, the relation of a funding plan to improved performance is not an issue for this Court to decide through footnote references to the writings of one side of a complex expert debate. The question here is whether the State has shown that its new funding program amounts to a \u201cchange\u201d that satisfies subsection (f)\u2019s requirement. The District Court found it did not. Nothing this Court says casts doubt on the legal validity of that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">The Court\u2019s remaining criticisms are not well founded. The Court, for example, criticizes the Court of Appeals for having referred to the \u201ccircumstances\u201d that \u201cwarrant Rule 60(b)(5) relief as <em>\u2018likely rare,\u2019 </em>\u201d for having said the petitioners would have to <em>\u2018\u2018sweep away\u201d </em>the District Court\u2019s \u201cfunding determination\u201d in order to prevail, for having spoken of the \u201clandscape\u201d as not being \u201cso <em>radically changed </em>as to justify relief from judgment without compliance,\u201d and for having somewhat diminished the \u201cclose[ness]\u201d of its review for \u201cfederalism concerns\u201d because the State and its board of education \u201cwish the injunction to remain in place.\u201d . <em>Ante, </em>at 451-452 (first, second, and fourth emphases added; internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">. The Court, however, does not explain the context in which the Court of Appeals\u2019 statements appeared. That court used its first phrase (\u201clikely rare\u201d) to refer to the <em>particular kind </em>of modification that the State sought, namely, complete relief from the original judgment, even if the judgment\u2019s objective was not yet fully achieved. 516 F. 3d, at 1167; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>cf. Moore \u00a7 60.47[2][c]. As far as I know it is indeed \u201crare\u201d that \u201ca prior judgment is so undermined by later circumstances as to render its continued enforcement inequitable\u201d even though compliance with the judgment\u2019s legal determination has not occurred. 516 F. 3d, at 1167. At least, the Court does not point to other instances that make it common. Uses of the words \u201csweeping\u201d and \u201cradica[l] change\u201d in context refer to the deference owed to the District Court\u2019s 2000 legal determination. See <em>id., </em>at 1168 (describing the 2000 order\u2019s \u201cbasic determination\u201d that English-learning \u201cprograms require substantial state funding in addition to that spent on basic educational programming\u201d). If there is an error (which I doubt, see <em>supra, </em>at 492-494), the error is one of tone, not of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Nor do I see any legal error that could have made a difference when the Court of Appeals said it should downplay the importance of federalism concerns because some elements of Arizona\u2019s state government support the judgment. I do not know the legal basis for the majority\u2019s reference to this recalibration of judicial distance as \u201cflatly incorrect,\u201d but, if it is wrong, I still do not see how recalibrating the recalibration could matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">In sum, the majority\u2019s decision to set aside the lower court decisions rests upon (1) a mistaken effort to drive a wedge between (a) review of funding plan changes and (b) review of changes that would bring the State into compliance with federal law, Part I, <em>supra; </em>(2) a misguided attempt to show that the lower courts applied the wrong legal standards, Part II, <em>supra; </em>(3) a mistaken belief that the lower courts made four specific fact-based errors, Part III, <em>supra; </em>and (4) a handful of minor criticisms, Part IV, <em>supra </em>and this page. By tracing each of these criticisms to its source in the record, I have tried to show that each is unjustified. Whether taken separately or together, they cannot warrant setting aside the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">As a totally separate matter, the Court says it is \u201cunclear\u201d whether the District Court improperly ordered statewide injunctive relief instead of confining that relief to Nogales. And it orders the District Court to vacate the injunction \u201cinsofar as it extends beyond Nogales\u201d unless the court finds that \u201cArizona is violating\u201d subsection (f) \u201con a statewide basis.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">What is the legal support for this part of the majority\u2019s opinion? Prior to the appearance of these cases in this Court, no one asked for that modification. Nothing in the law, as far as I know, makes the relief somehow clearly erroneous. Indeed, as the majority recognizes, the reason that the injunction runs statewide is that the State of Arizona, the defendant in the litigation, <em>asked the Court to enter that relief. </em>The State pointed in support to a state constitutional provision requiring educational uniformity. See <em>ante, </em>at 471. There is no indication that anyone disputed whether the injunction should have statewide scope. A statewide program harmed Nogales\u2019 students, App. 13-14, \u00b6\u00b640, 42; and the State wanted statewide relief. What in the law makes this relief erroneous?</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">The majority says that the District Court must consider this matter because the \u201c [petitioners made it clear at oral argument that they wish to argue that the extension of the remedy to districts other than Nogales should be vacated.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 470, n. 23. I find the matter less clear. I would direct the reader to the oral argument transcript, which reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-8\">\u201cMR. STARR: . . . What was entered here in this order, which makes it so extraordinary, is that the entire State funding mechanism has been interfered with by the order. This case started out in Nogales....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-9\">\u201cJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I \u2014 I agree with that. I think it was a vast mistake to extend a lawsuit that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>applied only to Nogales to the whole State, but the State attorney general wanted that done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">\u201cMR. STARR: But we should be able now to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsU\">\u201cJUSTICE SCALIA: But that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s water over the dam. That\u2019s not what this suit is about now.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 26.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Regardless, what is the legal basis for the Court\u2019s order telling the District Court it <em>must </em>reconsider the matter? There is no clear error. No one has asked the District Court for modification. And the scope of relief is primarily a question for the District Court. <em>Swann </em>v. <em>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., </em>402 U. S. 1, 15 (1971) (\u201cOnce a right and a violation have been shown, the scope of a district court\u2019s equitable powers to remedy past wrongs is broad, for breadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable remedies\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">As the length of the opinions indicates, these cases require us to read a highly detailed record. Members of this Court have reached different conclusions about what that record says. But there is more to the case than that.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">First, even if one sees these cases as simply a technical record-reading case, the disagreement among us shows why this Court should ordinarily hesitate to hear cases that require us to do no more than to review a lengthy record simply to determine whether a lower court\u2019s fact-based determinations are correct. Cf. <em>Universal Camera, </em>340 U. S., at 488 (\u201c[A] court may [not] displace\u201d a \u201cchoice between two fairly conflicting views, even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it <em>de novo\u201d); Graver Tank &amp; Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Linde Air Products Co., </em>336 U. S. 271, 275 (1949) (noting the well-settled rule that this Court will not \u201cundertake to review concurrent findings of fact by two courts below in the absence of a very obvious and exceptional showing of error\u201d). In such cases, appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>courts are closer to the fray, better able to reach conclusions that are true to the record, and are more likely to treat trial court determinations fairly and with respect \u2014 as is clearly so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Second, insofar as the Court goes beyond the technical record-based aspects of these cases and applies a new review framework, it risks problems in future cases. The framework it applies is incomplete and lacks clear legal support or explanation. And it will be difficult for lower courts to understand and to apply that framework, particularly if it rests on a distinction between \u201cinstitutional reform litigation\u201d and other forms of litigation. Does the Court mean to say, for example, that courts must, on their own, go beyond a party\u2019s own demands and relitigate an underlying legal violation whenever that party asks for modification of an injunction? How could such a rule work in practice? See <em>supra, </em>at 492-494. Does the Court mean to suggest that there are other special, strict prodefendant rules that govern review of district court decisions in \u201cinstitutional reform cases\u201d? What precisely are those rules? And when is a case an \u201cinstitutional reform\u201d case? After all, as I have tried to show, see <em>supra, </em>at 489-490, the cases before us cannot easily be fitted onto the Court\u2019s Procrustean \u201cinstitutional reform\u201d bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Third, the Court may mean its opinion to express an attitude, cautioning judges to take care when the enforcement of federal statutes will impose significant financial burdens upon States. An attitude, however, is not a rule of law. Nor does any such attitude point toward vacating the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion here. The record makes clear that the District Court did take care. See <em>supra, </em>at 486. And the Court of Appeals too proceeded with care, producing a detailed opinion that is both true to the record and fair to the lower court and to the parties\u2019 submissions as well. I do not see how this Court can now require lower court judges to take yet greater care, to proceed with even greater caution, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>while at the same time expecting those courts to enforce the statute as Congress intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Finally, we cannot and should not fail to acknowledge the underlying subject matter of this proceeding. These cases concern the rights of Spanish-speaking students, attending public school near the Mexican border, to learn English in order to live their lives in a country where English is the predominant language. In a Nation where nearly 47 million people (18% of the population) speak a language other than English at home, U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Economics and Statistics Admin., Census Bureau, Census 2000 Brief: Language Use and English-Speaking Ability 2 (Oct. 2003), it is important to ensure that those children, without losing the cultural heritage embodied in the language of their birth, nonetheless receive the English-language tools they need to participate in a society where that second language \u201cserves as the fundamental medium of social interaction\u201d and democratic participation. Rodriguez, Language and Participation, 94 Cal. L. Rev. 687, 693 (2006). In that way linguistic diversity can complement and support, rather than undermine, our democratic institutions. <em>Id., </em>at 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">At least, that is what Congress decided when it set federal standards that state officials must meet. In doing so, without denying the importance of the role of state and local officials, it also created a role for federal judges, including judges who must see that the States comply with those federal standards. Unfortunately, for reasons I have set forth, see Part II, <em>supra, </em>the Court\u2019s opinion will make it more difficult for federal courts to enforce those federal standards. Three decades ago, Congress put this statutory provision in place to ensure that our Nation\u2019s school systems will help non-English-speaking schoolchildren overcome the language barriers that might hinder their participation in our country\u2019s schools, workplaces, and the institutions of everyday politics and government, <em>i. e., </em>the \u201carenas through which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>most citizens live their daily lives.\u201d Rodriguez, <em>supra, </em>at 694. I fear that the Court\u2019s decision will increase the difficulty of overcoming barriers that threaten to divide us.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">For the reasons set forth in this opinion, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>APPENDIXES</p>\n<p id=\"AvD\">A</p>\n<p id=\"AXq\">PERFORMANCE ON CONTENT-BASED ASSESSMENT TESTS \u2014 SPRING 2006<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ALH\">MATH</p>\n<p id=\"A83\">GRADE ELL STUDENTS PASSING EXAM NON-ELL AND RECLASSIFIED STUDENTS PASSING EXAM</p>\n<p id=\"A3E\">3 54% 94%</p>\n<p id=\"A6K\">4 44% 91%</p>\n<p id=\"AYq\">5 58% 88%</p>\n<p id=\"AcIb\">6 23% 82%</p>\n<p id=\"Ard\">7 40% 82%</p>\n<p id=\"Aj0\">8 28% 70%</p>\n<p id=\"Azh\">READING</p>\n<p id=\"Arr\">GRADE ELL STUDENTS PASSING EXAM NON-ELL AND RECLASSIFIED STUDENTS PASSING EXAM</p>\n<p id=\"AT6\">3 40% 92%</p>\n<p id=\"AvR\">4 19% 83%</p>\n<p id=\"AWL\">5 22% 81%</p>\n<p id=\"AXN\">6 14% 76%</p>\n<p id=\"AuA\">7 13% 74%</p>\n<p id=\"AZy\">8 31% 73%</p>\n<p id=\"Azt\">WRITING</p>\n<p id=\"AHs\">GRADE ELL STUDENTS PASSING EXAM NON-ELL AND RECLASSIFIED STUDENTS PASSING EXAM</p>\n<p id=\"AUI\">3 52% _82%_</p>\n<p id=\"A7W\">4 52% _87%_</p>\n<p id=\"Abk\">5 34% _80%_</p>\n<p id=\"AmL\">6 71% _97%_</p>\n<p id=\"AoM\">7 66% _98%_</p>\n<p id=\"AqV\">8 49% _ _94%_</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">FUNDING AVAILABLE TO NOGALES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT, PER STUDENT<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">TYPE 1999-2000 2000-2001 2001-2002 2002-2003 2003-2004 2004-2005 2005-2006 2006-2007</p>\n<p id=\"ACL\">Base level $2,592 $2,618 $2,721 $2,788 $2,858 $2,929 $3,039 $3,173</p>\n<p id=\"Ant\">ELL funds $156 $157 $163 $321 $329 $337 $349 $365</p>\n<p id=\"AyY\">Other state ELL funds $0 $0 $0 $126 $64 $0 $74</p>\n<p id=\"A2n\">Federal Title I funds $439 $448 $467 $449 $487 $638 $603 $597</p>\n<p id=\"AlH\">Federal Title II funds $63 $74 $101 $109 $91 $92 $87</p>\n<p id=\"AKy\">Federal Title III (ELL) funds $0 $0 $0 $67 $89 $114 $118 $121</p>\n<p id=\"Ajr\">State and federal grants $58 $56 $59 $47 $207 $214 $205 $109</p>\n<p id=\"Att\">TOTAL <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> $3,302 $3,342 $3,484 $3,899 $4,162 $4,387 $4,406 $4,605<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Azv\">Constant dollars (2006)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> $3,866 $3,804 $3,904 $4,272 $4,442 $4,529 $4,406 $4,477</p>\n<p id=\"Aks\">Total ELL funds $156 $157 $163 $514 $501 $515 $467 $639</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b565-55\">App. to Pet. for Cert, in No. 08-289, p. 311.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b566-104\">516 F. 3d 1140, 1159-1160 (CA9 2008); App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 08-289, pp. 42-43.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b566-105\"> Nogales received less per-pupil funding in 2006 than the average provided by every State in the Nation.
