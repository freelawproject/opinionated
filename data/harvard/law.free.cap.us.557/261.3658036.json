The first is whether the Act gives authority to the United States Army Corps of Engineers, or instead to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency), to issue a permit for the discharge of min<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>ing waste, called slurry. The Corps of Engineers (or Corps) has issued a permit to petitioner Coeur Alaska, Inc. (Coeur Alaska), for a discharge of slurry into a lake in southeast Alaska. The second question is whether, when the Corps issued that permit, the agency acted in accordance with law. We conclude that the Corps was the appropriate agency to issue the permit and that the permit is lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\">With regard to the first question, \u00a7 404(a) of the CWA grants the Corps the power to \u201cissue permits ... for the discharge of . . . fill material.\u201d 86 Stat. 884, 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1344(a). But the EPA also has authority to issue permits for the discharge of pollutants. Section 402 of the Act grants the EPA authority to \u201cissue a permit for the discharge of any pollutant,\u201d \u201c[e]xcept as provided in\u201d \u00a7404. 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1342(a). We conclude that because the slurry Coeur Alaska wishes to discharge is defined by regulation as \u201cfill material,\u201d 40 CFR \u00a7232.2 (2008), Coeur Alaska properly obtained its permit from the Corps of Engineers, under \u00a7 404, rather than from the EPA, under \u00a7 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">The second question is whether the Corps permit is lawful. Three environmental groups, respondents here, sued the Corps under the Administrative Procedure Act, arguing that the issuance of the permit by the Corps was \u201cnot in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7706(2)(A). The environmental groups are Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, Sierra Club, and Lynn Canal Conservation (collectively, SEACC). The State of Alaska and Coeur Alaska are petitioners here.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">SEACC argues that the permit from the Corps is unlawful because the discharge of slurry would violate an EPA regulation promulgated under \u00a7 306(b) of the CWA, 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1316(b). The EPA regulation, which is called a \u201cnew source performance standard,\u201d forbids mines like Coeur Alaska\u2019s from discharging \u201cprocess wastewater\u201d into the navigable waters. 40 CFR \u00a7 440.104(b)(1). Coeur Alaska, the State of Alaska, and the federal agencies maintain that the Corps permit is lawful nonetheless because the EPA\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>performance standard does not apply to discharges of fill material.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Reversing the judgment of the District Court, the Court of Appeals held that the EPA\u2019s performance standard applies to this discharge so that the permit from the Corps is unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">Petitioner Coeur Alaska plans to reopen the Kensington Gold Mine, located some 45 miles north of Juneau, Alaska. The mine has been closed since 1928, but Coeur Alaska seeks to make it profitable once more by using a technique known as \u201cfroth flotation.\u201d Coeur Alaska will churn the mine\u2019s crushed rock in tanks of frothing water. Chemicals in the water will cause gold-bearing minerals to float to the surface, where they will be skimmed off.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">At issue is Coeur Alaska\u2019s plan to dispose of the mixture of crushed rock and water left behind in the tanks. This mixture is called slurry. Some 30 percent of the slurry\u2019s volume is crushed rock, resembling wet sand, which is called tailings. The rest is water.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">The standard way to dispose of slurry is to pump it into a tailings pond. The slurry separates in the pond. Solid tailings sink to the bottom, and water on the surface returns to the mine to be used again.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">Rather than build a tailings pond, Coeur Alaska proposes to use Lower Slate Lake, located some three miles from the mine in the Tongass National Forest. This lake is small\u2014 800 feet at its widest crossing, 2,000 feet at its longest, and 23 acres in area. See App. 138a, 212a. Though small, the lake is 51 feet deep at its maximum. The parties agree the lake is a navigable water of the United States and so is subject to the CWA. They also agree there can be no discharge into the lake except as the CWA and any lawful permit allow.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">Over the life of the mine, Coeur Alaska intends to put 4.5 million tons of tailings in the lake. This will raise the lake-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>bed 50 feet \u2014 to what is now the lake\u2019s surface \u2014 and will increase the lake\u2019s area from 23 to about 60 acres. <em>Id., </em>at 361a (62 acres), 212a (56 acres). To contain this wider, shallower body of water, Coeur Alaska will dam the lake\u2019s downstream shore. The transformed lake will be isolated from other surface water. Creeks and stormwater runoff will detour around it. <em>Id., </em>at 298a. Ultimately, lakewater will be cleaned by purification systems and will flow from the lake to a stream and thence onward. <em>Id., </em>at 309a-312a.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Numerous state and federal agencies reviewed and approved Coeur Alaska\u2019s plans. At issue here are actions by two of those agencies: the Corps of Engineers and the EPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The CWA classifies crushed rock as a \u201cpollutant.\u201d 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1362(6). On the one hand, the Act forbids Coeur Alaska\u2019s discharge of crushed rock \u201c[e]xcept as in compliance\u201d with the Act. CWA \u00a7 301(a), 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1311(a). Section 404(a) of the CWA, on the other hand, empowers the Corps to authorize the discharge of \u201cdredged or fill material.\u201d 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1344(a). The Corps and the EPA have together defined \u201cfill material\u201d to mean any \u201cmaterial [that] has the effect of . . . [c]hanging the bottom elevation\u201d of water. 40 CFR \u00a7 232.2. The agencies have further defined the \u201cdischarge of fill material\u201d to include \u201cplacement of . . . slurry, or tailings or similar mining-related materials.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">In these cases the Corps and the EPA agree that the slurry meets their regulatory definition of \u201cfill material.\u201d On that premise the Corps evaluated the mine\u2019s plan for a \u00a7404 permit. After considering the environmental factors required by \u00a7 404(b), the Corps issued Coeur Alaska a permit to pump the slurry into Lower Slate Lake. App. 340a-378a.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>In granting the permit the Corps followed the steps set forth by \u00a7 404. Section 404(b) requires the Corps to consider the environmental consequences of every discharge it allows. 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1344(b). The Corps must apply guidelines written by the EPA pursuant to \u00a7 404(b). See <em>ibid.; </em>40 CFR pt. 230 (EPA guidelines). Applying those guidelines here, the Corps determined that Coeur Alaska\u2019s plan to use Lower Slate Lake as a tailings pond was the \u201cleast environmentally damaging practicable\u201d way to dispose of the tailings. App. 366a. To conduct that analysis, the Corps compared the plan to the proposed alternatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The Corps determined that the environmental damage caused by placing slurry in the lake will be temporary. And during that temporary disruption, Coeur Alaska will divert waters around the lake through pipelines built for this purpose. <em>Id., </em>at 298a. Coeur Alaska will also treat water flowing from the lake into downstream waters, pursuant to strict EPA criteria. <em>Ibid.; </em>see Part I-B-2, <em>infra. </em>Though the slurry will at first destroy the lake\u2019s small population of common fish, that population may later be replaced. After mining operations are completed, Coeur Alaska will help \u201creclaim]\u201d the lake by \u201cMapping\u201d the tailings with about four inches of \u201cnative material.\u201d App. 361a; <em>id., </em>at 309a. The Corps concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">\u201c[t]he reclamation of the lake will result in more emergent wetlands/vegetated shallows with moderate values for fish habitat, nutrient recycling, carbon/detrital export and sediment/toxicant retention, and high values for wildlife habitat.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 361a.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">If the tailings did not go into the lake, they would be placed on nearby wetlands. The resulting pile would rise twice as high as the Pentagon and cover three times as many acres. Reply Brief for Petitioner Coeur Alaska 27. If it were chosen, that alternative would destroy dozens of acres of wetlands \u2014 a permanent loss. App. 365a-366a. On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>premise that when the mining ends the lake will be at least as environmentally hospitable, if not more so, than now, the Corps concluded that placing the tailings in the lake will cause less damage to the environment than storing them above ground: The reclaimed lake will be \u201cmore valuable to the aquatic ecosystem than a permanently filled wetland . . . that has lost all aquatic functions and values.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 361a; see also <em>id., </em>at 366a.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">The EPA had the statutory authority to veto the Corps permit, and prohibit the discharge, if it found the plan to have \u201can unacceptable adverse effect on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds and fishery areas . . . , wildlife, or recreational areas.\u201d CWA \u00a7 404(c), 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1344(c). After considering the Corps\u2019 findings, the EPA did not veto the Corps permit, even though, in its view, placing the tailings in the lake was not the \u201cenvironmentally preferable\u201d means of disposing of them. App. 300a. By declining to exercise its veto, the EPA in effect deferred to the judgment of the Corps on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The EPA\u2019s involvement extended beyond the Agency\u2019s veto consideration. The EPA also issued a permit of its own \u2014 not for the discharge from the mine into the lake but for the discharge from the lake into a downstream creek. <em>Id., </em>at 287a-331a. Section 402 grants the EPA authority to \u201cissue a permit for the discharge of any pollutant,\u201d \u201c[ejxcept as provided in [CWA \u00a7404].\u201d 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1342(a). The EPA\u2019s \u00a7402 permit authorizes Coeur Alaska to discharge water from Lower Slate Lake into the downstream creek, subject to strict water-quality limits that Coeur Alaska must regularly monitor. App. 303a-304a, 309a.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The EPA\u2019s authority to regulate this discharge comes from a regulation, termed a \u201cnew source performance standard,\u201d that it has promulgated under authority granted to it by \u00a7 306(b) of the CWA. Section 306(b) gives the EPA authority to regulate the amount of pollutants that certain catego<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>ries of new sources may discharge into the navigable waters of the United States. 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1316(b). Pursuant to this authority, the EPA in 1982 promulgated a new source performance standard restricting discharges from new froth-flotation gold mines like Coeur Alaska\u2019s. The standard is stringent: It allows \u201cno discharge of process wastewater\u201d from these mines. 40 CFR \u00a7 440.104(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Applying that standard to the discharge of water from Lower Slate Lake into the downstream creek, the EPA\u2019s \u00a7 402 permit sets strict limits on the amount of pollutants the water may contain. The permit requires Coeur Alaska to treat the water using \u201creverse osmosis\u201d to remove aluminum, suspended solids, and other pollutants. App. 298a; <em>id., </em>at 304a. Coeur Alaska must monitor the water flowing from the lake to be sure that the pollutants are kept to low, specified minimums. <em>Id., </em>at 326a-330a.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">SEACC brought suit against the Corps of Engineers and various of its officials in the.United States District Court for the District of Alaska. The Corps permit was not in accordance with law, SEACC argued, for two reasons. First, in SEACC\u2019s view, the permit was issued by the wrong agency \u2014 Coeur Alaska ought to have sought a \u00a7402 permit from the EPA, just as the company did for the discharge of water from the lake into the downstream creek. See Part I-B-2, <em>supra. </em>Second, SEACC contended that regardless of which agency issued the permit, the discharge itself is unlawful because it will violate the EPA new source performance standard for froth-flotation gold mines. (This is the same performance standard described above, which the EPA has already applied to the discharge of water from the lake into the downstream creek. See <em>ibid.) </em>SEACC argued that this performance standard also applies to the discharge of slurry into the lake. It contended further that the performance standard is a binding implementation of \u00a7 306. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Section 306(e) of the CWA makes it \u201cunlawful\u201d for Coeur Alaska to \u201coperate\u201d the mine \u201cin violation of\u201d the EPA\u2019s performance standard. 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1316(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\">Coeur Alaska and the State of Alaska intervened as defendants. Both sides moved for summary judgment. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and ordered the District Court to vacate the Corps of Engineers\u2019 permit. <em>Southeast Alaska Conservation Council </em>v. <em>United States Army Corps of Engs., </em>486 F. 3d 638, 654-655 (2007). The court acknowledged that Coeur Alaska\u2019s slurry \u201cfacially meets the Corps\u2019 current regulatory definition of \u2018fill material,\u2019 \u201d <em>id., </em>at 644, because it would have the effect of raising the lake\u2019s bottom elevation. But the court also noted that the EPA\u2019s new source performance standard \u201cprohibits discharges from froth-flotation mills.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court of Appeals concluded that \u201c[b]oth of the regulations appear to apply in this case, yet they are at odds.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>To resolve the conflict, the court turned to what it viewed as \u201cthe plain language of the Clean Water Act.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court held that the EPA\u2019s new source performance standard \u201capplies to discharges from the froth-flotation mill at Coeur Alaska\u2019s Kensington Gold Mine into Lower Slate Lake.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">In addition to the text of the CWA, the Court of Appeals also relied on the agencies\u2019 statements made when promulgating their current and prior definitions of \u201cfill material.\u201d These statements, in the Court of Appeals\u2019 view, demonstrated the agencies\u2019 intent that the EPA\u2019s new source performance standard govern discharges like Coeur Alaska\u2019s. <em>Id., </em>at 648-654.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The Court of Appeals concluded that Coeur Alaska required a \u00a7 402 permit for its slurry discharge, that the Corps lacked authority to issue such a permit under \u00a7 404, and that the proposed discharge was unlawful because it would violate the EPA new source performance standard and \u00a7 306(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>The decision of the Court of Appeals in effect reallocated the division of responsibility that the Corps and the EPA had been following. The Court granted certiorari. 554 U. S. 931 (2008). We now hold that the decision of the Court of Appeals was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The question of which agency has authority to consider whether to permit the slurry discharge is our beginning inquiry. We consider first the authority of the EPA and second the authority of the Corps. Our conclusion is that under the CWA the Corps had authority to determine whether Coeur Alaska was entitled to the permit governing this discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Section 402 gives the EPA authority to issue \u201cpermit[s] for the discharge of any pollutant,\u201d with one important exception: The EPA may not issue permits for fill material that fall under the Corps\u2019 \u00a7404 permitting authority. Section 402(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-9\"><em>\u201cExcept as provided in </em>. . . <em>[CWA \u00a7404, 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1344], </em>the Administrator may ... issue a permit for the discharge of any pollutant, . . . notwithstanding [CWA \u00a7 301(a), 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1311(a)], upon condition that such discharge will meet either (A) all applicable requirements under [CWA \u00a7301, 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1311; CWA \u00a7302, 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1312; CWA \u00a7306, 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1316; CWA \u00a7307, 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1317; CWA \u00a7308, 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1318; CWA \u00a7 403, 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1343], or (B) prior to the taking of necessary implementing actions relating to all such requirements, such conditions as the Administrator determines are necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter.\u201d 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1342(a)(1) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">Section 402 thus prohibits the EPA from exercising permitting authority that is \u201cprovided [to the Corps] in\u201d \u00a7 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>This is not to say the EPA has no role with respect to the environmental consequences of fill. The EPA\u2019s function is different, in regulating fill, from its function in regulating other pollutants, but the Agency does exercise some authority. Section 404 assigns the EPA two tasks in regard to fill material. First, the EPA must write guidelines for the Corps to follow in determining whether to permit a discharge of fill material. CWA \u00a7 404(b); 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1344(b). Second, the Act gives the EPA authority to \u201cprohibit\u201d any decision by the Corps to issue a permit for a particular disposal site. CWA \u00a7 404(c); 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1344(c). We, and the parties, refer to this as the EPA\u2019s power to veto a permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\">The Act is best understood to provide that if the Corps has authority to issue a permit for a discharge under \u00a7404, then the EPA lacks authority to do so under \u00a7 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Even if there were ambiguity on this point, the EPA\u2019s own regulations would resolve it. Those regulations provide that \u201cdischarges of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States which are regulated under section 404 of CWA\u201d \u201cdo not require [\u00a7402] permits\u201d from the EPA. 40 CFR \u00a7122.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">In SEACC\u2019s view, this regulation implies that some \u201cfill material\u201d discharges are not regulated under \u00a7404 \u2014 else, SEACC asks, why would the regulation lack a comma before the word \u201cwhich,\u201d and thereby imply that only a subset of \u201cdischarges of . . . fill material\u201d are \u201cregulated under section 404.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">The agencies, however, have interpreted this regulation otherwise. In the agencies\u2019 view the regulation essentially restates the text of \u00a7 402, and prohibits the EPA from issuing permits for discharges that \u201care regulated under section 404.\u201d 40 CFR \u00a7 122.3(b); cf. CWA \u00a7 402(a) (\u201c[e]xcept as provided in ... [\u00a7 404], the Administrator may . . . issue a permit\u201d). Before us, the EPA confirms this reading of the regulation. Brief for Federal Respondents 27. The Agency\u2019s interpretation is not \u201cplainly erroneous or inconsistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>the regulation\u201d; and so we accept it as correct. <em>Auer </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>519 U. S. 452, 461 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The question whether the EPA is the proper agency to regulate the slurry discharge thus depends on whether the Corps of Engineers has authority to do so. If the Corps has authority to issue a permit, then the EPA may not do so. We turn to the Corps\u2019 authority under \u00a7 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Section 404(a) gives the Corps power to \u201cissue permits ... for the discharge of dredged or fill material.\u201d 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1344(a). As all parties concede, the slurry meets the definition of fill material agreed upon by the agencies in a joint regulation promulgated in 2002. That regulation defines \u201cfill material\u201d to mean any \u201cmaterial [that] has the effect of . . . [c]hanging the bottom elevation\u201d of water \u2014 a definition that includes \u201cslurry, or tailings or similar mining-related materials.\u201d 40 CFR \u00a7 232.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">SEACC concedes that the slurry to be discharged meets the regulation\u2019s definition of fill material. Brief for Respondent SEACC et al. 20. Its concession on this point is appropriate because slurry falls well within the central understanding of the term \u201cfill,\u201d as shown by the examples given by the regulation. See 40 CFR \u00a7 232.2 (\u201cExamples of such fill material include, but are not limited to: rock, sand, soil, clay . . . \u201d). The regulation further excludes \u201ctrash or garbage\u201d from its definition. <em>Ibid. </em>SEACC expresses a concern that Coeur Alaska\u2019s interpretation of the statute will lead to \u00a7 404 permits authorizing the discharges of other solids that are now restricted by EPA standards. Brief for Respondent SEACC et al. 44-45 (listing, for example, \u201cfeces and uneaten feed,\u201d \u201clitter,\u201d and waste produced in \u201cbattery manufacturing\u201d). But these extreme instances are not presented by the cases now before us. If, in a future case, a discharger of one of these solids were to seek a \u00a7 404 permit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>the dispositive question for the agencies would be whether the solid at issue \u2014 for instance, \u201cfeces and uneaten feed\u201d\u2014 came within the regulation\u2019s definition of \u201cfill.\u201d SEACC cites no instance in which the agencies have so interpreted their fill regulation. If that instance did arise, and the agencies were to interpret the fill regulation as SEACC fears, then SEACC could challenge that decision as an unlawful interpretation of the fill regulation; or SEACC could claim that the fill regulation as interpreted is an unreasonable interpretation of \u00a7404. The difficulties are not presented here, however, because the slurry meets the regulation\u2019s definition of fill.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-3\">Rather than challenge the agencies\u2019 decision to define the slurry as fill, SEACC instead contends that \u00a7404 contains an implicit exception. According to SEACC, \u00a7 404 does not authorize the Corps to permit a discharge of fill material if that material is subject to an EPA new source performance standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">But \u00a7404\u2019s text does not limit its grant of power in this way. Instead, \u00a7 404 refers to all \u201cfill material\u201d without qualification. Nor do the EPA regulations support SEACC\u2019s reading of \u00a7 404. The EPA has enacted guidelines, pursuant to \u00a7 404(b), to guide the Corps\u2019 permitting decision. 40 CFR pt. 230. Those guidelines do not strip the Corps of power to issue permits for fill in cases where the fill is also subject to an EPA new source performance standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">SEACC\u2019s reading of \u00a7 404 would create numerous difficulties for the regulated industry. As the regulatory regime stands now, a discharger must ask a simple question \u2014 is the substance to be discharged fill material or not? The fill regulation, 40 CFR \u00a7232.2, offers a clear answer to that question; and under the agencies\u2019 view, that answer decides the matter \u2014 if the discharge is fill, the discharger must seek a \u00a7 404 permit from the Corps; if not, only then must the dis-charger consider whether any EPA performance standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>applies, so that the discharger requires a \u00a7 402 permit from the EPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Under SEACC\u2019s interpretation, however, the discharger would face a more difficult problem. The discharger would have to ask \u2014 is the fill material also subject to one of the many hundreds of EPA performance standards, so that the permit must come from the EPA, not the Corps? The statute gives no indication that Congress intended to burden industry with that confusing division of permit authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The regulatory scheme discloses a defined, and workable, line for determining whether the Corps or the EPA has the permit authority. Under this framework, the Corps of Engineers, and not the EPA, has authority to permit Coeur Alaska\u2019s discharge of the slurry.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">A second question remains: In issuing the permit did the Corps act in violation of a statutory mandate so that the issuance was \u201cnot in accordance with law\u201d? 5 U. S. C. \u00a7706(2)(A). SEACC contends that the slurry discharge will violate the EPA\u2019s new source performance standard and that the Corps\u2019 permit is made \u201cunlawful\u201d by CWA \u00a7 306(e). Petitioners and the agencies argue that the permit is lawful because the EPA performance standard and \u00a7 306(e) do not apply to fill material regulated by the Corps. In order to determine whether the Corps\u2019 permit is lawful we must answer the question: Do EPA performance standards, and \u00a7 306(e), apply to discharges of fill material?</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">We address in turn the statutory text of the CWA, the agencies\u2019 regulations construing it, and the EPA\u2019s subsequent interpretation of those regulations. Because Congress has not \u201cdirectly spoken\u201d to the \u201cprecise question\u201d of whether an EPA performance standard applies to discharges of fill material, the statute alone does not resolve the case. <em>Chevron U S. A. Inc. </em>v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U. S. 837, 842 (1984). We look first to the agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>regulations, which are entitled to deference if they resolve the ambiguity in a reasonable manner. <em>Ibid.; </em>see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mead Corp., </em>533 U. S. 218, 226-227 (2001). But the regulations, too, are ambiguous, so we next turn to the agencies\u2019 subsequent interpretation of those regulations. <em>Id., </em>at 234-238; <em>Auer, </em>519 U. S., at 461. In an internal memorandum the EPA explained that its performance standards do not apply to discharges of fill material. That interpretation is not \u201cplainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation[s],\u201d and so we accept it as correct. <em>Ibid, </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Though SEACC contends that the agencies\u2019 interpretation is not entitled to deference because it contradicts the agencies\u2019 published statements and prior practice, we disagree with SEACC\u2019s reading of those statements and of the regulatory record.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">As for the statutory argument, SEACC claims the CWA \u00a7404 permit is unlawful because \u00a7 306(e) forbids the slurry discharge. Petitioners and the federal agencies, in contrast, contend that \u00a7 306(e) does not apply to the slurry discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">To address SEACC\u2019s statutory argument, it is necessary to review the EPA\u2019s responsibilities under the CWA. As noted, \u00a7306 empowers the EPA to regulate the froth-flotation gold mining industry. See 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1316(b). Pursuant to this authority, EPA promulgated the new source performance standard relied upon by SEACC. The standard is stringent. If it were to apply here, it would allow \u201cno discharge of process wastewater\u201d from the mine. 40 CFR \u00a7 440.104(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">The term \u201cprocess wastewater\u201d includes solid waste. So the regulation forbids not only pollutants that dissolve in water but also solid pollutants suspended in water \u2014 what the Agency terms \u201ctotal suspended solids,\u201d or TSS. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>\u00a7 440.104(a) (limiting the amount of TSS from other kinds of mines); see also EPA Development Document for Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Ore Mining and Dressing Point Source Category 157-158 (Nov. 1982) (the amount of TSS in \u201cwastewater\u201d from froth-flotation mines is \u201cgenerally high\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 175 (Table VI-6) (measuring the amounts of TSS in samples of froth-flotation mines\u2019 discharges); <em>id., </em>at 194 (stating an intent to \u201cregulat[e]\u201d TSS); <em>id., </em>at 402 (evaluating the costs of constructing a \u201csettling pond\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 535 (concluding that even in mountainous regions, a froth-flotation mine will be able to construct a \u201ctailings impoundment\u201d to \u201cprovide a disposal area for mill tailings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Were there any doubt about whether the EPA\u2019s new source performance standard forbade solids as well as soluble pollutants, the Agency\u2019s action in these cases would resolve it. Here, the EPA\u2019s \u00a7402 permit authorizes Coeur Alaska to discharge water from Lower Slate Lake into a downstream creek, provided the water meets the quality requirements set by the performance standard. This demonstrates that the performance standard regulates solid waste. The EPA\u2019s permit not only restricts the amount of total suspended solids, App. 327a (Table 3), but also prohibits the mine from allowing any \u201cfloating solids\u201d to flow from the lake. <em>Id., </em>at 328a. No party disputes the EPA\u2019s authority to regulate these discharges of solid mining waste; and no party questions the validity of the EPA\u2019s new source performance standard when it is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">When the performance standard applies to a point source, \u00a7 306(e) makes it \u201cunlawful\u201d for that point source to violate it: \u201c[I]t shall be unlawful for any owner or operator of any new source to operate such source in violation of any standard of performance applicable to such source.\u201d CWA \u00a7 306(e), 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1316(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">SEACC argues that this provision, \u00a7 306(e), prohibits the mine from discharging slurry into Lower Slate Lake. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>SEACC contends the new source performance standard is, in the words of \u00a7 806(e), \u201capplicable to\u201d the mine. Both the text of the performance standard and the EPA\u2019s application of it to the discharge of mining waste from Lower Slate Lake demonstrate that the performance standard is \u201capplicable to\u201d Coeur Alaska\u2019s mine in some circumstances. And so, SEACC reasons, it follows that because the new source performance standard forbids even minute discharges of solid waste, it also forbids the slurry discharge, 30 percent of which is solid waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-3\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">For their part, the State of Alaska and the federal agencies claim that the Act is unambiguous in the opposite direction. They rely on \u00a7 404 of the Act. As explained above, that section authorizes the Corps of Engineers to determine whether to issue a permit allowing the discharge of the slurry. Petitioners and the agencies argue that \u00a7404 grants the Corps authority to do so without regard to the EPA\u2019s new source performance standard or the \u00a7 306(e) prohibition discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Petitioners and the agencies make two statutory arguments based on \u00a7 404\u2019s silence in regard to \u00a7 306. First, they note that nothing in \u00a7 404 requires the Corps to consider the EPA\u2019s new source performance standard or the \u00a7 306(e) prohibition. That silence advances the argument that \u00a7404\u2019s grant of authority to \u201cissue permits\u201d contradicts \u00a7306(e)\u2019s declaration that discharges in violation of new source per-. formance standards are \u201cunlawful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Second, petitioners and the agencies point to \u00a7404(p), which protects \u00a7 404 permitees from enforcement actions by the EPA or private citizens:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">\u201cCompliance with a permit issued pursuant to this section . . . shall be deemed compliance, for purposes of sections 1319 [CWA \u00a7309] and 1365 [CWA \u00a7505] of this title, with sections 1311 [CWA \u00a7301], 1317 [CWA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>\u00a7307], and 1343 [CWA \u00a7403] of this title.\u201d 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1344(p).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Here again, their argument is that silence is significant. Section 404(p) protects the permittee from lawsuits alleging violations of CWA \u00a7 301 (which bars the discharge of \u201cany pollutant\u201d \u201c[e]xcept as in compliance\u201d with the Act); \u00a7307 (which bars the discharge of \u201ctoxic pollutants\u201d); and \u00a7403 (which bars discharges into the sea). But \u00a7 404(p) does not in express terms protect the permittee from a lawsuit alleging a violation of \u00a7 306(e) or of the EPA\u2019s new source performance standards. Section 404(p)\u2019s silence regarding \u00a7 306 is made even more significant because a parallel provision in \u00a7 402 does protect a \u00a7 402 permittee from an enforcement action alleging a violation of \u00a7306. CWA \u00a7402(k), 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1342(k).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">In our view, Congress\u2019 omission of \u00a7306 from \u00a7404, and its inclusion of \u00a7306 in \u00a7402(k), is evidence that Congress did not intend \u00a7 306(e) to apply to Corps \u00a7 404 permits or to discharges of fill material. If \u00a7 306 did apply, then the Corps would be required to evaluate each permit application for compliance with \u00a7 306, and issue a permit only if it found the discharge would comply with \u00a7 306. But even if that finding were made, it is not clear that the \u00a7404 permittee would be protected from a suit seeking a judicial determination that the discharge violates \u00a7 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">The CWA is ambiguous on the question whether \u00a7 306 applies to discharges of fill material regulated under \u00a7 404. On the one hand, \u00a7306 provides that a discharge that violates an EPA new source performance standard is \u201cunlawful\u201d\u2014 without any exception for fill material. On the other hand, \u00a7404 grants the Corps blanket authority to permit the discharge of fill material \u2014 without any mention of \u00a7 306. This tension indicates that Congress has not \u201cdirectly spoken\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>the \u201cprecise question\u201d whether \u00a7 306 applies to discharges of fill material. <em>Chevron, </em>467 U. S., at 842.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Before turning to how the agencies have resolved that question, we consider the formal regulations that bear on \u00a7\u00a7306 and 404. See <em>Mead, </em>533 U. S., at 234-238. The regulations, like the statutes, do not address the question whether \u00a7 306, and the EPA new source performance standards promulgated under it, applies to \u00a7 404 permits and the discharges they authorize. There is no regulation, for example, interpreting \u00a7 306(e)\u2019s text \u2014 \u201cstandard of performance applicable to such source\u201d \u2014 to mean that a performance standard ceases to be \u201capplicable\u201d the moment the discharge qualifies as fill material, which would resolve the cases in petitioners\u2019 favor. Nor is there a regulation providing that the Corps, in deciding whether to grant a permit under \u00a7 404, must deny that permit if the discharge would violate \u00a7 306(e), which would decide the cases for SEACC.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Rather than address the tension between \u00a7\u00a7 306 and 404, the regulations instead implement the statutory framework without elaboration on this point. Each of the two principal regulations, which have been mentioned above, seems to stand on its own without reference to the other. The EPA\u2019s new source performance standard contains no exception for fill material; and it forbids any discharge of \u201cprocess wastewater,\u201d a term that includes solid wastes. 40 CFR \u00a7440.104(b)(1); see Part III-A-1, <em>supra. </em>The agencies\u2019 joint regulation defining fill material is also unqualified. It includes \u201cslurry, or tailings or similar mining-related materials\u201d in its definition of a \u201cdischarge of fill material,\u201d 40 CFR \u00a7 232.2; and it contains no exception for slurry that is regulated by an EPA performance standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The parties point to additional regulations, but these pro- \u25a0 visions do not offer a clear basis of reconciliation. An EPA regulation, mentioned above, provides that \u201c [discharges of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>dredged or fill material into waters of the United States which are regulated under section 404 of CWA\u201d \u201cdo not require [\u00a7 402] permits\u201d from the EPA. \u00a7 122.3. As we have explained, however, this merely states that a permit for this discharge cannot be issued by the EPA. See Part II, <em>supra. </em>The regulation does not answer the question whether the EPA\u2019s new source performance standard and \u00a7 306(e) apply to a discharge regulated by the Corps under \u00a7 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">The agencies also direct us to the \u00a7 404(b) guidelines written by the EPA to guide the Corps permitting decision. See' 40 CFR pt. 230. The agencies note that these guidelines do not expressly require the Corps, in issuing a permit, to consider whether the discharge would violate EPA\u2019s performance standards. Here we think failure to mention \u00a7 306 or the EPA new source performance standards does offer some indication that these are not relevant to the \u00a7404 permit, though the argument falls short of being conclusive. The Corps\u2019 own regulations require the agency to evaluate permit applications \u201cfor compliance with applicable [EPA] effluent limitations.\u201d 33 CFR \u00a7 320.4(d) (2008). The regulations do not answer whether the new source performance standard is \u201capplicable\u201d to a discharge of fill material.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The regulations do not give a definitive answer to the question whether \u00a7306 applies to discharges regulated by the Corps under \u00a7 404, but we do find that agency interpretation and agency application of the regulations are instructive and to the point. <em>Auer, </em>519 U. S., at 461. The question is addressed and resolved in a reasonable and coherent way by the practice and policy of the two agencies, all as recited in a memorandum written in May 2004 by Diane Regas, then the Director of the EPA\u2019s Office of Wetlands, Oceans and Watersheds, to Randy Smith, the Director of the EPA\u2019s regional Office of Water with responsibility over the mine. App. 141a-149a (Regas Memorandum). The Memorandum, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>though not subject to sufficiently formal procedures to merit <em>Chevron </em>deference, see <em>Mead, supra, </em>at 234-238, is entitled to a measure of deference because it interprets the agencies\u2019 own regulatory scheme. See <em>Auer, supra, </em>at 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\">The Regas Memorandum explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-4\">\u201cAs a result [of the fact that the discharge is regulated under \u00a7404], the regulatory regime applicable to discharges under section 402, including effluent limitations guidelines and standards, such as those applicable to gold ore mining ... do not apply to the placement of tailings into the proposed impoundment [of Lower Slate Lake]. See 40 CFR \u00a7 122.3(b).\u201d App. 144a-145a.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The regulation that the Memorandum cites \u2014 40 CFR \u00a7122.3 \u2014 is one we considered above and found ambiguous. That regulation provides: \u201cDischarges of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States which are regulated under section 404 of CWA\u201d \u201cdo not require [\u00a7402] permits.\u201d The Regas Memorandum takes an instructive interpretive step when it explains that because the discharge \u201cdo[es] not require\u201d an EPA permit, <em>ibid., </em>the EPA\u2019s performance standard \u201cdo[es] not apply\u201d to the discharge. App. 145a. The Memorandum presents a reasonable interpretation of the regulatory regime. We defer to the interpretation because it is not \u201cplainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation[s].\u201d <em>Auer, supra, </em>at 461 (internal quotation marks omitted). Five factors inform that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">First, the Memorandum preserves a role for the EPA\u2019s performance standard. It confines the Memorandum\u2019s scope to closed bodies of water, like the lake here. App. 142a-143a, n. 1. When slurry is discharged into a closed body of water, the Memorandum explains, the EPA\u2019s performance standard retains an important role in regulating the discharge into surrounding waters. The Memorandum does not purport to invalidate the EPA\u2019s performance standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Second, the Memorandum acknowledges that this is not an instance in which the discharger attempts to evade the requirements of the EPA\u2019s performance standard. The Kensington Mine is not, for example, a project that smuggles a discharge of EPA-regulated pollutants into a separate discharge of Corps-regulated fill material. The instant cases do not present a process or plan designed to manipulate the outer boundaries of the definition of \u201cfill material\u201d by labeling minute quantities of EPA-regulated solids as fill. The Memorandum states that when a discharge has only an \u201cincidental filling effect,\u201d the EPA\u2019s performance standard continues to govern that discharge. <em>Id., </em>at 145a.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Third, the Memorandum\u2019s interpretation preserves the Corps\u2019 authority to determine whether a discharge is in the public interest. See 33 CFR \u00a7 320.4(a)(1); 40 CFR \u00a7230.10. The Corps has significant expertise in making this determination. Applying it, the Corps determined that placing slurry in the lake will improve that body of water by making it wider, shallower, and so more capable of sustaining aquatic life. The Corps determined, furthermore, that the alternative \u2014 a heap of tailings larger than the Pentagon placed upon wetlands \u2014 would cause more harm to the environment. Because the Memorandum preserves an important role for the Corps\u2019 expertise, its conclusion that the EPA\u2019s performance standard does not apply is a reasonable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Fourth, the Regas Memorandum\u2019s interpretation does not allow toxic pollutants (as distinguished from other, less dangerous pollutants, such as slurry) to enter the navigable waters. The EPA has regulated toxic pollutants under a separate provision, \u00a7307 of the CWA, and the EPA\u2019s \u00a7 404(b) guidelines require the Corps to deny a \u00a7404 permit for any discharge that would violate the EPA\u2019s \u00a7307 toxic-effluent limitations. 40 CFR \u00a7 230.10(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Fifth, as a final reason to defer to the Regas Memorandum, we find it a sensible and rational construction that reconciles \u00a7\u00a7306, 402, and 404, and the regulations implementing them, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>which the alternatives put forward by the parties do not. SEACC\u2019s argument, that \u00a7 402 applies to this discharge and not \u00a7 404, is not consistent with the statute and regulations, as already noted. See Part II, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-3\">The Court requested the parties to submit supplemental briefs addressing whether the CWA contemplated that both agencies would issue a permit for a discharge. 556 U. S. 1219 (2009). A two-permit regime would allow the EPA to apply its performance standard, while the Corps could apply its \u00a7 404(b) criteria. The parties agree, however, that a two-permit regime is contrary to the statute and the regulations. We conclude that this is correct. A two-permit regime would cause confusion, delay, expense, and uncertainty in the permitting process. In agreement with all of the parties, we conclude that, when a permit is required to discharge fill material, either a \u00a7 402 or a \u00a7 404 permit is necessary. Here, we now hold, \u00a7 404 applies, not \u00a7 402. See Part II, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The Regas Memorandum\u2019s interpretation of the agencies\u2019 regulations is consistent with the regulatory scheme as a whole. The Memorandum preserves a role for the EPA\u2019s performance standards; it guards against the possibility of evasion of those standards; it employs the Corps\u2019 expertise in evaluating the effects of fill material on the aquatic environment; it does not allow toxic pollutants to be discharged; and we have been offered no better way to harmonize the regulations. We defer to the EPA\u2019s conclusion that its performance standard does not apply to the initial discharge of slurry into the lake but applies only to the later discharge of water from the lake into the downstream creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">SEACC argues against deference to the Regas Memorandum. In its view the Regas Memorandum is contrary to published agency statements and earlier agency practice. SEACC cites three agency statements: A 1986 \u201cmemorandum of understanding\u201d between the EPA and the Corps re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>garding the definition of fill material; the preamble to the agencies\u2019 current 2002 fill regulation; and comments made by the agencies in promulgating the 2002 fill regulation. These arguments are not convincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">In 1986, to reconcile their then-differing definitions of \u201cfill material,\u201d the EPA and the Corps issued a \u201cmemorandum of agreement.\u201d 51 Fed. Reg. 8871 (MOA). The memorandum was not made subject to notice-and-comment procedures, but it was published in the Federal Register. It defined the statutory term \u201cfill material\u201d until the current definition took effect in 2002. Brief for Federal Respondents 30-31, n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">SEACC points to paragraph B(5) of the MOA, which reads:'</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">\u201c[A] pollutant (other than dredged material) will normally be considered by EPA and the Corps to be subject to section 402 if it is a discharge in liquid, semi-liquid, or suspended form or if it is a discharge of solid material of a homogeneous nature normally associated with single industry wastes .... These materials include placer mining wastes, phosphate mining wastes, titanium mining wastes, sand and gravel wastes, fly ash, and drilling muds. As appropriate, EPA and the Corps will identify additional such materials.\u201d 51 Fed. Reg. 8872.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">It is true, as SEACC notes, that this passage suggests that \u00a7402 will \u201cnormally\u201d apply to discharges of \u201csuspended\u201d\u2014 <em>i. e., </em>solid \u2014 pollutants. But that statement is not contrary to the Regas Memorandum, which acknowledges that the EPA retains authority under \u00a7 402 to regulate the discharge of suspended solids from Lower Slate Lake into downstream waters. This passage does not address the question presented by these cases, and answered by the Regas Memorandum, as to whether the EPA\u2019s performance standard applies when the discharge qualifies as fill material. In fact, the MOA\u2019s preamble suggests that when a discharge qualifies as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>\u201cfill material,\u201d the Corps retains authority to regulate it under \u00a7404:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-3\">\u201cDischarges listed in the Corps definition of \u2018discharge of fill material,\u2019 . . . remain subject to section 404 even if they occur in association with discharges of wastes meeting the criteria in the agreement for section 402 discharges.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 8871.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">The MOA is quite consistent with the agencies\u2019 determination that the Corps regulates all discharges of fill material and that \u00a7 306 does not apply to these discharges.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">SEACC draws our attention to the preamble of the current fill material regulation. 67 Fed. Reg. 31129 (2002) (final rule). It cites the opening passages of the preamble, which state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">\u201c[Tjoday\u2019s rule is generally consistent with current agency practice and so it does not expand the types of discharges that will be covered under section 404.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 31133.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">In SEACC\u2019s view, this passage demonstrates that the fill rule was not intended to displace the pre-existing froth-flotation gold mine performance standard, which has been on the books since 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">The preamble goes on to say, in a section entitled \u201cEffluent Guideline Limitations and 402 Permits\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-10\">\u201c[W]e emphasize that today\u2019s rule generally is intended to maintain our existing approach to regulating pollutants under either section 402 or 404 of the CWA. Effluent limitation guidelines and new source performance standards (\u2018effluent guidelines\u2019) promulgated under section 304 and 306 of the CWA establish limitations and standards for specified wastestreams from industrial categories, and those limitations and standards are in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>corporated into permits issued under section 402 of the Act. EPA has never sought to regulate fill material under effluent guidelines. Rather, effluent guidelines restrict discharges of pollutants from identified waste-streams based upon the pollutant reduction capabilities of available treatment technologies. Recognizing that some discharges (such as suspended or settleable solids) can have the associated effect, over time, of raising the bottom elevation of a water due to settling of waterborne pollutants, we do not consider such pollutants to be \u2018fill material,\u2019 and nothing in today\u2019s rule changes that view. Nor does today\u2019s rule change any determination we have made regarding discharges that are subject to an effluent limitation guideline and standards, which will continue to be regulated under section 402 of the CWA. Similarly, this rule does not alter the manner in which water quality standards currently apply under the section 402 or the section 404 programs.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 31135.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Although the preamble asserts it does not change agency policy with regard to EPA performance standards and \u00a7 402 permitting decisions, it is explicit in noting that the EPA has \u201cnever sought to regulate fill material under effluent guidelines.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The preamble, then, is consistent with the Regas Memorandum. If a discharge does not qualify as fill material, the EPA\u2019s new source performance standard applies. If the discharge qualifies as fill, the performance standard does not apply; and there was no earlier agency practice or policy to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">SEACC also cites remarks made by the agencies in response to public comments on the proposed fill material regulation. App. 22a-127a. These remarks were incorporated by reference into the administrative record. 67 Fed. Reg. 31131.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Responding to a question about whether \u201cmine tailings\u201d would be \u201csubject to section 404 regulation as opposed to section 402\u201d under the 2002 fill regulation, the agencies stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-3\">\u201cToday\u2019s final rule clarifies that any material that has the effect of fill is regulated under section 404 and further that the placement of \u2018overburden, slurry, or tailings or similar mining-related materials\u2019 is considered a discharge of fill material. Nevertheless, if EPA has previously determined that certain materials are subject to an [effluent limitation guideline] under specific circumstances, then that determination remains valid. Moreover,... permits issued pursuant to section 402 are intended to regulate process water and provide effluent limits that are protective of receiving water quality. This distinction provides the framework for today\u2019s rule.\u201d App. 48a.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">This statement is not conclusive of the issue. SEACC notes that this response, like the regulation\u2019s preamble, pledges that EPA\u2019s \u201cpreviou[s] determination^]\u201d with regard to the application of performance standards \u201cremai[n] valid.\u201d But, as noted above, the Regas Memorandum has followed this policy by applying the EPA\u2019s performance standard to the discharge of water from the lake into the downstream creek. The response does not state that the EPA will apply its performance standards to discharges of fill material.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">4</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The agencies\u2019 published statements indicate adherence to the EPA\u2019s previous application and interpretation of its performance standards. SEACC cannot show that the agencies have changed their interpretation or application of their regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">SEACC cites no instance in which the EPA has applied one of its performance standards to a discharge of fill mate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>rial. By contrast, Coeur Alaska cites two instances in which the Corps issued a \u00a7404 permit authorizing a mine to discharge solid waste (tailings) as fill material. See Brief for Petitioner Coeur Alaska 40-42. SEACC objects that those two \u00a7404 permits authorized discharges that used the tailings to construct useful structures \u2014 a dam in one ease, a tailings pond in another. Here, by contrast, SEACC contends that the primary purpose of the discharge is to use a navigable water to dispose of waste. <em>Ibid. </em>But that objection misses the point. The two \u00a7404 permits cited by Coeur Alaska illustrate that the agencies did not have a prior practice of applying EPA performance standards to discharges of mining wastes that qualify as fill material.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">SEACC has not demonstrated that the agencies have changed their policy, and it cannot show that the Regas Memorandum is contrary to the agencies\u2019 published statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">- We accord deference to the agencies\u2019 reasonable decision to continue their prior practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and these cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b339-10\">Justice Breyer,</author>\n<p id=\"AB\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">As I understand the Court\u2019s opinion, it recognizes a legal zone within which the regulating agencies might reasonably classify material either as \u201cdredged or fill material\u201d subject to \u00a7 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1344(a), or as a \u201cpollutant,\u201d subject to \u00a7\u00a7402 and 306, 33 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1342(a), 1316(a). Within this zone, the law authorizes the environmental agencies to classify material as the one or the other, so long as they act within the bounds of relevant regulations, and provided that the classification, considered in terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>the purposes of the statutes and relevant regulations, is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\">This approach reflects the difficulty of applying \u00a7\u00a7402 and 306 literally to <em>every </em>new-source-related discharge of a \u201cpollutant.\u201d The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) applies \u00a7306 new source \u201cperformance standards\u201d to a wide variety of discharges, ranging, for example, from those involved in the processing of apples into apple juice or apple cider, 40 CFR \u00a7407.10 (2008); to the manufacturing of cement, \u00a7411.10; to the production of fresh meat cuts by a meatcutter, \u00a7 432.60; and to the manufacture of pharmaceutical products by fermentation, \u00a7439.10. See generally 40 CFR pts. 405-471 (containing more than 800 pages of \u201cnew source performance\u201d and effluent limitation regulations). At the same time the regulations for any one point source often regulate numerous chemicals, minerals, and other substances produced by that point source; in the case of fermentation products, for example, the regulations provide performance standards for roughly 30 different chemicals. \u00a7439.15. These \u201cstandards of performance\u201d \u201creflect the greatest degree of effluent reduction which the Administrator determines to be achievable through application of the best available demonstrated control technology ... including, where practicable, a standard permitting no discharge of pollutants.\u201d 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1316(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">To literally apply these performance standards so as to forbid the use of any of these substances as \u201cfill,\u201d even when, say, they constitute no more than trace elements in dirt, crushed rock, or sand that is clearly being used as \u201cfill\u201d to build a levee or to replace dirt removed from a lake bottom may prove unnecessarily strict, cf. \u00a7 1362(6) (defining \u201cpollutant\u201d to include \u201crock\u201d), to the point that such application would undermine the objective of \u00a7404, which foresees the use of \u201cdredged or fill material\u201d in certain circumstances and with approval of the relevant agencies, \u00a7 1344. At minimum, the EPA might reasonably read the statute and the applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>ble regulations as allowing the use of such material, say, crushed rock, as \u201cfill\u201d in some of these situations. Cf. <em>Chevron U. S. A. Inc. </em>v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U. S. 837, 842-844 (1984); <em>Auer </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>519 U. S. 452, 461 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">At the same time, I recognize the danger that Justice Ginsburg warns against, namely, that \u201c[w]hole categories of regulated industries\u201d might \u201cgain immunity from a variety of pollution-control standards,\u201d if, say, a \u00a7 404-permit applicant simply adds \u201csufficient solid matter\u201d to a pollutant \u201cto raise the bottom of a water body,\u201d thereby turning a \u201cpollutant\u201d governed by \u00a7 306 into \u201cfill\u201d governed by \u00a7 404. <em>Post, </em>at 302 (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Yet there are safeguards against that occurring. For one thing, as the Court recognizes, see <em>ante, </em>at 275, it is not the case that <em>any </em>material that has the \u201c \u2018effect of... [c]hanging the bottom elevation\u2019 \u201d of the body of water is automatically subject to \u00a7404, not \u00a7402. The EPA has never suggested that it would interpret the regulations so as to turn \u00a7 404 into a loophole, permitting evasion of a \u201cperformance standard\u201d simply because a polluter discharges enough pollutant to raise the bottom elevation of the body of water. For another thing, even where a matter is determined reasonably to be \u201cfill\u201d and consequently falls within \u00a7404, the EPA can retain an important role in the permitting process. That is because the EPA may veto any \u00a7404 plan that it finds has an \u201cunacceptable adverse effect on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds and fishery areas .. ., wildlife, or recreational areas.\u201d \u00a7 1344(c). Finally, the EPA\u2019s decision not to apply \u00a7 306, but to allow permitting to proceed under \u00a7 404, must be a reasonable decision; and court review will help ensure that is so. 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">In these cases, it seems to me that the EPA\u2019s interpretation of the statute as permitting the EPA/Corps of Engineers \u201cfill\u201d definition to apply to the cases at hand is reasonable, hence lawful. Lower Slate Lake, located roughly three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>miles from the Kensington Gold Mine, is 51 feet deep, 800 feet wide, and 2,000 feet long; downstream from the lake is Slate Creek. Faced with a difficult choice between creating a huge pile of slurry on nearby wetlands or using part of the lake as a storage facility for mine tailings, see App. 294a-298a; see also <em>ante, </em>at 268-270, the EPA arrived at a compromise. On the one hand, it would treat mine tailings placed directly into the lake as \u201cfill\u201d under the \u00a7404 permitting program. App. 144a. The tailings, the EPA recognized, would have the \u201cimmediate effect of filling the areas of water into which they are discharged.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>But it would also treat any spillover of the tailings, or chemicals from the tailings, into any nearby waterway, most particularly Slate Creek (running out of Slate Lake) as requiring a \u00a7 402 permit. The EPA\u2019s \u00a7306 \u201cperformance standard\u201d would apply and that standard insists upon <em>no discharge of process wastewater at all. Id., </em>at 145a; see also 40 CFR \u00a7 440.104(b). The EPA reached this result because it recognized that, even though pollutants discharged into the creek might come \u201cin the form of suspended and settleable solids,\u201d such solids would \u201chave, at most, an incidental filling effect.\u201d App. 145a. The EPA thereby sought to apply the distinction it had previously recognized between discharges that have the immediate effect of raising the bottom elevation of water, and those that only have the \u201cassociated effect, over time, of raising the bottom elevation of a water due to settling of waterborne pollutants.\u201d See 67 Fed. Reg. 31135 (2002) (concluding that \u00a7402 applies to the latter); see also Brief for G. Tracy Mehan III as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>22-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\">I cannot say whether the EPA\u2019s compromise represents the best overall environmental result; but I do believe it amounts to the kind of detailed decision that the statutes delegate authority to the EPA, not the courts, to make (subject to the bounds of reasonableness). I believe the Court\u2019s views are consistent with those I here express. And with that understanding, I join its opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Justice Scalia,</author>\n<p id=\"A5M\">concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">I join the opinion of the Court, except for its protestation, <em>ante, </em>at 283-284, that it is not according <em>Chevron </em>deference to the reasonable interpretation set forth in the memorandum sent by the Director of the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) Office of Wetlands, Oceans and Watersheds, to the Director of the EPA\u2019s regional Office of Water with responsibility over the Coeur Alaska mine \u2014 an interpretation consistently followed by both the EPA and the Corps of Engineers, and adopted by both agencies in the proceedings before this Court. See <em>Chevron U. S. A. Inc. </em>v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U. S. 837 (1984). The opinion purports to give this agency interpretation \u201ca measure of deference\u201d because it involves an interpretation of \u201cthe agencies\u2019 own regulatory scheme\u201d and \u201c \u2018the regulatory regime,\u2019 \u201d <em>ante, </em>at 284 (citing <em>Auer </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>519 U. S. 452, 461 (1997)). <em>Auer, </em>however, stands only for the principle that we defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation <em>of its own ambiguous regulation. </em>But it becomes obvious from the ensuing discussion that the referenced \u201cregulatory scheme,\u201d and \u201cregulatory regime\u201d for which the Court accepts the agency interpretation, includes not just the agencies\u2019 own regulations but also (and indeed primarily) the conformity of those regulations with the ambiguous governing statute, which is the primary dispute here.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Surely the Court is not adding to our already inscrutable opinion in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mead Corp., </em>533 U. S. 218 (2001), the irrational fillip that an agency position which otherwise does not qualify for <em>Chevron </em>deference <em>does </em>receive <em>Chevron </em>deference if it clarifies not just an ambiguous statute but <em>also </em>an ambiguous regulation. One must conclude, then, that if today\u2019s opinion is <em>not </em>according the agencies\u2019 reasonable and authoritative interpretation of the Clean Water Act <em>Chevron </em>deference, it is according some <em>new </em>type of deference \u2014 perhaps to be called in the future <em>Coeur Alaska </em>deference\u2014 which is identical to <em>Chevron </em>deference except for the name.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>The Court\u2019s deference to the EPA and the Corps of Engineers in today\u2019s cases is eminently reasonable. It is quite impossible to achieve predictable (and relatively litigation-free) administration of the vast body of complex laws committed to the charge of executive agencies without the assurance that reviewing courts will accept reasonable and authoritative agency interpretation of ambiguous provisions. If we must not call that practice <em>Chevron </em>deference, then we have to rechristen the rose. Of course the only reason a new name is required is our misguided opinion in <em>Mead, </em>whose incomprehensible criteria for <em>Chevron </em>deference have produced so much confusion in the lower courts<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> that there has now appeared the phenomenon of <em>Chevron </em>avoidance \u2014 the practice of declining to opine whether <em>Chevron </em>applies or not.

C. \u00a7 1251(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">In service of its goals, Congress issued a core command: \u201c[T]he discharge of any pollutant by any person shall be unlawful,\u201d except in compliance with the Act\u2019s terms. \u00a7 1311(a). The Act\u2019s substantive requirements \u2014 housed primarily in Subchapter III, \u201cStandards and Enforcement\u201d\u2014 establish \u201ca comprehensive regulatory program supervised by an expert administrative agency,\u201d EPA. <em>Milwaukee </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>451 U.S. 304, 317 (1981). See also 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1251(d) (\u201cExcept as otherwise expressly provided . . . , the Administrator of [EPA] shall administer this [Act].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">The Act instructs EPA to establish various technology-based, increasingly stringent effluent limitations for categories of point sources. <em>E. g., </em>\u00a7\u00a71311, 1314. These limitations, formulated as restrictions \u201con quantities, rates, and concentrations of chemical, physical, biological, and other constituents,\u201d \u00a71362(11), were imposed to achieve national uniformity among categories of sources. See, <em>e. g., E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Train, </em>430 U. S. 112, 129-130 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>(1977). The limitations for a given discharge depend on the type of pollutant and source at issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AmA\">Of key importance, new sources must meet stringent \u201cstandards of performance\u201d adopted by EPA under \u00a7 306(e). That section makes it \u201cunlawful for <em>any </em>. . . new source to operate ... in violation of\u201d an applicable performance standard. 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1316(e) (emphasis added). In line with Congress\u2019 aim \u201cto insure . . . \u2018maximum feasible control of new sources,\u2019 \u201d <em>du Pont, </em>430 U. S., at 138, the preferred standard for a new source is one \u201c \u2018permitting <em>no </em>discharge of pollutants,\u2019 \u201d <em>id., </em>at 137-138 (quoting 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1316(a)(1); emphasis added). Moreover, new sources, unlike existing sources, are not eligible for EPA-granted variances from applicable limitations. 430 U. S., at 138.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">In 1982, EPA promulgated new source performance standards for facilities engaged in mining, including those using a froth-flotation milling process. See Ore Mining and Dressing Point Source Category Effluent Limitations Guidelines and New Source Performance Standards, 47 Fed. Reg. 54598. Existing mills, EPA found, were already achieving zero discharge; it was therefore practicable, EPA concluded, for new mills to do as well. <em>Id., </em>at 54602. Accordingly, under 40 CFR \u00a7 440.104(b)(1), new mines using the froth-flotation method, as Coeur Alaska proposes to do, may not discharge wastewater directly into waters of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\">The nationwide pollution-control requirements just described are implemented through the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), a permitting scheme set forth in \u00a7 402 and administered by EPA and the States. The NPDES is the linchpin of the Act, for it transforms generally applicable effluent limitations into the individual obligations of each discharger. <em>EPA </em>v. <em>California ex rel. State Water Resources Control Bd., </em>426 U. S. 200, 205 (1976). The discharge of a pollutant is generally prohibited unless the source has obtained an NPDES permit. <em>E. g., EPA </em>v. <em>National Crushed Stone Assn., </em>449 U. S. 64, 71 (1980) (\u201cSection 402 authorizes the establishment of the [NPDES], under which every discharger of pollutants is required to obtain a permit.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">The Act also establishes a separate permitting scheme, administered by the Corps, for discharges of \u201cdredged or fill material.\u201d 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1344(a). Section 404 hews to the Corps\u2019 established expertise in matters of navigability and construction. The \u00a7404 program does not implement the uniform, technology-based pollution-control standards set out, <em>inter alia, </em>in \u00a7 306. Instead, \u00a7 404 permits are subject to regulatory guidelines based generally on the impact of a discharge on the receiving environment. See \u00a7 1344(b); <em>ante, </em>at 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">As the above-described statutory background indicates, Coeur Alaska\u2019s claim to a \u00a7 404 permit carries weighty implications. If eligible for that permit, Coeur Alaska can evade the exacting performance standard prescribed by EPA for froth-flotation mills. It may, instead, use Lower Slate Lake \u201cas the settling pond and disposal site for the tailings.\u201d App. 360a (Corps\u2019 Record of Decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Is a pollutant discharge prohibited under \u00a7 306(e) eligible to receive a \u00a7 404 permit as a discharge of fill material? All <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>agree on preliminary matters. Only one agency, the Corps or EPA, can issue a permit for the discharge. See <em>ante, </em>at 274, 286. Only EPA, through the NPDES program, issues permits that implement \u00a7 306. See <em>supra, </em>at 297-298. Further, \u00a7 306(e) and EPA\u2019s froth-flotation performance standard, unless inapplicable here, bar Coeur Alaska\u2019s proposed discharge. See <em>ante, </em>at 278-279.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">No part of the statutory scheme, in my view, calls into question the governance of EPA\u2019s performance standard. The text of \u00a7 306(e) states a clear proscription: \u201c[I]t shall be unlawful for any owner or operator of any new source to operate such source in violation of any standard of performance applicable to such source.\u201d 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1316(e). Under the standard of performance relevant here, \u201cthere shall be no discharge of process wastewater to navigable waters from mills that use the froth-flotation process\u201d for mining gold. 40 CFR \u00a7 440.104(b)(1). The Act imposes these requirements without qualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Section 404, stating that the Corps \u201cmay issue permits\u201d for the discharge of \u201cdredged or fill material,\u201d does not create an exception to \u00a7 306(e)\u2019s plain command. 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1344(a). Cf. <em>ante, </em>at 276. Section 404 neither mentions \u00a7306 nor states a contrary requirement. The Act can be home to both provisions, with no words added or omitted, so long as the category of \u201cdredged or fill material\u201d eligible for a \u00a7 404 permit is read in harmony with \u00a7 306. Doing so yields a simple rule: Discharges governed by EPA performance standards are subject to EPA\u2019s administration and receive permits under the NPDES, not \u00a7 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">This reading accords with the Act\u2019s structure and objectives. It retains, through the NPDES, uniform application of the Act\u2019s core pollution-control requirements, and it respects Congress\u2019 special concern for new sources. Leaving pollution-related decisions to EPA, moreover, is consistent with Congress\u2019 delegation to that Agency of primary responsibility to administer the Act. Most fundamental, adhering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>to \u00a7 306(e)\u2019s instruction honors the overriding statutory goal of eliminating water pollution, and Congress\u2019 particular rejection of the use of navigable waters as waste disposal sites. See <em>supra, </em>at 298-301. See also 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1324 (creating \u201cclean lakes\u201d program requiring States to identify and restore polluted lakes).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\">The Court\u2019s reading, in contrast, strains credulity. A discharge of a pollutant, otherwise prohibited by firm statutory command, becomes lawful if it contains sufficient solid matter to raise the bottom of a water body, transformed into a waste disposal facility. Whole categories of regulated industries can thereby gain immunity from a variety of pollution-control standards. The loophole would swallow not only standards governing mining activities, see 40 CFR pt. 440 (effluent limitations and new source performance standards for ore mining and dressing); <em>id., </em>pt. 434 (coal mining); <em>id., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>pt. 436 (mineral mining), but also standards for dozens of other categories of regulated point sources, see, <em>e. g., id., </em>pt. 411 (cement manufacturing); <em>id., </em>pt. 425 (leather tanning and finishing); <em>id., </em>pt. 432 (meat and poultry products processing). See also Brief for American Rivers et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>26-27 (observing that discharges in these categories \u201ctypically contain high volumes of solids\u201d). Providing an escape hatch for polluters whose discharges contain solid matter, it bears noting, is particularly perverse; the Act specifically focuses on solids as harmful pollutants. See 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1314(a)(4) (requiring EPA to publish information regarding \u201cconventional pollutants,\u201d including \u201csuspended solids\u201d); Brief for American Rivers, <em>supra, </em>at 28-29, and n. 18 (identifying over 50 effluent limitations that restrict total suspended solids).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Congress, we have recognized, does not \u201calter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions \u2014 it does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.\u201d <em>Whitman </em>v. <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc., </em>531 U. S. 457, 467-468 (2001). Yet an alteration of that kind is just what today\u2019s decision imagines. Congress, as the Court reads the Act, silently upended, in an ancillary permitting provision, its painstaking pollution-control scheme. See <em>ante, </em>at 281. Congress did so, the Court holds, notwithstanding the lawmakers\u2019 stated effort \u201cto restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>the waters of the United States, 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1251(a); their assignment to EPA of the Herculean task of setting strict effluent limitations for many categories of industrial sources; and their insistence that new sources meet even more ambitious standards, not subject to exception or variance. Would a rational legislature order exacting pollution limits, yet call all bets off if the pollutant, discharged into a lake, will raise the water body\u2019s elevation? To say the least, I am persuaded, that is not how Congress intended the Clean Water Act to operate.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\">In sum, it is neither necessary nor proper to read the statute as allowing mines to bypass EPA\u2019s zero-discharge standard by classifying slurry as \u201cfill material.\u201d The use of waters of the United States as \u201csettling ponds\u201d for harmful mining waste, the Court of Appeals correctly held, is antithetical to the text, structure, and purpose of the Clean Water Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">For the reasons stated, I would affirm the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b345-8\"> Whether aquatic life will eventually be able to inhabit the lake again is uncertain. Compare <em>ante, </em>at 269, with App. 201a-202a and <em>Southeast Alaska Conservation Council </em>v. <em>United States Army Corps of Engineers, </em>486 F. 3d 638, 642 (CA9 2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b347-7\"> In addition, the Act requires States to institute comprehensive water quality standards for intrastate waters, subject to EPA approval. See \u00a7 1313.

State Water Resources Control Bd., </em>426 U. S. 200, 205, n. 12 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b347-13\"> Even the provision allowing the President to exempt federal installations from compliance with the Act\u2019s requirements \u2014 \u201cif he determines it to be in the paramount interest of the United States to do so\u201d \u2014 does not extend to new source standards: \u201c[N]o exemption may be granted from the requirements of section [306] or [307] of this [Act].\u201d 33 U.

C. \u00a7 1323(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b350-4\"> The Court asserts that \u201cnumerous difficulties\u201d will ensue if a discharge governed by a new source performance standard is ineligible for a \u00a7404 permit. <em>Ante, </em>at 276. Namely, the Court notes, the discharger will have to determine whether a performance standard applies to it. <em>Ante, </em>at 277. That is not only the usual inquiry under the Clean Water Act; it is one Coeur Alaska answered, without apparent difficulty, when it sought and obtained an EPA permit for the proposed discharge from the lake into a downstream creek. See <em>ante, </em>at 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Justice Breyer fears that \u201clitera[l] application]\u201d of performance standards would interfere with efforts \u201cto build a levee or to replace dirt removed from a lake bottom,\u201d and thus \u201cmay prove unnecessarily strict.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 292 (concurring opinion). His concerns are imaginative, but it is questionable whether they are real. Apple juice processors, meateutters, cement manufacturers, and pharmaceutical producers do not ordinarily build levees \u2014 and it is almost inconceivable that they would do so using the waste generated by .their highly specific industrial processes. See, e. <em>g., </em>40 CFR \u00a7411.10 (performance standard for particular cement manufacturing process). Levee construction generally is undertaken by developers or government, entities not subject to performance standards for such a project. This litigation, furthermore, does not illustrate the \u201cdifficulty\u201d Justice Breyer perceives. See <em>ante, </em>at 292. Coeur Alaska does not seek to build a levee or return dirt to a lake; it simply wants to use Lower Slate Lake as a waste disposal site.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b351-6\"> The \u201csafeguards\u201d Justice Breyer identifies are hardly reassuring. See <em>ante, </em>at 293 (concurring opinion). Given today\u2019s decision, it is optimistic to expect that EPA or the courts will act vigorously to prevent evasion of performance standards. Nor is EPA\u2019s veto power under \u00a7 404(e) of the Clean Water Act an adequate substitute for adherence to \u00a7306. That power \u2014 exercised only a dozen times over 36 years encompassing more than 1 million permit applications, see Brief for American Rivers 14\u2014 hinges on a finding of \u201cunacceptable adverse effect,\u201d 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1344(e). Destruction of nearly all aquatic life in a pristine lake apparently does not' qualify as \u201cunacceptable.\u201d Reliance on ad hoe vetoes, moreover, undermines Congress\u2019 aim to install uniform water-pollution regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
