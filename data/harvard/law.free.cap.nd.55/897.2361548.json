J.</author>\n<p id=\"ArD\">The plaintiff incorporated in 1906, under the name of Company \u201cA,\u201d First Regiment North Dakota National Guard Training School. The principal place of business was in Bismarck, North Dakota. Its incorporators were members and ex-members of Company \u201cA,\u201d First Regiment North Dakota National Guard. The object of the corporation was to lease or buy suitable grounds for an armory and rifle range, to erect, maintain and own an armory for use by Company \u201cA\u201d as a training school, and place of meeting, to promote and instruct its members in the science and arts of war. The incorporation was perfected under an act of the legislature, chapter 101, 1897, \u00a7 1425a, of the 1899 Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">Lots 23 and 24, in Block 32 of the original plat of Bismarck, North Dakota, were purchased for an armory site. Title to these lots was taken in and deeded to the State of North Dakota. An armory building was erected by Company \u201cA\u201d on these lots. On completion of the armory, the then Governor of the State of North Dakota executed and delivered a deed for said lots to said Company \u201cA.\u201d The Company placed two mortgages on the premises, one to the Red River Valley <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>Mortgage Company for thirty-five hundred dollars, and one to the State of North Dakota for five thousand dollars. The Company incurred and owed additional indebtedness.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-4\">Company \u201cA\u201d was an active military organization, with headquarters in said armory until called into service of the government in March, 1917. At that time, there existed a regularly elected and acting Board of Directors, with a captain, who was ex officio president, as provided by the articles of incorporation. In August, 1917, the Company was mustered into the federal service, and became a part of the expeditionary forces overseas.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">On August first, 1917, Edmund A. Hughes, one of the defendants, was appointed custodian of Company \u201cA\u2019s\u201d property, and he accepted the appointment. On October 9, 1919, a former captain, H. T. Murphy, and L. W. Sperry, as secretary, sold and deeded said lots to Edmond A. Hughes and C. B. Little, two of the defendants herein, for a consideration of fifteen thousand dollars, to be paid by assuming the mortgages mentioned, and other indebtedness of the Company, equal to the difference between such mortgages and consideration. It is contended that Murphy and Sperry had no authority to make the salo and transfer, and that the deed is, therefore, invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">Hughes and Little went into possession of the property, and erected buildings and made extensive improvements thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">On August 4, 1921, Company \u201cA\u201d commenced this action, under .\u00a7 8147, Comp. Laws 1913, requiring defendants to set forth their claims, and praying that they be adjudged null and void, and that defendants be decreed to have no estate or interest in said property.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">Defendants answered alleging title, and by way of affirmative defense and counterclaim, set forth that they had made improvements thereon to the extent of twenty thousand dollars, and that the plaintiff its officers and stockholders, were guilty of laches, and estopped from questioning defendants\u2019 ownership of the property, and praying that title be quieted in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">Plaintiff replied, denying and placing in i\u00a7sue all the claims of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">The case came on for trial before Hon. W. L. Nuessle, on the 11th day of May, 1922. On December 30, 1922, he prepared and signed a memorandum decision, in which he expressed the opinion that the' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>plaintiff could not recover, on account of ladies and estoppel, though, the deed was unauthorized, and therefore invalid. In this memorandum decision, he also stated that the plaintiff was not precluded from showing the actual value of the property on October 9, 1919, and that if it was worth more than the defendants agreed to pay, that it was entitled to recover the difference. He also stated that no evidence on the question of value had been adduced, and for that reason would either have to grant a new trial, or hear additional testimony on that subject. On January 2, 1923, in conformity with this memorandum decision, he signed an order \u201cthat- the said cause be tried anew, or that additional testimony be taken to show the value of the property, on the 9th day of October, 1919.\u201d On January 3, 1923, Judge Nuessle resigned as District Judge, to become a member of the Supreme Court, to which he had been elected.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-3\">On May 2, 1924, the plaintiff moved before Hon. Fred Jansonius, successor to Judge Nuessle, on the district bench, for an order setting-aside and vacating the memorandum decision and order made by Judge Nuessle. This motion was denied on August 23, 1924. On a motion to .dismiss the action, ITon. Fred Jansonius, on April 5, 1926, disqualified himself to sit in the case, and it was agreed that Hon. Charles M. Cooley, Judge of the First Judicial District, be designated to hear the case. On May 20, 1926, the plaintiff\u2019s motion for an order that the action be tried anew was denied by Judge Cooley, either as a court or a jury case. He ordered that the case stand as a court case,- and that it be heard on the single question of the value of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">The case came on for further testimony before Judge Cooley, on August 10, 1926, on the lone question of the value of the property, as of October 9, 1919, over objection of the plaintiff. The plaintiff did not examine any witnesses on that subject, and offered no testimony. On the conclusion of defendants\u2019 testimony, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-5\">\u201cIn the testimony offered here, it is found that the value of the property did not exceed eleven thousand five hundred dollars, on the 9th day of October, 1919, including the lots and buildings, and all, so you may draw your order accordingly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">, On the 11th day of August, 1926, the court made Findings of Fact. Conclusions of Law and Order for Judgment, quieting title in defendants, on the ground of laches and estoppel, as determined by Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>Nuessle, and that tlie property was worth not to exceed eleven thousand five hundred dollars on date of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-4\">The case is now before this court on appeal. Among the errors' assigned by the plaintiff, is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-5\">\u201cError No. 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-6\">\u201cThe court erred in denying plaintiff\u2019s motion for a trial de novo, and entering its order on the 20th day of May, 1926, as it appears upon, .the judgment roll.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">It is the contention of the plaintiff that Judge Cooley had no authority to take up the case where Judge Nuessle left off, and thus make Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order for Judgment, determining the action, quieting title oil the evidence heard before Judge Nuessle, and determining the damages on the evidence adduced before him. It is the claim of the defendants that since Judge Cooley made Findings of Fact covering both ends of the ease, that ho had jurisdiction. The evidence touching the question of title was heard before Judge Nuessle in 1922. The evidence to complete the case on the damage end was heard before Judge Cooley in 1926.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">A succeeding judge may adopt the Findings of Fact made by his predecessor, and order judgment thereon. Edmonds v. Riley, 15 S. D. 470, 90 N. W. 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">Under the constitution of this state, \u00a7 103, the district courts have original jurisdiction of all causes both at law and equity, and appellate jurisdiction as may be conferred by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">In speaking of a like provision in the Constitution of New York, in Re Carey, 24 App. Div. 531, 49 N. Y. Supp. 32, the court said: \u201cThe constitution (art. 6, \u00a7 3) contemplates that the judge who has to decide a controverted question of fact should have the advantage of seeing the witnesses, and hearing them give their testimony; and it is a just requirement (one which a sense of propriety commends) that the evidence in a cause, when practicable, be given in the presence of those who are to. adjudicate thereon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">AATe have no statute empowering the trial court, in a contested case, to use the testimony taken before his predecessor, and make Findings of Fact thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-12\">As well stated by the court in Putnam v. Crombie, 34 Barb. 232:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>\u201cAnother judge, or a jury, might- find differently upon the same evidence, in regard to the facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-4\">\u201cThe matter of decision and entry of judgment is regulated by statute.\u201d Weyman v. National Broadway Bank, 59 How. Pr. 331.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">It requires the exercise of judicial judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">It is true that in Re Nolan, 71 N. J. Eq. 207, 63 Atl. 618, Justice Magie, sitting as judge prerogative, held that evidence may be heard by one probate judge, and the case be decided by his successor on a transcript of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">In that case, the Justice, however, noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-8\">\u201cMoreover, it was stated in the argument, and conceded by counsel of contestant and of the proponents, that Judge Poster should read and consider the evidence taken before Judge Ileisley, and transcribed from the stenographer\u2019s notes, and use it in determining the contest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-9\">In the case of Barton v. Burbank, 138 La. 997, 71 So. 134, the court, in a very few words, holds that \u201cthere was no more reason why he (successor) should not have decided the case upon that testimony, than why this court should not do so.\u201d Citing and relying upon one of its prior decisions \u2014 Saint v. Martel, 127 La. 86, 53 So. 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-10\">But in that case, the court dealt with the duty of the trial judge on a reversal by the Supreme Court, and held that another judge than the one from whom the appeal was taken, could enter final judgment, on an order by the Supreme Court for \u201cfurther proceedings according to law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b950-11\">Moreover, there is a clear distinction in the hearing and determining of causes by the trial court, a court of original jurisdiction, and the appellate court, a court of appellate jurisdiction, with certain limited exceptions. Our statute provides that the appellate court shall review the record and provides for transcripts of the evidence before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-12\">In the case of Labonte v. Lacasse, 78 N. H. 489, 102 Atl. 540, Chief Justice Parsons decided, where the evidence was heard in an equity action for a reformation of a deed, and the case left undetermined by the trial judge, that, \u201ca new trial must be had unless the plaintiff abandons the proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b950-13\">The Supreme Court of California, Re Sullivan, 143 Cal. 462, 77 Pac. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>153, where the evidence was heard before one judge, and the case later decided by another, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-4\">\u201cThe question presented is, however, not one of jurisdiction, but of the erroneous exercise of jurisdiction. A party litigant is entitled to a decision upon the facts of his case from the judge who hears the evidence, where the matter is tried without a jury, and from the jury that hears the evidence, where it is tried with a jury. He cannot bo compelled to accept a decision upon the facts from another judge or another jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">By statute, in the state of Colorado, in an election contest, it is provided that: \u201cThe County judge trying such cause shall cause the testimony to be taken in full, and filed in such cause.\u201d A case was tried before the presiding judge, a great many witnesses had testified, and their testimony was reduced to writing and filed with the case. 11 is term expired before the case was finished, and his successor was urged to take up the case where his predecessor left off. He ordered, however, a trial de novo. The Court, in Clanton v. Ryan, 14 Colo. 419, 24 Pac. 258, speaking of this statute, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-6\">\u201cFrom this language, it is argued with much force that the new judge should have taken up the trial where the retiring judge left it, should have considered the evidence taken by his predecessor as substantive evidence in the cause. In view of the hardship resulting from mistrials, which are liable to occur in cases of this kind, especially where a change of county judges follows, a general election of county officers, we might be inclined to hold that such was the purpose and intent of requiring the testimony to be thus preserved, were it not that the very next sentence of the act required that \u2018the trial of such causes shall be conducted according to the rules and practice of the county court in other cases.\u2019 By the words \u2018other cases\u2019 must be understood ordinary civil actions. It certainly is not \u2018according to the rules and practice\u2019 in the trial of ordinary civil actions before a court of record for one judge to hear the evidence, or part thereof, orally, and then for another judge to render a finding and judgment upon such evidence, however perfectly the same may have been preserved. It is more probable that the object of requiring the testimony to be preserved was for convenient reference afterwards, or for use on appeal, or as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>a deposition in case a second trial should be had when witnesses should have died, or removed from the county.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">The consideration of the case by Judge Nuessle had never reached the point of actual decision. In his memorandum decision, he expressed the opinion that the defendants should have the title quieted in them by reason of the laches and estoppel of the plaintiff. He was also of the opinion that the evidence was not sufficient for him to dispose of the case, and therefore ordered a new trial, or the taking of further testimony on the question of damages. The case had not, therefore, reached the point where Judge Nuessle determined the issues involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">As said by-the Supreme Court of Indiana, in Wainwright v. P. H. &amp; F. M. Roots Co. 176 Ind. 682, 97 N. E. 8:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-6\"><em>\u2018\u25a0\u2018\u00c1 </em>party to an action is entitled to a determination of the issues by the jury or judge that heard the evidence, and where the case is tried before the judge, and the issues remain undetermined at the death, resignation, or expiration of the term of such judge, his successor cannot decide, or make findings in the case, without a trial do novo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">J udge Cooley made findings on the most important issue in the case, that of affecting the title, on the evidence heard before Judge Nuessle. He had not heard the witnesses testify on the subject. He adopted Judge Nuessle\u2019s conclusion therefrom. Not having any statute providing for such procedure, it was an erroneous exercise of judicial authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">It follows from what has been said that thus far in the consideration of this case in the district court and in this court there has been no decision upon the question of title which includes questions of estoppel, laches, etc., and that the judgment must be reversed and a new trial ordered on all issues.</p>\n<judges id=\"b952-9\">Birdzelh, Oh.
