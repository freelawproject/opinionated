The personal estate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>the testator was also given to the same parties, to be held in the same manner as was prescribed by the testator of his realty.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b296-4\"><em>Edward Colston </em>and <em>Jordan, Jordan &amp; Williams, </em>in support of the demurrer:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-5\">1. The words \u201c during his natural life and to his heirs,\u201d taken alone, will convey a fee by force of the rule in Shelley\u2019s case. 1 Fearne on Remainders, [149,] [198]; 1 Preston on Estates, [263]; <em>McFeely\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Moore\u2019s Heirs, </em>5 Ohio, 465; <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Zane\u2019s Heirs, </em>12 Ib. 287; <em>King\u2019s Adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>King\u2019s Heirs, </em>Ib. 390.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-6\">2. The ulterior devise, in default of issue to first devisee, does not impair the legal effect of the word \u201cheirs\u201d in the prior devise, as they do not at all refer to -the <em>quantity </em>of the estate, but merely to its disposition on the happening of a contingency, which has not yet occurred nor can now ever occur. 4 Kent\u2019s Com. 214, and cases cited <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-7\">3. The testator must be considered as having used the word \u201cheirs\u201d in its legal import, unless it appear so clearly that no one can misunderstand that his .intention was to give it some other meaning. 1 Fearne on Remainders, [168,] and cases cited; 2 Jarman on Wills, [277] <em>et </em>seq.; <em>Ide </em>v. <em>Ide, </em>5 Mass. 500; <em>Mowat </em>v. <em>Carew, </em>7 Paige Ch. 328; <em>Poole </em>v. <em>Poole, </em>3 B. &amp; P. 620; <em>Jesson </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>2 Bligh, 56, decided by Lord Eldon and Lord Redesdale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-8\">All admit that technical words are not necessary in a will; but where a testator sees fit to use such words, we are bound to understand that he used them in their appropriate sense, unless he himself has satisfied us that he has not done so. The principal American cases are : <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Essex Bridge, 2 </em>Pick. 243; <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>4 Pick. 198; <em>Stevenson </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>10 Ohio St. 307; <em>Collier </em>v. <em>Collier, </em>3 Ohio St. 369; <em>Niles </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>12 Ohio St. 320.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-9\">4. The circumstances of the devise to Stevenson being for his life does not show the intention of the testator so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>clearly as to prevent the rule in Shelley\u2019s case from applying. <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Bedford, </em>4 Maule &amp; Sel.; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>2 Vesey, Sen., 225; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>1 East, 229; <em>Perrin </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>4 Burr, 2579; <em>McFeely\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Moore\u2019s Heirs, </em>5 Ohio, 465.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b297-5\"><em>Matthews &amp; Ramsey </em>and <em>Thos. T. Heath, </em>contra:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-6\">1. That the devise to Stevenson Reddish expressly limits to him an estate for life only, and that such appears to have been the intention of the testator, which the court will effectuate without reference to any arbitrary rule of construction. <em>King </em>v. <em>Beck, </em>15 Ohio, 559. This position does not exclude the authority, but merely the application of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>8 Ohio, 365; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Hoop, </em>6 Ohio St. 480.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-7\">2. That the use of the words \u201c decease before maturity without lawful issue\u201d shows that the word \u201cheirs\u201d was used with the meaning and sense of \u201c issue,\u201d and meant children or descendants, and that they therefore will be construed words of purchase and not of limitation. <em>Stevenson </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>10 Ohio St. 307; <em>Ellicombe </em>v. <em>Gompertz, </em>3 Mylne &amp; Cr. 127-154; <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Essex Co., </em>18 How. 202.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-8\">3. <em>Niles </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>12 Ohio St. 320, is clearly to be distinguished, as in that case it was the clear intention to give a fee simple in the first devisee, while in the one at bar the intention is equally clear to give but a life estate. The former simply decides that the words \u201cdying without issue\u201d mean issue living at the death of the devisee, and can not therefore have the force they would if construed to mean without issue indefinitely. See <em>Hull </em>v. <em>Priest, </em>6 Gray, 18.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b297-9\">Storer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADD\">A single question is presented for our determination: What estate did Stevenson Eeddish take under the devise from his father? Was it a term for his life only, a fee simple, or a fee tail ?</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">The defendant claims to hold an estate in fee, while the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>plaintiff's allege their father, when he made the conveyance, held an estate for life only.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Where the intention of a testator can be ascertained, we need not resort to any artificial rule to limit or extend a devise.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">If the purpose of the testator can be determined without violence to the language he has used, and there is no ambiguity in the terms employed, it is our duty so to interpret the whole instrument that we shall give effect to what we are satisfied was the object of the testator in disposing of his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The will before us was probated in December, 1831, when the rule relied upon by the plaintiff was admitted to be the law in Ohio. <em>McFeely\u2019s Heirs </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>5 Ohio, 469. But by the wills act of 1840, sec. 47, 1 Curwen, 69, it was provided, \u201c When lands, tenements, or hereditaments are given by will to any person for life, and after his decease to his heirs in fee, or by words to that effect, the conveyance shall be construed to vest an estate for life only to such first taken, and a remainder in fee simple to his heirs.\u201d This section was re-enacted in May, 1852. 3 Curwen, 1911.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">From the fact that our legislature, so soon after the decision in <em>Moore </em>v. <em>McFeely </em>was rendered, declared that the rule in Shelley\u2019s case should no longer be followed in construing devises, and the general unwillingness of the profession to adopt it, regarding it as a technical and arbitrary exposition of the law, we ought not to apyly it in any case, even if the statute had not been passed, unless we were required to do so to uphold a devise that would otherwise fail. Whatever estate was devised by the testator to his son became vested before the statute of 1840; but we do not feel bound to regard it with any more favor than we should if the decision in McFeely and Moore was still obligatory. In <em>King\u2019s Heirs </em>v. <em>King\u2019s Adm\u2019rs, </em>12 Ohio, 390, follo\u2019wing their former opinion in <em>McFeely </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>the Supreme Court held that the rule in Shelley\u2019s case, although not then applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>to wills taking effect since 1840, was in all other respects a rule of property in Ohio; but this opinion was afterward reversed in <em>King </em>v. <em>Beck, </em>15 Ohio, 559, where it was held that the rule referred to would not be allowed to prevail against the intention of the testator, if that intention could be effectuated without creating an estate forbidden by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The effect of this decision, we suppose, was in all cases where the limitation in the will was to the first taker for life by express words, to deny the application of the rule referred to, regarding the section 47 of the wills act as declaratory of the law previously existing, not as establishing a new rule, but removing, all doubt as to what the law really was. We may therefore conclude, that in every case where there is a clear expression of the testator\u2019s purpose by the language of the devise, that the devise should hold for life only, that intention should be adhered to, without resorting to a mode of proceeding purely arbitrary to explain it.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The learned judge who decided the case of <em>McFeely </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>seemed to regard the rule with more veneration for its antiquity and the learning with which it had been discussed in England, without any particular reason for its applicability to our institutions, and it has since met with no particular favor with the profession in Ohio. The rule itself has been abolished by statute in New York, Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Illinois, and in Mississippi, New Hampshire, and New Jersey, it is applicable only to grants, and we think it should not be applied in this State to wills probated before 1840, except in extreme cases, where no other course can be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">We need not refer to the bitter opposition the rule encountered in-its early history, until after the conflict of nearly two centuries it was finally confirmed in <em>Perrin </em>v. <em>Blake. </em>Sufficient is it for us to feel that it would never have originated in the Hnited States, where no such condition of things existed which had induced the English courts to introduce it into the body of the common law before the revolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">If we refer to the devise of the testator to }iis son, it vests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>the devisee by explicit language with an estate for life and to his heirs, and in case of the decease of the devisee before he arrives at his majority, and without lawful issue, there should be a remainder over to the children of the testator\u2019s sister and brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">It is argued that the word \u201c heirs \u201d following the estate for life, there being no word preceding it designating the class of heirs, must be taken to mean heirs generally; but we think when taken in connection with the subsequent part of the devise, which gives the estate for life where the children of the devisee are named, as restricting the term \u201cheirs\u201d to the issue of the devisee, thus creating an estate tail, and vesting a fee simple in the children of the devisee as first donees in tail under the statute. It is admitted that the devisee, the testator\u2019s son, not only arrived at full age, but the plaintiff's are his children, who take, we are satisfied, no estate from their father by descent, but are vested with an estate by purchase, by virtue\" of their grandfather\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The words \u201c heir, heirs, children, and issue,\u201d are frequently regarded as convertible, and may be construed, taking i-nto consideration the whole will, to mean either one or the other, as its proper construction may require; thus, a devise to heirs may be interpreted to mean children or issue, and either restricted or enlarged, as may be necessary to carry out the purpose of the testator. <em>Cosby et al </em>v. <em>Lee\u2019s Ex\u2019rs, </em>2 Disney, 460; <em>King </em>v. <em>Beck, </em>15 Ohio, 559; and the well-considered case of <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>4 Pick. 209, where Chief Justice Parker reviews the whole law on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Judge Redfield very aptly says, in his late work on Wills, vol. 2, p. 204, that the rule in Shelley\u2019s case has more commonly \u201cled one side of the real intention of the devisor than almost any other;\u201d and of a similar opinion was our Supreme Court, when they decided the case of <em>King </em>v. <em>Beck, </em>15 Ohio, 559, on a will probated before 1840, where they held, to use the language of Judge Read, who gave the opinion, \u201cthat they had no disposition to strain a point to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>bring a case within the operation of the rule in Shelley\u2019s case, a rule, he said, which had its origin in feudal tenure, and was first adopted to secure to the lord the profits and perquisites incident to inheritances, and as an afterthought, the additional reason that it was necessary to prevent an abeyance of the fee. It is at least an artificial technicality, and just in proportion as it lacks reason, it has won upon the affections of the profession; but it is the duty of this eourt to conform its decisions, when we attempt to walk by the light of precedent from another country, to the nature of our institutions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">While we admire the touching lamentation of Chancellor Kent, upon the abolition of the rule in New York, we have no disposition with him to mourn over its fate. 4 Kent\u2019s Com. 267, note.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">On a careful consideration of all the questions made by counsel, we are all of opinion that the testator intended to devise a life estate only to his son in the property described in the petition, with remainder over to his grandchildren, whether in fee or in tail it is .immaterial for the purposes of this action, as in either case the plaintiff must recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">We have been favored, both by oral and written argument, with a very able discussion of the law of devises, more especially on the proper application of the rule in Shelley\u2019s case to the devise of the testator to his son; but while we have been impressed with the thorough research of counsel into the ancient law, as expounded by Eearne and Perkins, and the more modern adjudications of the courts, while we admit they have so well vindicated the maxim \u201c <em>sa'ius est petere fontes, quam sectari rivulos,\u201d </em>we are, nevertheless, fully persuaded the rule we have discussed is not one of construction to which we are bound implicitly to .adhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">On the whole case, judgment will be rendered for the plaintiffs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
