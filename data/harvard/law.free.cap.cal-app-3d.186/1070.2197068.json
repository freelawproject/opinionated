The suspension order was based on appellant\u2019s refusal to submit to chemical testing for blood alcohol level following her arrest for driving under the influence (Veh. Code, \u00a7 13353; all further statutory references are to the Vehicle Code).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">In an unpublished portion of the opinion, we reject appellant\u2019s contention the evidence is insufficient to support the finding that she was capable of refusing to submit to chemical testing. Here, we reject appellant\u2019s argument that the license suspension must be set aside because the arresting officer told her she could take a breath test even though the test was not available at the hospital to which she had been taken. We shall therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">Facts Relevant to Appellant\u2019s Contention Her License Suspension Must Be Set Aside Because the Implied Consent Admonition Was Unlawful</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">Appellant was found by a citizen after the car she was driving left the roadway and came to rest in an orchard.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">A police officer arrived on the scene, noticed physical signs of appellant\u2019s alcohol intoxication, and placed her under arrest. Appellant was taken to a hospital that had no equipment to test the alcohol level of appellant\u2019s breath. Even though the officer knew the hospital could not administer a breath test, he read appellant the standard admonition that she could take a blood, urine, or breath test. She refused to take each test.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">Appellant contends her license suspension must be set aside because the officer\u2019s admonition about tests was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">At the time of appellant\u2019s arrest, section 13353, subdivision (a)(2)(A), provided in relevant part that one arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol \u201cshall have the choice of whether the test shall be of his or her blood, breath, or urine, and the person shall be advised by the officer that he or she has such a choice.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, section 13353, subdivision (a)(3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>(now \u00a7 23157, subd. (a)(3)), then provided: \u201cIf the person is lawfully arrested for an offense allegedly committed in violation of Section 23152 or 23153, and, because of the need for medical treatment, the person is first transported to a medical facility where it is not feasible to administer a particular test of, or to obtain a particular sample of, the person\u2019s blood, breath, or urine, the person shall have the choice of those tests which are available at the facility to which that person has been transported. In such an event, the officer shall advise the person of those tests which are available at the medical facility and that the person\u2019s choice is limited to those tests which are available.\u201d (Stats. 1982, ch. 1341, \u00a7 4, p. 5005.)</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Appellant contends the officer\u2019s admonition violated the statute because he told appellant she could take a breath test when he knew none was available at the hospital. The evident purpose of former section 13353, subdivision (a)(3), is to limit an arrestee\u2019s choice of tests to those available at a medical facility to which the arrestee has been transported for treatment. The statute is obviously designed to clarify what should happen when one or more of the standard battery of tests is unavailable at the medical facility. The statute appears to be an aid to law enforcement officers, who might otherwise be obligated, but unable, to furnish a standard test chosen by an arrestee.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">Despite the apparent aim of the statute\u2014to aid law enforcement\u2014it remains true that the admonition of the arresting officer deviated from the statutory requirement, because he told appellant she could choose a breath test when in fact one was unavailable. However, it does not follow that the license suspension must be set aside.  \u201cIt is, of course, the trial court\u2019s function to determine whether the driver was in fact misled by inaccurate advice, and whether his refusal to submit to a test was a result thereof. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Decker </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 903, 907 [101 Cal.Rptr. 387, 495 P.2d 1307].)  Here, the record contains no evidence that the officer\u2019s gratuitous inclusion of a breath test in his admonition had any causal effect whatsoever on appellant\u2019s refusal to take any test. In these circumstances, the license suspension need not be set aside.
