She applied for a permit to install a septic tank on her property. Since her land had too high a percolation rate to be suitable for a conventional leach field for septic tank effluent, her permit application was rejected. She proposed, thereafter, to install an alternative system, by which her septic tank effluent would be piped into an imported mound of soil which would serve as a leach field. County counsel opined that the then-current county ordinance code conferred no authority for issuance of a permit for such an alternative sewage disposal system, and that an amendment to the code would be necessary for issuance of such a permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">On June 28, 1983, the appellant Board of Supervisors of the County of Santa Clara<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> passed and adopted ordinance No. NS 517.29 (hereafter, the ordinance amendment), which amended the code so as to authorize the county health officer to issue permits for alternative private sewage disposal systems for single family residences, in addition to the conventional septic tank and leach field system provided for by the code.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Before its enactment of the ordinance amendment, the Board had adopted a \u201cnegative declaration\u201d under section 21080, subdivision (c) of the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7\u00a7 21000-21177,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> hereafter, CEQA) on November 15, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">On July 21, 1983, respondent David C. Heninger filed, in Santa Clara County Superior Court, a petition for peremptory writ of mandate and stay order, in which he requested the court to require the Board to rescind, void, and annul the ordinance amendment, and to enjoin appellants from issuing any permits or entitlements for sewage disposal systems pursuant to the ordinance. In his petition respondent alleged, among other shortcomings, that the Board had violated CEQA in failing to prepare an environmental impact report (hereafter, EIR) before enacting the ordinance amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>A hearing on the petition was held on October 31, 1983, and a judgment granting a peremptory writ of mandate was filed on January 25, 1984. The trial court found, among other things, that \u201cthere was no substantial evidence in the record to support a determination to adopt a negative declaration under CEQA\u201d and that there was \u201csubstantial evidence in the record to support requirement that an Environmental Impact Report be prepared, reviewed and approved prior to ordinance adoption.\u201d The court declared the ordinance amendment null and void, and of no effect, and prohibited appellants from implementing or giving any effect to said ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">On February 21, 1984, respondent filed a postjudgment motion for award of attorney\u2019s fees. The motion was heard and, on March 27, 1984, an order granting attorney\u2019s fees was filed, by which the Board was ordered to pay respondent\u2019s attorneys the sum of $13,982.40.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The appeal before us is from the judgment granting the peremptory writ of mandate and from the order granting attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">\n<em>Necessity for an Environmental Impact Report</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Section 21151 provides, \u201c[I] All local agencies shall prepare, or cause to be prepared by contract, and certify the completion of an environmental impact report on any project they intend to carry out or approve which may have a significant effect on the environment. ...\u201d Appellants properly accept the propositions that the Board is a \u201clocal agency\u201d within the meaning of section 21151 (see \u00a7\u00a7 21062, 21063) and that enactment of the ordinance amendment is a \u201cproject\u201d within the meaning of section 21151. (See <em>Bozung </em>v. <em>Local Agency Formation Com. </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 277-279 [118 Cal.Rptr. 249, 529 P.2d 1017], interpreting \u00a7 21065;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Rosenthal </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1975) 44 Cal.App.3d 815, 823 [119 Cal.Rptr. 282].) By accepting these propositions, appellants properly concede that CEQA applies in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Appellants also properly accept the proposition that the Board was obliged to order an EIR if it could be fairly argued, based on substantial evidence in the record before the Board, that the ordinance amendment might cause a significant effect on the environment. This proposition is in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>accord with the holding of the Court of Appeal, First Appellate District, Division Four, in <em>Friends of \u201cB\u201d Street </em>v. <em>City of Hayward </em>(1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 988, 1001-1002 [165 Cal.Rptr. 514], based on <em>No Oil, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75 [118 Cal.Rptr. 34, 529 P.2d 66], and followed in several subsequent Court of Appeal decisions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This proposition has won the approval of the state Office of Planning and Research, charged under section 21083 with the preparation of guidelines for implementation of CEQA. A new version of one of those guidelines, California Administrative Code, title 14, section 15070,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was filed July 13, 1983, for the express purpose of codifying the holding of <em>Friends of \u201cB\u201d Street. </em>(State Office of Planning and Research, CEQA: The Cal. Environmental Quality Act\u2014Law and Guidelines (Jan. 1984) pp. 88-89.) Within two months, the Legislature enacted a new version of section 21080, subdivision (c),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> containing provisions virtually identical to those of Guidelines, section 15070. (Stats. 1983, ch. 872, \u00a7 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Lastly, appellants properly accept the proposition that the \u201csignificant effect on the environment\u201d to which section 21151 refers is the effect to which enactment of the ordinance amendment may ultimately lead, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>the de minimis effect of the \u201cgovernmental paper-shuffling\u201d which mere enactment of an ordinance entails. (See <em>Bozung </em>v. <em>Local Agency Formation Com., supra, </em>13 Cal.3d 263, 277-278, fn. 16; Guidelines, \u00a7 15378, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">The parties disagree as to the appropriate standard for court review of the action of the Board. Appellants cite <em>Pacific Water Conditioning Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>City Council </em>(1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 546, 558 [140 Cal.Rptr. 812], which holds that if the Board chose to reject or to ignore evidence that the ordinance amendment may have a significant effect on the environment, both the superior court and this court would be bound by that choice, so long as some substantial evidence was before the Board that the ordinance amendment would not have a significant effect on the environment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellants go on to review evidence which, they contend, lends substantial support to their view that the ordinance amendment will have no significant effect on the environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\"><em>Friends of \u201cB\u201d Street, </em>however, explicitly rejects the standard of review applied in <em>Pacific Water Conditioning Assn., Inc., </em>declaring that \u201can agency\u2019s adoption of a negative declaration is not to be upheld merely because substantial evidence was presented that the project would not have [significant environmental] impact. The . . . court\u2019s function is to determine whether substantial evidence supported the agency\u2019s conclusion as to whether the prescribed \u2018fair argument\u2019 could be made. If there was substantial evidence that the proposed project might have a significant environmental impact, evidence to the contrary is not sufficient to support a decision to dispense with preparation of an EIR and adopt a negative declaration, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>because it could be \u2018fairly argued\u2019 that the project might have a significant environmental impact.\u201d <em>(Friends of \u201cB\u201d Street </em>v. <em>City of Hayward, supra, </em>106 Cal.App.3d 988, 1002.)</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">In view of the express administrative codification of <em>Friends of\u201cB\u201d Street </em>effected by promulgation of Guidelines, section 15070, we consider the subsequent adoption of essentially the same language in section 21080, subdivision (c), to constitute an implicit legislative determination that <em>Friends of \u201cB\u201d Street </em>sets forth the correct standard for judicial review in cases of this type, and a rejection of the <em>Pacific Water Conditioning Assn., Inc. </em>standard. We are, thus, bound to adhere to the <em>Friends of \u201cB\u201d Street </em>standard in reviewing, in our turn,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Applying this standard, we find substantial evidence of record, on the basis of which one might fairly argue that the ordinance amendment may have a significant effect on the environment. This evidence appears in the text of the ordinance amendment itself, in the Santa Clara County General Plan, which the Board had adopted on November 18, 1981, and in the administrative record which appellants filed in the trial court on September 2, 1983.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The ordinance amendment itself contemplates possible adverse environmental impacts, in that it prescribes steps to be taken \u201c[1i][i]n case of any failure, malfunction or breakdown of any private sewage system . . . .\u201d These steps include forced \u201cvacation of the premises if no other [means] of abatement is possible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">The history of conventional septic tank use in Santa Clara County, as revealed in the county\u2019s general plan, is one of environmental degradation, both through outright failures of systems (p. K6) and through mere \u201cover concentrations of septic systems\u201d (p. D8). Specific sites of contamination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>include \u201cthe aquifers beneath the north and south valleys\u201d (cf. Guidelines, appen. G, subds. (f), (h))<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and an extension of Lexington Reservoir (cf. Guidelines, appen. G, subds. (f), (g)) which was \u201cpolluted to an extent noticeable by both sight and smell.\u201d In response to an inquiry about the then-proposed ordinance amendment, a senior engineer of the California Regional Water Quality Control Board pointed out, in a letter dated January 11, 1983, that alternative sewage disposal systems are notorious for their failure. By memorandum dated April 13, 1983, the Santa Clara County Health Department \u201crecommended that the Board of Supervisors not adopt this alternative sewage ordinance due to the unproven nature of proposed alternative systems.\u201d This memorandum opined that installation of alternative systems would result \u201cin an increased possibility of system failure with possible public health consequences requiring abatement.\u201d (Cf. Guidelines, appen. G, subd. (v).)</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The negative declaration which the Board adopted at the time it passed the ordinance amendment noted that opening up areas previously closed to development because unsuitable for conventional septic tank systems \u201cwould appear to have a growth inducing potential.\u201d (Cf. Guidelines, appen. G, subd. (k).)</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">We conclude that the Board acted in violation of CEQA in ignoring or discounting this considerable body of evidence, and that the trial court acted properly in granting respondent\u2019s petition for a writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">But. . .</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Our conclusion that the ordinance amendment is a \u201cproject\u201d is made with reluctance, and not with the ease which our acceptance of appellants\u2019 concession in that regard may suggest. The very broad definition of \u201cproject\u201d which <em>Bozung </em>dictates compels us to this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">Working from the premise that \u201cit is desirable that the precise information concerning environmental consequences which an EIR affords be furnished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>and considered at the earliest possible stage\u201d <em>(Bozung </em>v. <em>Local Agency Formation Com., supra, </em>13 Cal.3d 263, 282), the <em>Bozung </em>court holds that a local agency formation commission\u2019s approval of an annexation proposal, which could lead to enactment of an ordinance of annexation, which could lead to rezoning, which could lead to issuance of use, building, and grading permits, which could lead in turn to actual construction of houses, is a \u201cproject\u201d within the meaning of section 21151, so that an EIR must precede such approval. Requiring an EIR \u201cat the earliest possible stage\u201d in <em>Bozung </em>did not lead to as absurd a result as we experience in this case. In <em>Bozung, </em>each step in the string of possibilities was aimed at facilitating an existing plan to subdivide and develop a 677-acre ranch. The required EIR obviously would deal with the effects to be anticipated from implementation of that plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">In this case, the \u201cearliest possible stage\u201d obviously is now, but the only plan of which we are aware is that of one landowner who is apparently willing to shoulder the burdens of installing and maintaining an alternative sewage disposal system. No EIR would be required for implementation of that plan by itself, which proposes a system to handle wastewater produced by a two-bedroom house. (Guidelines, \u00a7 15303.) An EIR is required in this case, only because of a potential for other alternative sewage disposal proposals for other sites in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">This case illustrates how, with some well-directed legal effort, an opponent of development can delay or, sometimes, abort a project. The expense of delay, and the expense of an EIR itself, can force cancellation of plans having little or no environmental impact. This case also illustrates how easily courts can, or must, cause that result even when the substance of the required EIR must be speculative and conjectural, its geographic scope huge, its cost staggering, and its ultimate utility highly questionable, at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Due to the unspecified nature of future proposals for alternative sewage disposal systems, the preparer of an EIR in this case would be obliged, among other things, to review \u201call available literature\u201d on the various types of alternative sewage disposal systems available and their performance in varying climactic and soil conditions, to do a county-wide study to determine the areas not served by sewers and the soil conditions therein, a study of past problems with sewage pollution, a study of possible future population densities, and a study of potential for future pollution problems and attendant public health hazards.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We do not deal with a specific plan for development <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>of 677 acres, as did <em>Bozung. </em>We deal here with a potential for many different plans, involving different systems, in different places, in a county covering 1,300 square miles of varied topography and soil conditions. If we assume that someone is willing to undertake the cost of such a report (and the county seems the only candidate for paying the bill), there is no assurance that the report will be useful to anyone. After an EIR is prepared, if the Board chooses to order one, and by the time another ordinance amendment is enacted, the one known applicant may well have lost interest and others may not materialize. The invitation will be out to other property owners, after great public expense and after considerable delay, but will anyone come to the party?</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">Expenditure of limited governmental resources on speculative studies is contrary to sound policy and contrary to the legislative intent in enacting CEQA, as we perceive them. The route which the Board followed in this case, adoption of a negative declaration, avoided such foolishness and was suitable to the facts which the Board faced. Nevertheless, we are bound by the pronouncements of the California Supreme Court as to what constitutes sound policy and as to what prompted the Legislature to enact CEQA. We follow those pronouncements.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\"><em>The Award of Attorney\u2019s </em>Fees<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The judgment is affirmed and the postjudgment order granting attorney\u2019s fees is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Elkington, Acting P.

It should offer real assistance in protecting the environment and serve a real function in informing the Board and the public.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b531-11\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 601.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b531-8\">NEWSOM, J., Concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"A6Q\">I concur in what I conceive to be the clear holding of the majority that the Santa Clara Board of Supervisors acted illegally in adopting a negative declaration for the proposed sewage disposal system.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">I write this separate concurrence, however, because I wish to disassociate myself from the conclusions\u2014all of them dicta, I believe\u2014stated on page <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>609, beginning with the word \u201cBut\u201d and continuing to the end of the published part of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Thus, I find nothing \u201cabsurd\u201d in the view that pouring septic effluents into a leach field near a public reservoir should constitute a \u201cproject\u201d under applicable law, if only because, as the majority opinion puts it, \u201cthe history of conventional septic tank use in Santa Clara ... is one of environmental degradation.\u201d And, indeed, as the majority further notes, the Santa Clara Board <em>itself </em>recognized the \u201cgrowth inducing potential\u201d of the system proposed in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">As this court said in an almost identical context, \u201c [w]e of course recognize that it is presently impossible to determine with specificity the number, nature or location of replacement construction projects. Until such projects are proposed, their impact\u2014individually and in the aggregate\u2014cannot be gauged with exactitude. But that the ordinance reasonably portends possible future environmental impacts flowing from the cumulative effect of probable replacement construction projects seems undeniable. And even before specific projects are commenced the City may be able to state\u2014at least in general terms\u2014that the ordinance will have an impact upon the environment, or to dismiss that possibility. Without a threshold evaluation, however, the City leaves its constituents in ignorance of the avoidable dangers CEQA intended to avert. If a \u2018project\u2019 poses the possibility of significantly influencing the environment, as the subject ordinance clearly seems to do, the inability of the City to identify impacts ought not to relieve it of the responsibility to prepare an appropriate EIR in accordance with section 21151.\u201d <em>Terminal Plaza Corp. </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 892, 904-905 [223 Cal.Rptr. 379].)</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">I wish also to state my entire disagreement with the majority\u2019s view that this case serves to illustrate \u201chow an opponent of development can delay, or, sometimes, abort a project.\u201d To my mind, it serves rather to illustrate the wisdom of a law which permits citizens vigilant in the public interest to force local government to think before it acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Appellants\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied January 29, 1987.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
