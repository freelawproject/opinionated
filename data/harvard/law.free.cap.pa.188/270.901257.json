In the absence of a contract, there cannot be a recovery for such services. The evidence thus far has not come up to the standard, as we regard it, under the law, and therefore evidence prior to the date specified in the written contract, August 4,1893, is excluded for the present. Objection sustained and a bill sealed to the plaintiff. [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-11\">The court charged in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-12\">[Very high authority declares that the most learned doubteth most. This aphorism, we may say, was declared by a most eminent judge and lawyer, and is the natural inclination of a cultured legal mind to accept a reasonable cause for a legal conclusion. This doubt may, then, be said to arise among those dealing with the law about the divinity of the family relation, when they meet so often the unseemly wrangles and disputes among members of the same family, among those, indeed, who come from the loins of the same parents, who were nursed in infancy and nourished by the care, labor, attention and love, we may say, of common parents. It would be well if, when the grave covers all that is mortal of the parents, the disputes and wrangles among the children for the pittance of the material estate the parent leaves behind, were ended; we say, it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>be well if, when the grave covers the parent, the wrangles and disputes of children over his or her accumulations would be forgotten in the common distress that a dear parent has been lost. That this is not so is discouraging, indeed, to the parent when he is thinking and laboring and saving his accumulations and the results of his industry so that when he is gone Iris children may have a fair start in life and not be dependent upon the cold charity of the world. We say it is discouraging for a parent to labor and accumulate and make efforts to do good so that his children may have profit when he is gone from them, to think that they will so soon forget the reciprocal duties of the great relation of parent and child and get into unseemly wrangles in our courts. Such thoughts are suggested from this class of cases, when we think of the .young parents, their tender love and affection for their children, by industry and prudence accumulating property, passing through the morning and the vigor of life to dependent old age, the hand of affliction comes to the parents and they are helpless, and these little children that have been the subject of their care grown to be men and women are the natural dependence of the parents who are thus afflicted. Oh, it is a solemn and unpleasant thing to think, after you are dead or in your affliction, these children that you have so tenderly raised will begrudge you those attentions which the afflictions of age bring upon you. We say, it weakens our confidence in the divinity of human nature when we see-these things, and we deprecate them. We could only wish they could be kept out of our courts. Higher authority than we has said this, and, hence, the law says that no child shall recover for services rendered to the father unless a special contract to pay for such services has been made and proved. Now, that is the law. You have heard it discussed, and we have made these general remarks to indicate briefly the reason of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-5\">A learned judge, away back, says: \u201c Unless an express contract can be shown there can be no precedent more dangerous than to permit a son to succeed in an attempt to avail himself of an account trumped up for the purpose of getting an undue share of the estate at the expense of the other heirs. When a son continues with a father after age, and it is usually done with a view to provision by will, if disappointed in, perhaps, his reasonable expectations, we cannot permit him to turn around and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>attempt to retrieve Ms fortunes by resorting to an account on a quantum meruit for services rendered the father in his lifetime.\u201d That has been reiterated again and again. Judge Ag-nkw says, in Leidig v. Coover, 47 Pa. 534, that \u201cthe declarations of a parent to compensate a child may admit the filial devotion and real work of the child and the profit he derives from the services. They may reach further and disclose his own sense of obligation and his settled purpose to compensate. But all this is insufficient to raise a promise. Without a contract expressly made for wages, proved by clear, distinct and satisfactory evidence, there cannot be a recovery.\u201d The law, in that respect, is predicated upon that natural feeling that is presumed to exist between father and son, son and father, or children and parents. Hence, to allow services rendered by one to the other to be recovered for in cold dollars and cents, an express contract must be proved. Now, it is different between strangers, because when one stranger renders service to another the law implies a contract and the person rendering the service is to be paid what the services are shown to be reasonably worth. But with a parent and child, we say, there must be an express contract. We have made this plain to you so that you will understand the reason why we were so exacting about a written contract in the matter.] [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-5\">There is no trouble here on that subject, because there is a written contract between the parties, and the only matter for you to determine is, what should be paid for the services rendered by the son, the plaintiff here, to the deceased father in pursuance of this written contract? That is the only question; and it is well for you to recall, when you are considering what shall be the rate of compensation, what were the relations between these parties, that it was not between strangers, but it was between a son and a father. A son is entitled to just such compensation as comes within the purview of the expressions of the written contract. [But in computing that, reference should be had to the relative position of the parties, the fact that they were parent and child. In arriving at this compensation, we think that should be borne in mind, not as a matter of charity alone, but as an element entering into the quantity and the nature of the services which are claimed for here. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Look at this as a fair business proposition; recalling the fact, also, that this was father and son.] [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-6\">The expression is this, that James McFeaters \u201c does enter into this contract and agrees that his son, William D. McFeaters, shall have a reasonable recompense in the way of pay for the said James McFeaters\u2019s, his father\u2019s, boarding and care and attention during the time that he may be and stay with him, the said William D. McFeaters.\u201d Now, then, the expression is \u201c boarding, care, attention.\u201d There is no conjunction there, but that is understood. The word \u201c and \u201d is not here, but the words \u201c care, attention,\u201d and that such pay or recompense shall not be payable during the life of the said James McFeaters past his pleasure or as long as he stays with the said Wm. D. McFeaters. Said pay or recompense to commence at the time that the said James McFeaters went to reside with the said William D. McFeaters and end at his decease or at any time he may leave the residence of William D. McFeaters to remain permanently away.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-7\">[Now, it is a safe rule to observe this, in fixing an amount of money that is not specified in a contract, what was in the mind of the parties to that contract at the time it was made; that would be a reasonable compensation in case there was a breach of it, or in case a suit had to be brought to compensate the party under the contract. In plain language, it is a fair thing to discover from all the testimony and the surroundings what was in the mind of James McFeaters and what was in the mind of William D. McFeaters at the time they made that contract of what would be a reasonable compensation for this boarding and care and attention; and, if you can discover it, that is a fair measure of compensation. It is not a question, necessarily, for you to think what it ought to be, what you would require; but, what was in the mind of those parties at the time they made this contract as far as you can discover it.] What was in the minds of these parties when they made this contract ? that was a reasonable compensation, if you can discover it from the testimony. What is such a reasonable compensation as was in the contemplation of the parties when this agreement was made ?

But the contract not having fixed upon the rate of compensation to be paid to the plaintiff for his services but, on the contrary, expressly provided that it should be a reasonable recompense, it necessarily devolved upon the jury exclusively to say how much it should be. The court properly left this question to the jury with correct instructions as to their duty. While it must be conceded that the remarks of the trial judge complained of in the first assignment were more redundant than the occasion required we cannot say there was positive error in them which we could regard as ground for reversal. The natural repugnance of most persons to contracts of this nature was some excuse for the comments of the court, but they were not erroneous in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The sixth assignment cannot be sustained.
