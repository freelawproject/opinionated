At the same time, and with the knowledge of the execution creditor, the general creditor agreed to give a mortgage on the lands to be conveyed to him to a junior execution creditor to secure the payment of his claim in consideration of the junior execution creditor not bidding at the sale. Immediately before the sale the general creditor refused to give to the junior execution creditor his notes, but renewed the offer to give the mortgage. The senior execution creditor thereupon agreed with the junior execution creditor not to convey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>the land to (he general creditor unless the latter gave the mortgage to the junior creditor. At the sale the senior creditor bought in the properly. The general creditor subsequently refused to take the property, and surrendered all his claim to it to the purchaser. At the time the surrender was made the senior creditor offered to convey to the junior creditor the land, if the latter would pay the amount which the general creditor had originally agreed to pay to the senior creditor. This offer was refused. Nearly three years after the surrender, and after valuable improvements had been placed upon the land, the junior creditor filed a bill in equity against the senior creditor to enforce an alleged trust. <em>Held, </em>that the bill was properly dismissed.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b335-5\">Argued Oct. 21, 1898.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A7n\">Appeal, No. 181, Oct.

Such a trust is a constructive one, and upon the purchaser\u2019s denying the promise, if same be established against him, he is termed a trustee ex maleficio: Sweetzer\u2019s App., 71 Pa. 264; Wolford v.

Such a pledge is sometimes termed an \u201cequitable mortgage,\u201d but owing to the fact that in England all second mortgages are termed \u201c equitable,\u201d the later writers adopt the terra \u201c equitable lien \u201d to describe an interest of this nature: Daggett v.
