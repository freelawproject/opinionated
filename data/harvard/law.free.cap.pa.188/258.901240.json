I hereby appoint Solomon B. Wise &amp; Joseph Wise Jr my executrix of this my last Will and testament.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-9\">Joseph Wise, Jr., accepted the farm devised to him at the death of his father and took possession of it. Some years after it came into his possession he became insolvent and made an assignment for the benefit of his creditors. His farm, under an order of court, was sold by the assignee, discharged of liens. The auditor appointed to distribute the fund realized from the sale of the farm, awarded the entire fund to the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>creditors of tlie assignor. The five sisters of Joseph Wise, Jr., whose legacies have not been paid in full, take exception to the auditor\u2019s award, claiming that they should be paid before the judgment creditors are entitled to anything. The single question raised by their exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report turns upon the construction of the will of Joseph Wise, Sr. Does his will make the legacies of his daughters a charge on the farm devised to his son Joseph Wise, Jr.? The rule by which we must be guided in determining this question, is well established. \u201c To make a legacy a charge upon land devised, it is necessary it should be declared so by express words, or that it may be inferred from the whole will that such was the intention of the testator.\u201d The difficulty arises, not in ascertaining and fixing the true rule of interpretation, but in its application to the language of each particular will. \u201cA naked direction to the devisee to\u00bbpay a legacy creates only a personal liability if he accepts the devise.\u201d But \u201c a direction to the devisee to pay a legacy out of the lands devised or as a condition on which the lands are devised, creates not only a personal liability, if the devise is accepted, but also a charge upon the land devised.\u201d If it appears from the language of the will that the testator intended to couple the payment of the legacy by the devisee with the devise of the land so that the payment is to be made because or as a condition on which the devise has been made, then the real estate devised is, in equity, chargeable with the payment of the legacy. In such a case the payment of the legacy is a condition on which an unincumbered title vests in the devisee. In the light of these rules of construction, let us examine the will in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-5\">The testator directed his personal estate to be sold to pay his debts and funeral expenses. He wished to give Joseph, Jr., the farm, and he wished to give each of his five daughters a certain sum of money, and it is apparent that he believed that there would be no personal estate out of which the daughters could be paid by the executors after his debts and funeral expenses were paid. What, then, is his scheme? To have the executors deed the farm to Joseph, Jr., for a consideration sufficient to pay the five girls their shares, or to devise it to him on condition that he pay the five daughters their legacies, as there will be no personal property out of which the executors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>can pay them. Joseph, Jr., was to pay a consideration for the land and that consideration money was to be paid to the daughters. The testator says \u201c my said younger son Joseph Wise, Jr., is to pay in consideration for the farm bequeath to him by me the balance to make the five daughters equal.\u201d Again, \u201c I bequeath to said Elizabeth, Mary Ann, Rebecca Maria and Barbary Hill $500 each .... to be paid in two years after my decease to them, which Joseph is to pay them .... being the balance he is to pay for the farm which I bequeath to said Joseph Wise, Jr.\u201d Clearly the testator coupled the payment of the money that his son Joseph was to pay his five daughters with the devise of the farm in such a way as to make it the payment of an interest that they were to have paid to them out of the farm. He was devised the farm on condition or with the direction that he \u201cpay for\u201d it a certain sum, and the persons to whom the payments are to be made are named. The testator evidently intended that Joseph, Jr., was to sustain a dual relation to his estate; he was to be both a devisee and a purchaser of this farm. The money he was to pay the five daughters was to he considered as purchase money, \u2014 as money \u201c paid for the farm,\u201d \u2014 and so far he was a purchaser of the farm. The value of the farm in excess of this sum was a gift, and to that extent he was a devisee; and that he might have an unincumbered title the testator provided that the executors should make him a deed, evidently when he paid the purchase money. It will not do to presume that the testator inserted this clause in his will out of ignorance. He had a purpose in inserting it, and that was to give his son, Joseph, Jr., an unincumbered title as soon as he complied with the condition upon which the farm was devised to him. The intention evidently was that the deed was to be given after, and to witness that, he had paid the charge that the testator had made on the farm in favor of his daughters. \u201c The question whether a legacy is a charge upon real estate is one of intention. If the actual intention appears, no form of vords is necessary. Unless technical words by which rules of property are fixed have been used, the intention is to be gathered from the whole will.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AUmE\">Applying this rule to the facts in this case, we are of opinion that Joseph Wise, Sr., intended that his daughters should be paid out of the farm devised to his son, Joseph, Jr., and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>that their legacies were a charge upon the land sold by the assignee. The costs of audit were properly disposed of. And now, April 21, 1897, the exceptions filed by the legatees to the auditor\u2019s report are sustained, and the report is referred back to the auditor to make distribution in accordance with the opinion herewith filed, -with power to take additional testimony if necessary. The exceptions filed by the judgment creditors, as to the costs of audit, are overruled.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AGA\">October 31, 1898:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in sustaining exceptions to auditor\u2019s report.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b282-6\"><em>D.
