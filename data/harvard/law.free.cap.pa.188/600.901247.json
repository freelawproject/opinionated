Gilchrist, architect, to the effect that the work is done in strict accordance with the drawings and specifications, and that he considers the payment properly dne; said certificate, however, in no way lessening the total and final responsibility of the contractor; neither shall it exempt the contractor from liability to replace work, if it be afterwards discovered to have been done ill or not in accordance with the drawings and specifications, either in execution or materials, and provided further, .... no liens shall be filed against the building by either the contractor or any sub-contractor for work or labor done ormaterial furnished.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-5\">The jury returned a verdict for plaintiff for $1,120, subject to the question of law reserved whether the plaintiff could recover on a mechanic\u2019s lien filed under the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-6\">The court, in an opinion by White, J., ordered that judgment should be entered for defendant non obstante veredicto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-7\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the judgment of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b621-8\"><em>J. McF. </em>Carpenter, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Atf\">There is no pretense of any parol agreement against liens, or even that the parties to this contract understood it to be a \u201c no lien contract.\u201d It simply provided that when the work was completed the contractor would be paid if no liens were filed. As stated above, by striking out certain words and inserting others, payment was made dependent on a fact instead of notice of a fact. There is not even a hint or suggestion that plaintiff should not file a lien, but merely a provision that he could not get the money which the architect might consider due and payable, if any lien was filed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b621-9\">All that can be claimed is that the plaintiff could not get his money on an order from the architect unless it was accompanied by a certificate setting forth certain facts, and unless as a fact no lien had been filed, or the lien creditor would then agree to release: Moore v. Carter, 146 Pa. 492.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b621-10\"><em>William M. McGill, </em>with him <em>Thomas D. Chantler, S. W. Cunningham </em>and <em>John C.

Caffrey, 93 Pa. 526; Scheid v. Rapp, 121 Pa. 593; Schroeder v. Galland, 134 Pa. 283; Benedict v. Hood, 134 Pa. 293; Nice v.

It is an independent stipulation, not connected with any other subject, and we know of no reason why it should not be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
