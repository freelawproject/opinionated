On this land or some parts of it were a gristmill and sawmill, with other improvements, and personal property of different kinds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-8\">On the west side of French creek in the township of Rock-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>dale, lie owned a farm which he bought of John George. He also owned a farm on the west side of French creek, the title to which came from Isaac Miller known as the Miller farm. He also owned about thirty-five acres of land in the same township, immediately north of, and adjoining the Miller farm. The title to this piece was derived from one Jededia Hall.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-4\">The testator was a widower without children, and Miss Alice J. Jarvis, the sister of his deceased wife, was his housekeeper. The Miller farm was his place of residence. A part of his business was raising or buying cattle, and fattening them for the New York market. This was done on the Miller farm, where he had barns for the housing of the cattle, and the necessary apparatus for preparing feed for them during the fattening process. As to the care of the cattle intended for the market as above stated when in pasturage, the facts, as nearly as I can ascertain therein from the evidence, statements and admissions of the counsel on each side, are that the cattle were pastured on his lands on both sides of French creek, as was most convenient.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-5\">At the time the testator died he had on the Miller farm over 100 head of cattle in preparation for market, some of them already fitted therefor. The testator had himself a few days before'his death procured two cars, to be sent to Miller\u2019s station immediately joining the Miller farm, for the purpose of shipping a part of the cattle to market. The cars were on the siding when he died; and were loaded and sent to New York-before he was buried. The cattle so sent were sold in New York and the proceeds thereof turned over to the executors or to Miss Jarvis, one of them. The remainder of these cattle or most of them, three more cars, were sent to market soon after, and the balance were retained until the following winter, prepared for market and marketed in the same way as the former two carloads.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-6\">During the intervening summer these cattle were pastured, or in a large part at least, on the lands of the estate of the testator on the east side of French creek, and the price of such pasturing charged by executors in their account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-7\">I state the fact as to the pay for this pasturing, on the testimony of Miss Alice J. Jarvis, which is not rebutted, and I find an item of money received from her in the account-of $280. That, while it does not say so, is presumably it.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AdS\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>October 17, 1898:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-4\">These cattle were prepared for and sent to market, and sold in the same way as the others. The entire sum received for these cattle was $5,866.66, the money being received by Miss Alice J. Jarvis, one of the executors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-5\">This item of $5,866.66 is not charged to the executors in the account; and its not being so charged is the ground of the sixth exception \u2014 the only contest now before the auditor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-6\">The contention of the exceptants is that, as the will is silent as to the thirty-five acres adjoining the Miller farm, and as the will is also silent as to the cattle being fattened on the Miller farm, and does specify certain articles of personal property on the Miller farm, as bequeathed to Miss Alice J. Jarvis, that, as to the thirty-five acres above mentioned, and the proceeds of the fat cattle, there is an intestacy, and therefore the proceeds of the said cattle belong to the heirs at law of the testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-7\">The contention on the other hand is that the proceeds of the sale of said cattle belong to Miss Alice J. Jarvis; in other words,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-8\">\u2022 that the bequest to her entitles her to all the personal property, on the Miller farm, belonging to the testator at the time of his death; that the will disposed of the entire estate, that there was no part of it of which there was an intestacy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-9\">The auditor found that there was no intestacy, and awarded the proceeds of the sale of cattle to Miss Jarvis.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-10\">The court sustained exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-11\"><em>.Errors assigned </em>were in sustaining exceptions to auditor\u2019s report.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b69-12\"><em>F.

This creek divided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>his lands into two nearly equal parts, and he made it a division line in disposing of his estate. His purpose to devote his property which was on the east side of the creek to the payment of debts and pecuniary legacies, and to give that on the west side to his adopted daughter and sister-in-law clear of all claims, he made very plain. After making a number of pecuniary legacies he directed that they should be paid from the proceeds of the sale of his real and personal property situate on the east side of the creek, and he provided that in the event of a deficiency of assets after the payment of debts the legacies should abate proportionately,. and that if there should be a surplus it should be divided equally among his nephews and nieces. He then came to the second branch of his will. Having exempted his property on the west side of the creek from the payment of debts and legacies he disposed of it, first by giving a farm to his adopted daughter, and then by giving all other lands and the personal property thereon to his sister-in-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">The last clause of the will is in effect a residuary clause. He had before disposed of all his property real and personal on the east side of French creek, and of one farm on the west side, and had provided plans for distribution in case there should be either a deficiency or a surplus. He commenced the clause with the words, \u201c I now give and bequeath,\u201d which in their connection indicate an intention to make a final disposition of the remainder of his property, and he proceeded to dispose of all other lands which he owned and all personal property thereon. His enumeration of the kinds of personal property, \u201csuch as cows, horses, hogs, household furniture, all farm tools, wagons, etc., that may be on the farm,\u201d raises the only doubt as to his intention. If this had been omitted his mean-' ing would have been very clear. But this enumeration, following general words which include everything, and in a clause which is in its character residuary, does not, we think, exclude the cattle in question. These cattle had been pastured on the testator\u2019s farms on both sides of the creek, and four months before his death they had been taken to his barns on the west side to be fattened for market. This had been done in the regular course of his business. For several years he had bought cattle which he pastured, on all of his farms during the summer and fattened in his barns on the west side during the winter. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>He was engaged in this business when the will was written, and continued in it without interruption until his death. The cattle in question constituted a large part of his personal estate, and it cannot be supposed that he either overlooked them in making his will or that he intentionally omitted them from the disposition he made. He was an uneducated man, entirely unskilled in the use of language, and his intention can be better reached by considering the general plan and purpose of his will, which he succeeded in making clear, than by a critical examination of the words and phrases which he used.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-3\">A partial intestacy is not to be presumed if the words used will carry the whole estate, and a construction is to be given a will which will avoid a partial intestacy unless the contrary is unavoidable: Reimer\u2019s Estate, 159 Pa. 212, and cases there cited. There is nothing in the will to indicate an intention that it was not to speak and take effect as if executed immediately before the death of the testator, but its general scheme and expression are in harmony with the construction provided for by the Act of June 4, 1879, P. L. 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">The decree of the orphans\u2019 court is reversed and set aside, and the report of the auditor is confirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
