Before Collier, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-9\">At the trial it appeared that at about five o\u2019clock in the afternoon on September 6, 1896, Cornelius Moran, a boy about eight years old, was injured while alighting from one of defendant\u2019s electric cars. The boy was in charge of his sister, about thirteen years old, and his cousin, a girl about fourteen years old. When the car reached the Twelfth street crossing in the city of McKeesport it stopped, and the two little girls succeeded in getting off. There was evidence that the little boy followed the girls to the platform, and before he could get off, and about the time he got on the step, the car started, and the boy was jolted or fell off the car. There was also evidence that he jumped off. The evidence tended to show that the conductor was negligent in starting the car before the boy had alighted, and that the motorman had not taken proper precautions to prevent the accident.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-10\">The trial court refused defendant\u2019s request for binding instructions.

Whether there was negligence in this respect was necessarily for the jury. There was also conflicting evidence as to whether he was jolted from the car, or fell off or jumped off, and this matter also required the determination of the jury. In these circumstances the court could not withdraw the case 'from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
