Further along in the same book was an account, the last entry of which was of a date ten years before decedent\u2019s death. The latter account did not exhibit the sale and delivery of any goods or property, but merely lump charges, and it showed a balance due the claimant of over $1,200. There was no evidence to explain the entries, nor to explain the delay in payment. The deceased was of ample means, while the claimant was in need; yet he had been paying the deceased cash for goods sold and delivered to himself. <em>Reid, </em>that the claim should be disallowed.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b234-8\">Argued Feb. 15, 1898.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AH_\">Appeal, No. 392, Jan.

They are separated by all these pages, upon nearly every page of which we find an account with other persons with Avhom Henry Breisch had dealings and an examination of these numerous accounts, shows that they are all of a date subsequent to the date of the account against Elias Miller on pages 455 and 450.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-16\">Robert Breisch, the son of Henry Breisch, was called as a Avitness to explain this system of accounts. He was bookkeeper for his father for about twenty-four years. After testifying to the account ending on pages 312 of the account book, he was asked:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-17\">\u201c Will you state to the court whether at the same time you kept in another portion of your book an account devoted to the timber business or transactions of Breisch and Miller? A. Yes, sir; on page 455.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-18\">He testified that the items of debit in this account were for timber or sawed lumber hauled to the mines for Elias Miller; that Elias Miller had a contract with certain collieries among which were Gilberton and Wiggans, for the sale and delivery of timber, and that Henry Breisch furnished the lumber upon a contract with Miller. He says this account was kept separate to know the amount of timber hauled in. He says that when the timber was delivered \u25a0 at the several collieries for Miller, entry was made of the quantity and character of the timber, in small books and from them, the lumping charges were made out and entered in this account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-19\">An examination of the account against Elias Miller, Avhich ends on page 312, shows that on page 114 during 1872, charges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>of lumber were entered against Miller, and on June 19,1878, an entry is made of one load of plank hauled to Gilberton colliery. On page 172 of the same account, during 1874, numerous items of timber delivered at the Gilberton colliery were charged up to Miller. On page 312 during 1878,1879 and 1882 various items of lumber were charged against Elias Miller. The evidence shows that on January 9, 1890, Breisch settled an account which Miller had against him by a cash payment of 144.57. The books of original entries of Elias Miller having every indication of being the record of his daily transactions with other persons, as well as the record of the mutual account between himself and Breisch, show no entry of the two items of credit entered by Breisch in his book to the credit of Miller, on December 7, 1895.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-5\">From this evidence, we find the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-6\">1. The account between Henry Breisch and Elias Miller ending on pages 312 and 313, presented by claimant, is an unsettled account of their mutual dealings from May 1, 1875, to December 7, 1895, and by this account nothing is due claimant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-7\">2. The account beginning on page 455 and ending on pages 450 and 451 begins November 80 and ends June 26, 1876. It is a separate and distinct account of an entirely different character. It does not exhibit the sale and delivery of any goods or property by Miller to Breisch.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-8\">3. The last item of this on either side is June, 1876; that nothing had been done by the decedent, by way of promise, acknowledgment or payment on this account within six years prior to his death which would toll the bar of the statute of limitations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-9\">Reference to a few authorities may be well, before making final disposition of this claim. In Mueller\u2019s Estate, 159 Pa. 590, it is said that \u201cclaims against decedents which might have been made against himself while living are always subject to just suspicion.\u201d The evidence offered in support of this claim discloses very just grounds for suspicion. It is a very stale claim. There appears no reason whatever for such delay. The decedent was of ample means, and Henry Breisch was in need of every cent due him, and while so in need, instead of insisting on payments on account, or credits on account, he was paying Miller in cash for goods sold and delivered to him by Mil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>ler. In the case of Wilson v. Wilson, 6 N. J. Law, 95, cited with approval by Mr. Justice Mitchell, in Fulton\u2019s Est., 178 .Pa. 86, it is said, \u201c A book of daily entries containing accounts with different people touching matters in which a man is known to deal or be employed, and which according to the custom of the country are usually made matter of account, has been admitted as evidence for the jury under all the circumstances of the case, while a detached paper, which might have been made up for the occasion, has been wholly rejected. ... Now these last entries appear to me to be no part of the book, properly speaking, but to stand precisely in the situation of a detached paper, and to derive no credit at all from their being written \u25a0within the cover of the book, seeing they are written upon pages wholly detached from the daily entries and accounts.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-4\">It is contended on behalf of claimant that Henry Breisch being a farmer, unacquainted with any better method for keeping his accounts, should not suffer because they were kept in this unusual way. But it is plain he must have known better how to keep such accounts, for during 1872, 1878, 1874, 1878, 1879 and 1882, numerous items of lumber charges were entered by him against Miller, in the usual and proper way, \u2014 not in lump charges as these are in a separate part from the regular entries of their mutual dealings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-5\">The claim is disallowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in overruling exceptions to adjudication.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b240-7\"><em>E.
