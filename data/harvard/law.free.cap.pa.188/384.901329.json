On October 7, 1892, John G. Ruoff obtained a judgment against Lewis H. Hartzell for $8,860. On September 22,1893, Lewis H. Hartzell assigned to one John Long all his estate, right, title, etc., by and under the will of his father that would be due and owing to him at the death of his mother, Hannah Hartzell. This assignment was in writing, was for a valuable consideration, and on the day it was made, it was recorded in the recorder\u2019s office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-7\">On September 28, judgment was entered in favor of J.

Upon the two judgments above recited writs of fi. fa. were issued; the land devised to Lewis II. Hartzell was taken in execution and sold by the sheriff on November 10, 1893, to John G. Ruoff for $2,505. This sale was regularly confirmed by the court, and a deed was duly acknowledged and delivered to the purchaser.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-9\">6.

The sheriff\u2019s schedule of distribution shows that $1,262.49 was applied to the payment of arrears due the widow at time of sale; $47.85 to costs of sale, and the balance of the purchase money $1,194.66, was allowed to John G. Ruoff, the purchaser, on account of his judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-10\">7. Hannah Hartzell, widow of testator, died on March 24, 1895. Since her death John G. Ruoff has refused to pay to the legatees\u2019 petitioners the sum of $2,560 or any part thereof, and this proceeding has been instituted to enforce payment of that amount with interest from the date of the death of the widow. On his own petition John Long, assignee of the share of Lewis II. Hartzell, has been permitted by the court to intervene and become one of the petitioners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>CONCLUSIONS ON LAW.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-4\">1. The devise to Lewis H. Hartzell and his acceptance thereof vested in him the title to the \u201c Keefer farm,\u201d charged with a lien to secure the payment of $2,560 dollars and interest thereon, to the persons and at the times provided in the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-5\">2. Under the will, Lewis H. Hartzell, on the death of the widow, was entitled to receive, not any fixed share of the $2,560 charged on his own land, but a share in a fund to be made up of this and several like charges, from which fund was first to be deducted the costs and expenses of collection, distribution, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-6\">3. Under these circumstances this future but undetermined interest of Lewis H. Hartzell in the fund to be created as provided in the will did not merge and become extinguished in the fee simple title to the land which vested in him under the devise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-7\">4. The lien created by the will being of a fixed and continuing nature, a sheriff\u2019s sale of the land during the life of the widow did not discharge the lien, but the purchaser took the land charged with the payment of $2,560, and the interest thereon, in addition to the amount of his bid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-8\">5. The purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale did not buy the interest or share of Lewis H. Hartzell in the fund to be gathered after the death of the widow, but only his interest in and title to the land itself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-9\">6. John G. Ruoff, the respondent, has no defense at law or in equity to the payment of the sum of $2,560 with interest thereon, from March 24, 1895, the date of the widow\u2019s death, and the petitioners are entitled to a decree in their favor for that amount.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-10\">If the respondent had any doubt as to the persons he should pay, the first section of the Act of May 1, 1861, Purdon\u2019s Di- \u2022 gest (12th ed.), 621, pi. 269, furnishes complete protection against such dangers and enables a person in his situation to pay the legacy and discharge his land with promptness and security.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-11\">That the land passed by the devise charged with the payment of the valuation money fixed by the testator, is too plain for argument: Hart v. Homiller, 23 Pa. 39 ; Gilbert\u2019s Appeal, 85 Pa. 347.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>The devisee having taken the title bound by a lien, let us consider the further provision of the will providing for the creation of a fund after the death of the widow, and giving to each of his live children, including Lewis, an equal share in the net proceeds of that fund. Can it be said that the lien tlius fixed on the land of Lewis became merged in whole or in part in the title which vested in Lewis, because he, as a legatee, was to receive a share of the fund of which the money charged on his own land was a constituent part ? That the lien as a whole could not merge seems clear, because the widow and the other legatees were interested in it, and their interests could not be destroyed by mere operation of law. Equity does not favor mergers; and in law mergers are said to bo odious. Equity will not permit the rights of creditors, legatees, etc., to be defeated by mere act of law, without any act done by them: Penington v. Coats, 6 Wharton, 282.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-5\">So if there be a beneficial interest in any other person, there will be no merger: Dougherty v. Jack, 5 Watts, 456.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-6\">Could any part of the lien merge on the theory that it represented the share of Lewis in the fund? If so, what part or to what extent ? Let it be kept in mind that Lewis was not given a portion of the money charged on his own land, so that it could be said he owed himself a fixed and determinate sum. On the contrary, he was given a share in a fund the exact amount of which could not be determined when his rights vested, and cannot be determined now. True, if each devisee paid in the amount charged in the will, the gross amount of the fund could be known. Even then the net amount of the fund could not be ascertained. But how could it be told until payments were actually made that the devisees would pay the amount charged ? And in case of their failure what certainty is there that the lands charged would sell for enough to realize the amounts charged ? Although the original petition filed by the executor averred that the remaining devisees had paid into his hands the amounts charged on their devises, when the court decided that he had no standing to* receive the money and release the land the money may have been withdrawn from his hands; or it may be withdrawn at the pleasure of the devisees, as the executor is but their agent in this respect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-7\">It seems clear that the interest of Lewis in this lien was so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>impossible of ascertainment that the doctrine of merger could . not apply. Moreover it was not to the interest of the devisee that the two should merge. His interest in the fund was personal property. It could not be bound by the lien of a judgment against him. It would not pass by a sheriff\u2019s sale of his land. He could sell and assign it at pleasure like any other chose in action. Under such circumstances there is a presumption that no merger took place. As a merger is for the benefit of him in whom the two interests unite, it will never take place when it is against his interest, or when it is most for his advantage to keep the charge alive: Wallace v. Blair, 1 Grant, 81; Moore v. Harrisburg Bank, 8 Watts, 149; Dougherty v. Jack, supra; Bryar\u2019s Appeal, 111 Pa. 81. There is also some evidence, the only evidence on either side of this question, that as early as 1898, Lewis Hartzell did not consider there was any merger, because on September 22 of that year, he specifically assigned his interest in the fund to John Long. Finally the case of Hart v. Homiller, Ex\u2019r, supra, seems to expressly decide this question and about every other important question in this case: \u201cIf after this (a sheriff\u2019s sale of the land of the devisee charged with the payment of a legacy) there should be funds in the hands of the executor of the estate, and the said devisee\u2019s share thereof should be sufficient to pay the charge on the land thus devised, this would not of itself operate as an extinguishment of the charge; for that would be the application of the devisee\u2019s funds in order to discharge the duty of the sheriff\u2019s vendee.\u201d As this case is so much like the one in hand, and rules nearly every phase of it, it may be well to recall that it was carefully reviewed by Mitchell, J., in delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court when the present case was recently before that body: Hartzell\u2019s Estate, 178 Pa. 286. While they overrule the case cited, in so far as it decides that an executor may maintain a proceeding in the orphans\u2019 court to recover a legacy charged on land, the learned justice says: \u201c These cases are all subsequent to Hart v. Homiller, and while not disturbing the principle of that decision, must be accepted as establishing a different practice.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-4\">It would therefore appear that on September 22,1893, Lewis Hartzell was the owner of a tract of land bound by the liens of the charge created by the will, and the judgment of respondent. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>He was also the owner of a share in a fund to be made up after his mother\u2019s death in the manner provided by the will. This was personal property, and was not bound by any attachment or other legal impediment to its assignment. On the date named he assigned this share for a valuable consideration to John Long, and there is no reason apparent in the evidence before the auditor why this assignment did not pass a good title to the assignee. The subsequent sale by the sheriff did not convey anything but the interest of Hartzell in the land. It did not disturb the assignment to Long. The purchaser had express notice of the fact that the lien would be preserved, and that the land would cost him the amount of the lien in addition to his bid. Presumably by reason of this, the respondent bought for $2,505, land devised to Lewis Hartzell by his father at $7,680.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-3\">Under these circumstances the law will not permit the purchaser to hold the land except on payment of the legacy. And certainly in equity he has no standing to ask that his land should be discharged from the duty of paying the legacy. Upon all the evidence the auditor feels clear that the respondent has no defense at law or in equity against this proceeding, and accordingly a decree directing the payment of $2,560 with interest from the date of the death of the widow and costs since the filing of the present petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-4\">Exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report were dismissed by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in dismissing exceptions to auditor\u2019s report.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b411-6\"><em>W.

In consideration of the language used it is clear the testator did not charge the land (except for the widow\u2019s benefit). He could easily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>have done so by express words: Hackadorn\u2019s App., 11 Pa. 88 ; 2 Trickett on Liens, sec. 541; Solliday v.
