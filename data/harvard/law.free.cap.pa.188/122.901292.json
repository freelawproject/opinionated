L. 330, which reads as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-7\">\u201c Section 1. That whenever the school directors, or controllers of any city, borough, township or independent \"school district shall wilfully neglect or refuse to provide suitable houses, rooms or buildings, in and for any school district within their jurisdiction, and under their supervision and control, with ample room and seating for the reasonable and convenient accommodation of all the school children residing within the district who may be in attendance, or who desire to attend the school or schools therein, then ten or more taxable citizens, residents of the said district, may set forth in writing the facts in the case, under oath or affirmation of at least six persons who sign the statement, and petition the court of common pleas of the county in which said school district is situated, or in vacation any judge of the said court, for the appointment of a competent inspector, and the court or judge thereof may appoint such inspector, whose duty it shall be to visit the district by order of the court or judge thereof, and inquire into the facts set forth in the complaint submitted, giving due notice to the members of the board of directors against whom the complaint for neglect of duty is made, and to other persons concerned, and the said inspector shall report to the court or proper judge thereof, under oath or affirmation, of the result of his personal inspection and investigation, accompanied by statements of facts and proofs obtained in the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-8\">\u201cSection 2. If, after hearing the allegations and proofs offered to substantiate the charges set forth in the complaint or to disprove them, and after having fully and diligently inquired into all the facts and circumstances bearing on the case in point, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>the aforesaid inspector finds that the directors or controllers have refused, neglected or failed, without valid cause for such refusal, neglect or failure on their part, to provide and maintain suitable and adequate accommodations for the school children of the district as the law requires, he shall so report to the court or the judge appointing him, and the court in such case is hereby authorized and empowered to grant a rule upon the directors or controllers then having jurisdiction in the district, or such of them as have wilfully neglected or failed without justifiable excuse to perform the duties enjoined upon them by law, to show cause why the court or judge thereof should not remove them from office and appoint others in their stead, until the next annual election for directors.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-5\">Under the school law of 1854, the courts of this commonwealth have invariably refused to interfere with the discretion of school directors in all matters, especially in the building and location of schoolhouses, for the reason that matters of discretion are not reviewable in law or equity. It is only in cases of bad faith equivalent to fraud that these courts would interfere, suggesting that the remedy for the abuse of discretion was in the votes of the taxpayers at the polls. The act of 1893, however, has expressly given to courts enlarged powers. Justice Dean, in delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court on an interpretation of this act of assembly in In re Rule upon G. S. Walker, Ross\u2019s App., 179 Pa. 24, says, among other things: \u201c There is no doubt, however vaguely expressed, that the legislature intended by the act of 1893, to confer a certain power of supervision of the discretion of school boards on the state courts, which, under the law of 1854, they did not theretofore have.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AEi\">And further on in commenting upon the wording of section 1, viz: \u201c If the directors \u2018 shall wilfully neglect or refuse \u2019 to provide houses, rooms or buildings, then on petition of ten or more taxable citizens, the court shall act.\u201d \u201c This imposes upon the court the duty,\u201d says Justice Dean, \u201cthrough its own appointees of investigation and putting upon record the facts and testimony. If the inspector then finds that \u2018 without valid cause \u2019 the directors have neglected or refused to perform their duty, he shall report. It will be noticed, the words, \u2018 wilfully neglected and refused,\u2019 are here dropped, and the words, \u2018 without valid cause,.\u2019 substituted; words not by any means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>importing the same thing. If a duty be enjoined on an officer, his refusal to perform it is wilful. He has no discretion as to its performance. But, if he be commanded to do a certain act, unless he have a valid cause for not doing it, and he then refuses for cause, the question is at once raised between him and his superior, whether the cause is sufficient to excuse him in his disobedience; it brings the judgment and discretion of the subordinate at once under the supervision of his superior. And further reading of section 2, bears out this view. It says, tiie court is empowered to grant a rule on those directors who \u2018have-failed without justifiable excuse \u2019 to perform the duty enjoined.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-5\">This decision also settles another question raised in the same case; that is, that the finding of fact by the inspector is not conclusive, like that of an auditor, on the court below. His reported conclusions are subject to a careful review on the rule to show cause on school directors, which the act of assembly authorizes, in case the inspector finds that the directors have refused, neglected or failed to provide adequate accommodations, as required, \u201c without valid cause for such refusal, neglect or failure.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-6\">We have very carefully examined the testimony and the report of the inspector in this case, because we feel that the power given us by the act of assembly should be exercised only in a very clear case. The facts in this case, as we gather them from the testimony taken by the inspector, are plain, and clearly show that there is an absolute necessity for a new schoolhouse at the village at Kirkwood. [The testimony shows, as the inspector says, that there are thirty-eight children of school age in the village of Kirkwood, within a radius of half a mile from the center, and the nearest schools to the said village, which these pupils now attend, are each a mile and a half distant, and that the seating capacity for all the school children residing within the district, who desire to attend these schools is insufficient to accommodate them. These facts are uneontroverted. The testimony also shows, and the inspector so reports as the fact, that there has been no change in schoolhouse sites or locations during the past sixty years, and no additional schoolhouse facilities were furnished in that time, and the school tax rate in said district in 1895 was but two and a half mills on the dollar, which was reduced to two mills in 1896, and that. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>the board of school directors had reduced the salaries of their teachers $2.00 a month; while the school law authorizes an amount of tax to be levied annually equal in amount to the county and state taxes, which is thirteen mills on the dollar for school purposes and an equal amount for building purposes, making in all twenty-six mills on the dollar.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ApM\">October 17, 1898:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-4\">It seems to us that there could scarcely be a stronger appeal made to the legal discretion of a court, than the one now before us.] [The abuse of discretion in this case is very clear, in our opinion, which compels us to make this rule absolute, the costs to be paid by the school district.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the order of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b146-6\"><em>B.

The court appointed an inspector as provided by the act, who took much testimony on both sides, and in a very careful report finds that the averments of the petition are true. On the report being presented to the court additional testimony was taken in the shape of depositions; the court again carefully considered the whole subject, and in an unanswerable opinion filed concurred with the inspector. Then, an order of removal was made, a new board appointed, which was recognized by the state department, a tax laid and a new sehoolhouse built. From the decree of removal we have this appeal by the old board. The principal assignment of error is an attack on the power of the court under the act of 1898. We shall not repeat what we said in Ross\u2019s Appeal, 179 Pa. 25, and in Kittanning School District\u2019s Appeal, 179 Pa. 60. After a careful consideration we adopted the construction of the act announced in those cases, and we adhere to it now. Evidently when the legislature adopted the policy of largely increased state appropriations, it also adopted the policy of conferring on the state courts enlarged powers of supervision. The millions of additional money appropriated were not intended to lessen local taxation, but to increase the efficiency of the schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The court below, on ample testimony, has found the facts warranting its decree; we would not touch it, unless there was a manifest error in its finding or a flagrant abuse of its discretion. Not the semblance of either is shown. The decree is .affirmed, and appeal dismissed at costs of appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b147-6\">Mk. Justice Mitchell,</author>\n<p id=\"AznC\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Though I did not note a dissent in the cases giving a con\u2022struction to the act of 1893,1 did not concur in them, as I was .and am of opinion that all that act intended was to authorize the courts to compel the exercise by the school directors of the powers vested in them by the law, in other words, to enforce attention to their duties, not to substitute the judgment or discretion of the inspector or the court for that of the officers to whom the people, under the law, had committed the authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>This case is the application of those decisions run into extremes. The appellants, a new board, were ousted for the non-action of the old one, on a question of difference in judgment between both boards and the court, and when the matter came again before the people as the ultimate tribunal to settle it, they voted to restore the ousted board. The result therefore of this case is that the court of common pleas of Lancaster county is-managing the school affairs of Oolerain township on its own judgment, not only against the judgment of the officers primarily charged with that duty, but against the expressed will of the-people themselves. I dissent entirely from such judicial usurpation of functions committed by law to elected officers.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
