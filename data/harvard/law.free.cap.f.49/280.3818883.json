Suit by the masters of the vessels Hampshire and Ixia against the Havemeyers &amp; Elder Sugar Refining Company to recover a balance of freight.

The Hampshire delivered 211 more bags than the bills pf lading called for; the Ixia, 76. The shortage in weight was not 1 per cent, of the amount stated in the bills of lading, which could be. accounted for by the tendency of sugar to vary in weight from inherent causes. The district court held that all of the sugar received had been delivered, and hence that the alleged offset to libelants\u2019 claims failed, and they were entitled to recover, (42 Fed. Rep. 511;) and, on appeal, a <em>pro forma </em>affirmance was rendered by the circuit court, whence respondent appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b296-11\"><em>Parsons, Shepard &amp; Ogden, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b296-12\"><em>Convers &amp; Kirlin, </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b296-13\">Before Wallace and Lacombe, Circuit.

We are satisfied that the contents of these bags were delivered in the 76 new bags of the Ixia,. and the 211 of the .Hampshire,, containing sweepings, and that some of the cargo bags were destroyed by rough usage during the discharge, and others, partly destroyed, were put inside the new bags. The decree of the circuit court in each case is affirmed, with interest, and the costs of the appeal to be paid by the appellant, and the cause remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
