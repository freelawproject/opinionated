Libelant was afterwards informed that the R.

No notice was given to the vessel owner that the ship was expected to pay for the tow-age until the failure of the ice company, six months after the first voyage. <em>Held, </em>that the service was not rendered on the credit of the vessel, but on the credit of the charterer. 45 Fed.

Previous to the rendering of the towage sued for, the libelant had rendered other towage services to the schooner, the bills for which had been paid by the Ridgewood Ice Company. No notice was given the master or owmers of the vessel that they were expected to pay these towage bills until after the failure of the Ridgewood Ice Company, and the claimants contended that the services were not rendered on the credit of the vessel, but at the request and on the credit of the ice oompany. The district court found that the services were not rendered on the credit of the vessel, and dismissed the libel, (45 Fed. Rep. 511;) and, on appeal, a <em>pro forma </em>affirmance w'as rendered by the circuit court, whence libelant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b182-13\"><em>Wing, Shoudy &amp; Putnam, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number><em>Owen, Gray &amp; Sturges, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b183-4\">Before Wallace and Lacombe, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b183-5\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AF7f\">We are satisfied that the towage service, for the recovery of which this' libel is filed, was not rendered on the credit of the schooner or her owners, but both her master and the libelant understood that the towage was to be collected of the Ridgewood Ice Company, the charterer of the vessel. The decree of the circuit court is affirmed, with costs of this court, and the cause remanded to that court, with directions to render a decree accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
