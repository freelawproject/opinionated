The tug had no lookout, other than her master at the wheel. The sloop went from one tack to another, when about 1,000 feet from shore, and the tug soon after struck and sank her. The tug claimed that the change of course was the cause of the collision. The court found that the tug had ample time to have avoided the sloop after her going about, and accordingly <em>held, </em>that the tug was solely in fault for keeping a defective lookout.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b183-15\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-16\">In Admiralty.

Young left the foot of Fulton street, New York, hound for Yonkers. The morning was clear, the tug had no low, and went out about one-third of the distance across the river, and then took a straight up-river course, going at full speed. She had no stationed lookout forward, other than her master in the pilot-house. When somewhere in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>neighborhood of Twenty-Third street, her master discovered ahead of him the small fishing sloop Mary, which was beating up the river, heading somewhat on the New York shore, and which was then to the eastward of the course of the tug. The latter kept on with unabated speed, continually overtaking the sloop. When about off Twenty-Sixth or Twenty-Seventh street, and while still 1,000 feet from the New York shore, the sloop went about on her tack towards New Jersey. Shortly afterwards the tug struck the sloop, cutting off her stem, causing her to become a total wreck, and inflicting personal injuries on her master, who was at the helm. The owner of the sloop brought suit for the loss of the vessel, the master for his personal injuries, and a deck-hand for the loss of his effects, all of which suits were consolidated on motion. The district court held the tug solely in fault, (45 Fed. Rep. 505,) and on appeal a <em>pro forma </em>affirmance was given by the circuit .court, whence an appeal was taken to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b184-4\"><em>Benedict &amp; Benedict, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-5\">The absence of a stationed lookout on the tug is immaterial, unless the collision was caused by such absence of lookout. <em>The Farragut, </em>10 Wall. 334; <em>The Fannie, </em>11 Wall. 238; <em>The Atlas, </em>10 Blatchf. 459, 464; <em>The Gen.

If, under that assumption, the sloop\u2019s maneuver was not calculated to mislead or embarrass the tug, it is immaterial whether or not she ran out her port tack. The testimony shows clearly, and in fact it was conceded on the argument, that she had gone about\" and filled upon the starboard tack before the collision. The disputed question is whether there was abundant time and space to enable the tug, seeing her maneuver, to keep out of the way. The collision happened about opposite Twenty-Seventh or Twenty-Eighth street. Such is the testimony of the disinterested witnesses called by the claimant, who saw it from the foot of Twenty-Ninth street. Variation in their estimates of the precise distance is to be expected; but it was certainly below, not above, their own position. They testify that the sloop went about very shortly before, (though one of them fixes the time as three or four minutes,) and therefore a little further down the river. The witness Sands, who was standing on the pier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>at tlio foot of Twenty-Fifth street, says that she went about off Twenty-Fourth street, a#id that the collision took place off Twenty-Sixth or Twenty-Seventh street. Any estimate of his as to distances away from him, in the same direction, is as fallible as such estimates usually arc; but it seems hardly possible ho could be mistaken in the statement that one of the places he indicates is above, and the other below, his own point of observation. It seems a fair conclusion from the evidence that the sloop had sailed on her now tack, at least as far as from Twenty-Fourth to Twenty-Sixth street, which gave the tug ample time to conform her own navigation to the change of the sloop\u2019s course, if she had seen tho latter come about, as she should have done. Tho decree of the court below is affirmed, with interest and the costs of the appeal to be paid by the appellant, and the cause remanded for further proceedings to be there taken in pursuance of this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
