It therefore prays the court to enjoin the defendant against proceeding at law to collect rent under the lease; to assist the plaintiff in making delivery of the leased property, and in ascertaining what compensation should be rendered to the defendant for its previous use; and generally to afford its aid in settling the controversy which has arisen out of the transactions between the parties, and terminating, finally, their relations. The court, acknowledging the plaintiff\u2019s right to terminate the lease under the circumstances stated, granted an injunction against proceeding at law to recover rent accruing subsequently to such notice; and declined to interfere with an action, then pending, brought to' recover rent previously due, because the question of validity raised, could be interposed and decided on the trial thereof. Subsequently oh such trial, and review by the supreme court, thelease was found to be invalid. The plaintiff in the bill now seeks to discontinue proceedings under it, while thedefendant endeavors, through the instrumentality of a cross-bill, to avail himself of its use as a means of recovering possession of his property, or its equivalent, and compensation for the plaintiff\u2019s enjoyment of it under the lease. We do not think the plaintiff\u2019s motion should prevail. The propriety of allowing discontinuances in equity depends upon whether defendants may be prejudiced thereby. A decree, or decretal order, entered is usually a conclusive answer to the application. Here, not only was such an order entered, but it now appears that the proceeding, or a similar independent one commenced by himself is the defendant\u2019s only means of enforcing his rights \u2014 rights which the bill in a measure concedes. The principal object of the proceeding, originally, was to accomplish the object which the defendant now seeks; and considerable testimony has been taken with a view to this end. The defendant would, therefore, be seriously prejudiced by its discontinuance. Not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>only would he lose the benefit of this testimony, hut he would also he delayed, and might be compelled to seek the plaintiff in another jurisdiction. The object of the cross-bill is to enable the defendant to assume an aggressive attitude in the proceeding, and to use it as a means of settling and closing up the entire controversy on which it is founded. This object seems projier and commendable; and we do not find anything in the rules governing equity pleading, which forbids its allowance. The decisions in which it has been held that cross-bills come too late after answers have been filed \u2014 that they should be presented as soon as practicable, so as io avoid delaying the plaintiff\u2019s efforts to obtain a trial,\u2014 are not applicable to the circumstances of this case. The plaintiff\u2019s motion must therefore be dismissed and the defendant\u2019s allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">Acheson, Circuit Judge, concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
