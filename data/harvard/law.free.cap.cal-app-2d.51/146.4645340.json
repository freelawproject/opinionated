Such ruling was in accordance with numerous previous decisions holding that, in order to comply with the requirements of the last paragraph of rule VIII, section 2, <em>supra, </em>appellant\u2019s assignments of error should take the form of propositions which, if sustained, would lend substantial support to appellant\u2019s request for a reversal of the judgment of the lower court. <em>(Adams </em>v. <em>Standard Accident Insurance Co., </em>124 Cal.

(2d) 387].)</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Appellant has not filed a brief pursuant to our order of October 22, 1941. Therefore, since more than twenty days have elapsed since the entry of such order, respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal should be and it is hereby granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Moore, P.
