September 25, 1941, appellant filed its notice of appeal from the foregoing judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">Respondent relies upon this proposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-13\">\n<em>The time for taking an appeal from a judgment of the superior cou,rt annulling an election and declaring a vacancy to exist in a particular office is ten days after the entry of judgment by the superior court.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-14\">This proposition is tenable. Section 8575 of the Elections Code reads in part thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-15\">\u201cAny party aggrieved by the judgment of the court may appeal therefrom to the district court of appeal, as in other cases of appeal thereto from the superior court. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-16\">Were this the only provision on the subject, an aggrieved party would have sixty days after the entry of judgment within which to file a notice of appeal. (See. 939, Code Civ. Proc.) However, section 8576 of the Elections Code reads thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-17\">\u201cWhenever an election is annulled or set aside by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>judgment of the superior court, and no appeal has been taken within ten days thereafter, the commission, if any has issued, is void and the office is vacant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Therefore, under the established rule that a specific provision relating to a particular subject will govern in respect to that subject as against a general provision, although the latter standing alone would be broad enough to include the subject to which the more particular provision relates, the time for taking an appeal in the case of the annulment of an election is determined by the special statute, namely, section 8576 of the Elections Code. (Sec. 3534, Civ. Code; <em>Kahrs </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>28 Cal. App. (2d) 46, 49 [82 P. (2d) 29] ; sec. 1859, Code Civ. Proc.) Section 8576 of the Elections Code constitutes an exception to the general statute. (Sec. 8575, Election Code; sec. 939, Code Civ. Proc.)</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">In the instant case the notice of appeal was filed thirty-seven days after the entry of judgment in the superior court, which was after the time prescribed by law for the filing of notice of appeal in such cases. It follows that the appeal was not taken within the time prescribed by law and, since the filing of a notice of appeal within the time allowed by law is mandatory in order to confer jurisdiction upon this court <em>(Lancel </em>v. <em>Postlethwaite, </em>172 Cal. 326, 331 [156 Pac. 486]; <em>Irving </em>v. <em>Sheetz, </em>26 Cal. App. (2d) 751, 752 [80 P. (2d) 502]), the appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Moore, P. J., and Wood (W. J.), J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
