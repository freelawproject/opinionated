During the times herein mentioned, appellant lived with his elderly father in a small apartment in the city of Sacramento. The victim of the killing was one Albert Burke, who had lived with his wife Leona, for some eight years, but who was not married to her until about one year prior to the shooting. Leona had been married three times, and had two children by decedent, and one by each of her other two husbands. The Burkes and the Smiths had been friendly for a number of years, living in adjoining dwellings. On the night of October 25, 1941, or very early Sunday morning, decedent went to the Smith apartment and pounded loudly upon the door. Appellant opened the door, and according to his testimony, decedent struck him with his fist, knocking him back into the room. Appellant thereupon reached for a revolver Which was concealed under some quilts. He shot the decedent several times, inflicting a wound which was fatal. The visit of decedent to the apartment of Smiths appears from the evidence to have been the result of a conspiracy between Leona and . appellant. According to the statement made by the latter, and which appears in the record, on the night of the killing, appellant and Leona had a long talk concerning her husband. Leona knew that appellant had a gun on the premises. She therefore proceeded to impregnate his mind with the idea that it would be very good strategy for the two of them to get rid of the husband in some manner. We quote from the statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">\"Question: All right. A. And I took the two drinks of whiskey, and she says, \u2018 Al hit me on the jaw. \u2019 Well, it was swollen a little. I says, \u2018The dirty cur,\u2019 like that. I says, \u2018A man who will hit a woman won\u2019t fight a man, and,\u2019 I says, \u2018he ain\u2019t much to do it.\u2019 <em>And she says, \u2018I wish some kind of an accident would happen to him, either like he would get killed, or something like that.\u2019 </em>\u2018Well,\u2019 I says, \u2018you don\u2019t want to think nothing like that because, \u2019 I says, \u2018we have been good friends all the way around and\u2019\u2014Question: Go ahead. A. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>she says, \u2018well,\u2019 she says, \u2018he is nothing in the world but what you would call a brute, more than anything.\u2019 And she says, \u2018I just can\u2019t stand him much longer.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 I says, \u2018that ain\u2019t none of my business.\u2019 And she says, \u2018Where do you keep your gun?\u2019 I says, \u2018I keep it on the dresser most of the time.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 she says, \u2018why do you keep it on the dresser ?\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 I says, \u2018so it won\u2019t be concealed; if anybody comes down there they can see it.\u2019 And she says, \u2018Why don\u2019t you keep it over there next to the suitcases where the quilts are ? \u2019 She says, \u2018You can keep it underneath there.\u2019 And\u2014\u2018Well,\u2019 she says, \u2018that might be a pretty good idea;\u2019 like that. <em>And she says, \u2018I am going to phone up Al,\u2019 and says, \u2018and have an understanding with him and bring him down to the house.\u2019 She says, \u2018but,\u2019 she says, \u2018he might come down mad and start a fight with you.\u2019 \u2018But,\u2019 she says, \u2018if you shoot a man in your house,\u2019 she says, \u2018it is\u2014you can call for justifiable, or something like that.\u2019 Well, you know what I mean; self-defense. \u2018And,\u2019\u2014\u2018and it happened in your house.\u2019 And\u2014\u2018well,\u2019 I says, \u2018I tell you,\u2019 I says, \u2018I don\u2019t know; I don\u2019t know much about the law.\u2019 </em>Just like that. And\u2014well, she says, \u2018I am going to phone him up and bring him down after I have a talk with him, and,\u2019 <em>she says, \u2018if anything happens,\u2019 she says, \u2018you can have my daughter and I will take your father.\u2019 </em>Like that. \u2018Well,\u2019 I says, \u2018I don\u2019t want your daughter, and,\u2019 I says, \u2018if Dad ever took you,\u2019 I says, \u2018I would want to get away, because, \u2019 I says, \u2018I don\u2019t want neither one of you\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The father of appellant testified that the revolver with which the shooting was done was loaded with shells sometime Saturday night. It also appears that the revolver had been taken from its usual location on the dresser and placed beneath the quilts above mentioned. It further appears that after Leona had told her husband that the Smiths had rented an apartment for her, the husband immediately became very angry and started for the Smith apartment. The wife testified that she followed him to the apartment, and she admitted that at no time did she warn him of the fact that appellant possessed a revolver. She was immediately behind her husband, and saw him knock at the door of the apartment; she heard the door open, and saw a burst of flame as the revolver was fired. The husband, after the shooting, fell immediately to the floor, and was conscious for a very short period. She testified that her husband said, before he lapsed into unconsciousness, \u201cYou <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>got me, Edgar, \u2019 \u2019 (meaning the appellant). Edgar said, \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>That is what you get for fooling around. \u2019 \u2019 The evidence further showed that decedent was unarmed. In all, three shots were fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">We think the evidence is sufficient to support the verdict. Both the appellant and the wife of decedent are fortunate that they were not found guilty of a more serious offense. The woman took the role of a modern \u201cLady Macbeth,\u201d and planted in the mind of appellant, who was far younger than she, the idea that it would be best for both of them if the decedent was done away with. For this, we have the testimony of appellant himself. It is regrettable that the State did not see fit to bring the wife before the bar of justice. There is ample evidence from which the jury could have found premeditation, instead of finding that the killing was done in the heat of passion.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">We find no merit in the contention that there was any prejudicial misconduct on the part of the district attorney in his argument to the jury. In this connection it is urged that the district attorney stated to the jury that the deceased worked every day, whereas in truth and in fact, he did not have a steady <em>job; </em>that the district attorney stated that appellant furnished the wife with liquor and constantly plied her with it; that the district attorney referred to the law of some other states concerning the necessity for one in a quarrel to warn the other before he starts shooting; and finally, that the district attorney made some reference to the future economic condition of the two children of decedent. We cannot say that the district attorney went beyond the bounds of legitimate argument. Furthermore, the trial court admonished the jury to pay no attention to the foregoing statements. The evidence of guilt is so plain that we do not see how the jury could possibly have been influenced by the incidents mentioned. In 8 Cal. Jur. 621, 622, \u00a7 602, it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">\u201cA judgment will not be reversed because of the misconduct of the district attorney except in clear and extreme cases, and unless the misconduct is flagrant and obviously prejudicial, and unless, in the opinion of the appellate court from a review of the entire record, it results in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d Certainly, there has been no miscarriage of justice here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>The judgment and order denying motion for a new trial are, and each of them is, hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Thompson, Acting P. J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied May 28, 1942.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
