Second, that defendant did not give plaintiff credit for a part of the products repossessed by defendant, to plaintiff\u2019s damage in the sum of $116.40. The prayer was for $4,216.40.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-3\">Defendant\u2019s motion to strike out plaintiff\u2019s allegations relative to the $3,500 for loss of the business was granted. Defendant denied the other allegations, and alleged a counterclaim of $305.98 for merchandise sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">After the order was made striking out the $3,500 item, plaintiff filed an amendment to the complaint claiming $195.83 as commissions, and amended the prayer by omitting the $3,500 and including the $195.83. As amended the prayer was for $913.23.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Defendant appeals from the judgment in favor of plaintiff for $750.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The order having been made striking out the claim for $3,500, and the prayer having been amended to demand $913.23, the subject matter of the action was then not within the jurisdiction of the superior court. <em>(Jacobson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>[1936] 5 Cal. (2d) 170, 174 [53 P. (2d) 756].) Since a judgment rendered by a court without jurisdiction of the subject matter is void <em>(Hahn </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>[1868] 34 Cal. 391, 402 [94 Am. Dec. 742]; <em>Capital Bond etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Hood, </em>[1933] 218 Cal. 729, 731 [24 P. (2d) 765]), the judgment should be reversed even though the point is not raised by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">The judgment is reversed and the superior court is directed to transfer the action to a proper court having jurisdiction of the subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Schauer, P. J., and Shinn, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
