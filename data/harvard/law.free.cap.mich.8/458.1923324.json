The rule of the Board with respect to the duty and power of the superintendent and engineer was given in evidence, and proof made that the work was done and the materials furnish-ed Avithout the knotvledge or assent of the Board, and that they had never since ratified or confirmed the doings of Houghton in the premises, but had refused so to do. On the other hand, evidence was adduced on the part \u25a0of Hale, tending to prove, that at three different times prior to 1857 the materials of the Board had been used, and their laborers employed, in furnishing and laying down water pipes upon private property. It was shown that Houghton, since its creation, had control and superintendence of all work done by the Board or its employees, but there was no evidence to show by whom. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>these particular jobs had been directed or supervised, or whether or not they were done with the knowledge or assent of the Board, other than that it appeared that in each case payment for the work had been made to the secretary of the Board, and this appeared in the monthly reports made by him to the Board of said works. Evidence was also adduced tending to show, that these were the only instances in which the materials and labor had been used and employed upon private property, and that in each case the pipe required had been of unusual size for service pipe; that in other cases the operations of the Board had been confined to streets, lanes, and public squares, and other public property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-5\">The Circuit Judge charged the jury: that the Board had no power to make the contract mentioned in the testimony, and, therefore, could not authorize any agent to make it for them; and that if the plaintiff had made the contract as their agent, and in their name, he was entitled to maintain a suit upon the contract, and recover in his. own name. And he refused the request of defendant\u2019s counsel to charge that the materials mentioned in the account sued for, being conceded to be the property of said Board, if the \u2019plaintiff had no authority to sell them he could not recover their value in this suit, without proof that he had in some way acquired title thereto: that in this ease, his recovery would not bar the right of the Board to the property, or Hale\u2019s liability to them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b460-6\"><em>Wm. </em>Gray, for plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b460-7\">The Board had power to make the contract. And the proof was ample that they made it by a duly authorized agent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b460-8\">But if not, the materials still belong to the Board. Hale has acquired no title, and has nothing to pay for: \u2014 <em>Story on </em>Agency, \u00a7\u00a7 225, 226, 229.

In carrying out the duty of supplying water to the city of Detroit, it was not contemplated that the Board should enter into a general plumbing business; but a regard to the safety of their works requires that they should have some discretionary power, not only in supervising the connections made ,,-by others, but, when large quantities of water are likely to be used, in using means themselves to prevent waste and ensure security. And we see nothing in the charter to prevent [such work as that done in the case before us, if regarded in good faith, by the proper authorities, as a proper ease for the exercise of such discretion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>And, so far as third persons are concerned, the superintendent and engineer is made by the regulations the proper medium of negotiation. The duties imposed upon the Board require constant attention, and it could never have been, supposed that such a body, serving gratuitously, and appointed as business men and not as engineers, should devote their time daily to the details of such business. That work must fall upon agents, and the officer referred to is chosen to exercise a general supervision over the whole arrangements, subject,1 of course, to the control of the Board. And while, in the present case, he exceeded his instructions, and the Board had a right, which they exercised, to repudiate his acts, the effect of such repudiation could not injuriously affect third persons, or deprive them of rights obtained in good faith by dealing with an agent upon 'whose authority they had a right to rely. We do not think the Board can regard Mr. Hale as unlawfully in possession of the property in question, and the effect of their refusal to ratify Houghton\u2019s contract amounts, therefore, to an election to look to the latter for payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">This being the case, Houghton became by this refusal fully empowered to sue in his own name for the labor aijd materials furnished. And although the charge, so far as concerned the authority of the Board, was erroneous, yet the error was not material, and ought not to cause a reversal of the judgment.'</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The judgment must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b462-7\">^The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
