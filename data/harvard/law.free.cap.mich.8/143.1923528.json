W. Backus was the owner of the horse in question; that on that day he executed a chattel mortgage \u2014 but without any change of possession of the property \u2014 conveying this and other property to S. P. Brady. The mortgage was duly filed in the clerk\u2019s office of the city of Detroit, and was in force and unpaid on the 11th of August, 1858. Prior to that time, and after May, 1858, Backus removed a part of his property, and this horse included, to the town of Anderdon, Canada, with the intention of residing, and resided there without his family until December, 1858, when his family joined him, and he became a permanent resident. On the 11th of August he executed a mortgage, also without change of possession, to the plaintiff, to secure a <em>Iona fide </em>indebtedness. By this mortgage several horses are conveyed; they are therein described as follows: \u201cOne brown mare, one sorrel horse, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>one bay horse, one brown colt;\u201d and after describing household goods and other property, the description concludes with these words: \u201cand all other goods and chattels and personal property now being at the residence of said Backus, in Onslow Cottage, in the township of Anderdqn.\u201d This mortgage was executed, verified and filed, in accordance with the statutes of Canada relating .to chattel mortgages, which statutes being the laws of Canada for 185'I, are by consent considered a part hereof, and were in evidence, and are sent herewith.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-5\">\u201cIt was in proof on the trial, subject to objection, that on the 11th of August, 1858, Backus had no other chestnut or sorrel horse; that the horse replevied was then\u2014 at the time of the mortgage to plaintiff \u2014 a sorrel, but had changed in color, and become at the time of the replevin a chestnut. And- that the horse was then, <em>i. e. </em>when mortgaged to plaintiff, at the place of Backus, and that Backus had not there, or at any place in Canada, any other sorrel or chestnut horse.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-6\">\u201cIt was also in evidence that on the 20th day of March, 1859, the mortgage so given to Brady had become void for want of a renewal thereof, as provided for by the statutes of this state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-7\">\u201cIt was in proof that Backus brought the horse to Detroit, on the 2d day of May, 1859, for the purpose of having him trained, where he remained until replevied; that the defendants, having a judgment against Backus, issued execution thereon, and [levied upon this horse on the 16th day of June, 1859 ; they became the purchasers at the execution sale, and held the horse by virtue thereof at the date of the writ of replevin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-8\">\u201cUpon these facts the following questions arise and are reserved for the opinion of the Supreme Court thereon:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-9\">\u201c 1.

If the mortgage given to Montgomery did not protect the property from levy and sale under the defendant\u2019s execution, would said levy and sale take' priority of said mortgage ?\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b145-9\"><em>W. Gray, </em>for plaintiff:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-10\">The description in the mortgage is sufficient. The statute <em>(Stat. Ganada, </em>1857, <em>p. </em>7), is not to be construed as requiring the most perfect possible description, for that would defeat all mortgages. The statute only requires good faith, and is merely directory in this particular: \u2014 , <em>Rose v. Scott, </em>17 <em>Q. B. (Ganada) </em>385. ' And it is proper to aid the writing by parol proof which does not contradict it. The testimony given was also admissible for the purpose of identity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-11\">If the mortgage was valid in Canada, the lien did not cease when the property was brought here. The true doctrine is this: If a contract made in one country is against the law or policy of another, it will not be enforced in the latter; but if valid where made, and might be made in the latter, it will be enforced: \u2014 <em>Story Confl. </em>L. \u00a7\u00a7 326, 327. See 3 <em>Mich. </em>123. A mortgage made in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>New Hampshire was held invalid against the property in Vermont, when found there in possession of the mortgagor (23 <em>Vt. </em>284), because a mortgage without change of possession could not be made in Vermont. The mortgage was therefore against the law and policy of that state: 11 <em>N. H. </em>64; 10 <em>N. H. </em>46.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b146-5\"><em>Wells &amp; </em>Sunt, and <em>S. D. </em>Terry, for defendants:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-6\">The description in the mortgage was <em>insufficient: </em>\u2014 Rose <em>v. Scott, </em>supra; <em>Lawrence v. </em>Evarts, 7 <em>O. S. R. </em>194.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-7\">But if the mortgage was good in Canada, the lien ceased on the property being brought here. Though our courts are bound to recognize the existence of the liens under the foreign statute, they are not to give them a priority over other liens acquired under our orvn <em>statutes: </em>\u2014 Story <em>Confl. L. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 323, 324, <em>325d, 325k, </em>326, 327, 388, 389; 15 <em>Pick. </em>11; 13 <em>Mass. </em>146; 5 <em>N. H. </em>213; 9 <em>Vt. </em>358; 11 <em>N. H. </em>55; 23 <em>Vt. </em>279. At the common law, and independant of the Canadian statute, the Montgomery mortgage would be absolutely void, for it could not be filed here. ' Can the Canadian statute change the rule here? Does the comity of nations require that it should have such an effect? And that the courts of this state should hold that it defeats the liens acquired by our own citizens upon the property of a debtor found here? We think not.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b146-8\">Campbell J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">The questions arising in this case, all go to the inquiry whether the mortgage, made by Backus to Montgomery, takes precedence of the execution sale against Backus, Whereby the property was sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">The mortgage from Backus to Montgomery was made in Canada, and, in order to be valid at all, must be sustained under the laws of Canada. It is claimed by the defendants that, under those laws, the description of the horse in controversy is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>By the Canadian statute of 20 <em>Vic. C. </em>3, \u00a7 4, it is declared that a mortgage of chattels, \u201cshall contain such efficient and full description thereof, that the same may be thereby readily and easily known and distinguished.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The description in the mortgage before us is \u201c one sorrel horse.\u201d In the case of <em>Rose v. </em>Scott, <em>17 Q. B. </em>385, the court of Queen\u2019s Bench of Upper Canada had occasion to apply the provision of the statute above quoted, to a chattel mortgage containing the following description, viz: \u201c seven horses, three lumber wagons, one carriage, one pleasure sleigh, all the household furniture in possession of the said party of the first part, and being in his dwelling house; all the lumber and logs in and about the saw mill and premises of the said grantor, and all the blacksmith\u2019s tools now in possession of the said party of the first part; six cows and four stoves.\u201d The court held that nothing but the furniture, lumber and logs, could pass, as none of the other articles were described in such a way as to enable a person to ascertain their identity by inspection or inquiry, and distinguish them from other similar articles. We do not perceive in the description before .us any way of distinguishing this sorrel horse from any other sorrel horse in the province, and are very well convinced that the instrument would be so construed by the Canadian courts, upon the authority cited. The object of the statute is to prevent purchasers and creditors from being deceived by ambiguous descriptions, the allowance of which would encourage fraud, and render it easy to substitute one chattel for another. As this horse had a name, that would have furnished a ready description. And any hint: which would have directed the attention of those reading the mortgage to any source of information beyond the word of the parties to it, would at least have been much more satisfactory. The provision in the statute was, as is remarked in <em>Rose v. </em>Scott, \u201cto enable third parties to ascertain what was intended to be assigned.\u201d The statute is certainly a wise one, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>and should be so construed as to make it effectual. As between the parties, the same difficulties are not likely to arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">A more serious question, however, is whether the mortgage, if sufficiently certain, could yet avail against the levy. The defendants claim that it must yield to their execution title. The plaintiff, however, insists that we are bound by comity to protect his rights; and that his mortgage is valid here, to all intents and purposes, if valid in Canada.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">We certainly should be very reluctant to deny to any party any right legally assured to him under the laws of our neighboring province, even if our common origin and friendly associations did not make the duty of extending the principles of comity a cheerful one. And in holding, as we are compelled to in this case, we are glad that we find no incompatibility between our own laws and those of Canada. We regard them both as aiming to accomplish the same object in very much the same way. They are substantially alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The evil which both statutes found in existence, was the facility for fraud held out by allowing mortgagors of chattels to retain possession under any circumstances. By pernfitting the mortgagee to hold,' if he took his security in good faith, the law formerly subjected subsequent purchasers from the mortgagor to all the danger arising from his fraud, although he was enabled to perpetrate it by the permission to retain possession given him by the mortgagee. At the same time there were many cases where it was very necessary to the mortgagor to be enabled to keep possession. In order to provide for such emergencies, and at the same time protect creditors and purchasers from fraud, our statutes declare that a chattel mortgage shall be void as against them, without an actual and continued change of possession, unless the mortgage is recorded by filing a copy, with us in the city or town, and in Canada, in the proper county office. And here, as there, an affidavit of renewal must be made yearly.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>This provision for filing or registry is not intended by any means to encourage or legalize the practice of making mortgages without possession. The statute now as before, regards change of possession as the rule, and allows filing to dispense with its necessity, because filing is public notice. But we can not suppose that either statute was designed, or can be properly construed, to dispense in any case with filing and change of possession also. If a chattel mortgage of property here is made by a non - resident, our law contains no provision for filing it. In such a case a change of possession is therefore essential, and can not be dispensed with against creditors or purchasers. The Canadian law contains a provision for filing in the county where the property is, if the mortgagor is a non-resident, and also contemplates a new filing, if the property is removed from county to county. These provisions are ample, where the property continues within the jurisdiction. But neither law undertakes to provide for any notice to be effectual if the property is elsewhere, and in such contingency, the prohibition of retaining possession must be absolute, so far .as it can apply at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">We must assume that these laws were passed in view of the well settled principle, that a law can have no binding force beyond the jurisdiction of the sovereignty enacting it. A resident of Canada, while dealing in Canada, for a chattel, can not be sirpposed to know the law of Michigan, or to be obliged to take notice of the records in a Michigan office. A statute of Michigan requiring him to do so would be of no validity beyond our own borders. And it would be equally unreasonable to require a citizen of Michigan, at home, to take notice of files and entries in Canada. These notices can have no extra territorial force. Proceeding upon the principle that the laws must have a sensible construction, we feel constrained to hold that the rules of these laws which require a change of possession, dispense with it only where an effectual notice may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>given. If mortgagees desire to be protected where no notice can be made effectual, they must take possession, and not allow the mortgagor to take the property where third parties have no means of ascertaining its title.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">In the view we have taken of these laws, no conflict arises, and we regard our ruling as sustaining the policy of both countries.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">It must be certified, that the mortgage of plaintiff is invalid as against the levy and sale under the defendant\u2019s execution, and that the latter must be allowed priority. The other questions become immaterial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b150-7\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
