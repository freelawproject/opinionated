For this compromise note and collateral security, Waldo, Barry <em>&amp; </em>Co. gave a receipt, in which they agreed that if the compromise note was paid at maturity, the four original notes and the security were to be given up, but otherwise to remain in full force.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-5\">Previous to this time, on January 16th, 1858, complainant made a bargain with defendants for a mortgage they held upon the furniture of the Russell House, Detroit, given by W. H. Russell, to secure $16,000; and they gave complainant a writing in which they promised that on his paying $9,000 in four equal semi-annual instalments, they would assign him this mortgage. Complainant paid the first of these instalments, but did not pay the second when it came .due, nor his n\u00f3te of $2,500, so turned out to Waldo, Barry <em>&amp; </em>Co.; nor did defendants pay their compromise note when it matured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-6\">On December 21st, or 22d, 1858, one of the members of Holmes <em>&amp; </em>Co. called upon Waldo, Barry <em>&amp; </em>Co., and stated to them that, in consequence of complainant failing to make his payments, the former were not able to meet their compromise note, and asked W. B. <em>&amp; </em>Co., to wait upon them for thirty days longer. Holmes <em>&amp; </em>Co., claimed that this request was assented to, but this was denied by W.

This was assented to by W., B. &amp; Co., and on complainant paying $8,000 therefor, the four original notes, together with the compromise note and the collaterals, were transferred to complainant by an instrument in writing, \u201csubject to all the rights and equities in favor of Holmes <em>&amp; </em>Co., in the hands of said Hale and his assigns as they\u201d were \u201cor would be in\u201d the hands of Waldo, Barry <em>&amp; </em>Co., if they \u201chad retained them instead of selling them to said Hale.\u201d In this writing was set out a copy of the compromise agreement with Holmes &amp; Co. Waldo, on being- subsequently inquired of by Holmes &amp; Co. why this was done, replied that \u201cHale had told them he could keep Holmes <em>&amp; </em>Co. out of their money for two years, and he would not be bothered any further with it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-4\">January 24th, 1859, Hale called on Holmes <em>&amp; </em>Co., and offered to pay the amount due towards the purchase of the Russell chattel mortgage, by applying the same o.n the said four original notes of Holmes &amp; Co., which the latter refused. He then filed his bill in chancery, alleging the insolvency of Holmes &amp; Co., and praying that they be decreed to apply on said \u25a0 purchase the amount of said four notes, or so much as would be necessary to satisfy the instalments past due on said purchase; and that they be enjoined from proceeding to collect such chattel mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-5\">The Circuit Court made decree substantially as prayed by complainant, applying on said four notes complainant\u2019s note of $2,500, and the amount past due on said contract for the purchase of the chattel mortgage.

J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">In January, 1858, the defendants held a mortgage of Wm, H. Russel], upon certain personal property in the Russell House, in Detroit, to secure the payment of $16,-000. This mortgage they agreed to assign to Hale upon his payment to them of $9,000, in four equal installments, at six, twelve, eighteen and twenty-four months; but took no contract from Hale to make such payment. Their obligation to assign the Russell mortgage was dependant upon the prompt payment by Hale of the several installments above mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Hale paid the first installment, but made default upon the second, as the defendants claim; and they are about to take possession of the property and foreclose the mortgage for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Hale files this bill to restrain such foreclosure, and for specific relief; claiming that he holds liabilities of the defendants to a much larger amount than is due them, which, or so much as is necessary, he is entitled in equity to have allowed as payment towards the purchase of the Russell mortgage, and to prevent the threatened forfeiture of his right to purchase it. This claim of right is based upon the alleged insolvency of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">Whether we regard the bill as one filed to relieve against a forfeiture of the agreement, or to secure an equitable set off (and both grounds were taken uj&gt;on the argument), it. can not be sustained. In a variety of cases, as where one is prevented by unavoidable accident, or by the wrongful act of the other party, from making payment, or when the principal amount of the contract price has been paid, and the like, it is true that a court of equity will interfere to relieve against a forfeiture; but never where such relief can only be afforded by compelling a party to receive his own obligations, when the agreement contains no mutual promises, and where such interference would be to vary the terms of the contract forfeited.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Nor is this a case in which equity will interfere to compel a set off. No set off can exist at law, because no contract upon the part of Hale exists against which to allow it. There is nothing but the offer of Holmes <em>&amp; </em>Co. to convey, upon the payment of \u00a79,000 in certain fixed installments, the debt and mortgage of Russell for $16,-000. The option remained with Halo to purchase it or not, but if he would, he must do so according to the terms of such offer. There is no mutual credit, and insolvency alone is insufficient, even' in a case of positive indebtedness, to authorize an equitable off set. This we expressly held in <em>Lockwood v. Beckwith, </em>6 <em>Mich. </em>167.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">But the cose itself, as developed by the pleadings and proof, is not one entitling the complainant to any relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Whether the agreement by Waldo, Barry <em>&amp; </em>Co., with the defendants, for the compromise of the latter\u2019s indebtedness, might have been forfeited by the former or not, is wholly immaterial under the facts now existing, and it is also immaterial whether they agreed or not to extend the time for payment of the compromise note. When the latter note was given, the defendants placed in the hands of Waldo, Barry <em>&amp; </em>Co. the promissory note of this complainant for $2,500, together with a mortgage held as collateral security for its payment, to be held by Waldo, Barry &amp; Co. as collateral security for the payment of such compromise note. This note of the complainants was past due when the compromise note became due. When the second installment under the defendants\u2019 agreement with the complainant was about falling due, and upon which the defendants relied (and this Waldo, Barry &amp; Co. evidently knew) to take up their compromise note, we find Hale in New York negociating for the purchase of the defendants\u2019 paper in Waldo, Barry <em>&amp; </em>Co.\u2019s hands, and obtaining it under what savors very strongly of a threat. He knew that they, as well as the defendants, relied upon his payment of- this installment to take up the compromise note; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>and the extraordinary benefits offered to huh in the agreement of the defendants, might well induce them to rely confidently upon it. When therefore he told Waldo, Barry &amp; Co. that \u201che -could keep defendants out of the money two years,\u201d they undoubtedly became satisfied that the most they could hope for was the amount of the compromise note, secured by Iiale\u2019s obligation. They therefore sold to Hale such note, for the sum of $3,000, and transferred to him the four notes which were to be satisfied by its payment, and the securities, viz. Hale\u2019s note and the mortgage held as collateral to it. This was the real transaction as understood by the parties, if we are to believe Waldo, and so the written assignment executed by them must be interpreted. Hale, then, never purchased the notes covered by the compromise note, so as to acquire the right to demand payment of them; as by selling the compromise note and surrendering to him the security dejiosited to ensure its payment only, and not that of the four notes, they confirmed the compromise. The effect of the transaction therefore is simply this: By taking up his own note and security, he cancelled them; and what he claims to be a purchase of the compromise note, is in reality a payment of his note which secured it. If he has any claim upon the defendants, it is only for the difference between the amount due upon his note, and the amount of the compromise note: but with this question we have no concern. He never acquired any claim against the defendants by procuring the four notes transferred with the compromise note, which he can enforce either at law or in equity. They were paid by the payment of his note in the manner indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The decree of the court below must be reversed, and the bill dismissed, with costs of this ^ court and of the court below.</p>\n<judges id=\"b43-6\">Manning, and Campbell JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b43-7\">Christianct, J., was absent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
