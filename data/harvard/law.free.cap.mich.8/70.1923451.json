E. </em>Terry, for petitioner,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ab\">now moved for his discharge. They contended that the Recorder\u2019s <em>Court </em>could not issue a writ of Habeas Corpus, though the <em>Recorder </em>might. And further, that the court having once passed sentence, had no power for any cause to bring the defendant before it for sentence anew. Under the statute, the fact of defendant\u2019s age is one to be determined judicially before sentence; and having been passed Jup\u00f3n, is now <em>res </em>judicata, and can not be reviewed: \u2014 1 <em>Park. Cr. R. </em>374; 8 <em>Eng. </em>100. The original sentence was therefore valid, but under it, by the express provisions of the statute, petitioner could not be detained in the House of Correction after he arrived at the age of twenty-one. He has now arrived at that age, as appears by his petition, which, not being denied by the return, is to be taken as true.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b72-9\"><em>J. M. Eoward, Attorney </em>General, contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5\">admitted that the Recorder\u2019s Court had no power to bring the prisoner before it to review or change its sentence, but he contended that the judgment and sentence were conclusive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>on the question of petitioner\u2019s age, and he must therefore be remanded to the Reform School, to undergo the sentence.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b73-5\">Campbell J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">A <em>habeas corpus </em>having been issued to the sheriff of Wayne county, to inquire into the cause of detention of the relator, it appears that in August, 1859, he was sentenced to the State Reform School, as under sixteen years of age, and that the Recorder of Detroit, who sentenced him, has recently issued a precept or writ, of a somewhat anomalous character, whereby he has been brought back from that\"\u2019 institution, and is now in the hands of the sheriff of Wayne county.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The relator now claims, that his imprisonment in the Wayne county jail is illegal, and that he was in fact more than sixteen years old when sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">The first question that arises is, whether the action of the Recorder, in sentencing the relator, was legal. The law requires the court to ascertain, by testimony, the age of the person committed, as near as may be, and certify it to the keeper of the Reform School, with the sentence. Having certified the supposed age of the relator, .with his sentence, the Recorder must be presumed conclusively, so far as all collateral inquiries are concerned, to have done his duty. We have no right to assume, or even to inquire, in this proceeding, whether he allowed the statements of the accused, or any other than legal evidence, to guide him. This is not the proper manner in which to review such finding, if it be subject to review. He has no right now to give a new sentence; and the old one is undoubtedly a legal and valid commitment. If he made a mistake in the prisoner\u2019s age, it does not vitiate the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">Without inquiring into the authority of the Recorder to issue a <em>habeas corpus </em>in any case, to be served out of the city or county, the writ which he actually issued is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>void. lie could not take a prisoner 'out of the Reform School, who has been lawfully sentenced there, unless to testify as a witness. <em>The </em>sheriff of Wayne <em>comity </em>can not lawfully hold Mm in obedience to such a writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">The question next arises, whether the relator is entitled to a discharge altogether. He claims that his allegations in the petition for a writ of <em>habeas </em>corpus, not being controverted, must be taken as true; and that, if true, they show his sentence to have expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">This is not so. The object of' a writ is to require the person who answers it to show' upon what authority he detains the prisoner. The return shows, not indeed any authority in the sheriff of Wayne county to. hold him, but an authority in the keeper of the Reform School to hold him, under a legal commitment from which he has not been lawfully discharged. The prisoner may, under section 5239, deny the truth of the return, or establish his right <em>to </em>a discharge by facts; but until he does so, the return showing sufficient cause, and being admitted to be true, will prevail. He has not shewn that Ms term of imprisonment has expired. He has not even alleged it.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">As he has been legally committed for a criminal offense, it is our duty to remand him to the proper custody, wMch is that of the keeper of the State School of Reform, at Lansing, to be held under Ms original sentence, which is set forth in the return: \u2014 2 <em>Comp. </em>L. \u00a7\u00a7 5234, 5235.</p>\n<judges id=\"b74-7\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
