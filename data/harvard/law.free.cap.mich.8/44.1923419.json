Carr claimed the goods by virtue of a general assignment made to Mm by Pool for the benefit of creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-10\">On the trial, after plaintiff had rested Ms case, defendant called Eugene Pringle as a witness, who testified that at the time of the assignment he had in Ms hands demands against Pool, and on the next Monday after the date of the assignment he called on Pool, at the store where the goods were, and Pool there made a statement to Mm relative to the schedule to the assignment. Defendant\u2019s counsel then asked the witness what this statement was. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected to the question, and the court sustained the objection. The witness further stated that he asked Pool to let Mm see the schedule of property, and that he after-wards asked Mm if the schedule was made out. Defendant\u2019s counsel then asked the witness what Pool said in answer to this inquiry. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected to the question, and the court sustained the objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-11\">The witness further testified that Carr afterwards told Mm the schedule was not yet made out, but that three or four weeks later he informed him it was then completed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-12\">From Pool\u2019s testimony, who had been previously called as a witness for plaintiff, it appeared that the schedule was made out on the next Tuesday after the date of the assign<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>ment. At the time of the interview with Pringle, he was acting as clerk for Carr in selling the goods. The assignment was delivered to Carr on the day of its date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-5\">There was evidence in the case that a short time before the assignment, Pool had bought out one who had been a partner' with him in business; and defendant\u2019s counsel asked the eom't to charge the jury that if they should find, from the testimony, that Pool, in contemplation of making an assignment, purchased his partner\u2019s interest and dissolved the partnership, then such purchase and dissolution were conclusive evidence of fraud in law, and would render the assignment fraudulent in law. The court refused so to .charge, but did charge that the purchase by Pool of his partner\u2019s interest, if made in contemplation of assignment, was a matter for their consideration from which to determine whether there was or was not actual fraud in making the assignment. The court further charged that the annexing of a schedule of the property assigned was not absolutely essential to the validity of the deed, and that in the absence of fraud the deed would convey the property without a schedule; but that it was proper for the jury to consider the time, manner and other circumstances of making and attaching the schedule, for the purpose of determining whether the assignment was made with fraudulent intent or not. The jury rendered a verdict for plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-6\">The errors assigned in this court were, 1st and 2d, that the court erred in sustaining the objections to the questions asked Pringle; and 3d and 4th, that the court erred in its charge to the jury as above given.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b45-7\"><em>Johnson &amp; Highy, </em>for plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-8\">Pool, at the time of the interview with Pringle, was in possession of the property, either as agent of the assignee or in the duty of completing the assignment by making out the schedule of the property.

The statement of Pool, called for, was not. admissible as part of the <em>res gestes. </em>He was not in possession, but acting as a mere clerk. The offer of testimony Was an attempt to destroy a contract by a conversation between others, and not to show possession, or the character of that possession. The declarations of a jierson in possession of property, and not a party to the suit, are only admitted on the principle that they are cotemporaneous with and explanatory of some act which is admissible, and therefore part of the <em>res gestes. </em>\u2014 2 <em>Mich. </em>390 ; 1 Gray, 551; 14 <em>N.

J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">We think the Circuit Judge erred in sustaining the objections made to the questions propounded to Pringle, as to the statements of Pool to Mm, touching the schedule. Although the assignment may then have been so far completed as to render it a valid conveyance of Pool\u2019s property, m the absence of fraud, (which is a question not submitted to us) yet these statements, whatever they were, appear to have been made before the schedule was made out and attached, and while Pool was making it. He still had the ostensible custody of the property, but whether under Carr\u2019s employment, or in his own right, was a question to be determined on the trial. The transaction was claimed to be fraudulent, and the defendant below was attempting to prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>it to be such. Pringle represented some of the creditors of Pool, and interrogated liim respecting the schedule. Situated as Pool was in relation to the assignment, the property and the assignee, and the object of the inquiry being to ascertain the real nature of the transaction, his answers were competent evidence, and should have been admitted. They would not be the statements of an indifferent party, nor would the evidence be hearsay; but the statements of an actor pending the transaction, made before its full completion. In cases where fraud is the subject of investigation, the statements of the parties charged with it are, and must of necessity be, permissible in evidence if made before the instrument charged to be fraudulent is completed, or while it is being made. Othenvise in the great majority of cases fraud as a fact could never be shown. It would not only be an unsafe but an unjust rule, which should confine a party attaching an instrument upon such ground, to the testimony of the party charged with the fraud. It is claimed that these statements, so long as the assignment had been made, were not a part of the <em>res gestee, </em>and consequently the evidence of Pringle would be hearsay \u2014 Pool being the only competent witness, by whom to prove the facts squght to be established. As an actor, his statements may be-proven by any one who heard them, as well as by himself, even although his statements were not strictly <em>res gestae, </em>not being facts in the transaction, nor made by him while in the act of making the schedule, although made during the period which elapsed between its commencement and completion. Much difficulty exists at times in determining Avhat declarations are <em>res gestee, </em>but there is none in holding that the declarations of a party in interest, although at the time he is taking measures to divest himself of his interest, or that those of an actor, before -the transaction is completed, are admissible evidence, on the ground of such interest, or relation to the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">For this error, we think the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>The third and fourth assignments of error are determined by the cases of <em>Oliver v.
