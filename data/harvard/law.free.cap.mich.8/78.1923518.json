On motion being made for a new trial, based upon certain exceptions taken to the rulings of the court, the Recorder reserved the questions arising on such motion for the opinion of this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b79-4\"><em>A. </em>Bussell, for the prosecution,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0p\">now moved to dismiss the case, on the ground that the Recorder\u2019s Court has no power to reserve for the opinion of this court, questions in cases arising under city ordinances. The Recorder\u2019s Court is to be kept within its jurisdiction in such cases by certiorari, as Avas the old Mayor\u2019s court, from which in respect to the trial of city cases the Recorder\u2019s Court in no wise differs: \u2014 -2 <em>Doug.

Police </em>Justice, 7 <em>Mich. </em>Abuse of authority can be reached by trespass, as in 2 <em>Doug. Mich. </em>332; or by <em>injunc</em>tion, as in <em>Har.

It has also exclusive jurisdiction of all offenses against the ordinances of the city. All prosecutions are to be in the name of the People, and all trials the same as on indictment. Trials for offenses against city ordinances being thus assimilated to trials for offenses against the state laAvs, both in that court and in the Circuit Courts, an intent is apparent to remove all substantial difference betAveen them, if in fact any difference ever existed. In fact no substantial difference exists, except in degree, between the various violations of penal laws.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-7\">The defendant is entitled to have the proceedings, at any time before or after judgment, removed to the Supreme Court, by Avrit. of error or other process in the same manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>that like proceedings may be from the Circuit Courts: \u2014\u2022 D185 V, <em>p. </em>113, \u00a724.. Removing <em>in the same manner </em>must include all authorized modes of removal from Circuit Courts, and <em>lihe </em>proceedings, must refer to all criminal prosecutions in the Circuits. The words \u201cother process\u201d in the charter, are synonymous with the words \u201c other modes\u201d or \u201cother means.\u201d \u2014 3 <em>Black. Com. </em>379 ; 2 <em>Bouv. L.

Under the definition given by Blackstone, any mode of commencing a suit, and any mode of transferring a case from one court to another, is <em>process. </em>In the Roman law, the word <em>process </em>had the same signification as the terra <em>action at law.

It is only then, when he acts in this latter capacity, that he can reserve questions \u2014 the statute only conferring that power upon Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">The charter, in prescribing the manner in which trials shall be conducted in his court, merely regulated the practice therein. It conferred no power independent of this. Although causes may be removed into this court from the Recorder\u2019s Court, as they may be from the Circuit Court, yet the reservation of questions for our opinion is in no sense a removal of the cause. It remains below. We can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>render no judgment, nor can vre make any order in it. Our powers are merely advisory.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The case must be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
