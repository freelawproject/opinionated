Plaintiff in error, who held a mortgage given by Merchant, was made a party respondent to said petition, and proceedings having been had before the Commissioner in conformity with the section mentioned, the Commissioner rendered judgment that the prayer of the petition be granted, and the tax deeds annulled.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b430-11\"><em>T. M. </em>Cooley, for plaintiff in error: .</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-12\">The Legislature can not, under the Constitution, confer upon Circuit Court Commissioners the power which this act attempts to give.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-13\">That the power is judicial is too clear to need argument, or the citation of authorities. The decision of- the Commissioner is called a <em>judgment </em>by the act (\u00a7101): it determines the title : it is a substitute for the action of ejectment (\u00a790): it is final unless appealed from: the commissioner does not report to the Circuit or any other court: and the Circuit Court gets no jurisdiction of the proceedings except by <em>a/ppeal. </em>The power is not only a judicial power, but a judicial power of the highest importance, determining finally controversies with respect to property, to any amount or value.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-14\">It is a power not exercised with respect to any suit <em>in court.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-15\">It is not possessed by Circuit Judges_jat chambers, and does not relate to chamber duties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>It was not possessed by commissioners at the adoption of the Constitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-5\">The act therefore does not come within any of the decisions of this court with reference to the power of commissioners, and there can really be no question of its invalidity.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b431-6\">There was no appearance for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"ATh\">Martin Cii. J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">By \u00a7101 of act No. 32 of the session of 1858, <em>(S. JO. pp. </em>186, 189) the Legislature attempted to confer upon Circuit Court Commissioners judicial powers equal to the combined powers of courts of law and of equity. By \u00a716 of Art. 6 of the Constitution, the Legislature could only invest these officers with powers not exceeding those of a Circuit Judge at chambers; and this attempt to clothe them with these superior powers, is in. direct conflict with this constitutional provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">The judgment of the Circuit Court Commissioner is reversed, with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b431-9\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
