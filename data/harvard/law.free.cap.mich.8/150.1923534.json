The guilt of the accused must depend upon the circumstances as they appear to him, and he will not be held responsible for a knowledge of the facts, unless his ignorance arises from fault or negligence.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b150-10\">Homicide <em>86 defmdmdo, </em>in resisting an assault not made with felonious intent, is excusable where the danger to be resisted is to life, or of serious bodily harm, of a permanent character, and unavoidable by other means in the power of the slayer so far as he is able to judge at the time.

It was inhabited by a considerable population, who were here engaged in tbe business of fishing. Their bouses and other buildings stood in a line near to and following tbe shore of tbe lake. Amongst these were tbe bouse and \u2022 premises of tbe prisoner, where be was carrying on tbe business of fishing, and was living with bis wife and three young children, one of whom was a young infant, and tbe eldest a daughter 12 years old, together with two hired men, named Daniel Whitney and Dennis Cull. It was a long building about 16 feet square, contained but one room, and bad a bark-roof, and only one window, and but\" one door, made of boards, which was fastened to tbe building with leather binges, and opened outward; and upon tbe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>inside was fastened and kept closed by means \u2022 of a rope attached to it and a pin near the side of the door, around which the rope was drawn and made fast.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-5\">Thirty-six feet distant from the prisoner\u2019s house, was another building-of the prisoner, called a net-house. This was constructed with six posts set in the ground, having plates upon their top, and the whole was enclosed with boards an inch or an inch and a quarter thick, nailed on the sides to the posts, and on the roof nailed to the plates, and to a ridge-pole. The joints of the roof were also covered with bark, and the bark held in its place by poles extending from one end to the other. It had a board floor, and but one door, Avkich opened directly opposite to tke door of tke prisoner\u2019s kouse. Tkis door was made of boards, was fastened to tke building witk leather hinges, and upon tke inside was closed and fastened <em>by </em>tke same means and arrangement as tke door of tke prisoner\u2019s kouse above described. It also kad a latch. Tke net-house was about sixteen feet long and fourteen feet wide; contained but one room, kad a bertk constructed about two and a half feet high, for tke purposes of a bedstead, in tke end of tke building opposite that containing tke door, Avkich bertk was large enough to accommodate two persons comfortably, and on wkick tke prisoner\u2019s two hired men, Whitney and Cull, kad slept regularly, up to tke time of tke homicide, during tkeir employment with tke prisoner, tke former kaving been -in kis service two weeks, and tke latter one week immediately preceding. They took tkeir regular meals witk tke prisoner\u2019s family in kis kouse, and lived, as members of kis family. Two of tke three persons engaged in tke transactions leading to and immediately connected Avitk tke komicide, David Plant and Isaac Blanckard, Jr., tke deceased, resided also at Se\u00fal Choix Point, near its foot, at a place called tke Harbor, Plant about a mile, and Blanckard about three - fourths of a mile from tke prisoner\u2019s kouse. Tke other, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Joseinli Robilliard, resided near the end of the point, and not far from the prisoner\u2019s premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-5\">On Thursday, at about noon, of the same week when the homicide occurred, Plant in the presence of said Blanchard, at the house of one Downey, situate on the point, threatened in conversation with Mrs. Downey, that, he must whip the prisoner or there would be a fracas. This threat was heard by the young daughter of the prisoner, who happened to be passing near at the time, and who immediately went home and communicated the threat to her mother, who thereupon immediately awakened the prisoner, he being-then asleep on a bed, and communicated the threat to him in these words; \u201cMy little g-irl says in passing Mr. Downey\u2019s, she heard Plant say he was going- to whip you.\u201d This was about 1 o\u2019clock r. ar. On the evening of the same day, at about 8 o\u2019clock, an assembling of from fifteen to twenty persons occurred on the j&gt;oint, a few rods from the prisoner\u2019s house, and between the houses of Joseph Martell and a Mr. Durocher, which were about one hundred feet apart. The 'larger part of these persons resided at the harbor, and between the harbor and the point. They had, as Mary Pond, a witness for the prisoner, testified, been hunting for the prisoner, and had overtaken Mm near Durocher\u2019s house. Jerry Williams, a witness for the People, testified that he was one of the company; that he had been on board a vessel in the bay, and was returning towards the harbor; that he came there with a party of persons, and there met another party, and he could not say how many persons were present, nor how long they remained there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-6\">In the company were Plant, Robilliard and the deceased. The prisoner was got into the company by Plant, who had called him out of Joseph Martell\u2019s house. They were sitting all around the prisoner, engaged in conversation. They surrounded him. Their proceedings thus far were observed by the prisoner\u2019s daughter, who was secreted behind Du<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>rocher\u2019s house, in order to look at them and see what they would do to her father, and she then left, and went home and reported them to her mother. Whilst the company was so assembled, Plant told the prisoner that he did not use his neighbors right; that he ought not to pitch on to men not of his size and abuse them; that if the prisoner wanted to fight anybody, he had better take a man of his size. There was no evidence of any provocation on the part of Pond by words or acts. Plant then struck the prisoner in his face with his fist \u2014 the prisoner\u2019s hat at the same time falling off \u2014 and then kicked him in his breast. The prisoner did nothing more than pick up his hat and put it on again. Then they drank whisky together, furnished by Blanchard. In a short time the prisoner, as Mary Pond expressed it, \u201cgot clear of the company.\u201d At first, as stated by other witnesses, he walked off, and then was seen running away alone into the woods. About 9 or 10 o\u2019clock on the same evening, Plant, Robilliard and Blanchard, came to the door of the prisoner\u2019s net-house. The prisoner\u2019s two hired men, Whitney and Cull, were then asleep therein, and when they went to bed that evening, the door was fastened to the building upon its hinges, and it was closed and fastened as usual on the inside by means of the rope above described, which was made fast around a pin or nail near the side of the door.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-4\">Whitney was awakened by the walking of Plant on the floor, and he then saw the door lying outside on the ground, torn from its hinges, and the pin or nail that had held the rope was also broken. Plant first went up to the bed, took hold of Whitney\u2019s arm and asked who he was. Whitney told him, and then Plant said \u201cyou are not the man.\u201d Plant then asked where the prisoner was. Whitney replied \u201cat Joseph Mart ell\u2019s.\u201d . Robilliard and Blanchard remained outside near the door of the net-house. This was after dark. Plant did not explain to Whitney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>what he wanted of the prisoner. They then went to the door of the prisoner\u2019s house; Plant opened it. They wanted the prisoner; Plant asked where he was; his wife replied \u201cI do not know; go and see on board the little vessel.\u201d Plant said, \u201cwe have been there, and he was not there; we must have him absolutely; we have got business with him.\u201d She replied, \u201c What business have you ? it is just as well to say it to me as to him: what do you want to do with him? Say it to me and I will tell him.\u201d They said \u201cNo, we must have him to-night: we do not wish to toll you; we will tell him:\u201d and they then went away towards the point to hunt for him. When they came to the door there were about twenty persons behind the house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-5\">Just after this occurrence the prisoner came home, stayed from five to ten minutes, went away, and slept all night at the house of a near neighbor, Joseph Martell, Between ten and eleven o\u2019clock the same evening, Plant, Robilliard and the deceased, went to the house of Thomas Ward, after he had gone to bed, but for what purpose, Iras not shown.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-6\">On the next day, Friday, the prisoner was away from home most .of the day, and Whitney saw him but once or twice. He came to the house of Joseph Martell on that day, between ten and eleven o\u2019clock in the forenoon, to g-et his pistol, -saying- he wanted it for his hired man. He obtained it, carried it away, but it was not loaded and had no lock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-7\">On the same day, about noon, Plant and the deceased were in company near the house of Peter Closs; the prisoner was also present, and then the deceased was standing \u25a0about one hundred feet off. Plant was heard to make threats against the prisoner. Plant said to the prisoner, \u201cIt is a good while since you harre had a grudge against me; I must whip you to satisfy myself.\u201d Plant went near to the prisoner and told him not to say anything; if he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>did he would give him slaps, or kicks. Plant then took a stone in his hand, and said, \u201c Don\u2019t speak any more; I am a good Irishman, and will throw it at you.\u201d \u2022 Pond did not say the least thing in reply to the threats, nor do anything; but went off quietly home. Immediately afterwards Plant went to the dock of Peter Gloss, and there said, that he must whip Augustus Pond, or pass for the biggest loafer on the earth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-5\">On the same day, about two o\u2019clock in the afternoon, Plant and the prisoner Avere together at prisoner\u2019s premises, when the prisoner took Plant into the net-house, where they drank together once. They were there about ten minutes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-6\">On Friday night, Plant did not go to bed, Plant, Robilliard and the deceased, Avere aboard some vessels near the shore from nine till about eleven o\u2019clock in the evening, when they left the vessel. It was a bright moonlight night: the moon on this night was nearly full, and rose at ten o\u2019clock and eleven minutes in the evening. Whitney and Cull went to bed in the prisoner\u2019s net-house, at about eleven o\u2019clock in the evening. Before going to bed they set up the door in its usual place, and they soon went to sleep. None of the family in the prisoner\u2019s house went to bed this night, because they were afraid of Plant, Robilliard and the deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-7\">Between one and two o\u2019clock that night, Whitney was waked by boards being tom from the roof of the net-house, directly over his bed. Cull did not awake. Plant came inside and said, \u201c some one is tearing down the net-house; let us go out and give \u2019em hell.\u201d At this time the west side and a part of the roof of the net-house were tom down by Robilliard and the deceased, who Avere outside, whilst Plant was inside the building. The whole three, Plant, Robilliard and the deceased, then went to the door of the prisoner\u2019s house, and as to what there transpired at the door, the prisoner\u2019s daughter, Mary Pond, testified as folloAvs:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>\u201c Plant shook the door and said, \u201c Open the door ;\u201d mother answered \u201cNo, what will I open the door for?\u201d Plant said \u201cWe want the master of the house.\u201d Mother asked, \u201cWhy_ do you want to see him?\u201d Plant answered, \u201cWe have business with him.\u201d Mother said, \u201che is not \u25a0here, and it is just as well to say it to me as to him.\u201d Father then got off the bed and got under it. Plant shook the door again and said, \u201copen the door; we want to search the house.\u201d Mother replied, \u201cI told you he is not here.\u201d Plant then asked for some crackers. I went and got them, whilst mother stood by the door, fastening It. She took the crackers and tried to give them through a crevice between the logs near the door. Blanchard did not want to take them through the crevice; he wanted the door oj&gt;ened, but finally took them through the crevice. Plant then again said, \u201c Open the door.\u201d Mother refused. He then again said \u201copen the door or you will regret it.\u201d Mother replied, \u201cNo I will not open it.\u201d Father was then going, to come out from under the bed; mother said to Mm, \u201cfor God\u2019s sake do not come out, it will be your death-blow.\u201d Father came out but went under it again, Blanchard then asked for some sugar; I got it, gave it to mother, and she tried to give it to them through the crevice; they declined taking it through the crevice, and Plant said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t open the door you will regret it;\u201d \u201c open the door right away;\u201d -\u201c open the door; it is Dave Plant, who speaks with you to-night; when Dave Plant tells you to .open your door, you must open right away.\u201d She then slid the cord along, and opened the door from six to twelve inches, passed out the sugar ; they did not take it, but Plant took hold of her arm and squeezed it; mother told him to let go; he answered, \u201c no I will not, I want you to open the door.\u201d Mother fainted; she did not fall, but leaned on the door; they -soon took the sugar and put it in their whisky. They then left, going towards the house of Louis Robinson. He lives in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Same house with Thomas Ward. As they left they said, \u201cLet us go towards Robinson\u2019s and. see.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-5\">The prisoner then came out of his house, went to the house of Peter Closs, a near neighbor and brother-in-law, there obtained a double-barrelled shot gun, both barrels being already loaded with pigeon-shot. In about a quarter of an hour after he left his house, he returned with the gun, went into the net-house, looked around, and then went'into his own house in company with Whitney. Whitney staid in the house a few minutes, then came out, - did not go to bed again during the night, and went to^ wards Thomas Ward\u2019s, where he heard the parties making a noise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-6\">Plant, Robillard and the deceased, went to Robinson\u2019s house and asked for Thomas Ward. Ward and the family Were in bed. They <em>were </em>told by Mrs. Robinson that he was not within. They insisted that he was. They were then told by Mrs. Robinson that she had a sick child. They said they didn\u2019t care a damn, they would come in any way, and if they couldn\u2019t come through the door, they would come through the roof. Mrs. Robinson then told them that Ward was in their net-house. They went to, find him there, but not finding him, came back to the door, and said they would break the door open or come through the roof. Then Ward, who was in the house, spoke and told them to wait and he would go out. Ward got up, dressed himself, and went out. Plant asked Ward to go around with them; Ward refused. Plant asked Ward if he was afraid. Ward said he was afraid of going with them, they acted so mean. The deceased then put his hand on Ward\u2019s shoulder and told him not to be afraid, \u00e1s they were not going to hurt him. The deceased then asked for something to eat. Ward went into the house to get something to eat, and whilst he was in for that purpose, the deceased stood by the door and told Ward not to be afraid, he wouldn\u2019t let any one in. Ward, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>came out with some bread and butter, and gave it to all three, which they ate. While eating the bread and butter the deceased said, \u201cWe have torn down half the net-house of Augustus Pond, coming along, and have left the rest, so when we go back wo will have the rest of the fun.\u201d He also said, \u201cI want to see Gust. Pond: he abused an Irishman, and I want to abuse him just as bad as he abused the Irishman.\u201d He also said, \u201c Pond has to be abused any way.\u201d He further said, \u201cThomas, this is good bread; I.don\u2019t know but it may be the last piece of bread I\u2019ll eat.\u201d On this same occasion Plant said, \u201cI must have a fight with Gust. Pond, and if I can\u2019t whip him, Isaac will whip him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-4\">The deceased was then standing by the side of Ward, and had his hand on Ward\u2019s shoulder. Plant spoke of the three as being an army, and said that he was captain, Robilliard was Bonaparte, and Blanchard was the soldier, and was to do what they ordered. Plant said he had wanted Blanchard to go into prisoner\u2019s house, and he was going to punish him by drinking three times to his drinking once, for not doing as he was told to do. Plant and Robilliard drank twice by the door. Ward then went into his house, and Plant, Robilliard and the deceased, went away towards George Porkains\u2019 house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-5\">They soon returned, and in passing Ward\u2019s house, they were heard to say that \u201cthey were going back again; were going to find him, and to whip him, or have the soul out of him.\u201d In passing, the deceased stopped by Ward\u2019s net-house. Plant and Robilliard went on towards the prisoner\u2019s house, and when they were two or three hundred feet from Ward\u2019s, as judged by the sound, Plant hallooed for Isaac Blanchard, thus: \u201cIsaac, come along; are you afraid ? What in hell is the use of being afraid ? Follow me, yon follow a man.\u201d Blanchard replied, \u201c I am not afraid,\u201d and he then went in the direction of the prisoner\u2019s house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>Plant, Robilliard and the deceased, then went to the door of the prisoner\u2019s house.

Robilliard and the deceased stood outside, and they commenced tearing down the net-house; at the same time Plant went inside, where Dennis Cull was sound asleep in bed. The first that Cull knew was his being pulled out of bed on to the floor. Plant was on top of him with his hand on his throat, choking him. Cull asked who it was choking him, but got no answer. Just at this time, whilst Plant was in the net-house and Robilliard and the deceased were tearing it down, .the prisoner came to the door of his house, opened it, and hallooed thus : \u201cWho is tearing down my net-house?\u201d To this there was no response.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-5\">Near or about the same time, the voices of a woman and child were heard crying near the prisoner\u2019s house, and by the woman\u2019s voice the words \u201c For God\u2019s sake\u201d were spoken twice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-6\">The boards were rattling at the same time that these voices of the woman and child were heard.

In about half a minute after the first order to leave, the prisoner said again, \u201c Leave, or I\u2019ll shoot.\u201d These orders to leave were spoken with a loud voice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-7\">A little before the firing of the gun, and whilst Plant was in the net-house, the cries of Cull were heard in the net-house.

He did not speak, but hallooed twice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-8\">The boards stopped rattling about three or four seconds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>before the gun was fired, and the gun was fired from two to four seconds after the prisoner\u2019s second order of \u201cLeave, or I\u2019ll shoot.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-4\">The gun was fired a little before daybreak, on the morning of Saturday, the 18th of June.

Prisoner said to his brother that he had come to give himself up to him, to take him for what he had done; and that he wanted to reach Beaver Islands, to give himself up to the law. The Beaver Islands are about twenty-five miles from Seul Choix. \u25a0 He addressed these words to his brother, \u201c I come and surrender myself to you.\u201d His brother did not take him, because, as he said, the prisoner\u2019s men understood the matter better than he did, and at that time the brother did not think of his being a constable, as he was yery much confused and excited from the occurrence. The prisoner then engaged his two hired men, Whitney and Cull, to go with him to Beaver Islands.

But taken in connection with the <em>context </em>of the charge, and as a naked proposition, it being so delivered without explanation of its <em>whole </em>bearing and application, and without the <em>slightest </em>notice of distinction between the right to repel a mere <em>legal </em>and <em>civil trespass </em>on property, and the right to repel its <em>felonious </em>and <em>criminal destruction </em>or <em>injury, </em>the proposition Avas Avell calculated to confound and mislead the jury, and lead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>them to suppose that the prisoner had no remedy against the crime by using reasonable and necessary means to prevent it, and that he had no other remedy than to <em>submit </em>to \u2018the crime, if he could not <em>peaceably </em>prevent it, and then \u201cseek redress in the courts\u201d by civil suit for the value of the property destroyed.

A crime is a public wrong, and, according to its nature, may or may not be a legal trespass or private wrong. For the private wrong or trespass, in either case, the law awards <em>to </em>the injured party his damages or compensation. But for the crime or public wrong, the law awards no compensation, but punishment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-7\">There is, therefore, ample reason why a mere legal trespass or private wrong should not be resisted unto death. It has its ample remedy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-8\">Not so with a crime or public wrong, for which, when once committed, there is no remedy, though it may be punished. The law of society, the public safety, therefore, requires that crime be resisted and prevented ; and hence every citizen is invested not only with the right but duty to repel and prevent it; but the means employed must appear to be necessary and reasonable for the purpose, in view of the nature of the crime and all the circumstances of the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-9\">All crime, therefore, can and should be resisted; but whether the degree of force used be necessary, and whether resistance unto death be justifiable in any particular case, are not matters of law for the court, but fact for the jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>to be submitted to them under the law and the evidence, which in the present case the court refused to do: \u2014 <em>State v.

And as most of the questions raised before us involve the consideration of the same subject, it may be necessary to examine somewhat carefully into the rules which divide homicide into its various heads, and determine the character of each act of slaying.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The facts are claimed, by the counsel for the accused, to have a tendency to establish the act as innocent on various grounds: <em>first, </em>as excusable in defence of himself or his servant; <em>second, </em>as justifiable in repelling a riotous attack, and <em>third, </em>as justifiable in resisting a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The first inquiry necessary, is one which applies equally to all of the grounds of defense; and is whether the necessity of taking life, in order to excuse or justify the slayer, must be one arising out of actual and imminent danger; or whether he may act-upon a belief, arising from appearances which give him reasonable cause for it, that the danger is actual and imminent, although he may turn out to be mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Human life is. not to be lightly disregarded, and the law will not permit it to be destroyed unless upon urgent occasion. But the rules which make it excusable or justifiable to destroy it under some circumstances, are really meant to ensure its general protection. They are designed to prevent reckless and wicked men from assailing peaceable members of society, by exposing them to the danger of fatal resistance at the hands of those whom they wantonly attack, and put in peril or fear of great injury or death. And such rules, in order to be of any value, must be in some reasonable degree accommodated to human character and necessity. They should not be allowed to entrap or mislead those whose misfortunes compel a resort to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Were a man charged with crime to be held to a knowledge of all facts precisely as they are, there could be few cases in which the most innocent intention or honest zeal could justify or excuse homicide. The jury, by a careful sifting of witnesses on both sides, in cool blood, and \u25a0 aided by the comments of court and counsel, may arrive at a tolerably just conclusion on the circumstances of an assault. But the prisoner, who is to justify himself, can hardly be expected to be entirely cool in a deadly affray, or in all cases to have1 great courage or large intellect; and can not well see the true meaning of all that occurs at the time; while he can know nothing whatever concerning what has occurred elsewhere, or concerning the designs of his assailants, any more than can be inferred from appearances. And the law, while it will not generally excuse mistakes of law (because every man is bound to know that), does not hold men responsible for a knowledge of facts unless their ignorance arises from fault or negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">A criminal intent is a necessary ingredient of every crime. And therefore it is well remarked by Baron Parke in <em>Regina v. </em>Thurborn, 2 <em>C. &amp; </em>K. 832, that \u201cas the rule of law, founded on justice and reason, is that <em>actus non facit reum nisi mens sit </em>rea, the guilt of the accused must depend on the circumstances as they appear to him.\u201d And Mr. Bishop has expressed the same rule very clearly, by declaring that \u201cin all cases where a party, without fault or carelessness, is misled concerning facts, and acts as he would be justified in doing if the facts were what he believed them to be, he is legally as he is morally innocent : \u2014 1 <em>Bish. Cr. L. </em>\u00a7 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">These principles have always been recognized, and are sustained by numerous authorities; but they need no vindication, and a further citation would \u2022 add nothing to the clear and intelligible statements already referred to. And from an examination of some of the charges given, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>are very much inclined to believe that the court beloAV entertained the same views, at least as to some branches of the defense. But as some of the charges actually given, and particularly those in response to the first and second instructions requested, negative this rule, and the jury upon those must have been misled, we must regard these charges as erroneous unless they were inapplicable to the ease altogether. Their applicability will be presently considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">In order to determine the materiality of the questions of law raised, it becomes necessary to determine under what circumstances homicide is excusable or justifiable. In doing this, it will be proper -to advert merely to those instances which may bo regarded as coming nearest to the circumstances of the case before us. The other cases we are not called upon to define or consider; and what we say is to be interpreted by the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The only variety of excusable homicide (as contra-distinguished from justifiable homicide at common law) which we need advert to, is that which is technically termed homicide <em>se aid saa </em>defendendo, and which embraces the defense of one\u2019s own life, or that of his family, relatives or dependants, within those relations whore the law permits the defense of others as of one\u2019s self. Practically, so far as punishment is concerned, there is no distinction with us between excusable and justifiable homicide; but' a resort to common law distinctions will nevertheless be convenient, in order to illustrate the difference between the various instances of homicide in repelling assaults, according as they are or are not felonious. Homicide <em>se defendendo </em>was excusable at common law when it occurred in a sudden affray, or in repelling an attack not made with a felonious design. According to Mr. Hawkins, it was excusable and not justifiable because, occurring in a quarrel, it generally assumed some fault on both sides : \u2014 <em>Hawk. P. C., B. </em>1 <em>Ch. </em>28, \u00a7 24. In these cases, the original assault not being with a feloni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>ous intent, and the danger arising in the heat of blood on one or both sides, the homicide is not excused unless the slayer does all which is reasonably in ;Ms power to avoid the necessity of extreme resistance, by retreating where retreat is safe, or by any other expedient which is attainable. He is bound, if possible, to get out of his adversary\u2019s way, and has no right to stand up and &gt; resist if he can safely retreat or escape: \u2014 See 2 <em>Bish. Cr. L. </em>\u00a7\u00a7543 to 552, 560 to 562, 564 to 568; <em>People v. </em>Sullivan, 3 <em>Seld. </em>396; 1 <em>Russ. Cr. </em>660 <em>et seq. </em>Mr Russell lays ylown the rule very concisely as follows <em>(p. </em>661) : \u201cThe party assaulted must there-' fore flee, as far as he conveniently can, either by reason of some wall, ditch, or other - impediment, or as far as the fierceness of the assault will permit him; for it may be so fierce as not to allow him to yield a step without manifest danger of his life or great bodily harm; and then, in his defense, he may hill his assailant instantly. Before a person can avail himself of the defense that he used a weapon in defense of his life, he must satisfy the jury that that defense was necessary; that he did all he could to avoid it; and that it was necessary to 2motect his own life, or to protect himself from such serious bodily harm as would give him a reasonable a2&gt;prehension that Ms life was in immediate danger. If he used the wea2^on havmg no other means -of resistance, and no means of escape, in such case, if he retreated as far as he could, he would be justified.\u201d A man may defend Ms family, his servants or his master, whenever he may defend himself. How much further this mutual right exists, it is unnecessary in this case to consider: \u2014 See 2 <em>Bish. Cr. L. </em>\u00a7581, <em>and cases cited; </em>1 <em>Russ. Cr. </em>662; 4 <em>Bl. Com. </em>184.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">There are many curious and nice questions concerning the extent of the right of self defence, where the assailed party is in fault. But as neither Pond nor Cull were in any way to blame in bringing about the events of Friday night, which led to the shooting of Blanchard, it is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>important to examine them. The danger to be resisted must be to life, or of serious bodily harm of a permanent character; and it must be unavoidable by other means, Of course we refer to means within the power of the slayer, so far as he is able to judge from the circumstan-' ces as they appear to him at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">A man is not, however, obliged to retreat if assaulted in his dwelling, but may use such means as are absolutely necessary to repel the assailant from his house, or to prevent his forcible entry, even to the taking of life. But here, as im the other cases, he must not take life if he can otherwise arrest or repel the assailant: \u2014 2 <em>Bish. Cr. </em>L. \u00a7 569; 3 <em>Greenl. Ev. </em>\u00a7117; <em>Hawk. P. C., B. </em>1 <em>Ch. </em>28, \u00a723. Where the assault or breaking is felonious, the homicide becomes justifiable, and not merely excusable.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The essential difference between excusable and justifiable homicide rests not merely in the fact that at common law the one was felonious, although j&gt;ardoned of course, while the other was innocent. Those only were justifiable homicides where the slayer was regarded as promoting justice, and performing a public duty; and the question of personal danger did not necessarily arise, although it does generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">It is held to be the duty of every one who sees a felony attempted by violence, to prevent it if possible; and in the performance of this duty, .which is an active one, there is a legal right to use all necessary means to make the resistance effectual. Where a felonious act is not of a violent or forcible character, as in picking pockets, and crimes partaking of fraud rather than force, there is no necessity, and therefore no justification, for homicide, unless possibly in some exceptional cases. The rule extends only to cases of felony; and in those it is lawful to resist force by force. If any forcible attempt is made, with a felonious intent against person or property, the person resisting is not obliged to retreat, but may pursue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Ms adversary, if necessary, till he finds himself out of danger. Life may not properly be taken under this rule where the evil may be prevented by other means within the power of the person who interferes against the felon. Reasonable apprehension, however, is sufficient here, precisely as in all other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">It has also been laid down by the authorities, that private persons may forcibly interfere to suppress a riot or resist rioters, although a riot is not necessarily a felony in itself. This is owing to the nature of the offense, which requires the combination of three or more persons, assembling together and actually accomplishing some object calculated to terrify others. Private persons who can not otherwise suppress them, or defend themselves from them, may justify homicide in killing them, as it is their right and duty to aid in preserving the |&gt;eace. And <em>perhaps </em>no case can arise where a felonious attempt by a single individual will be as likely to inspire terror as .the turbulent acts of rioters. And a very limited knowledge of human nature is sufficient to inform us, that when men combine to do an injury to the person or property of others, of such a nature as to involve excitement and provoke resistance, they are not likely to stop at half way measures, or to scan closely the dividing line between felonies and misdemeanors. But when the act they meditate is in itself felonious, and of a violent character, it is manifest that strong measures will generally be required for their effectual suppression; and a man who defends himself, his family or his property, under such circumstances, is justified in making as complete a defense as is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">When we look at the facts of this case, we find very-strong circumstances to bring the, act of Pond within each of the defenses we have referred to. Without stopping to recapitulate the testimony in full or in detail, we have these leading features presented: Without any cause or provocation given by Pond, we find Plant, Robilliard and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Blanchard, combining with an expressed intention to do him personal violence. On Thursday evening this gang, with from fifteen to twenty associates, having been hunting for Pond, found him at a neighbors, and having got him out of doors, surrounded him, while Plant struck him with his fist, and kicked him in the breast, with insulting language, evidently designed to draw him into a fight. He escaped from them, and ran away into the woods, and succeeded in avoiding them that night. That same night they tore down the door of the net-house, where his servants were asleep, in search of him; and not finding him there, went to the house; the whole rabble being with them; and wanted Pond, and expressed themselves determined to have him; but refused to tell his wife what they wanted of him. Not finding him there, they started off elsewhere in search of him. This was between nine and ten o\u2019clock at night. About noon of Friday, Plant and Blanchard met Pond, when Plant threatened again to. whip him; and then went up to him, told him not to say anything, and that if he did he would give him slaps or kicks. Plant then took a stone in his hand, and threatened if Pond spoke, to throw it at him. Pond said nothing, but went home quietly, and Plant went off and was heard making further threats soon after. Friday night neither Pond nor his family went to bed, being in fear of violence. Between one and two o\u2019clock that night, Plant, Robilliard and Blanchard went to the net-house, and partially tore it down, while Whitney and Cull were in it. They then went to the house where Pond, his wife and children were, shook the door, and said they wanted Pond. Pond concealed himself under the bed, and his wife demanded what they wanted of him, saying he was not there; when Plant shook the door again, and ordered Mrs. Pond to open it; saying they wanted to search the house. She refusing, they resorted to artifice, asking for various articles of food, and objecting to receiving them except through the door. Plant then repeatedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>commanded her to open the door, saying if she did not, she would regret it. On opening the door from six to twelve inches, by sliding the cord, to hand them some sugar, which they demanded, they did not take the .sugar, but Plant seized Mrs. Pond\u2019s arm, and squeezed it until she fainted. Not succeeding in getting into the house, they then left for Ward\u2019s, and Pond went to the house of his brother-in-law, and borrowed a double barreled shot gun loaded with pigeon shot, and returned home. While at Ward\u2019s, Blanchard told the latter that they had tom down part of Pond\u2019s net-house, and had left the rest so that when they went back they would have the rest of the fun. Blanchard also said, \u201cI want to see Gust. Pond: he abused an Irishman, and I want to abuse him just as bad as he abused the Irishman. Pond has to be abused any way.\u201d He also said to Ward, \u201c this is good bread, I don\u2019t know but it may be the last piece of bread I\u2019ll eat.\u2019\u2019 Plant also made threats. A short time after returning, they were heard to'say they were going back again; were going to find him and to whip him, or have the soul out of him. It is to be remarked that we have their language as rendered by an interpreter, who was evidently illiterate, or at least incompetent to translate into very good English; and it is impossible for us to determine the exact force of what was said.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">The party then went back to^ Pond\u2019s, and asked admittance to search for him. His wife refused to let them in. They immediately went to the net-house, where Cull was asleep. Plant seized Cull, and pulled him out of bed on the floor, and began choking him. Cull demanded who it was, but received no answer. Blanchard and Robilliard had commenced tearing down the boards. Pond went to the door and hallooed, \u201cWho is tearing down my net-house ?\u201d to which there was no answer. The voices of a woman and child were heard crying, and the woman\u2019s voice was heard twice to cry out \u201c for God\u2019s sake!\u201d Cull\u2019s voice was also heard from the net - house, not speaking, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>hallooing as if he was in pain. Pond cried out loudly \u201c leave or I\u2019ll shoot.\u201d The noise continuing, he gave the same warning again, and in a few seconds shot off one barrel of the gun. Blanchard was found dead the next morning. Pond took immediate steps to surrender himself to justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">A question was raised whether the net-house was a dwelling or a part of the dwelling of Pond. We think it was. It was near the other building, and was used not only for preserving the nets which were used in the ordinary occupation of Pond, as a fisherman, but also as a permanent dormitory for his servants. It was held in <em>The People v. Taylor, </em>2 <em>Mich. </em>250, that a fence was not necessary to include buildings within the curtilage, if within a space no larger than that usually occupied for the purposes of the dwelling and customary out - buildings. It is a very common thing in the newer parts of the country, where, from the nature of the materials used, a large build, ing is not readily made, 'to have two or more small buildings, with one or two rooms in each, instead of a large building divided into apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">We can not, upon a consideration of the facts manifest ; from the bill of exceptions, regard the charges asked by/ the defense as abstract or inapplicable to the case. It was for the jury to consider the whole chain of proof; but if they believed the evidence as spread out upon the , case, we feel constrained to say that there are very few <em>\\ </em>of the precedents which have shown stronger grounds of ! justification than those which are found here. Instead'1 of reckless ferocity, the facts display a very commendable ; moderation.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Apart from its character as a dwelling, which was denied by the court below, the attack upon the net-house for the_ purpose of destroying it, was a violent and forcible felony. And the fact that it is a statutory and not common law felony, does not, in our view, change its character. Rape and many other of the most atrocious felonious assaults, are statutory felonies only, and yet no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>one ever doubted the right to resist them, unto death. And a breaking into a house with the design of stealing the most trifling article, being common law burglary, was likewise allowed to be resisted in like manner, if necessary. We think there is no reason for making any distinctions between common law and statute felonies in this respect, if they are forcible and violent. So far as the manifest danger to Pond himself, and to Cull, is concerned, the justification would fall within the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">It is claimed by the prisoner\u2019s counsel, that we are authorized to pronounce upon the case the judgment which the facts warrant. Had the facts spread out in the bill of exceptions been found as a special verdict by the jury, this would be true. But as the case stands, we can only consider them as bearing upon the instructions given or refused. The errors being in the rulings, and not in the record outside of the bill of exceptions, we can do nothing more, in reversing the judgment,\u00a3than to order a new trial. The District Judge has ruled upon the law questions in such a way as to present them all fairly as questions not before decided in this state. We think there was error in requiring the actual instead of apparent and reasonably _\u00a1 founded causes of apprehension of injury; in holding that the protection of the net-house could not be made by using a dangerous weapon; and that the conduct of the assailing party was not felonious; and also in using language calculated to mislead the jury upon the means and extent of resistance justifiable in resisting a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">We do not deem it necessary to pass upon the minor points, as we do not suppose the authorities will deem it important to proceed further, unless the facts are very different from those presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The judgment below must be reversed .and a new trial granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b182-8\">Manning and Christiancy JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b182-9\">Martin Cn.
