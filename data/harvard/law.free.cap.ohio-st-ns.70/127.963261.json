It would seem to follow that the option to terminate these leases or to keep them in force by payment of the stipulated rental is in the lessee and that the one dollar and the agreement to pay the rental is a good consideration for the option.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The cases of plaintiffs below seem to have been suggested by, and based upon, the statement made by Burket, J., in <em>Brown et al. </em>v. <em>Fowler et al., supra, </em>on page 523, that, \u201ca tenancy at the will of one party is a tenancy also at the will of the other. \u2019 \u2019 Assuming that the statement is correct in cases of mere tenancy at will, it has no application in these \u2022cases. This is no mere tenancy at will. There is a good and valid consideration for the option .granted by these instruments, and it is immaterial whether they are called leases, deeds,- or written agreements. The intention of the parties is to control and it is manifest that it was not the intention of either party that the right granted by the instrument should be a mere license that could be terminated by the grantor at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">In <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Tanner, </em>38 Ohio St., 118, a written instrument like the instruments under consideration in this case, in that it was in the nature of a lease and for no definite term and with an option in the lessee to terminate it at any time, was under consideration, and it was held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">\u201cT and B executed an instrument under seal, signed by two witnesses, and acknowledged by T before a justice of the peace, in which instrument it is covenanted that T leases to B two acres of land (described in the instrument), with the use of water in adjoining lands of T and privilege of conducting it in pipes \u2018to a cheese house to be erected on said premises, T reserving enough water to accommodate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>the stock kept on the farms of T. And B is to bnild a cheese house on the premises, and agrees to pay T for the use of the premises and the privileges aforesaid, thirty dollars per annum on the first day of October, in each year, while the premises shall be used as and for the manufacture of cheese; and when the premises shall no longer be used for such purpose, the premises, together with the privileges aforesaid, shall revert to T, said B having the privilege of removing all buildings and fixtures put upon said premises by him.\u2019 <em>Held, </em>that this was a lease to B for life, provided he continued to use the premises for the manufacture of cheese thereon and paid rents, with the right at any time to remove the buildings and fixtures placed on the premises by _ such lessee. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">In that case the instrument contained no words of inheritance, and, presumably for that reason, it was held to be a lease for life, only.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">In <em>Delhi School District </em>v. <em>Everett, </em>52 Mich., 314, it is held, in an opinion by Cooley, J.: <em>\u201cA </em>lease to a school district, to hold the property \u2018during the time it is used for school purposes,\u2019 is a lease in perpetuity at the will of the lessee; and as the lessee is a corporation, and words of inheritance are not required, the lease, if a present consideration is paid, really operates as a bargain and sale, and conveys a base or determinable fee'. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">In <em>Foltz </em>v. <em>Huntley, </em>7 Wend., 210, the syllabus is as follows: \u201cA demise to A B, his heirs and assigns, for such term of time as he pays rent, etc., he, on his part, covenanting for himself and his heirs, etc., to pay rent and perform covenants, is a perpetual lease. The lessor, but not the lessee, may elect, on default, to consider it forfeited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>In <em>Lowther Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Guffey et al., </em>52 W. Va., 88, 43 S. E. Rep., 101, it was held that, \u201cWhere a grant, of oil and gas, and oil and gas privileges, in consideration of one dollar, without limitation as to time, contains a forfeiture clause in these words: \u2018In-case no well is completed within two years from this date, then this grant shall immediately become null and void as to both parties: provided, that second, party may prevent such forfeiture from year to year by paying <em>to </em>the first annually in advance eighteen and seventy-five one-hundredths dollars, at-her residence, until such well is completed, \u2019 such lease is thereby converted into a lease from year to year, at the option of the lessee, until a well is completed. It would then continue so long as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">See also <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Tolleston Club, </em>110 Ill., 65; <em>Gilmore </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>83 Ind., 196; <em>Hosack </em>v. <em>Crill, </em>204 Pa. St., 97; 53 Atl. Rep., 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">It is true that at common law a lease at the will of one party was at the will of either, and for the reason that an estate at the will of the lessee, his heirs or assigns, was the equivalent of the fee-simple, which could not-he granted by a lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">But in this state, at an early day it was provided,, by statute, that permanent leasehold estates, renewable forever, should descend as estates in fee, and they were made subject to he taken on execution as-real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">\u2022 Why the common law rule is not the law in this-state is well stated by Lowrie, C. J., in <em>Effinger </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>32 Pa. St., 367. He says: (368) \u201cThis lease-is for one hundred years, with the right in the lessee, his heirs or assigns, to hold the premises at the same rent, as long thereafter as he or they shall think <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>proper; and the counsel insists that, after the hundred years, this becomes a lease at the will of one party, and therefore of either. He urges that \u25a0such was, for several centuries, the common law of England; and that, therefore, it is now a part of our \u25a0common law, and that we have assumed legislative functions in setting it aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">(369) \u201cNow if the law relied on here depended on -a custom that has passed away, it is not we, but the people themselves, that have set aside the law; and it would be mere usurpation in us to declare that it is still in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\u2018(That law did depend on a custom that has passed away. An estate at the will of the grantee, his heirs and assigns, is equivalent to a fee simple, and such an estate could not, by the old customs, be conveyed without livery of seisin. By the same customs, there could be no livery of seisin under a lease, but a mere taking of possession. Land granted by livery of seisin, without defining the quantity of the \u25a0estate, was treated as a life estate. Where there was merely a delivery of possession, without defining the term, there arose only a tenancy at will. For want of livery of seisin, and the form of conveyance proper to that ceremony, it was necessary to treat an estate at the will of the grantee, as being also at the will of the grantor, else a fee simple might be granted in a form that pertained to the lowest order of estates; and this the customs of that \u2022day did not allow.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">\u201cNow and here, it is otherwise. With us, a fee \u00a1simple may be granted without livery of seisin, as well as a lease for years, or at will.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">(370) \u201cThere is nothing, therefore, to prevent us from giving effect to this contract according to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>intention of the parties. If they meant to create an \u2022estate that should endure so long as the grantee, his heirs and assigns, should desire to keep it at the rent agreed upon, then such is its character; and this silences all the minor objections brought to bear on the title. That they did mean such an estate, is \u2022quite plain from their agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">\u201cIt is, in terms, a demise and grant to James Crozer, his heirs and assigns, for one hundred years, and as much longer as he and they may think proper, at an annual rent of three pounds, and with leave to him or them to surrender the premises at any time during the term, on giving one year\u2019s notice; and the grantor, for himself, his heirs, executors, and administrators, covenants with the grantee, his heirs and assigns, that they shall quietly enjoy and hold the premises and privileges granted, against the grantor or any person claiming under him.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">\u201cIt would be darkening counsel with words to attempt to prove that this means to grant an estate to be held and assigned at the will of the grantee and those holding 'under him. The parties have so contracted, and the law does not forbid it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b169-9\">Spear, C.
