Kinkead, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-9\">The rule of construction to be applied to clauses in wills like the one under consideration may be summarized thus:</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-10\">Where a testator bequeaths or devises property to his heirs of different classes, as children and grandchildren, without using language showing a manifest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>intent that the different classes are to receive an equal division, then U -will bo presumed that the testator intended ill,-it fclwy wi'i take in the manner or by the mode by which they would take under the-law of descent and distribution, resort to such statutes being necessary in such case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-5\">' But wherever a testator in making provision for his heirs of different classes, as in providing for the-disposition of the residuum of his estate, after making specific devises, says that such residuum shall pass to all his heirs, or lawful heirs, and uses language reasonably indicating that he intended an equal division, even without naming all his heirs either in the will itself or in the dispositive clause, it will be presumed that he had in mind all his heirs, both children and grandchildren, and that he intended to make equal division for them all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-6\">The will must be the sole guide in such cases, it being improper to resort to the statutes of descent or-to extrinsic evidence. The words \u201cshall be equally divided amongst my lawful heirs, share and share alike,\u201d is language clearly indicating such intention.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-7\">The rules which we have just stated in our own language are fairly deducible from all the authorities, as we would apply them to this case, and is the law in Ohio, Missouri, North Carolina, Oregon, New York and Virginia, but not in Pennsylvania and Illinois. The law in the two latter states is opposed to our contention, in Pennsylvania flatly so because the language construed is quite similar to that in the will in this case, although it lacks the significant words which are in the clause of the will in our case, \u201cshare and share alike.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-8\">Upon reflection it is perhaps not true that the doctrine of the Pennsylvania and Illinois cases is. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>different from what we have above stated, and as shown by the cases, but the courts in these two states have differently applied the rule of construction to language of similar import. <em>Bisson </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>143 N.

The language of this item is as follows: \u201cWhatever there remains after my decease shall be equally divided amongst my lawful heirs, share and share alike.\u201d At the time of his death the testator, Frank Koehl, left surviving him as his sole and only heirs at law, his five children, who are defendants in error here, viz.: Frank Koehl, Jr., Emma Federspiel, Catharine Walters, Maggie Boesche and Pearl Koehl, and his two grandchildren, Emil Henry Koehl and Louisa Maria Koehl, plaintiffs in error, who were children of Louis Koehl, a son of said testator, who died more than eight years prior to the execution of said will. The question presented, here for determination, is whether under the provisions of said item four of the will of Frank Koehl the residuum of his estate thereby disposed of, is to be distributed among his \u201clawful heirs,\u201d the children and grandchildren above named, in equal portions, and one-seventh part thereof given to each; or whether such residuum is to be divided into six equal parts, and one-sixth given to each of the five children of testator, and the remaining sixth to his two grandchildren. In short is the' distribution of said residuum, under item four, to be made <em>per stirpes </em>or <em>per capita. </em>It was contended in the courts below and is the conten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>tion of defendants in error here that where a testator bequeaths his estate, or the residuum thereof, to his heirs, or as in this case, to his \u201clawful heirs,\u201d without other or further designation, and without naming them, thereby making necessary a resort to the statutes of descent and distribution in order to ascertain and determine who shall take under the will, that such devisees or legatees, when so ascertained, will take only in the proportion designated and prescribed by the statutes of descent and distribution, and, .if not of equal degree, they will take by right of representation;-or <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per capita. </em>That such is the general rule, in the absence of any specific direction by testator as to how, or in what proportion each shall take, would seem from the authorities, to be well settled. <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>62 Ill., 417; <em>Daggett </em>v. <em>Slack et al., </em>8 Metc., 450; <em>West </em>v. <em>Rassman, </em>135 Ind., 278; <em>Woodward </em>v. <em>James, </em>115 N. Y., 346; <em>Eyer </em>v. <em>Beck, </em>70 Mich., 179; <em>Conklin </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>63 Conn., 377; <em>Kirkpatrick </em>v. <em>Kirkpatrick, </em>197 Ill., 144; <em>Mattison </em>v. <em>Tanfield, </em>3 Beav., 131. But this rule, resting as it does upon the presumption, that because the testator has made necessary a resort to the statute, in order to determine who his donees are, that therefore he also intended, that the statute should govern and control as to the proportion each should take, can have no application to a case like the one at bar, where the testator has in clear and specific language prescribed and directed how such division shall be made as between those whom he has designated as his beneficiaries; viz. \u201cequally, share and share alike.\u201d Having so declared and directed, nothing is left for inference or presumption, as to the mode of distribution, and division must be made as directed by the testator. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>By item four of Ms will the testator, Frank Koehl, \u00bfives the <em>residue </em>of his estate to a \u201cclass,\u201d which in terms he therein designates by the general description, his \u201clawful heirs.\u201d This being the only designation or description of those who were intended as beneficiaries under this clause of the will, of necessity, resort must be had to the statute, in \u25a0order to determine who are the legal heirs of the testator within the meaning of tMs clause. In a -technical, or strict legal sense, neither the children or grandchildren of testator were at the time of the making of this will his heirs. <em>Nemo est haeres \u25a0viventis. </em>But by reference to the statute we find \u2022that all of them, both children and grandcMldren, are, within the purview and meaning of the statute, his \u201clawful heirs, \u2019\u2019 inasmuch as without the will, all would be entitled, by. inheritance to share in the distribution of his estate. All then, being beneficiaries under item,four of this will, it only remains to ascertain their respective interests, and to determine the share to which each is entitled, upon a distribution of the residuum of testator\u2019s estate, disposed of by this item of the will, and this must be ascertained and determined, if it may be, according to the intention of the testator as disclosed by the language of the will itself. In thus ascertaining the intention of testator, effect must be given to every word of the testamentary clause under consideration, without rejecting any of them, if this can be done by a reasonable construction, not inconsistent with the manifest intent and purpose of said testator, apparent from the whole will taken together. Quid-' ed then by this rule of construction, and there being nothing found elsewhere in said will to limit, control or vary the direction given by testator in item four, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>\u25a0as to the method of distribution and division of the residuum of his estate, the .intention of the testator as to the manner in which such division should be made and as to the share each should take, would from the language employed by him in directing such divisi\u00f3n, seem entirely clear. By the phrase \u00a3&lt;my lawful heirs\u201d testator describes the objects of his bounty and designates who are to be his beneficiaries ; and by the words, <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>equally, share and share alike, \u2019 \u2019 he defines and points out the manner in which they are to take the estate comprehended by the gift. If, as contended by counsel for defendants in error, the testator had meant that both the persons who were to take, and the manner of division, should be governed by, and should be in accordance with, the statutes of descent and distribution, and as if he had -died intestate, then item four of his will was entirely nseless, for in that case the same persons would take, and in the same manner, as if he had died leaving no will. Testator does not say that the persons designated as beneficiaries are to take in the same manner, and in like proportions, as though he should die intestate, but on the contrary, after describing those who are to be the objects of his bounty, by the general designation, \u00a3\u00a3my lawful heirs,\u201d which includes both children and grandchildren, he, in clear and specific language, directs that division shall be made amongst them, \u00a3\u00a3equally, share and share alike.\u201d Primarily, the object of making a will is t\u00f3 direct another and different mode of distribution of the testator\u2019s estate from that marked out by the law of descent. That Frank Koehl made a will, is a circumstance tending to show that he intended thereby to make provision for his heirs different from that which the law would make. And the fact that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>made a will is a fact that weighs against snch construction of the provisions of item four of this will,, as is here contended for by counsel for defendants in error, because, if the construction for which they contend is to prevail, it would, at most, only accomplish that which the law itself would effect, in the absence of any such clause or provision, and it makes the insertion in this will, of item four, an idle and useless act on the part of the testator. There, being nothing in this will to suggest or require a different conclusion, we must presume and conclude that the testator, Frank Koehl, had a purpose and object in employing the particular language he did. employ, in item four, and from the language therein used by him, we think this intention is clear and unmistakable. By the use of the phrase \u201cmy lawful heirs\u201d he manifestly intended that all those persons, who would be his heirs under the statute of descent,, in case of his intestacy, should be his beneficiaries, and should take the residuum of his estate. And by the use of the words\"equally,share and share alike, \u2019\u2019 he just as clearly evidenced the intention that they should not take such residuum in the manner prescribed by the statute, but should take it equally, share and share alike, as directed by his will. By reference to the statute we ascertain <em>who </em>are to take-under item four, and by the plain provisions of the will itself, we are told <em>how </em>they are to take, that is: \u201cequally, share and share alike,\u201d <em>per capita </em>and <em>not per stirpes.
