J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0Q\">Defendant and appellant Nestl\u00e9 USA, Inc. (Nestl\u00e9) appeals a judgment in favor of plaintiff Richard Herr (Herr) following ajuiy trial of an age discrimination suit resulting in a $5,163,600 verdict. Nestl\u00e9 also seeks review of an order denying its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV), and a postjudgment attorney fee award of $1,788,159.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">Herr cross-appeals, contending the trial court erred in granting nonsuit on his punitive damages claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">The issues presented include the sufficiency of the evidence to support the age discrimination claim, whether the trial court should have allowed the punitive damages claim to go to the jury, whether the damages and attorney fee award are excessive, and alleged evidentiary and instructional errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">We find the verdict is supported by the evidence and perceive no error in any of the trial court\u2019s mlings. Therefore, the judgment and orders are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-14\">In the published portion of the opinion, we address Nestl\u00e9\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in enjoining it pursuant to the unfair competition law (UCL) (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.) from discriminating against employees age 40 and over.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>The UCL defines unfair competition as including \u201cany <em>unlawful, </em>unfair or fraudulent business act or practice . . . .\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200, italics added.) The California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12900 et seq.) makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to engage in age discrimination. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12940, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An employer which practices age discrimination has an unfair competitive advantage over employers who comply with the FEHA because older workers frequently are more highly compensated than their younger colleagues. Further, the UCL\u2019s remedies are cumulative to the remedies available under the FEHA. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17205.) Therefore, injunctive relief under the UCL is an appropriate remedy where a business has engaged in an unlawful practice of discriminating against older workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">1. <em>Facts.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">a. <em>Evidence establishing Nestl\u00e9 \u2019s preference for younger employees.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">In 1985, the Carnation Company, located in Los Angeles, was acquired by Nestl\u00e9 S.A., a Swiss company. For a number of years, Carnation continued to operate as it had in the past. However, in the early 1990\u2019s, Nestl\u00e9 S.A.\u2019s chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors, Helmut Maucher (Maucher), decided to bring Carnation and Nestl\u00e9\u2019s other American companies under one roof, resulting in the formation of Nestl\u00e9 U.S.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">At a management meeting in October 1990, Robert Mason, an executive vice-president, presented Nestl\u00e9\u2019s views regarding its Carnation employees. Mason said Carnation employees were older employees, with an average age of 43 and with 15 or 17 years of service and it was Nestl\u00e9\u2019s \u201cpolicy to promote young, energetic people in management positions.\u201d Mason remarked that Carnation \u201chad a lot of deadwood in it\u201d and instructed that staff \u201csee about getting rid of the deadwood.\u201d One of the individuals present at this meeting was James Person, who was then over 43 years of age and serving as Carnation\u2019s director of environmental affairs. Person testified he was shocked to hear that his employment at Nestl\u00e9 would be limited because of his age.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">In 1988, Carnation\u2019s EEO (equal employment opportunity) policy stated the company was committed to \u201cequal opportunity in all matters of employment without consideration of a qualified individual\u2019s race, sex, <em>age, </em>color, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>religion, national origin . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) The 1993 policy statement, the first one issued after the Nestl\u00e9 transition, conspicuously omitted \u201cage\u201d as an enumerated category.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Age was restored as a protected category two years later, after Nestl\u00e9 was sued for age discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">On December 1, 1993, Maucher, who headed Nestl\u00e9, issued a memorandum entitled Objectives 1994. With respect to human resource policies, Maucher directed that Nestl\u00e9 \u201c[cjontinue hiring, identifying and developing young people to have in the long-term enough resources for future management.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">b. <em>Evidence establishing Nestl\u00e9\u2019s failure to promote Herr was age-related.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">In early 1989, at the age of 41, Herr took a position at Carnation as an internal auditor. During the interview process, Herr was assured that Carnation promotes from within. One year later, Herr was promoted to a manager position. This was Herr\u2019s final promotion. The transformation of Carnation to Nestl\u00e9 was under way.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">In 1991, Herr received a positive performance evaluation, with an \u201cE\u201d (exceeded expectations), the company\u2019s highest rating, in the areas of organizing, controlling and communication, and an \u201cM\u201d (met expectations) in all other areas. In 1992, Herr received an even better review, gamering \u201cE\u201d ratings in nine distinct areas: controlling, utilization of time, budget and expense control, presentation skills, quantity of work, self control, dependability, cooperation, and quality of work. Herr was then ready to move on within the organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">In 1992, when the position of director of financial reporting became available, Herr, then 45 years old, applied for it. Herr had the training and qualifications for the job, including over 20 years of experience at Mobil and Carnation. However, Nestl\u00e9 gave the position to Greg Geane, age 31, who possessed less than 10 years of business experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">In the summer of 1992, in an attempt to become more well rounded professionally, Herr also applied for two lateral manager positions involving financial operations for Nestl\u00e9 foreign trade. Although Herr had substantial experience qualifying him for those positions, they went to Dan Stroud, age 32, and Ruth Ause, age 31. As contrasted with Herr\u2019s two decades of experience, Stroud had only two and a half years of finance experience. Further, Ause had received unfavorable performance reviews, and recently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>had been demoted due at least in part to performance reasons. Mary Lou Wallace, age 31 and a director of finance, rejected Herr and testified she did not care what Herr\u2019s performance history had been.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">In the summer of 1993, Herr\u2019s supervisor, Barbara Coad, age 43, was removed by Jack Mulhem, senior vice-president in finance, from her position as director of sales financial services, a position she had held since 1985. As director, she supervised about 40 people; in her new position, she supervised none. A year and a half later, Coad left the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Herr was well qualified for Goad\u2019s director position. He had worked directly under Coad for three years and had experience in all aspects of her job. The job description specified a \u201cminimum of ten years\u2019 business experience,\u201d and that a CPA or MBA was preferred. Herr met these requirements. However, Herr was not interviewed for the position. Instead, Mulhem selected 32-year-old Dan Stroud, who lacked 10 years\u2019 business experience and had neither a CPA nor an MBA degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Herr then expressed interest in the position left open by Stroud\u2019s promotion. Herr was told the job already had gone to Dawn Striff, who was 29 years old and had been with Nestl\u00e9 only a short time. Wallace, who decided to promote Striff, admitted that Herr met all the qualifications for the position. However, Herr was denied an opportunity to interview for the position, which was not even posted, contrary to Nestl\u00e9\u2019s own policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">\u201e Despite repeated inquiries, Herr was never told why he was passed over for these various positions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">Herr began to feel depressed, unwanted and hopeless and spoke with Mike Mayhall, who had hired Herr at Carnation. Mayhall told Herr, that he, Herr, \u201cwasn\u2019t one of Jack [Mulhem\u2019s] boys. I wasn\u2019t someone in my early thirties that could be promoted throughout the organization. He told me that my responsibility was going to be to train the young managers of Nestl\u00e9. And he also told me that Jack had made a comment to him that he was getting a little bit long in the tooth.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">Between January 1992 and January 1996, Mulhem promoted five people to the position of manager or higher. None was 40 or over; they ranged in age from 28 to 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>Herr continued to seek advancement at Nestl\u00e9. He learned of openings for the positions of controller in Nestl\u00e9 Brand Food Service, and director of financial reporting. Herr was qualified for both the controller and director positions and previously had interviewed for the director position, but now was refused an interview for either one. The controller position went to 31-year-old Greg Geane and the director position went to 32-year-old Dave Frasher. Herr asked Tim Alders in the human resources department why he wasn\u2019t able to get an interview. Alders responded that Eric Bredeson, the hiring manager, \u201chad made a comment to him that this would be my last promotion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Around October 1993, Herr met with Mulhem to discuss opportunities for advancement at Nestl\u00e9. Mulhem told Herr \u201cthere were going to be a lot of opportunities opening up in the future.\u201d Mulhem stated he would reassign Herr to a different position as manager of special projects, reporting directly to Mulhem, to give Herr a broader background to better qualify him for future openings. In December 1993, Herr moved into his new position under Mulhem as manager of special projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">However, Herr\u2019s new position did not lead to advancement. Instead, in February 1994, after just two months, Mulhem gave Herr a layoff notice and told him his position, the one that was to lead to new opportunities, was being eliminated. The layoff notice was accompanied by a summary of termination benefits, requesting Herr to sign a settlement agreement and release of all claims, including age discrimination, in order to receive the termination benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Before Herr\u2019s scheduled departure date, Mulhem offered him a temporary position as a manager in the sales financial services department, a position that was itself slated for elimination. That job became available because one DeMartini was not performing satisfactorily.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Mulhem told Herr the assignment would last six to twelve months, at which time Herr would be terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">Herr performed well in his new job. His 1994 performance review indicated he achieved or exceeded expectations. In the summer of 1994, Herr\u2019s then supervisor, Stroud, moved to another position, creating an opening for a new director of sales financial services. Mulhem did not even consider Herr for the job, although Mulhem admitted Herr was doing a very good job. Instead, Mulhem\u2019s candidates were Jim Bidwell, Carol Scoville and Anne Witler Woods, all of whom were in their early 30\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>In February 1995, Mulhem gave the position to Woods, even though he was aware that Woods, like Stroud, her predecessor, lacked the minimum requirements for the job, including 10 years of business experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Herr learned of Woods\u2019s promotion to director of sales financial services and felt shocked and betrayed. He asked Mulhem whether he was passed over because of his age. Mulhem did not respond. Herr told Mulhem he couldn\u2019t take it anymore and there was nothing he could do but leave. Mulhem replied, \u201cI knew you would . . . this is the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">On March 22, 1995, Herr gave written notice of his resignation, effective April 14, 1995. Woods asked Herr to remain for another eight to 12 weeks to complete a certain project. Herr agreed, hoping to salvage his career by demonstrating his value to the company. He continued to do an excellent job.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> After that project ended, Herr finally left Nestl\u00e9 on June 30, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">2. <em>Proceedings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Herr filed suit against Nestl\u00e9 on February 7, 1997. The operative second amended complaint alleged two causes of action: age discrimination under the FEHA and unfair competition (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">a. <em>Jury trial on Herr\u2019s age discrimination claim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">Herr\u2019s age discrimination claim was tried to a jury. Numerous witnesses were called, including Herr, Mulhem, Person, Mayhall, Wallace, Stroud, Alders and Bredeson, referred to <em>ante. </em>After Herr rested, Nestl\u00e9 moved for nonsuit on the issues of constructive discharge and punitive damages.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The trial court granted Nestl\u00e9\u2019s motion for nonsuit solely as to punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">The jury returned a special verdict, finding on a nine-to-three vote that Nestl\u00e9 intentionally discriminated against Herr on the basis of his age and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>that Herr was constructively discharged because of his age, and awarded Herr $5,163,600 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">b. <em>Court trial on the UCL claim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The following day, the trial court, by stipulation sitting without a jury, heard the unfair competition claim. Following argument, the trial court permanently enjoined Nestl\u00e9 \u201cfrom discriminating on the basis of age, 40 and over, in promotions of employees\u201d; directed Nestl\u00e9 to issue to all employees a repudiation of the 1994 objectives memorandum wherein Maucher directed that Nestl\u00e9 \u201c[cjontinue hiring, identifying and developing young people to have in the long-term enough resources for future management\u201d; and ordered dissemination of the final judgment, including the repudiation, to all Nestl\u00e9, USA employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">c. <em>Subsequent proceedings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">On May 25, 2000, the trial court entered judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">Nestl\u00e9 moved for JNOV and for new trial. Nestl\u00e9 contended, inter alia, there was no substantial evidence to support the verdict, the evidence did not support an injunction on the UCL claim, the damages were excessive and were the product of passion and prejudice, evidentiary and instructional errors denied Nestl\u00e9 a fair trial, and at a minimum the damages should be reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">On July 19, 2000, the trial court denied Nestl\u00e9\u2019s posttrial motions, finding, inter alia, the evidence \u201cshowed a continuous pattern of age discrimination,\u201d and the damage award was within the realm of generally accepted standards and represented an acceptance of the testimony of plaintiffs expert and a rejection of the defense expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">On September 11, 2000, the trial court awarded Herr attorney fees in the sum of $1,788,159.38 pursuant to the FEHA and Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, the private attorney general statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-12\">Nestl\u00e9 filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment and from the order denying its motion for JNOV. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3(a) &amp; (c).)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Herr filed a timely notice of cross-appeal from the judgment, seeking review of the order granting nonsuit on the punitive damages claim. (Cal. Rules of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>Court, rule 3(e).) Nestl\u00e9 thereafter timely appealed the trial court\u2019s postjudgment order re attorney fees. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 904.1, subd. (a)(2).) The various appeals were consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"AVx\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Nestl\u00e9 contends: the trial court erred in denying its motion for JNOV on the age discrimination and unfair competition claims; the trial court erred in denying the motion for new trial; the trial court erred in not significantly remitting the damages; and the attorney fee award should be reversed or substantially reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">[[1. <em>Trial court properly denied Nestl\u00e9\u2019s motion for JNOV on the age discrimination </em>claim.]]<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">2. <em>Trial court properly enjoined Nestl\u00e9 under the UCL from engaging in age discrimination against employees age 40 and older.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">a. <em>No merit to Nestl\u00e9\u2019s contention it was entitled to JNOV on the UCL claim; the UCL claim was decided by the court, not the jury, and therefore a JNOV does not lie.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">As a preliminary matter, Nestl\u00e9 contends the trial court should have granted JNOV on the unfair competition claim. The argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">As indicated, after the jury returned its verdict on the age discrimination claim, the trial court, by stipulation sitting without a jury, heard the UCL claim. The JNOV procedure, by definition, applies to jury trials, and a trial judge should grant a motion for JNOV where the jury returns a verdict which is not supported by substantial evidence or by reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 629; <em>Hauter v. Zogarts </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 104, 110 [120 Cal.Rptr. 681, 534 P.2d 377].) Because the instant UCL claim was decided by the court, not the jury, Nestl\u00e9\u2019s contention that it was entitled to JNOV on the unfair competition claim is groundless.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-12\">However, moving beyond the procedural flaw in Nestl\u00e9\u2019s contention, we turn to the substantive issue of whether the trial court properly enjoined Nestl\u00e9 under the UCL from \u201cdiscriminating on the basis of age, 40 and over, in promotions of employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>b. <em>Age discrimination in violation of the FEHA is an unlawful employment practice which may be enjoined under the UCL; the UCL\u2019s remedies are cumulative.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Business and Professions Code section 17200 defines unfair competition as including \u201cany <em>unlawful, </em>unfair or fraudulent business act or practice . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) The UCL authorizes injunctive relief to prevent unfair competition. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17203.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Here, the evidence established that it was Nestl\u00e9\u2019s practice to promote young people in management positions to the detriment of their more mature colleagues, such as Herr. The FEHA makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to engage in age discrimination. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12940, subd. (a).) It follows that injunctive relief under the UCL is an appropriate remedy where a business has engaged in an unlawful practice of discriminating against older workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">Nestl\u00e9 contends it did not engage in unlawful age discrimination and therefore the unfair competition claim must fall together with the age discrimination claim. This argument fails because, as discussed in the previous section, there is substantial evidence to support the jury\u2019s determination Nestl\u00e9 did discriminate against Herr on account of his age.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">Nestl\u00e9 also contends the UCL is intended to protect consumers and competitors, not employees, and therefore Herr\u2019s remedy for age discrimination is limited to the FEHA. The argument is meritless. Business and Professions Code section 17205 specifically provides, \u201cUnless otherwise expressly provided, the remedies or penalties provided by this chapter are <em>cumulative to each other and to the remedies or penalties available under all other laws of this state.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">Further, an action for injunctive relief under the UCL may be brought \u201cby any person acting for the interests of itself, its members or the general public.\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17204.) \u201cThe courts in California have consistently upheld the right of both individual persons and organizations under the unfair competition statute to sue on behalf of the public for injunctive relief as \u2018private attorney[s] general,\u2019 even if they have not themselves been personally harmed or aggrieved. <em>(Perdue </em>v. <em>Crocker National Bank </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 913, 929 [216 Cal.Rptr. 345, 702 P.2d 503]; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number><em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>Atlantic Finance Co. </em>(1980) 105 Cal.App.3d 65, 70-73 [164 Cal.Rptr. 279].)\u201d <em>(Consumers Union of United States, Inc. v. Fisher Development, Inc. </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 1433, 1439 [257 Cal.Rptr. 151] [action against developer of adult community to enjoin discrimination in housing].) A fortiori, Herr, who was personally aggrieved by the age discrimination practiced at Nestl\u00e9, had the right under Business and Professions Code section 17204 to sue as a private attorney general to enjoin Nestl\u00e9 from engaging in unlawful employment discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Further, although Nestl\u00e9\u2019s counsel argued below that age discrimination is an \u201cintra company\u201d matter which is not injurious to competitors or consumers, the trial court properly rejected that argument. Actual injury to competition is <em>not </em>a required element of proof of a violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200. <em>(People ex rel. Van de Kamp </em>v. <em>Cappuccio, Inc. </em>(1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 750, 760 [251 Cal.Rptr. 657]; Stem, Bus. &amp; Prof.C. \u00a717200 Practice (The Rutter Group 2003) 13:17, p. 3-3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Further, Business and Professions Code section 17200 has been applied in the employment context. In <em>Cortez v. Purolator Air Filtration Products Co. </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 163 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 518, 999 P.2d 706], the Supreme Court held unlawfully withheld overtime wages may be recovered as restitution in a UCL action. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 173.) The failure to pay statutorily mandated overtime wages constitutes unfair competition in that an employer which fails to pay overtime wages gains an unfair advantage over its competitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">By a parity of reasoning, age discrimination likewise implicates unfair competition. It is self-evident that older workers, who have worked their way up the ranks, frequently are more highly compensated than their younger colleagues. Thus, an employer that practices age discrimination may have an unfair competitive edge over employers that comply with the FEHA. Therefore, an employer which engages in age discrimination in violation of the FEHA is subject to a prohibitory injunction under the UCL.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">For these reasons, the trial court properly enjoined Nestl\u00e9 under the UCL from engaging in age discrimination in violation of FEHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">[[3. <em>No merit to Nestl\u00e9\u2019s contentions relating to the denial of its motion for new trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">[[Herr\u2019s Cross-appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>[[Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">[[Discussion]]<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The judgment, the order denying the motion for JNOV, and the order awarding attorney fees to Herr, are affirmed.
