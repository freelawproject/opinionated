Since then she has had frequent seizures, the number and intensity of which are poorly controlled by medication; all the treating and examining doctors agree that she has a chronic or primary seizure disorder. Plaintiffs\u2019 experts have submitted reports finding a causal relationship between the DPT immunization and the seizure disorder. Defendants\u2019 expert reports assert that DPT vaccine does not cause seizure disorders; as stated in one of those reports, \u201cthe role of DPT ... is that it <em>reveals </em>the [seizure] disorder, but has no role in causation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">Defendants have given notice that they intend to present testimony at trial <em>from </em>three physicians who had been consulted in Jessica\u2019s treatment between 1987 and 1991, Dr. Abraham Chutori-an, Dr. Jeffrey Buchhalter and Dr. Joseph Schneider. In their consultations, all three doctors had prepared written reports describing their findings, diagnoses and recommendations for treatment and for diagnostic studies. With respect to the cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>the seizure disorder, Dr. Chutorian reported that the history and findings \u201care not compatible with a pertussis encephalopathy <em>[ie., </em>brain disease]\u201d; Dr. Buchhalter reported that \u201c[t]he etiology is unclear\u201d; Dr. Schneider reported that Jessica\u2019s condition \u201cis not consistent with a pertussis encephalopathy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">In anticipation of trial, defendants took videotaped <em>de bene esse </em>depositions (R. 4:14-9) of Drs. Chutorian and Buchhalter, in which counsel explored the doctors\u2019 opinions as to the causes of Jessica\u2019s disorder. Dr. Chutorian testified that the scientific literature discloses \u201ca controversial question\u201d as to whether DPT vaccine causes any encephalopathy, with some investigators doubting that DPT encephalopathy \u201cexists at all\u201d and others finding it as a \u201crare occurrence, occurring maybe ... between 1 in 200 and 1 in 250 thousand children who are immunized.\u201d Dr. Chutorian did not state his own position, if any, in that controversy. He testified, however, that diagnoses of DPT encephalopathy are commonly based on findings of \u201coverwhelming\u201d disease immediately following a DPT shot; Jessica\u2019s seizure disorder, he said, was \u201cin no way\u201d of that kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">In his deposition, Dr. Buchhalter made similar references to the conflicting medical literature. He stated his own view that \u201cthere is no convincing evidence in the medical literature that [Jessica\u2019s] kind of seizure disorder can follow DPT immunization\u201d; accordingly, in seeking to determine \u201cwhy she was having seizures,\u201d he did not consider the DPT shot as a possible cause. However, like Dr. Chutorian, he found that Jessica did not have the \u201cprofound\u201d kind of encephalopathy that the disputed literature attributed to DPT vaccine.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">After the depositions were taken, plaintiffs moved to preclude defendants \u201cfrom making any reference at trial to the unsolicited opinions on the causation of [Jessica\u2019s] seizure disorder.\u201d They argued that (1) the asserted \u201cunsolicited opinions ... are protected from disclosure by the physicians\u2019 fiduciary duties to [Jessica],\u201d (2) because the treating physicians were not to be called to testify on plaintiffs\u2019 behalf concerning causation, their opinions should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>available to defendants only upon a showing of \u201cexceptional need\u201d and (3) the causation testimony of the treating physicians would be \u201cunduly prejudicial and should be excluded under <em>Evid.R. 4 </em>[now <em>N.J.R.E. </em>403].\u201d The motion judge granted the requested relief, reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-6\">But we start with a premise that these are treating physicians or should be in a category of treating physicians. They\u2019re not experts. And the general rule is that the treating physician should not be\u2014is not allowed to render opinions that would be harmful to a patient\u2019s case; that that obligation is owed by a physician to his patient. And I think that that\u2019s the rule that ought to pertain here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">The jury is not being precluded from all the opinions are the same opinions that these doctors held and expressed in the depositions. They\u2019re going to get those opinions. They\u2019re going to get them from experts called by the defendant. Defendant obviously feels, and I concur, that those opinions would be much more impression [sic] or affect the jury to a greater degree if they came from the plaintiff\u2019s own treating physicians rather than what he describes as hired guns. But the fact is that the information is going to be given to the jury and they\u2019re going to have it and they\u2019re going to be able to weigh it. And it seems to me that the plaintiff would be unduly prejudiced if I were to permit the physicians to render their opinions which would seriously affect the theory of the plaintiffs case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">That analysis is flawed. <em>There is no </em>\u201cgeneral rule\u201d <em>that </em>a treating physician \u201cis not allowed to render opinions that would be harmful to a patient\u2019s case.\u201d Our case law does recognize a plaintiffs legitimate interest in assuring that his or her physician \u201cwill not voluntarily provide evidence or testimony that will assist the defendant\u2019s cause.\u201d <em>Stempler v. Speidell, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>368, 381, 495 <em>A.</em>2d 857 (1985) (citing with approval <em>Alexander v. Knight, </em>197 <em>Pa.Super. </em>79, 177 A.2d 142, 146 (1962) (noting that a treating doctor owes \u201ca duty to refuse affirmative assistance to the patient\u2019s antagonist in litigation\u201d)). <em>See also Serrano v. Levitsky, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>454, 521 A.2d 1377 (Law Div.1986) (holding that \u201can unsolicited opinion\u201d in the report of plaintiffs treating physician exculpating the defendant doctor is not admissible against plaintiff); <em>Piller v. Kovarsky, 194 N.J.Super. 392, 476 </em>A.2d 1279 (Law Div.1984) (barring treating physician from testifying as defense liability expert that defendant physician was not negligent); <em>cf. Graham v. Gielchinsky, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>361, 373, 599 A.2d 149 (1991) (noting that \u201cin the absence of exceptional circumstances ... courts should not allow the opinion testimony of an expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>originally consulted by an adversary\u201d). But a plaintiffs treating doctors can testify, and can be compelled by subpoena to testify, for a defendant \u201cconcerning their physical examinations and diagnoses of plaintiff.\u201d <em>Spedick v. Murphy, </em>266 <em>N.J.Super. </em>573, 592, 630 A.2d 355 (App.Div.1993); <em>see also Kurdek v. West Orange Educ. Bd., </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>218, 536 A.2d 332 (Law Div.1987) (permitting defendant to call plaintiffs treating physician to state his prognosis of no permanency).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Plaintiffs here accept that Drs. Chutorian, Buchhalter and Schneider are \u201ctreating physicians\u201d and that their testimony is not subject to the physician-patient privilege. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-22.4; <em>Kurdek, </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 224, 536 A.2d 332. And plaintiffs do not dispute defendants\u2019 right to call the treating doctors to testify concerning their examinations, findings, diagnoses, recommended treatments and prognoses. Plaintiffs contend, however, that the doctors\u2019 conclusions as to etiology\u2014whether Jessica\u2019s seizure disorder was caused by DPT vaccine\u2014should be out of bounds. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Each of the three doctors was consulted in Jessica\u2019s treatment. Each submitted a report directly to Jessica\u2019s primary treating physician. Each report set forth not only the doctor\u2019s findings and diagnosis, but his assessment of the causation of Jessica\u2019s seizure disorder. Those opinions of causation were not unrelated to the treatment, unnecessary, volunteered or unsolicited. The deposition testimony makes abundantly clear that the appropriate management of a seizure disorder requires assessment of its nature, severity and cause. Dr. Buchhalter, for example, testified that certain medications are particularly effective where \u201cone particular spot in the brain,\u201d such as a tumor or a stroke, can be identified as the cause of seizures, but where the abnormality appears \u201cin multiple places in the brain\u201d then other medications as well as diet are \u201cmore useful.\u201d Both Dr. Buchhalter and Dr. Chutorian stated that a DPT encephalopathy would involve not only seizure activity but such severe symptoms as loss of motor control, mental retardation, stupor, and frequent refractory sei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>zures; a finding of the presence or absence of DPT encephalopathy would surely impact on both diagnosis and treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">We therefore see no reason to distinguish the doctors\u2019 testimony as to causation and their testimony as to diagnoses and prognoses. All arise out of and are inextricably linked to Jessica\u2019s treatment. Defendants are entitled to elicit that relevant and material evidence from the treating physicians. That defendants could obtain similar testimony from their retained experts does not justify foreclosing them from inquiring of the treating doctors. If the testimony of the treating doctors is harmful to plaintiffs, it is not unfairly so. <em>See Spedick, </em>266 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 592, 630 A.2d 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Paragraph 2 of the April 19, 1993 order is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b405-11\">The vaccine protects against diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough) and tetanus; alleged adverse reactions are commonly laid to the pertussis component. <em>See generally Niemiera </em>v. <em>Schneider, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>550, 555 A.2d 1112 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
