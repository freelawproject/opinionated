His principal contention is that his right to confrontation was violated by admission of his codefend-ant\u2019s hearsay statement blaming him for the killing. Defendant further claims that this error was compounded by the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>failure to provide the jury with any guidance concerning how it was to consider his incriminatory statements. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Although the evidence of guilt was substantial, we are constrained to reverse defendant\u2019s convictions. We hold that the trial court committed error of constitutional dimension when it admitted evidence relating to a non-testifying codefendant\u2019s confession directly inculpating the defendant in the crimes charged. We also conclude that the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury were faulty in various particulars. Our review of the record convinces us that defendant was deprived of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">On January 19, 1989, Sara Pharo\u2019s lifeless body was found embedded in the sand on a beach located in Carneys Point Township. The police were immediately summoned. From a clearing in the grass approximately 70 feet from the body, the police recovered a log bearing traces of blood consistent with the victim\u2019s blood type. Nearby, the police later discovered a \u201cno trespassing\u201d sign lying in the water.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">Although it was apparent that Pharo\u2019s body had been submerged beneath the waters of the Delaware River for some time, the cause of death was not drowning. Instead, the evidence disclosed that the victim had been badly beaten and had died as a result of the injuries inflicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">The State\u2019s two experts differed respecting the precise cause of Pharo\u2019s death. Dr. Robert Breckenridge, a board certified pathologist employed by the Salem County Medical Examiner\u2019s office, concluded that, despite the numerous injuries inflicted on the victim, it was a single blow by a \u201crather sharp instrument! ]\u201d that deeply lacerated her scalp and caused a fracture of the base of the skull, followed by \u201ccompression\u201d and hemorrhage of the brain, which resulted in her death. The pathologist observed that the \u201cno trespassing\u201d sign, with its sharp edges on two sides, \u201ccould very well have been the instrument causing the laceration of the scalp and [the] fracture of the skull.\u201d He added that the log and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>various rocks found near the victim\u2019s body did not have sharp edges and could not have been the instrument that inflicted the fatal blow.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">\u25a0 Dr. Ronald Suarez, an Assistant State Medical Examiner, agreed with Dr. Breckenridge that Pharo\u2019s body evidenced a skull fracture with \u201csubtentorial hemorrhage[,]\u201d but was \u201cunable to [conclude]\u201d that the blow causing that injury resulted in death. Instead, Dr. Suarez pointed to \u201ca half dozen blows easily identifiable as separate from each other\u201d and concluded that \u201c[t]he accumulation of all the injuries caused [the victim] to die.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Pharo, a 13 year old eighth grade student who resided with her parents and brother, was last seen alive by her mother at approximately 5:30 p.m. on January 17, 1989. Shortly after the victim\u2019s body was discovered, the police investigation focused upon the defendant who was then 15 years old and resided in the same apartment complex as the victim. Defendant had confided to a friend, Jose Hernandez, that Pharo was rumored to be pregnant and he the father. On the next day, defendant\u2019s mother, in Hernandez\u2019s presence, asked defendant to summon Pharo in order to discuss her purported pregnancy. According to Hernandez, while walking to Pharo\u2019s apartment, defendant \u201cstarted breaking down.\u201d Defendant told Hernandez that he and Matthew Vincent had killed the victim. Defendant said that \u201cthey [had] hit her with a stick\u201d and had left her on the beach. Hernandez accompanied defendant to the river, but they were unable to find Pharo\u2019s body due to the rising tide. Defendant exclaimed that he would \u201cprobably kill himself\u2019 if he were sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Defendant and Vincent were apprehended on January 19, 1989. Lieutenant Dennis Sample of the Salem County Prosecutor\u2019s office interviewed defendant at the Carneys Point Police Department on that date. Also present were the defendant\u2019s mother and several law enforcement officers. Sample advised defendant of his constitutional rights. Both defendant and his mother acknowledged their understanding of these rights by signing the back of a <em>Miranda </em>card. Before commencing the interrogation, Sample <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>told defendant that he had previously interviewed Vincent and that Vincent had blamed the defendant for most of the violence. Defendant then gave the police an oral statement which was subsequently repeated and tape recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">In his statement, defendant vividly described the brutal beating inflicted upon the victim. Defendant recounted that Vincent had arranged to meet Pharo at the baseball field near the highway. Defendant was somewhat evasive concerning the purpose of the meeting. At one point, defendant admitted that earlier that day he and Vincent had planned to kill the victim. Later in his statement, defendant equivocated, noting that Vincent said Pharo was pregnant and that he was going to \u201churt her.\u201d Defendant claimed that he agreed to participate in the killing because he believed Vincent was merely \u201cjoking.\u201d In any event, the two met Pharo at the baseball field and chased her to the river. According to defendant\u2019s account, Vincent struck the victim\u2019s head with a rock approximately the size of a \u201csoftball.\u201d Both defendant and Vincent repeatedly hit the victim with a stick and a \u201cclub\u201d that they found on the beach. Each time Vincent \u201cpicked [the victim] up\u201d defendant would \u201ckick[] her.\u201d When Pharo fell into the water, defendant and Vincent rolled up their trousers and waded into the river so that they could \u201cchoke[] her\u201d and \u201chold[] her down.\u201d They held the victim under water and, after she stopped kicking, dragged her on to the beach where Vincent struck the victim with a sign post. Defendant recounted how Vincent picked up the \u201cno trespassing\u201d sign and shouted that he was \u201cgonna bash [the victim\u2019s] head open\u201d with it. Defendant claimed that he turned away at that point and did not actually observe the blow inflicted upon the victim. Vincent also applied pressure to her throat by pressing the sign post into her neck, face and chest. The victim\u2019s eyes \u201crolled back in her head\u201d and she appeared \u201ccursed.\u201d The two then fled the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Because of inconsistencies in their accounts of the incident, Sample decided to interview defendant and Vincent together. Sample testified that the two \u201cjok[ed] with each other about how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>they had killed [the victim] [and] how her eyes had rolled back\u201d into her head. Following this joint interview, Vincent gave an additional statement in which he \u201cadmitted to being more involved in the violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">At trial, defendant\u2019s tape recorded statement was played before the jury. In addition, Sample briefly described his joint interview with defendant and Vincent. Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, Sample testified that prior to questioning the defendant, he apprised him that Vincent had given a statement blaming him for the killing. Sample was also permitted to testify that before interviewing defendant and Vincent jointly, he told the boys and their mothers that there were \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in their statements and that \u201cMatthew was blaming most of the violence on Pedro.\u201d No limiting instruction was given to the jury concerning Vincent\u2019s statement inculpating the defendant. So too, the trial court failed to instruct the jury respecting its consideration of defendant\u2019s confession. We will deal with these points later in oui1 opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Juvenile delinquency complaints were filed against both defendant and Vincent. On April 16, 1990, the Family Part ordered that defendant be tried as an adult. Several days later, defendant, who had been detained in the Cumberland County Juvenile Detention Center for more than a year, attempted to escape. He was apprehended shortly thereafter. Testimony relating to defendant\u2019s unsuccessful attempt to flee was presented at trial as evidence of consciousness of guilt. It is against this backdrop that we consider the arguments advanced by defendant on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">We first consider the contention that the trial court erred by admitting testimony relating to Vincent\u2019s statement in which he placed most of the blame for the killing on the defendant. We hold that admission of this evidence violated defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation and New Jersey\u2019s common law.</p>\n<p id=\"AT6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Our analysis begins with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s prescription that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him[.]\u201d <em>U.S. Const. </em>amend. VI. This right is secured for defendants in state as well as federal criminal proceedings. <em>Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 <em>U.S. </em>400, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965). The primary interest advanced by the Confrontation Clause is the right of cross-examination. <em>Kentucky v. Stincer, </em>482 <em>U.S. </em>730, 736, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>2658, 2662, 96 L.Ed.2d 631, 641 (1987) (quoting <em>Douglas v. Alabama, </em>380 <em>U.S. </em>415, 418, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>1074, 1076, 13 L.Ed.2d 934, 937 (1965)). The opportunity for cross-examination has been characterized as the \u201c\u2018greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth!,]\u2019 \u201d <em>California v. Green, </em>399 <em>U.S. </em>149, 158, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>1930, 1935, 26 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>489, 497 (1970) (quoting 5 <em>Wigmore on Evidence </em>\u00a7 1367 (3d ed. 1940)), and is \u201ccritical for ensuring the integrity of the fact-finding process!,]\u201d <em>Kentucky v. Stincer, </em>482 <em>U.S. </em>at 736, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2662, 96 L.Ed.2d at 641. Cross-examination affords the accused an opportunity to test the recollection and sift the conscience of the witness. <em>Mattox v. United States, </em>156 <em>U.S. </em>237, 242, 15 <em>S.Ct. </em>337, 339, 39 <em>L.Ed. </em>409, 411 (1895). It also compels the witness to stand face to face with the jury in order that it may observe him, and judge by his demeanor upon the stand and the manner in which he gives his testimony whether he is worthy of belief. <em>Id. </em>at 242-43, 15 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 339, 39 <em>L.Ed. </em>at 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The United States Supreme Court has long recognized that the truth finding function of the Confrontation Clause \u201cis uniquely threatened when an accomplice\u2019s confession is sought to be introduced against a criminal defendant without the benefit of cross-examination.\u201d <em>Lee v. Illinois, </em>476 <em>U.S. </em>530, 541, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>2056, 2062, 90 L.Ed.2d 514, 526 (1986). Such a confession is fraught with all of the dangers of inaccuracy which characterize hearsay generally. <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 <em>U.S. </em>123, 141, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1620, 1630, 20 L.Ed.2d 476, 488 (1968) (White, J., dissenting). The out-of-court statements of a codefendant \u201chave traditionally been viewed with special suspicion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 141, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1631, 20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>L.Ed.2d at 488. Not only are such incriminations devastating to the defendant, but their credibility is inevitably suspect. <em>Id. </em>at 136, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1628, 20 L.Ed.2d at 485. \u201cDue to his strong motivation to implicate the defendant and to exonerate himself, a codefendant\u2019s statements about what the defendant said or did are less credible than ordinary hearsay evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 141, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1631, 20 L.Ed.2d at 488 (White, J., dissenting). The unreliability of such evidence is intolerably compounded when the alleged accomplice does not testify and cannot be tested by cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>at 136, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1628, 20 L.Ed.2d at 485. \u201cIt was against such threats to a fair trial that the Confrontation Clause was directed.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The rule is thus well settled that a codefendant\u2019s untested statement inculpating the defendant may not be introduced against the accused. <em>Lee v. Illinois, </em>476 <em>U.S. </em>at 546, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2065, 90 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 530. Moreover, in <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 <em>U.S. </em>123, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 the Court observed that, because of the devastating prejudice inherent in the introduction of such evidence, an instruction that one defendant\u2019s confession containing inculpatory references to another had evidential value solely against the confessing defendant did not sufficiently safeguard the other defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. <em>Id. </em>at 126, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1622, 20 L.Ed.2d at 479.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Our Supreme Court has taken a parallel course in protecting the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation under New Jersey\u2019s common law. <em>See State v. Maristany, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>299, 309, 627 A.2d 1066 (1993); <em>State v. Manning, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>417, 421-22, 413 A.2d 605 (1980); <em>State v. Young, </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>152, 156-57, 215 A.2d 352 (1965); <em>State v. Colon, </em>246 <em>N.J.Super. </em>608, 612, 588 A.2d 440 (App.Div.1991); cf<em>. State v. Gross, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>1, 11, 577 A.2d 806 (1990). Indeed, it can fairly be said that the Court has been more protective of the defendant\u2019s right to cross-examine than its federal counterpart. Several years before the United States Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncement in <em>Bruton, </em>our Court held that an out-of-court confession of one defendant could not be used against the other and that a limiting instruction would not suffice to eradicate the potential for prejudice as to the non-confessing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>defendant. <em>State v. Young, </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>at 157, 215 A.2d 352. More recently, the Court refused to follow the course taken by the United States Supreme Court and carve out an exception to this rule in cases of \u201cinterlocking confessions.\u201d <em>Compare Parker v. Randolph, </em>442 <em>U.S. 62, </em>99 <em>S.Ct. </em>2132, 60 L.Ed.2d 713 (1979) <em>with State v. Haskell, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>469, 478-79, 495 A.2d 1341 (1985). Our Court\u2019s decision foreshadowed the United States Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent change in which it rejected the exception it had created earlier. <em>Cruz v. New York, </em>481 <em>U.S. </em>186, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>1714, 95 L.Ed.2d 162 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Admission of Lieutenant Sample\u2019s testimony relating to Vincent\u2019s statement incriminating the defendant clearly violated La-boy\u2019s right of confrontation under the Federal Constitution and New Jersey\u2019s common law. Vincent\u2019s declaration that defendant was primarily at fault constituted rank hearsay, carrying no guaranty of testimonial trustworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">We find no merit in the State\u2019s claim that Vincent\u2019s declaration was not offered to prove the truth of its contents, but instead was introduced merely to show what prompted defendant to confess. <em>See Evid.R. </em>63 (now <em>N.J.R.E. </em>801(c) and 802). This contention is largely disingenuous. The voluntariness of defendant\u2019s confession was not seriously contested at trial. Moreover, this is not a case in which a defendant who is subjected to custodial interrogation suddenly changes a prior exculpatory account when faced with damning evidence provided by an accomplice. From the record before us, it appears that defendant confessed immediately after being apprised of and waiving his constitutional rights. The record does not disclose that Vincent\u2019s statement had any material impact upon defendant\u2019s decision to give a confession concerning the events resulting in the victim\u2019s death. Further, Sample testified that he apprised defendant of the gist of Vincent\u2019s statement both before and after Laboy confessed. It cannot fairly be argued that Vincent\u2019s statement in any way triggered defendant\u2019s confession. In any event, the prosecutor in his summation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>referred to Vincent\u2019s statement without any attempt to confine his remarks to the question of voluntariness.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Beyond this, the purpose for which the State introduced Sample\u2019s testimony relating to Vincent\u2019s declaration of defendant\u2019s guilt is irrelevant in view of the absence of an instruction precluding the jury from considering the evidence as proof that the statement was true. Without a sufficient limiting instruction, the testimony contained obvious hearsay consisting essentially of Vincent\u2019s assertion that defendant was primarily responsible for Pharo\u2019s death. That statement possessed all the invidious attributes of hearsay. Vincent\u2019s largely exculpatory, self-serving statement plainly lacked reliability. Its effect was to incriminate defendant without affording him the opportunity to cross-examine Vincent. <em>See State v. Maristany, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>at 309, 627 A.2d 1066.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Lest we be misunderstood, we hasten to add our view that a limiting instruction would not have sufficed to eradicate the prejudice emanating from admission of Vincent\u2019s statement. In reaching this conclusion, we recognize that a codefendant\u2019s or accomplice\u2019s out-of-court statement may be introduced for a purpose other than proving the truth of what it asserts without violating a defendant\u2019s right of confrontation. In <em>Tennessee v. Street, </em>471 <em>U.S. </em>409, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>2078, 85 L.Ed.2d 425 (1985), for example, the defendant claimed that he had been coerced by the sheriff reading an accomplice\u2019s confession and directing him to say the same thing. The trial court allowed the State to impeach this testimony by introducing the accomplice's statement which differed from defendant\u2019s confession in material respects. A carefully worded limiting instruction was given. The Supreme Court held that \u201cthere were no alternatives that would have both assured the integrity of the trial\u2019s truth-seeking function and eliminated the risk of the jury\u2019s improper use of evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 415, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2082, 85 L.Ed.2d at 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">In <em>State v. Sego, </em>266 <em>N.J.Super. </em>406, 629 A.2d 1362 (App.Div.1993), the defendant\u2019s accomplice gave two separate statements, one admitting his own guilt and exculpating the defendant, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>other placing primary responsibility on the defendant. The defense intended to introduce the statement exonerating the defendant. We upheld the trial court\u2019s decision allowing the State to discredit the accomplice\u2019s account exculpating the defendant by admitting the statement made on another occasion inculpating the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 413, 629 A.2d 1362. We said that \u201cif the State were precluded by the Confrontation Clause from using [the accomplice\u2019s] prior inconsistent statement to impeach his out-of-court statement ..., defendant would enjoy a significant strategic advantage in being able to present [only the] exculpatory [account] in hearsay form.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Under these circumstances, we were persuaded that there was a real need for admission of the accomplice\u2019s statement inculpating the defendant and we were confident that the trial court\u2019s limiting instructions would have obviated any potential for undue prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The facts here are completely different. As we noted earlier, the question of voluntariness was not seriously raised at trial and there was no sound reason requiring the admission of Vincent\u2019s declaration incriminating the defendant. This evidence had little, if any, probative value and its capacity for undue prejudice cannot seriously be questioned. <em>Evid.R. </em>4 (now <em>N.J.R.E. </em>403). It is difficult to see how the jury would give such a crucial statement limited probative effect even had a limiting instruction been given. <em>See State v. Manning, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>at 422, 413 A.2d 605. The rule that juries are presumed to follow the court\u2019s instructions is a pragmatic one, rooted less in the absolute certitude that the presumption is true than in the belief that \u201cit represents a reasonable practical accommodation of the interests of the [S]tate and the defendant in the criminal justice process.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Marsh, </em>481 <em>U.S. </em>200, 211, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>1702, 1709, 95 L.Ed.2d 176, 188 (1987). On the precise facts before us, we find the accommodation inadequate. The evidence was not relevant to any material issue and there was no need to test the validity of the thesis that juries generally follow instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>We also conclude that Sample\u2019s description of defendant\u2019s interaction with Vincent when they were jointly interviewed had the potential for prejudicing Laboy\u2019s right to a fair trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We believe that the .trial court should have redacted Vincent\u2019s part of the conversation. <em>See State v. Young, </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>at 157-58, 215 A.2d 352. On the record before us, it appears that the conversation could have been edited without destroying the contextual setting in which defendant\u2019s statement was made.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See State v. Bankston, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>263, 307 A.2d 65 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">We cannot fairly say that these errors were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Brown v. United States, </em>411 <em>U.S. </em>223, 231-32, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>1565, 1570-71, 36 L.Ed.2d 208, 215 (1973); <em>Schneble v. Florida, </em>405 <em>U.S. </em>427, 430-32, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>1056, 1059-60, 31 L.Ed.2d 340, 344-45 (1972); <em>Harrington v. California, </em>395 <em>U.S. </em>250, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284 (1969). While Vincent\u2019s statement fell far short of the type of comprehensive and detailed confession made by defendant, it nevertheless undermined La-boy\u2019s claim that he did not intend to kill the victim and that he did not administer the fatal blow. Although defendant recounted the commission of the crime in minute and grisly detail, the jury could have believed that he was attempting to minimize his involvement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>because it <em>had </em>heard testimony that Vincent at least initially blamed him for the killing. We stress that the factual question before the jury was not whether defendant participated in the fatal attack upon the victim. Instead, the question related to the nature and extent of his involvement. The jury\u2019s inquiry required it to focus on the defendant\u2019s conduct and state of mind. <em>See State v. Bielkiewicz, </em>267 <em>N.J.Super. </em>520, 528-29, 632 A.2d 277 (App.Div.1993) (quoting <em>State v. Bridges, </em>254 <em>N.J.Super. </em>541, 562-66, 604 A.2d 131 (App.Div.1992), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>447, 628 A.2d 270 (1993)). The prosecution contended that defendant either himself inflicted the fatal blow while harboring the requisite culpability state for murder or that he purposely caused death through the instrumentality of his accomplice. The minds of an average jury might well have found the State\u2019s case significantly less persuasive had the testimony relating to Vincent\u2019s statement been excluded. We observe in that respect that this was defendant\u2019s second trial. At the first trial, Vincent\u2019s statement was admitted but the trial court gave a limiting instruction. The trial was aborted when the jury could not reach a verdict. There is thus the strong probability that the erroneously admitted evidence coupled with the lack of a limiting instruction tipped the scale against the defendant. That probability undermines our confidence in the jury\u2019s verdict. We conclude that the errors committed had the clear capacity to lead to an unjust result.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">We now turn to the trial court\u2019s instructions. Initially, we note that the court\u2019s charge did not contain any reference to defendant\u2019s custodial statement. In <em>State v. Hampton, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>250, 294 A.2d 23 (1972), our Supreme Court held that the jury must be apprised of its duty to \u201cdecide whether in view of all [of the] circumstances the defendant\u2019s confession is true.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 272, 294 A.2d 23. So too, the jury is to be told that \u201c[i]f [it] find[s] that it is not true, then [it] must treat it as inadmissible and disregard it for purposes of discharging fits] function as [the] fact finder[ ] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>on the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>This principle was encompassed in <em>Evid.R. </em>8(3) which mandated that the trial court \u201cshall instruct the jury that [it is] to disregard the statement if [it] find[s] that it is not credible.\u201d It now appears in <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The trial court clearly erred by failing to instruct the jury in accordance with <em>State v. Hampton, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>250, 294 A.2d 23, and <em>Evid.R. </em>8(3). The mandate in <em>Hampton </em>and the directive in the <em>Rules of Evidence </em>are designed to \u201cinsure to a defendant an unfettered factual consideration by the jury of the credibility\u201d of all or part of his confession. <em>State v. Boyle, </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>64, 74, 486 A.2d 852 (App.Div.1984) (quoting <em>State v. Bowman, </em>165 <em>N.J.Super. </em>531, 537, 398 A.2d 908 (App.Div.1979)). Nothing in the charge, taken as a whole, can be viewed as ameliorating this error. <em>State v. Nutter, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>41, 59-60, 609 A.2d 65 (App.Div.1992); <em>but see State v. Setzer, </em>268 <em>N.J.Super. </em>553, 561-564, 634 A.2d 127, 131-133 (App.Div.1993) (charge as a whole did not constitute plain error notwithstanding omission of <em>Hampton </em>instruction). Specifically, the trial court\u2019s general instructions on the question' of credibility were not sufficient to apprise the jury of its constitutional duty under <em>Hampton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Defendant points to other errors in the trial court\u2019s charge. The jury was not apprised of its duty to determine whether the State presented \u201cindependent proof of facts and circumstances which strengthened] or bolsterfed] the confession and tendfed] to generate a belief in its trustworthiness.\u201d <em>State v. DiFrisco, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>253, 273, 571 A.2d 914 (1990) (quoting <em>State v. Lucas, </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>37, 56, 152 A.2d 50 (1959)). Nor did the trial court tell the jury it was to \u201c \u2018receive, weigh and consider [Hernandez\u2019s testimony relating to defendant\u2019s oral admissions] with caution,\u2019 in view of the generally recognized risk of inaccuracy and ... misconstruction by the hearer.\u201d <em>State v. Kociolek, </em>23 <em>N.J. </em>400, 421, 129 A.2d 417 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Having said this, we note that defendant did not submit a request to charge these principles and failed to interpose a timely objection raising these points. Viewed in isolation, each of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>errors would not have the capacity to lead to an unjust result. <em>See R. </em>2:10-2. It is at least arguable, however, that \u201cin their aggregate [they] rendered the trial unfair,\u201d <em>State v. Orecchio, </em>16 <em>N.J. </em>125, 129, 106 A.2d 541 (1954), and \u201caffect[ed] [the] substantial rights of the defendant,\u201d <em>State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 337, 273 A.2d 1 (1971). In light of our disposition of defendant\u2019s first point, we need not decide the issue. We merely note these errors to insure that they will not be repeated at the retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">We need not consider defendant\u2019s remaining arguments. We merely note that the trial court did not have the benefit of <em>State v. Mann, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>410, 625 A.2d 1102 (1993) when it admitted evidence of defendant\u2019s threat of suicide and subsequent escape from custody. In a similar vein, our opinion in <em>State v. Bielkiewicz, </em>267 <em>N.J.Super. </em>520, 632 A.2d 277, which pertains to accomplice liability, was rendered after defendant\u2019s trial and convictions. These questions should be reconsidered at the retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">The judgment of convictions is reversed and the matter is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b328-10\"> Defendant was 15 years old at the time the offense was committed. His codefendant, Matthew Vincent, was also a minor. On motion of the prosecutor, the Family Part waived jurisdiction and defendant and Vincent were tried as adults. Vincent's case was severed. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-26. He ultimately pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter and conspiracy to commit aggravated assault. On the aggravated manslaughter conviction, Vincent was sentenced to a 30 year custodial term with a 15 year parole disqualifier. A concurrent 10 year sentence with a five year period of parole ineligibility was imposed on the conspiracy count.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b328-11\"> The conviction for conspiracy to commit murder should have been merged with the conviction for the substantive crime of murder. <em>See State v. Hardison, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>379, 492 A.2d 1009 (1985); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-8a(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b338-6\"> In its brief, the State asserts that Vincent\u2019s side of the conversation was admissible as substantive evidence under the adoptive admission exception to the hearsay rule. <em>See Evid.R. </em>63(8)(b) (now <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(b)(2)). This argument was not advanced in the Law Division and we decline to consider it here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b338-7\"> Of course we do not foreclose the defendant from introducing -evidence relating to Vincent\u2019s declarations against penal interest. We recognize that defendant may be compelled to adopt this course in order to ameliorate the damaging effect of his own incriminatory statements. That the defendant may face such a dilemma does not constitute an invasion of his rights. The criminal process, like the rest of the legal system, \"is replete with situations requiring 'the making of difficult judgments' as to which course to follow.\" <em>McGautha </em>v. <em>California, </em>402 <em>U.S. </em>183, 213, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>1454, 1470, 28 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>711, 729 (1971) (quoting <em>McMann v. Richardson, </em>397 <em>U.S. </em>759, 769, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>1441, 1448, 25 L.Ed.2d 763, 772 (1970)). Although a defendant may have a right to follow whichever course he adopts, \"the Constitution does not by that token always forbid requiring him to choose.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
