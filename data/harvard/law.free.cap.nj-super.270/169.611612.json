He was sentenced to five consecutive life terms. The following issues are raised on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-10\">POINT I THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING THE SUPPRESSION MOTION BECAUSE THE EXCEPTIONS IT RELIED UPON [INEVITABLE DISCOVERY, EMERGENCY AID ON EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES, ABANDONMENT] DID NOT EXCUSE OR JUSTIFY THE WAR-RANTLESS ENTRY AND SEARCHES OF THE RESIDENCE AND ITS CONTENTS THAT OCCURRED. THE SEARCHES AT ISSUE VIOLATED BOTH THE UNITED STATES AND STATE CONSTITUTIONS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-11\">POINT II TRIAL COUNSEL\u2019S FAILURE TO MOVE TO SUPPRESS EVIDENCE OBTAINED AS A RESULT OF SEARCH WARRANTS WHICH WERE BASED UPON EVIDENCE SEIZED IN THE WARRANTLESS SEARCH OF THE LIST RESIDENCE CONSTITUTES INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OP COUNSEL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-12\">POINT III THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S DECISION THAT THE LETTER FROM DEFENDANT TO HIS MINISTER WAS ADMISSIBLE VIOLATED NOT ONLY <em>EVIDENCE RULE </em>29 BUT ALSO THE FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND ART. 1 PARA. 3 AND 4 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-13\">POINT IV THE SEIZURE BY THE POLICE OF THE DEFENDANT\u2019S LETTER TO HIS PASTOR VIOLATED THE DEFENDANT\u2019S RIGHT AGAINST SELF-INCRIMINATION AS PROTECTED BY THE FIFTH AMENDMENT AND BY THE NEW JERSEY COMMON LAW PRIVILEGE AGAINST SELF-INCRIMINATION. (Not Raised Below)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-14\">POINT V THE VENUE AND MANNER OF JURY SELECTION DENIED THE DEFENDANT HIS CONSTITUTIONALLY GUARANTEED RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-15\">A. The Court Erred in Denying Defendant\u2019s Motion for a Change of Venue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>B. The Court\u2019s Failure to Excuse Jurors with Preconceived Opinions Denied the Defendant His Constitutional Right to an Impartial Jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">C.

He then proceeded to the third floor of the home where his mother lived in separate quarters. Defendant and his mother walked together to the third floor kitchen. Defendant then killed his mother by shooting her in the head from behind. He could not move the body and left it where it lay. He returned to the first floor, dragged his wife\u2019s body into the ballroom, \u201ccleaned up the mess,\u201d and ate lunch.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">After lunch, defendant went to the bank to redeem about $2,000 in savings bonds which were in his name and his mother\u2019s, to gain access to his safety deposit box, and to cash two checks. He then placed a stop order on his mail and his mother\u2019s at the post office.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">Later in the afternoon, defendant picked up his oldest child, Patricia, a high school student, took her home and killed her with a shot to the left side of the face. Defendant then picked up his son Frederick fi*om junior high school and, upon arriving home, killed Frederick with a shot to the head. Still later, when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>remaining child, John, also a junior high school student, arrived home he was killed by defendant with \u201cat least ten\u201d gun and rifle shots.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Defendant then \u201ccleaned up\u201d and moved the children\u2019s bodies into the ballroom. By telephone and through notes, defendant stopped milk and newspaper deliveries and made arrangements for the children\u2019s absences from school and other activities, as well as his own absence from work, until after Thanksgiving. He then wrote letters to several relatives and a long letter to his pastor, Rev. Rehwinkel, in order \u201cto tell somebody about what had occurred.\u201d Defendant also composed some other notes with instructions concerning funeral arrangements for his family members. He then ate supper and went to bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Early the next day, defendant packed some of his possessions and shipped them by railway express. He drove to Kennedy Airport and abandoned his car there. He then went to New York City by public transportation and commenced a circuitous trip ending in Denver, where he obtained a new Social Security card in the name of Robert Clark. He took a job as a cook and \u201ckept a low profile life,\u201d changing his appearance from time to time and avoiding any trouble. He \u201cmade sure not even to get a parking ticket,\u201d and avoided situations such as passport applications which, he believed, required fingerprinting.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">On December 7, 1971, exactly four weeks after the killings, the police were summoned to the house by concerned friends. After consulting with these friends and some neighbors who expressed particular concern for the elderly Mrs. List, defendant\u2019s mother, the police and two of the friends entered the house through the only unlocked window they found, on the side porch. The bodies were discovered, four in the ballroom and one on the third floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">Shortly thereafter, the police officer in charge of the investigation arrived. He and other police officers assisting him read a note which they found on top of a desk in the study. The note was addressed \u201cTo the finder\u201d and signed \u201cJ. List.\u201d It contained a request that the authorities be contacted. The note also said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>that the key to the desk was in an envelope addressed to defendant and that the keys to the file cabinets were in the desk. Another note on the front of a locked desk drawer was labelled \u201cguns and ammo.\u201d A police officer pried the drawer open and found two firearms and some assorted ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Notes were also attached to the two file cabinets. One attached to the middle drawer of the smaller cabinet contained the legend \u201cFor Pastor Rehwinkel, ... [defendant\u2019s employer] and administrator.\u201d The note on the larger filing cabinet contained the name of defendant\u2019s employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Inside the smaller file cabinet the police found an unsealed file folder \u201cFor Pastor Rehwinkel of the Redeemer Lutheran Church.\u201d The folder contained a five-page letter to Rev. Rehwinkel dated November 9, 1971, in which defendant confessed to killing the members of his family. The letter was not in a separate envelope. ' The folder also contained photocopied stock certificates, a checkbook and an interest computation slip. The police also found a letter in the top drawer of one of the file cabinets which was addressed: \u201cTo the administrator\u201d and a note addressed \u201cHello Burt\u201d (defendant\u2019s employer).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Some 17j\u00e9 years later, defendant was identified after the killings were depicted in a network television broadcast. He was arrested at his home in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">On a motion to suppress the evidence found during the warrantless search of the house, the trial judge held the evidence to be admissible, <em>inter alia, </em>on abandonment and inevitable discovery grounds. <em>State v. List, </em>270 <em>N.J.Super. </em>252, 636 A.2d 1097 (Law Div.1990). We are in substantial agreement with the reasoning of the trial judge in this regard. <em>See State v. Farinich, </em>179 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 6, 430 A.2d 233 (App.Div.1981), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>378, 446 A.2d 120 (1982); <em>State v. Sugar (II), </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>214, 235-40, 495 A.2d 90 (1985). <em>See also </em>1 La Fave, <em>Search and Seizure </em>\u00a7 2.6(b) (2d ed.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">Defendant\u2019s invocation of the clergy-communicant (priest-penitant) privilege is insupportable. It is clear both from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>the very terms of <em>Evid.R. </em>29 <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-23) and the history of the privilege that it protects confidential communications only. <em>Cf. </em>Note, <em>Developments In The Law\u2014Privileged Communications, </em>98 <em>Harv.L.Rev. </em>1450, 1555-1563 (1985). The letter to Rev. Rehwinkel, left for anyone to find and read, cannot be considered to have been made with a reasonable expectation of confidentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Defendant contends that he was denied due process when the trial judge declined to excuse certain jurors for cause, requiring defendant to exercise peremptory challenges. In all instances the jurors had indicated either in their <em>pre-voir dire </em>questionnaires or on <em>voir dire </em>itself that, based upon information gained from news reports when the victims were discovered, from time to time in the interim, or more recently when defendant was apprehended, they had formed opinions that defendant was guilty. In careful questioning, the judge elicited an expression of understanding from each of these jurors that guilt was to be determined on the evidence alone and that predispositions were to be put aside. In each instance the juror being interrogated indicated his or her willingness and ability to do so and to be governed by the presumption of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">The manner in which these aspects of <em>voir dire </em>was conducted comported fully with the requirements of <em>State v. Williams (II), </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>393, 428-436, 550 A.2d 1172 (1988). Each such instance of denial of defendant\u2019s application to disqualify a juror for cause was based on the trial judge\u2019s reasoned evaluation that the juror could function free of bias or predisposition. Determinations of this type are within the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>State v. Carroll, </em>256 <em>N.J.Super. </em>575, 607 A.2d 1003 (App.Div.) <em>certif. denied, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>18, 611 A.2d 656 (1992). We discern no abuse of discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Defendant also argues that the imposition of five consecutive life sentences violated the guidelines established in <em>State v. Yarbough, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>627, 643-44, 498 A.2d 1239 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>1014, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1193, 89 L.Ed.2d 308 (1986). We are unpersuaded that the trial judge erred in identifying, evaluating, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>or applying the aggravating and mitigating factors. Defendant emphasizes that criterion of <em>Yarbough </em>which provides</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-5\">there should be an overall outer limit on the cumulation of consecutive sentences for multiple offenses not to exceed the sum of the longest term ... that could be imposed for the two most serious offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">We regard this ease as falling within the permitted exception to the rule. <em>Id. </em>at 647, 498 A.2d 1239. The killings, although related in defendant\u2019s mind, were predominantly independent of each other. Each was committed at a different time on successive victims in separate circumstances. <em>State v. Louis, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>250, 566 A.2d 511 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">We regard the issues raised in Points II, IV, V A and C, VI and VII to be clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
