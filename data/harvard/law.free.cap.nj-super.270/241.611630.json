We reverse the judgment entered in favor of Jake Marble, but affirm the judgment entered in favor of Travelers.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">The following facts are not in dispute. On June 21, 1991, plaintiff Gerald Daus<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and defendant Jake Marble were employed by Englewood Tire Warehouse and were on their employer\u2019s premises. Defendant Dane Marble, Jake Marble\u2019s 11 year old son, was also on the premises. Jake Marble apparently brought Dane to work that day to \u201cbabysit\u201d him.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">Daus was in the process of handing out keys to the company truck drivers when he was struck by a stack of pallets that were pushed into him by a forklift truck operated by Dane Marble. Daus contends that he received injuries as a result of that accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">Daus\u2019s complaint alleges that Dane operated the forklift truck in a negligent manner. He further contends that Jake Marble \u201cdid not properly supervise his son,\u201d and \u201cnegligently permitted or allowed him to [operate] the hi-lo forklift truck[.]\u201d The Marbles instituted a third-party action against Travelers contending that Travelers owed them a defense and indemnity under a homeowners insurance policy. Travelers answered the third-party complaint and subsequently moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the Travelers policy did not apply to bodily injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>\u201carising out of the ... use ... of motor vehicles or all other motorized land conveyances.\u201d As to Jake Marble, Travelers further contended that the policy did not cover bodily injury \u201carising out of business pursuits of an insured.\u201d On the return date of the summary judgment motion, the Law Division judge, <em>sua sponte, </em>requested the parties to brief the question of whether plaintiffs complaint against Jake Marble was barred by the fellow servant rule found in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">On the adjourned date of the motion, the judge concluded that the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-8 barred plaintiffs suit against Jake Marble. He further found that a forklift vehicle was a \u201cmotorized land conveyance[ ],\u201d within the meaning of the policy and entered summary judgment in favor of Travelers. The judge did not address the additional theory advanced by Travelers that coverage was precluded by the \u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Plaintiff appeals from both judgments. Defendants Marble have not filed a separate appeal from the summary judgment entered in favor of Travelers. However, they join plaintiff, who claims that genuine issues of fact were presented on the coverage issue, in the appeal against Travelers.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">We first address the issue of whether the trial judge erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Jake Marble based upon the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8. The statute, in pertinent part, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-10\">If an injury or death is compensable under this article, a person shall not be liable to anyone at common law or otherwise on account of such injury or death for any act or omission occurring while such person was in the same employ as the person injured or killed, except for intentional wrong. <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">Shortly after the statute was enacted in 1961, the Supreme Court had this to say about its purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-12\">Reflecting the commonly-held view that the enterprise should be the final repository of the inevitable risk of loss, the Legislature recently provided that an employee shall not be liable for negligent injury of a co-employee entitled to workmen\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>compensation benefits, <em>L. </em>1961, <em>c. </em>2, amending <em>R.S. </em>34:15-8. <em>[Eule v. Eule Motor Sales, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>537, 541, 170 A.2d 241 (1961).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">In order for the statute to apply as a bar to a suit against a co-employee, three conditions must be satisfied: (1) the plaintiff must have suffered a compensable injury; (2) the plaintiff and defendant must have been co-employees; and (3) the defendant must have been acting \u201cin the course of his employment.\u201d <em>Wunschel v. City of Jersey City, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>651, 659, 477 A.2d 329 (1984) (citing <em>Konitch v. Hartung, </em>81 <em>N.J.Super. </em>376, 379, 195 A.2d 649 [1963]). In this case it is clear that the first two conditions have been satisfied. Unquestionably, plaintiffs alleged injury arose out of and in the course of his employment with Englewood Tire Warehouse. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-7. It is also undisputed that plaintiff and defendant Jake Marble were co-employees. The trial judge\u2019s analysis, however, went astray when he observed that the sole issue was \u201cwhether or not the plaintiff was injured or <em>plaintiff\u2019s </em>injury arose out of or in the course of his employment.\u201d The focal issue, as all parties appear to agree on appeal, is whether Jake Marble was also in the course of his employment during the time the alleged negligent conduct occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Plaintiff contends that Jake Marble was not in the course of his employment at the critical time. His argument, succinctly stated, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">By bringing his son to work and baby-sitting he was not fulfilling a duty of his employment nor can it be tied into the employment relationship. Defendant was not doing something incidental to his employment. Since bringing his son to work was strictly of a personal nature, such activity withdraws him from the course of his employment. This conduct was nothing more than an unreasonable personal activity not within the course of Iris employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Jake Marble and Travelers simply argue in a conelusory way, without any case law support, that Jake Marble was in the course of his employment at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">Conduct leading up to an accident occurs in the course of the employment</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-10\">if it occurs while the employee is doing what a man so employed may reasonably do within a time during which he is employed and at a place where he may reasonably be during the time to do that thing. <em>[Coleman v. Cycle Transformer Corp., </em>105 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number><em>N.J. </em>285, 289, 520 A.2d 1341 (1986) (quoting <em>Rafferty v. Dairymen\u2019s League Cooperative Ass</em>\u2019n, 16 <em>N.J.Misc. </em>363, 200 A. 493 (Dep\u2019t of Labor, Workmen\u2019s Comp. Bureau, 1938).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Clearly, Jake Marble\u2019s allegedly negligent conduct occurred during work hours and on his employer\u2019s premises. The only question remaining is whether he was doing what \u201ca man so employed may reasonably do\u201d at that time and place. <em>Ibid. </em>Plaintiffs contention that Jake Marble was not acting in the course of his employment simply because babysitting his son was a \u201cpersonal\u201d activity is not sufficient to overcome the defense. Conduct may be in the course of the employment if it occurs in the workplace and during work time if \u201cthe employee was engaged in personally motivated, but customary, or reasonably expectable activities.\u201d <em>Mikkelsen v. N.L. Industries, </em>72 <em>N.J. </em>209, 212, 370 A.2d 5 (1977); <em>Coleman, supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 289, 520 A.2d 1341. Closely allied with that concept is the \u201cmutual benefit\u201d doctrine, which permits a determination that certain activities are in the course of employment even if they were \u201cother than those which an employee was hired to perform\u201d where it can be said that \u201ca clear and substantial benefit\u201d has enured to the employer by reason of the permitted activity. <em>Mikkelsen, supra, </em>72 <em>N.J. </em>at 213, 370 A.2d 5. At oral argument, plaintiff rejected the notion that what the employer knew, permitted or condoned in this context was relevant to the inquiry of whether Jake Marble was in the course of his employment at the time in question. However, it is clear to us that such an inquiry is not only relevant but critical to the determination of whether the defense asserted by Jake Marble is viable.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">We thus conclude that there were insufficient facts before the trial judge to determine whether Jake Marble\u2019s decision to babysit his son on the job, though personally motivated, was, nonetheless, undertaken with such frequency and without objection that it became \u201ccustomary, or reasonably expectable\u201d from the standpoint of the employer. <em>Id. </em>at 212, 370 A.2d 5. We cannot lose sight of the fact that the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8 constitute a defense, and it is the defendant\u2019s burden to exclude genuine issues of fact before obtaining a summary judgment based upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>the statute. Marble\u2019s appellate brief, without any certification in support of the allegation, states: \u201cDane Marble had been present at the worksite on many previous occasions and had, in fact, on many previous occasions operated one or other of the fork lifts and was familiar with and experienced in the operation of the fork lifts.\u201d That bare allegation is insufficient to establish the conclusion as a matter of law that Dane\u2019s presence on the job site from the standpoint of the employer was such that it became \u201ccustomary,\u201d and by reason thereof Jake was involved in \u201creasonably expectable activities\u201d when he was babysitting Dane on the date in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Thus, we reverse the summary judgment entered in favor of Jake Marble and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Summary judgment was granted in favor of Travelers in reliance on Section II Exclusion l.e.(l) which states that, personal liability coverage does not apply to bodily injury \u201carising out of: (1) the ... use ... of motor vehicles or all other motorized land conveyances ... operated by ... an \u2018insured\u2019[.]\u201d Focusing solely on defendant Jake Marble, plaintiff contends that the allegations of the complaint were not based upon his use of a motor vehicle or other motorized land conveyance. Rather, plaintiff contends that because the complaint against Jake Marble alleges that his negligent supervision of his son was a proximate cause of plaintiffs injury, the claim is dependent upon conduct separate from the actual driving of the forklift. Plaintiff contends that his argument is supported by <em>Salem Group v. Oliver, </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>265, 271, 590 A.2d 1194 (App.Div.1991), <em>aff'd, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>1, 607 A.2d 138 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">In <em>Salem Group, </em>the insured provided both alcoholic beverages and an all-terrain vehicle to his minor nephew, Carl Oliver. The homeowner\u2019s insurer, Salem Group, denied coverage to the insured relying on an exclusion in its policy worded similarly to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>exclusion in the Traveler\u2019s policy in this case. The Law Division judge denied the insurer\u2019s motion for summary judgment. This court affirmed. The insurer appealed as of right to the Supreme Court because of a dissent in the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">In affirming the majority decision, the Supreme Court made it clear that the question of coverage for the insured turned on the peculiar facts of the case and the nature of the coverage afforded the insured. The fifth count of the complaint clearly alleged social host liability against the insured for supplying alcoholic beverages to Oliver. With respect to that count and the homeowners\u2019s policy, the Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">No one disputes that insurers are generally obligated to defend their insureds on social host claims. The critical question is whether the insurer can avoid that obligation because a <em>separate excluded risk, </em>the operation of an all-terrain vehicle (ATV), constitutes ari <em>additional </em>cause of the injury. We find that the insurer remains obligated to defend the covered risk. It may not avoid that obligation simply because the operation of an ATV constitutes <em>an additional </em>cause of the injury. <em>[Salem Group, supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 3, 607 A.2d 138 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">The Supreme Court specifically distinguished cases, such as <em>Salem Group, </em>where the insured\u2019s liability for personal injuries can be premised on a theory wholly independent of negligent supervision involving an automobile <em>(ie., </em>social host liability), from those cases, such as <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Moraca, </em>244 <em>N.J.Super. </em>5, 581 A.2d 510 (App.Div.1990), where the plaintiffs theory of liability is based solely on the insured\u2019s failure to exercise sufficient control and supervision over a child in the operation of a motor vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 5, 581 A.2d 510. In the latter cases, the Supreme Court recognized the justification for excluding coverage under the homeowners policy to the parent because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">[tjthe negligent entrustment or supervision cannot be isolated from the ownership and operation of the insured automobile. In contrast, the serving of alcohol to a minor does not depend on the insured\u2019s ownership of a motor vehicle or its entrustment to another. One need not own a motor vehicle to serve alcohol to another. <em>[Salem Group, supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 5, 607 A.2d 138.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">In <em>Moraca, supra, </em>a negligent supervision claim was made against the insured, Yodice, for injuries caused by the alleged reckless driving of her son, Daniel. <em>Id. </em>244 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 7, 581 A.2d 510. Allstate denied coverage based on its exclusion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>accidents \u201carising out of\u2019 the use of \u201cany motorized land vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8, 581 A.2d 510. We held that the homeowner\u2019s insurance policy exclusion applied to claims against Yodice for damages based on negligent supervision. As noted earlier, that holding was impliedly approved by the Supreme Court in <em>Salem Group, supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 5, 607 A.2d 138.</p>\n<p id=\"AVG\">Interestingly, the plaintiff in <em>Moraca, supra, </em>relied upon this court\u2019s earlier opinion in <em>McDonald v. Home Ins. Co., </em>97 <em>N.J.Super. </em>501, 235 A.2d 480 (App.Div.1967), in support of her contention that the Allstate policy did not exclude claims for negligent supervision arising out of motor vehicle accidents. Plaintiff also relies upon <em>McDonald </em>in support of his claim in this case. However, the <em>Moraca </em>court noted the difference in the policy terminology in <em>McDonald </em>and observed that: \u201c[s]ince the <em>McDonald </em>decision, the exclusionary language in homeowners\u2019 policies has been broadened considerably to eliminate coverage in claims involving motor vehicles.\u201d <em>Moraca, supra, </em>244 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 12, 581 A.2d 510. The <em>Moraca </em>court concluded that \u201c[t]he isolation in <em>McDonald </em>of negligent supervision or entrustment from ownership, maintenance, operation or use of an automobile is contrary to the vast weight of authority including subsequent cases in New Jersey.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18, 581 A.2d 510. As noted earlier, our holding in <em>Moraca </em>was distinguished, but not criticized, by the Supreme Court in <em>Salem Group, supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 5, 607 A.2d 138. Thus, we conclude that plaintiffs reliance on <em>Salem Group </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Plaintiff also contends that there is a triable issue of fact as to whether a forklift is a \u201cmotorized land conveyance[ ]\u201d within the meaning of the policy. \u201cInsurance contracts are to be construed in accordance with the reasonable expectations of the average policy holder[,]\u201d and any ambiguity must be resolved against the insurance company. <em>Killeen Trucking, Inc. v. Great American Surplus Lines Ins. Co., </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>712, 715, 716, 512 A.2d 590 (App.Div.1986). However, \u201cthe rule of liberal con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>struction \u2018cannot operate to authorize a perversion of the language and the intent of the contracting parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Salem Group, supra, </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 271, 590 A.2d 1194 (quoting <em>Sinopoli v. North River Ins. Co., </em>244 <em>N.J.Super. </em>245, 250, 581 A.2d 1368 (App.Div.1990), <em>certif. denied, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>325, 604 A.2d 600 (1991)). Thus, in the absence of a specific definition in an insurance policy, the words must be interpreted in accordance with their ordinary, plain and usual meaning. <em>Killeen Trucking, supra, </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 714, 512 A.2d 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary (1980) defines \u201cforklift\u201d as a \u201cself-propelled machine for hoisting and transporting heavy objects by means of steel fingers inserted under the load.\u201d This same dictionary defines \u201cconveyance\u201d as a \u201cmeans of transport.\u201d The Oxford English Dictionary (1989) defines forklift as \u201ca vehicle fitted with a pronged device in front for lifting and carrying heavy goods.\u201d Plaintiff argues that because a forklift is not a registered vehicle capable of being operated on a public street, it is not intended to be a motorized land conveyance within the meaning of the policy. We fail to see the relevancy of the argument. The only place in the exclusionary language where registration is a factor for non-applicability of the exclusion is where the vehicle involved is a \u201cmotorized land conveyance designed for recreational use of public roads, not subject to motor vehicle registration.\u201d Plaintiff has not claimed, indeed he cannot claim, that a forklift qualifies as a recreational vehicle under any reasonable interpretation of the policy language.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">It is clear to us from the commonly accepted definitions of forklift that it is a motorized land conveyance under the terms of the insurance contract. The forklift is a motorized means of transporting cargo, while at the same time transporting the forklift operator. We find no difficulty in concluding that the average policy holder should expect that a motorized vehicle designed to transport cargo driven by a human operator would be considered a motorized land conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Thus we conclude that the trial judge did not err in granting summary judgment to Travelers as to its insureds Jake and Dane Marble. In view of our conclusion, we need not address the alternative exclusion relative to Jake Marble under the business pursuit exclusion of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Affirmed in part, and reversed in part. The matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-11\"> Carol Ann Daus, Gerald's wife, sues <em>per quod. </em>Her claim is irrelevant to these proceedings.
