Construction of the high school had been authorized by the voters in a September 30, 1986 bond issue. The judgment also orders the Regional Board to construct the high school.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In a sixty-seven page written opinion dated February 16, 1993, Judge McGann determined that the Regional Board failed to demonstrate sufficient supervening circumstances to justify its avoidance of the September 30, 1986 referendum mandate. We affirm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">We need not relate in detail the abundant facts and complex expert testimony presented by all parties during the bench trial, since they are carefully detailed by Judge McGann in his comprehensive opinion. However, a brief discussion of the relevant procedural history and operative facts is helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">In 1984, the Regional Board formed a Special Advisory Committee to study ways to accommodate growing student population in the district. The Committee was comprised of a cross-section of interested citizens, including representatives from each municipality\u2019s local board of education and governing bodies.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">After preliminary studies conducted by Dr. Michael Macaluso, from the State Department of Education\u2019s Bureau of Facility Planning Services, the Committee retained Dr. Emanuel Aver-bach, highly experienced in long-range planning, education and related fields. Dr. Averbach was accepted by Judge McGann as an expert in \u201cdemographic enrollment projections in a long-range facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">Dr. Averbach presented an extensive study in 1985, updated in 1986, reporting that because of projected increases in student <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>population, the district was in need of increasing its \u201ceffective capacity\u201d by 1,300 student places. According to Dr. Averbach, in 1985 the district\u2019s \u201ceffective capacity\u201d was 6,304. The actual student population in 1985 was 7,729 and would increase, according to the witness, to over 8,200 in 1994. \u201cEffective capacity\u201d was generally described by Dr. Averbach as a methodology which, given the educational programs offered, state limitations on class sizes and existing facilities, was the maximum number of students that could be legitimately accommodated. The witness declined to use \u201cfunctional capacity,\u201d a concept employed by the State Department of Education, because the methodology assumed that every space will be filled by students at all times, even if the current educational program does not call for such use.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">The Committee accepted Dr. Averbach\u2019s analysis and his use of the \u201ceffective capacity\u201d methodology. It found that existing facilities were inadequate to meet the present needs of the district and \u201cwill be more so in the future due to population pressures and changes in State guidelines.\u201d It thereupon presented its report to the Regional Board recommending immediate \u201cconstruction of a new high school with a capacity of 1300 in classroom space and 1600 in core facilities, to be located in the central eastern section of the Regional District.\u201d The Committee also recommended improvements to the district\u2019s existing high school facilities. Colts Neck Township, located in the central-eastern part of the district, offered to donate a seventy-acre tract for the new school.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">On September 18, 1985, the Regional Board accepted the Committee\u2019s recommendations and adopted a resolution authorizing a bonding referendum seeking $30,361,000 for the new school and $6,082,000 for the improvements to the existing schools. The required consent by the State Commissioner of Education was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>given. At the request of the Regional Board, in 1986 Dr. Aver-bach wrote a background article for a newsletter sent to the voters in the district which mentioned that the present \u201ceffective capacity\u201d was 6,304, and the projected average enrollment for 1994 and 1995 would be 8,470. The referendum passed on September 30, 1986, by a vote of 2,950 to 2,042. The $36,443,000 in bonds were sold and Colts Neck conveyed the tract for the new school to the Regional Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Plaintiffs in the present action, the Board of Education and Township Committee of Colts Neck, filed their original suit against the Regional Board on January 13, 1989, claiming that the Board intended only to complete the improvements to the existing high schools without constructing the new high school. On February 1, 1989, Judge Selikoff dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, but in doing so relied on the Regional Board\u2019s counsel\u2019s representation that the Board had <em>no </em>intention of abandoning its referendum mandate to build the new school. By unpublished opinion dated March 7, 1989, we affirmed Judge Selikoffs order of dismissal. (A-2573-88T1).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The Township of Freehold also brought an action against the Regional Board, charging it with failing to monitor purported changes in circumstances following the referendum, and seeking to enjoin construction of the high school pending a new study as to need. The case was settled on condition that the Regional Board obtain a new demographic study.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">On September 14, 1989, plaintiffs brought the present action seeking specific performance of the September 30, 1986 referendum mandate to build the new school. On February 21, 1990, after receiving a new demographic report (the Thomas Study), the Regional Board determined by resolution that, because of \u201ca substantial change in circumstances as evidenced by new data and new information,\u201d construction of the high school authorized by the referendum be \u201cdecommitted.\u201d The Board cited two \u201csubstantial\u201d changes: (1) the projected 1994-95 school population, according to the Thomas Study, was 7,483, approximately 1,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>students less than projected by Dr. Averbach;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (2) recent relaxation of state regulations permitting the expansion of the existing facilities in the district, rather than construction of a new high school. The Regional Board thereupon scheduled a referendum submitting to the voters its decision to decommission the high school. Judge McGann, in response to plaintiffs\u2019 motion, enjoined the referendum pending trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">After a lengthy bench trial, Judge McGann entered judgment in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, permanently enjoining the decommission referendum, ordering the Regional Board of approve the final plans for the new school by June 4, 1998 and retaining jurisdiction in order to monitor the Regional Board\u2019s compliance. Citing <em>Durgin v. Brown, </em>37 <em>N.J. </em>189, 198, 180 A.2d 136 (1962), the judge concluded that the Regional Board failed to show \u201cexceptional\u201d or \u201cunexpected\u201d supervening events that would justify nullification of the referendum mandate. Specifically, he found that the reduction in the projected enrollment for 1994 and 1995 was a temporary response to the recent recession and did not provide a legal basis to undo the September 30, 1986 referendum vote. The judge noted that it would take approximately three years to build a high school. He found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\">In other words, under anyone\u2019s projection (Dr. Babineau\u2019s [the Regional Board\u2019s expert] figure for 1994-5 was 7493) the Regional District will need substantial additional space soon and the voters have already dictated that it be in a new school in Colts Neck. There is nothing \u201cexceptional\u201d about differences in projections by experts. There is nothing \u201cunexpected\u201d about rises and falls in the economy. No one can predict exactly when they will occur.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The judge also concluded that intervening amendments to State regulations were not sufficiently meaningful to nullify the referendum, and also that there was no factual basis for the Regional Board\u2019s and intervenors\u2019 claim that Dr. Averbach had \u201cmisled\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Board and the public in his 1985 and 1986 reports.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">We affirm substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge McGann in his thoughtful opinion. However, since the Regional Board and intervenors raise before us the central question as to burden of proof, we address that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The Regional Board and intervenors argue that plaintiffs have the burden of showing that the Board\u2019s decommission resolution was an arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable exercise of the Board\u2019s governmental discretion. Judge McGann held otherwise, assigning to the Regional Board the burden of showing that supervening events since the referendum justified its nullification. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">We do not dispute the settled principle that policy, legislative and quasi-legislative determinations are committed to the judgment of local governmental bodies. <em>Riggs v. Long Beach Tp., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>601, 610-11, 538 A.2d 808 (1988); <em>United Advertising Corp. v. Metuchen, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>1, 8, 198 A.2d 447 (1964). Such determinations enjoy a distinct presumption of validity, <em>First Peoples Bank of N.J. v. Medford Tp., </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>413, 418, 599 A.2d 1248 (1991); <em>Hutton Park Gardens v. West Orange Town Council, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>543, 564, 350 A.2d 1 (1975), and will remain left undisturbed absent a showing of arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable action on the part of the governmental agency. <em>Palamar Constr., Inc. v. Pennsauken Tp., </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>241, 250, 482 A.2d 174 (App.Div.1983). These principles apply to policy determinations made by local boards of education. <em>See Parsippany-Troy Hills Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Board of Ed. of Tp. of Parsippany-Troy Hills, </em>188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>161, 167, 457 A.2d 15 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>527, 468 A.2d 182 (1983); <em>Kopera v. Board of Ed. of West Orange, </em>60 <em>N.J.Super. </em>288, 294, 158 A.2d 842 (App.Div.1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>However, this ease involves a referendum establishing a legal mandate by final judgment of the voters. <em>Durgin, </em>37 <em>N.J. </em>at 198, 180 A.2d 136. Our Supreme Court in <em>Durgin </em>held that once a local board of education submits a question concerning capital improvements to a binding referendum, the board no longer \u201cmay change its mind with the freedom it would have if its discretion alone were involved.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Rather, final judgment has been committed to the voters. <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cThe time for the Board\u2019s decision upon such matters was before the vote. When the voters approved the proposals, the debate upon policy was ended.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">However, <em>Durgin </em>holds that the board reserves some residual power to \u201cseek relief\u2019 from the \u201cextraordinary or unexpected,\u201d arising from \u201csupervening events which so nullify the premise upon which\u201d the referendum vote was conducted that governmental action is necessary. <em>Ibid. </em>In our view, <em>Durgin\u2019s </em>language clearly places the burden upon the local board to show the \u201cextraordinary or unexpected\u201d supervening events necessary to nullify the mandate of the electorate. We do not read the Law Division cases cited by the Regional Board and intervenors as expressing a contrary view. <em>See Board of Ed. of Tp. of Belvidere v. Bosco, </em>138 <em>N.J.Super. </em>368, 381, 351 A.2d 36 (Law Div.1975); <em>Silverman v. Board of Ed. of Millburn Tp., </em>134 <em>N.J.Super. </em>253, 261-62, 339 A.2d 233 (Law Div.), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>136 <em>N.J.Super. </em>435, 346 A.2d 611 (App.Div.1975). <em>Belvidere </em>was a declaratory judgment action that simply repeated the <em>Durgin </em>holding. <em>Belvidere, </em>138 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 380-82, 351 A.2d 36. <em>Silverman </em>applied <em>Durgin </em>to allow a district that had already built a new school to take the easily-reversed step of leasing it for a short period to the State Department of Education for \u201can educational use consistent with the purposes for which the school was built.\u201d <em>Silverman, </em>134 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 261-62, 339 A.2d 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Our review of the record accords with Judge McGann\u2019s ample findings and legal conclusions that the Regional Board did not sustain the burden articulated by the Court in <em>Durgin. </em>The judge accepted the opinions of Dr. Averbach over those expressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>by the Regional Board\u2019s experts. He noted that of all the competing experts, Dr. Averbach \u201cis possessed of more compelling expertise,\u201d who \u201cpainstakingly detailed\u201d examination of the \u201cactual functioning\u201d of the existing schools in reaching his conclusions concerning \u201ceffective capacity\u201d deficits and the continuing need for a new school. We will not disturb a fact-finder\u2019s acceptance of an expert\u2019s opinion when, as here, the opinion has factual and statistical support and the expert explains the scientific methodology he applied in reaching his conclusions. <em>See Landrigan v. Celotex </em>Corp., 127 <em>N.J. 404, </em>414-17, 605 A.2d 1079 (1992); <em>County of Middlesex v. Clearwater Village, Inc., </em>163 <em>N.J.Super. </em>166, 173-74, 394 A.2d 390 (App.Div.1978), <em>certif. denied, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>483, 401 A.2d 239 (1979); <em>Double R. Enter. v. Bordentown Tp., </em>12 <em>N.J.Tax </em>455, 466 (Tax 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Judge McGann acknowledged that the actual student population for the years 1990 through 1992 was lower than those projected by Dr. Averbach, and further that the witnesses\u2019 projected 1994 population was probably \u201cin excess of the actuality.\u201d However, the judge concluded that the difference is one of \u201cdegree not of substance.\u201d He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">There is no doubt that enrollment will continue to rise. Residential development in the Regional District has continued throughout <em>the </em>recession years but at a greatly reduced rate. The school is not to be built for 1994 or 1995 but to last for many years beyond. There is also no doubt that the end of the recession will cause the residential building rate to soar. The only question is when. In other words, under anyone\u2019s projection (Dr. Babineau\u2019s figure for 1994-5 was 7493) the Regional District will need substantial additional space soon and the voters have already dictated that it be in a new school in Colts Neck. There is nothing \u201cexceptional\u201d about differences in projections by experts. There is nothing \"unexpected\u201d about rises and falls in the economy. No one can predict exactly when they will occur.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">As to the Regional Board\u2019s argument that intervening amendments to State regulations now permit additions to the existing facilities, rather than construction of a new school, the judge held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-9\">No proofs were advanced by the Board as to the feasibility of making additions to existing schools to meet increased space needs. No study was undertaken prior to adoption of the \u201cdecommit\u201d resolution in any way comparable to that of the Special Advisory Committee. No architectural opinions were sought. The argument does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>not rise to \u201cexceptional or unexpected.\u201d It is an afterthought developed during litigation to buttress what the Board had already decided to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The judge\u2019s findings are amply supported by substantial credible evidence in the record. <em>Rova Farms Resort v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974). The central question before him was whether the differences in the projections and intervening regulation amendment warranted nullification of the referendum vote. A shift in board policy, fueled by political forces or otherwise, or a change in the voting membership of a local board is not enough. The \u201cextraordinary or unexpected\u201d supervening event must so affect the premise upon which the referendum was held as to compel nullification of it. <em>Durgin, </em>37 <em>N.J. </em>at 198, 180 A.2d 136. Abundant factual and expert evidence supports the judge\u2019s conclusion that the <em>Durgin </em>standard was not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">We recognize that the judge made his findings based on facts and circumstances as of February 1, 1993, rather than as of the February 21, 1990 decommission resolution. He considered trial testimony concerning the inevitable population and enrollment growth in the district as projected to 1999, which would create a considerable gap between projected enrollment and school capacity at the earliest date the new school could open. In effect, Judge McGann updated the premise behind the 1986 referendum to reflect the situation at the time of the 1983 bench trial. He was correct to do so. To have focused on the outlook in February 1990, when the Regional Board decided to decommission, would have ignored present realities and the district\u2019s compelling needs in the very near future.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Indeed, the facts reveal that the growth of the gap between enrollment and capacity is greater today than it was presumed to be in 1986. Judge McGann could not ignore those realities in applying the principles of <em>Durgin. </em>What the temporary decrease in population showed was an unpredictable flattening of the student population rate due to the recent recession. However, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>was compelling testimony that this trend was temporary and the need for the new school was still readily apparent. Dr. Averbach testified that despite the slow-down in population, and even applying the \u201cfunctional capacity\u201d methodology, many of the existing school facilities were overcrowded and over-used. Also, the experts were unanimous in their prediction that the student population in the district will probably reach 10,000 in 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">We also reject the Regional Board\u2019s claim that Dr. Averbach \u201cmisled\u201d the Board and the public by his \u201cerroneous\u201d 1985 and 1986 projections, and his use of the \u201ceffective capacity\u201d methodology. First, we question, as did Judge McGann, why the Regional Board waited nearly four years before seeking to decommission based on such a claim, particularly when the Board\u2019s own counsel as late as February 1989, before Judge Selikoff, represented that the Board had no intention to abandon construction of the new high school. In any event, Judge McGann properly held that Dr. Averbach\u2019s 1985 and 1986 student-population projections were not \u201cerroneous\u201d in a legal sense. The witness provided the figures based on a painstaking study, without the benefit of foresight respecting the later recession.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Moreover, it cannot be said that Dr. Averbach\u2019s use of \u201ceffective capacity\u201d misled the Regional Board or the public. The Committee and the Regional Board made an informed judgment that the \u201ceffective capacity\u201d methodology should be utilized, rather than \u201cfunctional capacity.\u201d Committee member Margaret Cardin testified that she and other members discussed the two concepts, understood their differences and unanimously voted to apply the \u201ceffective capacity\u201d concept. Also, in reaching its findings the Committee considered the input of Dr. Macaluso as well as the views of the entire Committee membership in reaching its conclusion that the new school in the central-eastern region of the district should \u201cimmediately\u201d be built. Given the fact that the Committee and Regional Board knowingly embraced the \u201ceffective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>capacity\u201d concept, the Board\u2019s newly-found claim that it was misled is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b530-13\">The district consists of Freehold, Farmingdale and Englishtown Boroughs and the Townships of Freehold, Howell Manalapan, Marlboro and Colts Neck. The Regional Board oversees five high schools located in Freehold Borough and the Townships of Freehold, Howell, Manalapan and Marlboro.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b531-10\"> The remaining appellants were granted leave to intervene.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b531-11\"> Counsel for the Regional Board acknowledged at oral argument before us that the Board considered, but did not move to transfer this matter to the State Department of Education pursuant to <em>Rule </em>1:13-4(a). <em>See Abbott v.
