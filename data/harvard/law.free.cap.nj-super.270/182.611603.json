We conclude that it does, and remand for trial at which the defense may be presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-13\">Defendant was indicted for conspiring \u201cwith D.R., a police informant and unindicted co-conspirator known to the Grand Jury and known to the said Michael Soltys as \u2018Danny,\u2019 to commit the crime of aggravated assault, second degree, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-l(b)(l) by soliciting the said D.R. (\u2018Danny\u2019) to purposely or knowingly cause serious bodily injury to Christy Frank, contrary to the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-2.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>second count alleges the same crime with respect to Jerome Goldberg.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">For purposes of defendant\u2019s pretrial application for leave to present the entrapment defense<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the parties agreed to the following facts, as stated in defendant\u2019s brief filed on this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaIN\">On January 14, 1992 the defendant, Michael Soltys, was incarcerated in the Union County Jail for violation of a restraining order involving his former girlfriend Christy Frank. Soltys shared a cell with Fred McCabe while incarcerated. The two had been strangers until that time, but during the two days they were cellmates, Soltys discussed with McCabe his own prior relationship with Frank and his conviction that he had been harmed both emotionally and financially by her and her subsequent boyfriend, Jerry Goldberg.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">On February 27, 1992, McCabe was released from jail and spoke to members of the Elizabeth Police Department that same day. As a result, on an unknown date, McCabe, now working as a police informant and wearing a concealed recording device, visited Soltys in the jail. He advised [Soltys] that he had located Jerry Goldberg, and that he had also located an individual who would be willing to kill Goldberg for money. During the course of the conversation Soltys indicated that he would like to see Goldberg and Frank hurt, though not lulled, but that he had no money to pay for it to be arranged. Soltys ultimately agreed that he wanted the job done and would somehow come up with the money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">Subsequently, on March 25,1992, undercover Essex County Police Officer Daniel Rinaldi visited Soltys at the jail, posing as a hit man who had been sent by McCabe. Soltys again replied that he had no money; Rinaldi replied that things could be worked out so that Soltys would pay him when he got out of jail, though no payment schedule was agreed upon. Rinaldi repeatedly offered to loll Goldberg, but Soltys insisted that he wanted Goldberg hurt, but not killed. Ultimately, a price of $2,500.00 was agreed upon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-8\">On March 31,1992, Soltys was taken to Union County Police Headquarters and interviewed. Soltys admitted that he had entered into an agreement with the man who had identified himself as \u201cDanny\u201d to have Christy Frank and Jerry Goldberg injured for a price of $2,500.00.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">The State adds that a four paragraph stipulation was before the trial judge. It provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Paragraph one, defendant never communicated any threats to either alleged victim concerning the incidents charged in this indictment. It is stipulated for purposes of this <em>motion </em>that defendant provided Fred McCabe with Christie Frank\u2019s father\u2019s phone number. Two, it is stipulated for purposes of this motion that threats made by Michael Soltys were communicated to Christie Frank by Fred McCabe and that Ms. Frank thereupon contacted the police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">Three, Detective Kominskas will testify at trial that he advised Jerry Goldberg of defendant\u2019s threats against him and that Goldberg did not previously know of these threats. Four, for purposes of motion, it is stipulated that both taped conversations took place and that Michael Soltys was speaking with Fred McCabe in the first instance and with Detective Rinaldi in the second instance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">As we understand the arguments and presentations before us, the stipulation is for purposes of the motion only. Defendant does not now seek a dismissal or a judgment of acquittal as a matter of law. The defense is to be decided by the trier of fact, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-12b, and the parties agree that the question before us is whether, as a matter of statutory law, the defense may be presented at a trial in which the actual proofs may vary to some degree.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant has the burden of proving statutory entrapment. <em>See State v. Rockholt, </em>96 <em>N.J. 570, 581, 476 </em>A.2d 1236 (1984); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-12b.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">The trial judge determined that the defense was unavailable because defendant was indicted for conspiracy to commit aggravated assault and the statute precludes the defense where \u201ccausing or threatening bodily injury is an element of the offense charged.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:2-12e. A second degree aggravated assault involves the causing or attempt to cause serious bodily injury. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-1b(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-12a provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-10\">A public law enforcement official or a person engaged in cooperation with such an official or one acting as an agent of a public law enforcement official perpetrates an entrapment if for the purpose of obtaining evidence of the commission of an</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>offense, he induces or encourages and, as a direct result, causes another person to engage in conduct constituting such offense by either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-5\">(2) Employing methods of persuasion or inducement which create a substantial risk that such an offense will be committed by persons other than those who are ready to commit it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-12c further provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">The defense afforded by this section is unavailable when causing or threatening bodily injury is an element of the offense charged and the prosecution is based' on conduct causing or threatening such injury to a person other than the person perpetrating the entrapment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Defendant maintains that \u201ccausing or threatening bodily injury\u201d is not an element of the crime of conspiracy with which he has been charged. He asserts that he has not been indicted for the substantive crime of aggravated assault and has been indicted only for conspiracy under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:5-2 which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-9\">A person is guilty of conspiracy with another person or persons to commit a crime if with the purpose of promoting or facilitating its commission he:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-10\">(1) Agrees with such other person or persons that they or one or more of them will engage in conduct which constitutes such crime or an attempt or solicitation to commit such crime; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-11\">(2) Agrees to aid such other person or persons in the planning or commission of such crime or of an attempt or solicitation to commit such crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-12\">Defendant further notes that the essence of conspiracy is the illegal agreement and not the specific crime which is the object of the conspiracy. <em>See State v. Carbone, </em>10 <em>N.J. </em>329, 337, 91 A.2d 571 (1952) (holding that \u201c[t]he offense depends on the unlawful agreement and not on the act which follows it\u201d); <em>see also e.g., Braverman v. United States, </em>317 <em>U.S. </em>49, 54, 63 <em>S.Ct. </em>99, 109, 87 <em>L.Ed. </em>23, 28 (1942) (\u201c[a] conspiracy is not the commission of the crime which it contemplates, and neither violates nor \u2018arises under\u2019 the statute whose violation is its object\u201d); <em>State v. Bridges, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>447, 628 A.2d 270 (1993). Thus, defendant contends that because the \u201crelevant parts of the indictment only allege conspiracy and no other crime,\u201d the trial judge erred in his conclusion that the entrapment defense provided for by <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:2-12 was precluded by operation of subsection 12c of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>The Law Revision Commission Commentary with respect to the limitation embodied in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:2-12c (which reads as it did in the 1971 Final Report of the New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission) notes that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-5\">[A] particular offense may be such that it could have no implied legislative exception because it is too \u201cheinous or revolting.\u201d No reported entrapment case allows the defense where great physical damage has taken place. MPC T.D. 9, p. 23 (1959). The Code places such a limitation on the defense. Here, the offender should be punished and the deterrent effect to the conniving police would be to prosecute them. <em>Id. </em>at 23-24. [II Final Report of the New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission, Comment 9 at 78 (1971).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The State contends that the New Jersey Penal Code Commission\u2019s explanation that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-12c is intended to preclude use of the entrapment defense to excuse \u201cheinous or revolting\u201d crimes and, therefore, should bar defendant\u2019s use of the entrapment defense here. The State further maintains that it is difficult to discern a distinction between one who inflicts serious bodily injury to another and one who hires a second person to commit such injury. To further support its position that the present case is the type of case to which the statutory entrapment defense was not meant to apply, the State cites the following from the ALI Model Penal Commentary to MPC 2.13(3) from which <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:2-12c is derived verbatim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">No reported entrapment case has been found involving a criminal act in which great physical damage has taken place. Subsection (c) states a principle in support of this result. Giving the defense as a deterrent to police misconduct is justified on the grounds that no other effective method exists and that it is unfair to prosecute a person persuaded or deceived into criminality by the state. In cases of crimes in which causing or threatening bodily injury is an element of the offense and in which a person other than the entrapper is the one whose safety is threatened, however, much of the reason for the defense disappears. Public opinion would, in all probability, demand the punishment of the conniving or cooperating officers. The injured persons would have motivation to seek civil redress. It will not seem generally unfair to punish someone who has caused or threatened bodily injury to another, even though he was induced to his action by law enforcement officials. It is unlikely that a law-abiding person could be persuaded by any tactics to engage in such behavior, and a person who can be persuaded to cause such injury presents a danger that the public cannot safely disregard. <em>[Model Penal Code and Commentaries, </em>Part I, \u00a7 2.13, Comment 8 (ALI 1985)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">We agree with much of what the State says, but in the absence of an indictment for a substantive offense, even one based on defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>dant\u2019s liability as a conspirator, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-6a, b(4), defendant may assert the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">We start with the fundamental proposition that \u201cpenal statutes must be strictly construed against the State. <em>State v. Churchdale Leasing, Inc., </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>83, 102, 557 A.2d 277 (1989); <em>State v. Valentin, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>14, 17-18, 519 A.2d 322 (1987); <em>In re Suspension of DeMarco, </em>83 <em>N.J. 25, 36 </em>414 A.2d 1339 (1980).\u201d <em>State v. Gonzalez, </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>92, 103, 574 A.2d 487 (App.Div.1990) (Skillman, J.A.D. dissenting), rev. on dissenting opinion, 123 <em>N.J. </em>462, 588 A.2d 816 (1991). Moreover, \u201call doubts as to meaning of a penal statute should be resolved in favor of the defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Maguire, </em>176 <em>N.J.Super. </em>164, 169, 422 A.2d 466 (Resent.Panel 1979) <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>508, 423 A.2d 294 (1980), citing <em>State v. Brenner, </em>132 <em>N.J.L. </em>607, 611, 41 A.2d 532 (E. &amp; A.1945). Thus, \u201c[w]here more than one reasonable interpretation may be made, or where the language is ambiguous and the ambiguity is not manufactured by the defendant\u2014the construction must be drawn against the state.\u201d <em>State v. Valentin, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>14, 18, 519 A.2d 322 (1987), quoted in <em>State v. Gonzalez, supra, </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 103, 574 A.2d 487. These maxims require us to hold for defendant who literally was indicted for no crime for which \u201ccausing or threatening a bodily injury is an element of the offense charged,\u201d and where the prosecution is not \u201cbased on conduct causing or threatening such injury.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather defendant was indicted for \u201cagreeing\u201d with another to aid in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>planning and commission of such a crime. The essence of a conspiracy is the agreement, the \u201cobject need not be achieved for a conviction of conspiracy to be valid____\u201d Cannel, Criminal Code Annotated, Comment <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:5-2 at 206 (1993). We recognize that here the conspiracy had to include an agreement to cause, or attempt to cause, serious bodily injury, but such an agreement itself constitutes neither a \u201cbodily injury\u201d nor a \u201cthreat\u201d thereof.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">Our legislature has in several contexts recognized the difference between conspiracies and substantive crimes. The elements of a conspiracy by their very nature do not require the completion of a criminal act, as opposed to an agreement to promote or facilitate the commission of one. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>2C:5-2. By definition, conspiracy is a lesser included offense of the crime which constitutes the object of the conspiracy, and the conspiracy merges into the completed act. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-8b, d. In fact, the legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>ture has concluded that conspiracy is an \u201cinchoate crime\u201d embodied in subtitle one of the Code of Criminal Justice, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:5-2, and has not included it among the substantive offenses defined in subtitle two, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-1 thru 2C:41-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Moreover, while crimes against the person are the most serious crimes, the legislature has provided that generally conspiracies to commit first degree crimes do not carry the same classification and are only crimes of the second degree. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-4a. The legislature has also recognized that persons who conspire to cause or threaten bodily injury can renounce their criminal purpose. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-2e.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Thus, while one can be unlawfully persuaded to agree to participate in a crime designed to injure another, it is quite another thing to undertake the additional acts and to do it. Hence, even though no \u201covert act\u201d is necessary to conspire to commit a first or second degree crime, <em>see N.J.S.A </em>2C:5-2d, there must be more than an agreement to be convicted of a substantive offense. And while defendant, as an accomplice or conspirator (as well as a principal), can be liable for the conduct of another person who commits the substantive offense, <em>see N.J.S.A </em>2C:2-6b(3) &amp; (4); <em>see also, e.g.; State v. Bridges, supra, </em>until such an act is actually committed defendant can assert an entrapment defense. On the other hand, there can be no justification by entrapment once the plan is culminated and an offense involving bodily injury or the threat thereof occurs. If defendant participates in such a crime as a conspirator or otherwise, he cannot assert an entrapment defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Here defendant is charged with no substantive offense. He is not charged with an attempt to cause serious bodily injury or any other violation of the statute which proscribes second degree aggravated assault, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:12-1b(1). Nor is he charged with the commission of any other degree of assault. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>2C:12-1. He was indicted only for a conspiracy, and \u201ccausing or threatening a bodily injury\u201d is not an element of conspiracy. Accordingly, the entrapment defense may be presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>The order under review is reversed, and the matter is remanded for trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-10\">A third count charging criminal contempt, <em>N.J.S.A. 20.29-9, </em>for disobeying a domestic violence restraining order, is not involved on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b214-11\"> The facts were stipulated for purposes of the pretrial hearing, and the parties have agreed that it was prudent to resolve the issue before openings and commencement of proofs. <em>See R. </em>3:13\u20141(b). No question regarding constitutional due process entrapment is raised before us <em>(see, generally, State v.

Fletcher, </em>792 S.W.2d 395, 397-98 (Ct.App.Mo.1990), the Court of Appeals of Missouri concluded that the defense of entrapment should not have been permitted in a prosecution for driving while intoxicated because, while it would have been relevant under Model Penal Code terminology, the Missouri legislature broadened the limitation so that the entrapment defense \"is not available in a crime which involves placing in danger of personal injury a person other than the person perpetrating the entrapment.\" <em>Compare </em>the approach of the Utah Supreme Court in <em>State v. Colonna, </em>766 P.2d 1062, 1065 (1988), which held that the substantive crime of aggravated or armed robbery \"includes by implication the existence of a threat of injury\u201d and that \"the commission of robbery using a firearm necessarily implies a threat of bodily injury to the victim.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b219-9\"> Of interest is the current model jury charge on conspiracy, which reads, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">A conspiracy to commit a crime is a separate and distinct crime from the actual commission of the substantive offense.
