On all the evidence, as a matter of law, a finding of concurring negligence of the operator of the plaintiff vehicle and the defendant, does not bar recovery by the plaintiff in the absence of agency. <em>Nash v. Lang; 268 </em>Mass. 407; <em>Bresnick v. Heath, </em>292 Mass. 293.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8p\">and denied her two other requests for rulings, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">\"1. On all the evidence, as a matter of law, a finding that the defendant was negligent is warranted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">2. On all the evidence, as a matter of law, a finding for the plaintiff is warranted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">He also denied or took no action on the husband\u2019s requests for rulings in the other case against him, one of them being that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-10\">\"7. As a matter of law, a finding of any negligence on the part of the plaintiff bars his recovery.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">The trial judge made the following findings of facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-12\">\"Margaret (sic) E. Desmond testified she owned the 1949 Plymouth that was involved in the accident, that William Desmond, her husband, had her permission to drive the car, that she gave him no instructions how to drive and at the time of the accident he was not en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>gaged in any activity of mine, (sic) fm. Desmond, hereinafter referred to as Desmond, was driving Martin Hughes home. Desmond and Hughes worked together. Desmond testified he received no instructions as to the operation of the vehicle. He drove down Parsons Street then onto North Beacon Street and as soon as passing vehicles permitted he attempted to cross No. Beacon Street to Birmingham Parkway. He looked up No. Beacon Street but he [did] not see anything coming.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-5\">No. Beacon Street at this point is a straight open street and the testimony was [that one] can see for 100 feet at least.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-6\">The accident happened on or about December 4, 1952, at about 8:ty a.m. The weather was fair and the light good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-7\">Desmond said his speed immediately prior to the accident was 10-15 miles per hour. Pineo\u2019s motor vehicle was slightly into the intersection of North Beacon Street and Birmingham Parkway. Desmond would not estimate Pineo\u2019s speed. Desmond said he was moving. Pineo testified he was stopped and Desmond crashed into him. Pineo was on the right side of North Beacon Street and it was there that Desmond crashed into him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-8\">There was no [tire] marks back of either car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AeI\">George F. O\u2019Brien, driver of the car following Pineo\u2019s car on North Beacon Street, testified that Pineo had stopped his car at (sic) before the accident. Desmond first saw Pineo\u2019s [car] twelve and one half away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-10\">I find that Desmond was negligent in failing to see the Pineo motor vehicle and in being on the left side of North Beacon Street where he drove into Pineo\u2019s motor vehicle. I find for case <em>(268 </em>Mass. 407) and for Robert Pineo and James Pineo as William Desmond was negligent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>There was a finding for the wife against the defendant, and a finding for the defendant as plaintiff in his action against the husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Both the wife and husband then filed motions for new trials and after a hearing thereon, both motions were denied, and the trial judge changed his finding in the first action, from one for the plaintiff wife, to one for the defendant, without making any <em>new </em>findings of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">They both then filed draft reports and because of undue delay by the trial judge in disposing of them, this consolidated report was established by this division. Rule 30, Rules of District Courts (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The wife and husband claim to be aggrieved \u201cby the inconsistent finding in that the Court found under <em>Nash v. Lang, 268 </em>Mass. 407 that Robert Pineo was negligent in order to grant Marjorie E. Desmond a recovery, and also claiming to be aggrieved in that the inconsistent finding is a mistake of law so injurious as to affect the substantial rights of both, and for the further reason that the Court\u2019s failure to grant Motions for New Trials has resulted in an injustice and for the further reason that the Court could not arbitrarily change its decision against Marjorie E. Desmond to circumvent its inconsistency in law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">At the trial the judge correctly instructed himself by allowing the wife\u2019s second request that she could recover for the concurring negligence of her husband and the defendant. <em>Nash v. Lang, 268 </em>Mass. 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">A collision between automobiles at intersecting streets generally presents fact questions as to the due care and contributory negligence of the respective operators. <em>Bresnick v. Heath, </em>292 Mass. 293, 297; and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">He found as a fact that the husband was negligent, and by finding against the defendant he impliedly found that he was also negligent, and, therefore, a finding for him against the husband was incorrect, since his negligence would bar his recovery. This is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>the error which he apparently tried to correct by changing his finding.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A-b\">Harry Sloper, for the Desmonds.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">By their failure to file requests for reports and draft reports the husband and wife have lost their rights to have their requests for rulings considered on appeal. Rules 27 and 28, Rules of District Court (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">A motion for new trial was the proper method to raise the question of the inconsistency in the findings. <em>Duralith Corp. v. Leonard, </em>274 Mass. 397, 401; <em>DiLorenzo v. Atlantic Nat. Bank, </em>278 Mass. 321, 323, 324; <em>Caton v. Winslow Bros. &amp; Smith Co., </em>309 Mass. 150, 154, and ordinarily such a motion rests in sound judicial discretion, <em>Davis v. Boston El. Ry., </em>235 Mass. 482, 496, 497; <em>Squires v. Toye, </em>291 Mass. 342, 343; <em>DeLuca v. Boston El. Ry., </em>312 Mass. 495, 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Instead of allowing the motions the judge chose the method of correcting his findings. This he had the power to do until final judgment. <em>Sheriff v. Gillow, </em>320 Mass. <em>46, </em>49 and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">However such a revision is unfortunate, we think that, as was said in that case \"it is more important for a judge to do justice according to his oath and his conscience than to avoid criticism. If further reflection convinces him that he has erred in an announced decision, he ought to correct his error while he still has the power.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">As in that case we think the record before us shows no error on the part of the trial judge and, therefore, the report is to be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
