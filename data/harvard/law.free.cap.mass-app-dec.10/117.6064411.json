GENNARINO CIARDIELLO alias JERRY CIARDIELLO</parties>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b123-12\">(October 20, 1955)</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b123-14\">\n<em>Brooks, }.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AhC\">This is an action of contract to recover $537.60 under three counts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>r. Account annexed for supplying forms and pouring concrete.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-4\">2. For labor and materials furnished by the plaintiff to defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">3. For hire and labor and materials furnished.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2r\">The answer is a general denial and the further special answer that the work was done with inferior materials and improper workmanship.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Defendant filed a declaration in set-off alleging that the work contracted for was done in an un-workmanlike manner, inconsistent with warranties as a result of which plaintiff in set-off was damaged. To this defendant in set-off filed a general denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">At the trial <em>(Russell, </em>J.) there was evidence by Mr. Lattimer, treasurer of plaintiff\u2019s company, that early in March, 1953, defendant wanted two foundations erected in Canton, Mass., that Mr. Lattimer agreed to provide them; that he supervised the operation of making the forms and pouring the concrete with the aid of two or three men; that he ordered the concrete and when it was delivered, poured it after placing the forms therefor. This work was completed shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">There is testimony by defendant that Mr. Lattimer said, \u201cI will take care of everything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">Defendant produced a witness who qualified as an expert, and, in brief, testified that plaintiff\u2019s work was improperly done in many respects and would require an additional outlay of $320 for each foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">Another witness for defendant testified to the fact that he and two men worked several days putting the foundations in proper shape and that the fair value of their services and materials was $520.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">At the close of the trial, defendant filed the following requests for rulings, all of which were granted by the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-12\">1. On all the evidence the Court is warranted in finding for the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>2. On all the evidence the Court is warranted in finding for the Plaintiff in Set-Off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-3\">3. On all the Jaw the Court is warranted in finding for the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-4\">4. On all the law the Court is warranted in finding for the Plaintiff in Set-Off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">5. When a party binds himself by a contract to do a work or to perform a service, he agrees by implication to do a workmanlike job and use reasonable and appropriate skill in doing it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">6. On the evidence, the Court is warranted in finding that the plaintiff did not perform the service in a workmanlike manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\">7. A party seeking to recover on a contract which he has not completely performed must have attempted substantial performance in good faith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-8\">8. As a matter of law, the Court may find that the contract was not performed completely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-9\">10. On all the evidence, the Court is warranted in finding that the Plaintiff did not substantially perform his contract in good faith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-10\">11. In an action on a count for work done and materials furnished in building under special contract, which the plaintiff substantially performed, damages is the contract price deducting the diminution in value of the house to the defendant, caused by the deviations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-11\">12. Refusal of performance before work completed has effect of breach of contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-12\">13. Repudiation of contract, amounting to breach, warrants the other party from further performing his side,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-13\">14. One who breaches a contract is liable for the natural and probable consequences of the breach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-14\">15. The Court is warranted in finding that the amounts expended by the defendant and plaintiff in set-off necessary to repair the foundations were the natural and probable consequences of the breach of the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-16\">16. The Court is warranted in finding that the plaintiff warranted to assume the responsibility for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>the placement of concrete and making of forms necessary to provide foundations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-4\">17. The Court is warranted in finding that the failure to so provide the foundations in a workmanlike manner; and refusal to perform was equivalent to a breach by the plaintiff of his contract with the defendant and plaintiff in set-off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">18. Where the consideration of a contract is ex-ecutory, or its performance depends upon some act to be done or forborne by the plaintiff or on some other event, the plaintiff must aver performance of such condition precedent or show some excuse for the nonperformance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">19. The Court is warranted in finding here that the proper erection of foundations was a condition precedent to payment by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The Court found the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-8\">\"The plaintiff performed its contract in a satisfactory manner. The foundations were useable for the purposes for which cellar foundations are normally used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-9\">\"I find for the plaintiff on original declaration and assess damages in the sum of $520.60 and on declaration in set-off for original plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AR\">The report filed with the court lacked the usual statement that it contained all the evidence material to the question reported. This lack has been since remedied through amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">Defendant\u2019s complaint now is that there was an inconsistency between the court\u2019s granting of defendant\u2019s requests for rulings, and the finding for plaintiff, also that there was no evidence to support the finding, more particularly as to the amount of damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">The requests for rulings were primarily of two kinds, those based on accepted principles of law set forth in the requests, and the familiar type of request that \"on all the evidence the court is warranted in finding for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-12\">As to those requests based on recognized principles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>of law, there was, of course, no error in granting them. As to the second type of request, for example the first request, \"on all the evidence the court is warranted in finding for the defendant,\u201d these were properly allowed. <em>Strong v. Haverhill Elec. Co., 299 </em>Mass. 455, 456. <em>Wood v. Spedoni, </em>328 Mass. 483, 485. The court said in the latter case, \"It is settled that by granting the request that 'the evidence is sufficient to warrant the court in finding for the defendant,\u2019 there was no inconsistency in finding for the plaintiff where, as here, the evidence warranted such finding.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AHD\">Joseph G. Galligan, Jr., for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ARq\">Henry A. Tempone, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">Furthermore, a claim of inconsistency must be raised by a motion for a new trial or to correct the inconsistency. As the court said in <em>Kelsey v. Hampton Court, </em>327 Mass. 150, 133:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-5\">\"If, as the defendant contends, there was any inconsistency between the granting of its fifth request and the general finding for the plaintiff, its remedy was to file a motion in the District Court for a new trial or to correct the alleged inconsistency and to secure a report on any adverse ruling and so preserve for review the question of law. <em>Biggs v. Densmore, </em>323 Mass. <em>106, 109.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Regarding the plea that the finding on damages was unsupported by the evidence, only one of defendant\u2019s <em>19 </em>requests for rulings, filed at the conclusion of the trial, related to damages, namely No. 11, which was granted. No request presented the issue of insufficiency of evidence now requested by defendant. We are not called upon under these circumstances to reverse the court\u2019s finding or order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Report to be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
