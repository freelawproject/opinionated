The chancellor issued a stay order.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the cause on two grounds: (1) That complainant had an adequate remedy at law under the administrative provisions of the act; and (2) that the bill did not show it was absolutely certain that complainant would suffer any wrong, as it was not shown that any of the persons concerned in the strike would be entitled to compensation payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">After a hearing, the chancellor dismissed the bill on March 6, 1946. The complainant moved for an order preserving the <em>status quo </em>of the cause pending the appeal and the final decree of this Court but that application was denied, and this appeal resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">By section 6901.6 of Williams\u2019 Code (section 6 of the Act, Pub. Acts 1936, Ex. Sess. ch. 1) it is provided that when a claim is filed which involves the question of a labor dispute, a deputy in the commissioner\u2019s office shall make a findings of fact with respect to the labor dispute and send it to -the commissioner, who shall affirm, modify,' or set aside such findings of fact by the deputy, and that the parties have the right to appeal such findings of fact to the appeal tribunals. This section further provides for an appeal to the board of review from any decision of an appeal tribunal, and also provides for judicial review by filing a petition for <em>certiorari </em>in the chancery court.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">, Complainant contends that it would be an idle ceremony for it to follow the procedure outlined in section 6 because the administrative officers would not admit that the section of the act under attack is unconstitutional. However, the act provides a remedy for the complainant, (and this portion of the act is not under attack), in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>it can make whatever legal defense it sees fit, and finally for the courts to pass upon said defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">The complainant further contends that the defendant stated that he had no discretion in the allowance of claims but would have to put the applications in the proper channels for payment, and the payments would he made by him as soon as they were processed.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Section 6901.4 of Williams\u2019 Code (section 4 of the Act) requires the commissioner to make certain findings with respect to claimants\u2019 eligibility to benefits and in so doing the commissioner must exercise his own discretion in passing on the claims. This Court cannot assume that the defendant would fail to carry out the duties required of him by .the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The complainant contends that it is entitled to injunc-tive relief to prevent a multiplicity of suits. The act provides that the manner in which disputed claims shall be presented shall be'in accordance with the regulations of the board of review, and it is reasonable to assume that the board of review would be as much interested as the complainant in preventing a multiplicity of suits and in permitting' complainant to present its defense that the act violated the constitution, in one proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">The act in question requires complainant to resort to the remedies set forth therein as a condition precedent to having a court of review. The plainer sections of the Unemployment Act were construed by this Court in <em>Block Coal, etc., Co. </em>v. <em>United Mine Workers, </em>177 Tenn. 247, 148 S. W. (2d) 364, and <em>Queener </em>v. <em>Magnet Mills, Inc., </em>179 Tenn. 416, 167 S. W. (2d) 1. In each of those cases the Court looked to the declared intention of the act as set forth in Section 2 in aid of the construction placed thereon. Also, see <em>State ex rel. </em>v. <em>American Trust Co., </em>161 Tenn. 570, 32 S. W. (2d) 1036; <em>Kutsche </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>v. <em>Keith, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>169 Tenn. 399, 88 S. W. (2d) 454; and <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Investors\u2019 Syndicate, </em>286 U. S. 461, 52 S. Ct. 617, 76 L. Ed. 1226.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">In 42 Am. Jur., Public Administrative Law, Section 197, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">\u2018 \u2018 Tlie doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies requires that where an administrative remedy is provided by statute, relief must be sought by exhausting this remedy before the courts will \u00e1ct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">It is also well settled that where there is a full and adequate remedy at law for an injury, it is not irreparable. Fo<em>rt </em>v. <em>Dixie Oil Co., </em>170 Tenn. 464, 95 S. W. (2d) 931.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Section 6901.6 of Williams\u2019 Code (section 6(b) of the Act) also provides that if the allowance of claims is finally reversed, \u201cno employer\u2019s account shall be charged with benefits so paid.\u201d \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">We are, therefore, of opinion that the suit Avas prematurely brought. Furthermore, it appears that the bill makes no attack on the act levying the tax, but only complains of the disposition of the funds derived from the tax levy after it comes into the hands of the commissioner. As it is uncertain whether complainant\u2019s tax rate will be increased, that being dependent upon a contingency which may or may not happen in the future, it is not adversely-affected. <em>Texas Co. </em>v. <em>Bryant, Com\u2019r, </em>178 Tenn. 1, 152 S. W. (2d) 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">In <em>Lawrence Baking Co. </em>v. <em>Michigan Unemployment C. Comm., </em>308 Mich. 198, 214, 13 N. W. (2d) 260, 265, 266, 154 A. L. R. 660, the Supreme Court of Michigan was considering the constitutionality of a statute containing a provision similar to the one under consideration here and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-11\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s argument is based upon the premise that the payment of compensation to employees on strike is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>penalty upon tlie employer because its rate of contribution to the unemployment fund will thereby be increased. The public purpose of the unemployment compensation law is to alleviate the distress of unemployment, and the payment of benefits is not conditioned upon the merits of the labor dispute causing unemployment. Likewise, the required contribution of the employer to the unemployment compensation fund is not determined upon the basis of the merits of the dispute. The increase in the amount of the employer\u2019s contribution to the fund because of its experience record of payments to employees is not in any sense a penalty. By the unemployment compensation act, the legislature provided a method of determining the employer\u2019s contribution to the compensation fund', and it did not see fit to base the amount of such contribution upon the merits of a labor dispute or upon the right or wrongdoing of the employer in connection \u00a1with such dispute. Such legislative enactment is presumed to be constitutional unless the contrary clearly appears. In the ease of <em>Cady </em>v. <em>City of Detroit, </em>289 Mich. 499, 505, 286 N. W. 805, 807, we said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Acg8\">\u201c \u2018A statute will be presumed to be constitutional by the courts unless the contrary clearly appears; and in case of doubt every possible presumption not clearly inconsistent with the language and the subject matter is to be made in favor of the constitutionality of legislation. . . . Every reasonable presumption or intendment must be indulged in favor of the validity of an act, and it is only when invalidity appears so clearly as to leave no room for reasonable doubt that it \u201cviolates some provision of the Constitution, that a court will refuse to sustain its validity.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">It results that all the assignments of error are overruled and the decree of. the chancellor is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
