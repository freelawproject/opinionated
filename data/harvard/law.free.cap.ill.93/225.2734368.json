The act incorporating the International Mutual Trust Company, passed in 1867, and conferring upon it some banking powers, but not that of issuing bills to circulate as money, without submitting the same to a vote of the people, is not in contravention of the constitution of 1848 then in force.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b227-10\" pgmap=\"227\">2. Corporation\u2014presumption as to seal in copies.

Practice\u2014trying case out of its order.

Although the constitution of 1848 has ceased to be a rule for the guidance of the departments of government, still all laws adopted whilst in force, and all rights acquired under it, must be tried and enforced as though it was in full force and vigor. The People v. Trustees of Schools, 78 Ill. 140; The People v. Pupuyt, 71 id. 656.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-8\" pgmap=\"228\">2. When a constitution has prescribed the form or mode of passing laws, those forms or modes are in the nature of limitations and must be obeyed. Law v. The People, 87 Ill. 392; Ryan v.

A bank, in commercial law, is a place for the deposit of money. The word is derived from the Italian banco, a bench.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-10\" pgmap=\"228(28) 229(67)\">An institution, generally incorporated, authorized to receive deposits of money, to lend money, and to issue promissory notes, usually known by the name of bank-notes, or to perform. some one or more of these functions. They are said to be of three kinds, viz: of deposit, of discount, and of circulation. Bouvier Law Die., Banks; 1 Encyclopedia Americana, Banks; Seldon v. Equitable Trust Co. 94 U. S. 419; Northrup v. Shook, 10 Blatch. 243; Clark v. Bailey, 11 id. 156; People v. Utica Ins. Co. 15 Johns. 394; Curtis v. Leavett, 15 N.

Manhattan Bank, 9 Wend. 351; Bank for Savings v. The Collector, 3 Wall. 512. The term \u201cbanking powers,\u201d-as used in sec. 5, art. 10 of the constitution of 1848, is not limited and confined to all of the powers which banks may possess, and the prohibition and limitation in said section includes:</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-10\" pgmap=\"229\">1. All acts, whether general or special.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqB\" pgmap=\"229\">2. Its language is not only prohibitory, but mandatory upon the legislature.</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-13\" pgmap=\"229\">3. And if the legislature does pass a law, general or special, authorizing or organizing banking associations or banking corporations without having it submitted to the people, and its approval by a vote of the people, such law is absolutely void anywhere and everywhere.</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-14\" pgmap=\"229\">For a full discussion of the whole subject of the unconstitutionality of laws incorporating banks, see Green v. Graves, 1 Doug. 351; Hulburt v. Britain, 2 id. 192; Utica Ins. Co. v. Scott, 19 Johns. 1; Moore on Banking, 1.</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-16\" pgmap=\"229\">4. The alignment that the effect of declaring a statute unconstitutional would be disastrous, should have no force. Law v. People, 87 Ill. 395; Chance v. Marion County, 64 id. 68; People v. Cowles, 13 N. Y. 360; Cooley Con. Lim. 84, 4th ed. and note, and the remarks of the judges in the following cases: Greencastle v. Black, 5 Ind. 565; Oakley v. Aspinwall, 3 N. Y. 568; Bank of Utica v.

Peck, 6 Cranch, 87.</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-4\" pgmap=\"230\">The sole duty of the court is to declare the law, and thereby \u2022 teach legislators, as well as everybody else, that whatever may be the consequences, the law must be obeyed. Law v. The People, 87 Ill. 392; Chance v. Marion County, 64 id. 68\u201469; Cooley on Con. Lim. 5; The People ex rel v. Supervisors, etc. 52 N. Y. 558; City of Springfield v. Edwards, 84 Ill. 632. Counsel for the plaintiff contends that the General Assembly, while acting-under the constitution of 1848, chartered a large number of banks or corporations like the one in question, but neither length of time, nor repeated violations of a constitution can sanction the abuse.

All corporations, public and private, exist and can exist only by virtue of express legislative enactment, and when the statute is a public law, the court is bound to take notice of it and determine whether it is in conflict with the constitution;</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-6\" pgmap=\"230\">A quo warranto therefore in such cases is not necessary.

Ahrens, for the appellee:</attorneys><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-8\" pgmap=\"230\">Appellants, by executing the appeal bond to the appellee, in which they recite that the appellee is a \u201ccorporation organized and existing under the laws of Illinois,\u201d are estopped from denying appellee\u2019s corporate existence, whether the act of incorporation be constitutional or not. Mitchell v. Deeds, 49 Ill. 419; Arnot v. Friel, 50 id. 175; Smith v. Whitaker, 11 id. 417; Herrick v. Swartwout, 72 id. 342.</p><p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-9\" pgmap=\"230(11) 231(45)\">The legality of the act of incorporation can not be questioned collaterally in this suit. It can only be made by the State. Balter v. Backus, 32 Ill. 110; Stone v. Great Western Oil Co. 41 id. 85; Ramsey v. P. M. and F. Ins. Co. 55 id. 314; Tarbell v. Page, 24 id. 46.</p><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-5\" pgmap=\"231\">As to the point made that the corporate seal did not appear from the copy of the certificate of the change of name, reference was made to Phillips v. Coffee, 17 Ill. 157, and Ill. Cent. R. R. Co. v. Johnson, 40 id. 37.</p><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-6\" pgmap=\"231\">As to trial of the case out of its order, the counsel cited Clark v. Mayfield, 77 Ill. 260; Reiman v. Ater, 88 id. 299.</p> <opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b231-7\" pgmap=\"231\">Mr. Justice Sheldon</author> <p id=\"Ab\" pgmap=\"231\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p> <p id=\"b231-8\" pgmap=\"231\">The main question in this case, the constitutionality of the act of incorporation of the International Mutual Trust Company, has been determined in favor of its constitutionalty in the case of The People ex rel. v. l\u0153wenthal, ante, p. 191.</p> <p id=\"b231-9\" pgmap=\"231\">The further question is made in this case that there was no competent evidence of the change of name to the International Bank\u2014that the certificate of the fact required to be filed with the Secretary of State was under the private seal of the president of the corporation, instead of being, as it should have been, under the seal of the corporation; and that the certificate does not set forth the facts of the case as required.</p> <p id=\"b231-10\" pgmap=\"231\">In the copy made by the Secretary of State, introduced in evidence, there appears affixed to the name of the president the following, \u201c(seal).\u201d The seal affixed affords prima facie evidence that it is the seal of the bank. Phillips v. Coffee, 17 Ill. 157. It was not necessary for the secretary to make a fac simile of the corporate seal. Ill. Cent. R. R. Co. v. Johnson, 40 Ill. 37. We fail to perceive wherein the certificate omits to state anything required by the statute.</p> <p id=\"b231-11\" pgmap=\"231(60) 232(87)\">It is further objected that the court took up and tried the case out of its order on the docket. All that appears in this respect is, that defendants objected that the cause, according to law and the rules of the court, could not be taken up and tried out of its order; but the court overruled the objection, took the case out of its order, and set the case down for trial on the 1st day of May, 1879, to which defendants excepted\u2014the order being made April 26, 1879. For aught that appears in the record the action of the court in this respect may have been proper under section 16 of the Practice act, that \u201c all causes shall be tried, or otherwise disposed of, in the order they are placed on the docket, unless the court for good and sufficient cause shall otherwise direct.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b232-6\" pgmap=\"232\">Finding no error the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b232-7\" pgmap=\"232\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
