Under section 39, ch. 106, Rev. Stat. 1874, in all suits for partition of real estate, whether commenced by bill in chancery or by petition, the court has jurisdiction to investigate and determine all questions of conflicting titles to the property sought to be partitioned.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b250-17\" pgmap=\"250(103) 251(79)\">2. So, in a suit for partition, it was alleged that one of the claimants held only under a tax deed, and that such tax deed was void, for the reason a portion of the tax upon which it was founded was void, because the certificate of the school directors under which the tax was levied was not such as was required by law, and was not filed in proper time; and further, that the deed was issued without authority of law, setting out the affidavit upon which it was issued, and the notice given. The circuit court found that the grantor of the person so claiming under the tax deed had purchased the property at a tax sale, and had paid certain moneys which had not been refunded, and that the present claimant under the tax deed was equitably entitled to receive from the owners the sums so paid, with interest. It was held, that under the statute, the suit being by bill in chancery or by petition, the court had jurisdiction to investigate and determine the questions thus presented.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b251-6\" pgmap=\"251\">3.

This we think is a misapprehension of our statute on this subject. Section 39, ch. 106, provides that \u201cin all suits for partition of real estate, whether by bill in chancery or by petition, the court may investigate and determine all questions of conflicting or controverted titles, and remove clouds upon the titles to any of the premises sought to be partitioned.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b254-6\" pgmap=\"254\">It will be perceived it makes no difference whether this proceeding was commenced by bill or by petition. In either case the statute confers jurisdiction upon the court to investigate and determine conflicting titles to the property. The case of Henrichsen v. Hodgen, 67 Ill. 179, was for the partition of lands, commenced by bill. It was objected that Henrichson being in possession, the proper remedy as to him was at law by an action of ejectment; but it was held the court having obtained jurisdiction of the case, for the purpose of partition, might do complete justice between the parties and dispose of the whole question of title between them, and thus save the necessity of a resort to an additional suit. That case gave construction to the statute cited, and must be regarded as conclusive as to the objection to the jurisdiction of the court in the case at bar.</p> <p id=\"b254-7\" pgmap=\"254\">Before the tax deed to defendant, Gage, could become evidence of paramount title to the property in him, it must be shown it was founded on a valid judgment. No judgment for taxes against the property is shown, nor any precept authorizing the sale. Unless a judgment for taxes against the property, and precept are shown, the tax deed will not divest absolutely the title of the former owners, and it will not be necessary to discuss the objections taken to a portion of the taxes for which the property was sold, nor whether the purchaser complied with the statute as to giving notice before taking out a tax deed.</p> <p id=\"b254-8\" pgmap=\"254\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b254-9\" pgmap=\"254\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
