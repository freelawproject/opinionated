In such a suit, charge considered, and held subject to the objection that it failed to submit to the jury the specific grounds of negligence alleged in plaintiff\u2019s petition, but in general terms instructed a verdict for the plaintiff if the negligence of the defendant was the proximate cause of the injury.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b500-12\">2. \u2014Master and Servant\u2014Admission of Servant\u2014When not Admissible.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b500-13\">In a suit for damages for personal injuries received while alighting from a street car about nine o\u2019clock in the morning, testimony as to a statement of the conductor made in the afternoon of the same day as to how the accident occurred would not be admissible as part of the res gestae, nor as an admission that the witness was authorized to make, nor would it be admissible for the purpose of contradicting or impeaching the conductor in the absence of a predicate for that purpose.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Appeal from the District Court of Galveston County.

W., 209, a case in Avhich the specific acts of negligence were set up in the petition, the court held: \u201cThe specific acts of negligence having been set forth, the, charge should have been confined to those acts.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-7\">In McCarty v. Houston &amp; T. C. Ry. Co., 21 Texas Civ. App., 575, the court said: \u201cWe are also of the opinion that the court should have submitted to the jury each ground of recovery which was made an issue in the pleadings and found support in the evidence. This the court did not clearly and distinctly do.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-9\">The statements of O. M. Palmer, conductor, detailed by Mrs. Dickey, were no part of the <em>res gestae, </em>and said O. M. Palmer was no such agent, representative or employe of appellant as that his statements made after the transaction would be admissible in' evidence against the appellant as admissions against interest. McAlpin v. Cassidy, 17 Texas, 450; International &amp; G. N. R. Co. v. Ragsdale, 67 Texas, 24; Chicago, R. I. &amp; T. Ry. Co. v. Yarbrough, 35 S. W., 422; Gulf, C. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. v.

Dickey, were offered for the purpose of. impeaching the testimony of said' O. M. Palmer, who testified as a witness for the appellant, then her testimony detailing said statements was not admissible in evidence, because no predicate whatever has been laid for introducing evidence of such statements as impeaching evidence by asking the witness, Palmer, if he had ever made any such statements to Mrs. Dickey.

After alleging that on said date appellee\u2019s three minor children were passengers on one of defendant\u2019s street cars, the particular acts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>negligence relied upon by the appellee are set out in his petition as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\">\u201cAnd plaintiff further alleges that the eldest of his said children got safely off said street car when it stopped, and that the conductor of said car, who was then and there the servant and employe of defendant, took hold of the youngest one of plaintiff\u2019s said children under her arms and negligently swung plaintiff\u2019s said child around off said car over the pavement, and negligently, without using any care whatever, permitted plaintiff\u2019s said child to fall from his hands, a distance of several feet, on to said pavement, causing her to sustain the injuries hereinafter set out. And plaintiff further alleges that said conductor of said street car did not leave the platform, and descend to the pavement, before attempting to assist the youngest child of plaintiff, as aforesaid, who was and is a tender child under the age of four years, to alight from said car, but that defendant\u2019s conductor did, in a grossly negligent manner and without using even ordinary care, raise the plaintiff\u2019s said child under her two arms, with her back towards him, and swing her around over the pavement and drop her thereon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Appellant answered by general denial, and plea of not guilty, and plea of contributory negligence on the part of the parents of appellee\u2019s child in permitting her to travel on its street cars without proper attendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The cause was tried by a jury October <em>12, </em>1908, and resulted in a verdict and judgment in favor of appellee against appellant for $318.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The first assignment of error complains of the charge of the court on the ground that it fails to submit to the jury the specific grounds of negligence alleged in plaintiff\u2019s petition, but in general terms instructs the jury to find for the plaintiff if they believe from the evidence that the conductor of the car, in assisting plaintiff\u2019s child to alight therefrom, \u201cfailed to use that high degree of care and caution for her safety that would have been used and exercised by a person of a high degree of care and caution under the same or similar circumstances; and further believed from the. evidence that such failure, if any, of said conductor to exercise that high degree of care and caution that would have been used and exercised by a person of a high degree of care and caution under the same or similar circumstances,\u201d was the proximate cause of the injury of said child.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">We think the objection to the charge is valid. It is unnecessary to cite authorities upon the proposition that in a suit to recover damages for personal injuries alleged to have been caused by the negligence of the defendant, if the plaintiff\u2019s petition specifies the particular acts of negligence relied on, no other acts of negligence than those alleged in the petition should be submitted to the jury as ground of recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">It is clear that under this charge the jury were authorized to find for plaintiff if the injury to his child was the proximate result of the want of the proper degree of care on the part of the conductor, regardless of whether such care was lacking with respect to the matters alleged in the petition. The specific acts of negligence having been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>alleged, the charge should have been confined to them. International &amp; G. N. Ry. Co. v. Eason, 35 S. W., 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">The charge complained of under the second assignment of error instructs the jury that if they believe from the evidence \u201cthat the said child attempted to jump from said car, and fell to the ground before the conductor could catch her, and that the conductor exercised that high degree of care and prudence that would have been exercised and used by a person of a high degree of care and prudence under the same or similar circumstances in attempting to prevent her from falling, then you will return a verdict for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">If the only issue of negligence submitted to the jury had been that alleged in the petition, this charge not being affirmative or abstract error would not have been misleading, and therefore not reversible error; but in view of the error in the charge complained of under the first assignment, which we have before pointed out, we think this charge was misleading, and calculated to emphasize such error.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The third assignment of error is as follows: \u201cThe court erred in admitting in evidence before the jury, over the objection of said defendant, the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s witness, Mrs. A. T. Dickey, in substance that, in the afternoon of the day on which the plaintiff\u2019s child, Mary Elizabeth Dickey, was injured (such injury having occurred in the neighborhood of nine o\u2019clock in the forenoon of said day at a point some distance from the residence of the witness), that O. M. Palmer, the conductor of the car on which said Mary Elizabeth Dickey was a passenger at the time of her injury, came to the house of the witness and stated to her' that he (said conductor) dropped said Mary Elizabeth Dickey; that he failed to get hold of one arm and dropped her; and, in substance, that said O. M. Palmer at that time did not say anything to said witness about said Mary Elizabeth Dickey jumping off the car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">This testimony was introduced over the objections of the defendant that it was not <em>res gestae, </em>nor an admission by one whose admission would be binding on or evidence against the defendant, and, if offered for the purpose of impeaching the witness Palmer, it wras inadmissible, because no predicate had been laid therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">The record shows that the witness Palmer, who testified for the defendant, was not interrogated by plaintiff as- to any statement made by him to Mrs. Dickey of the kind testified to by her. Eo predicate having been laid for such testimony, under a similar rule of evidence the contradictory statement of the witness was not admissible for the purpose of impeaching him.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">It is not contended that the statement was <em>res gestae, </em>and we think it is clear that it was not admissible as original evidence because it was not an admission that the witness was authorized by the defendant to make, and therefore could not be used in evidence against the defendant. McAlpin v. Cassidy, 17 Texas, 466 and 467; Belo &amp; Co. v. Fuller, 84 Texas, 454; Chicago, R. I. &amp; T. Ry. Co. v. Yarbrough, 35 S. W., 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">For the errors indicated the judgment of the court below should be reversed and the cause remanded, and it has been so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
