It was alleged that it was dangerous to strike the pile when out of line, and that said Alford, with the knowledge that the same was out of line, negligently directed the said pile to be struck with the hammer; that when the hammer fell it struck the piling a glancing blow, slipped past the head of the pile about two feet, forcing the same suddenly and with great violence further out of line, and against the hand-stick then being held by said Kirk Taylor, catching it between the leads, forcing the same suddenly around with great swiftness, whereby the same was caused to strike said Kirk Taylor under the jaw, breaking the same and driving his head violently against the bottom of the platform or deck, upon which he was standing, from which projected a tap or nut that entered his skull, crushing the same, resulting in his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">Appellant replied by pleading the general issue, contributory negligence and assumed risk. There was a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff, from which this appeal is prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Appellant\u2019s principal contention in the court below was that Kirk Taylor was guilty of contributory negligence in placing his head over the \u201clead stick,\u201d but for which he would not have been injured, and that he had been frequently warned, both by Alford and Crabtree, to keep his head from over the \u201clead stick.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">During the trial after Crabtree, a witness for appellant, had testified that he had warned Taylor a time or two that morning to look out for the stick and not to keep his head over the same, and that Alford had also warned him, he was asked on cross-eaxmination by appellee, as shown from the bill of exceptions, the following question: \u201cIs it likely, after being so frequently warned, that Taylor would have put his head over the stick?\u201d To which question and the answer sought to be elicited thereby, appellant objected on the ground that said question called for the conclusion of the witness, but the court overruled said objection and permitted the witness to answer, whereupon the witness said: \u201cIt didn\u2019t look so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">This ruling is complained of by the third assignment. We think the objection should have been sustained and this testimony excluded. It was permitting the witness to give his conclusion or opinion as to what Taylor would probably have done in the event that he had been so warned. We do not think this is a matter about which opinion or expert evidence can be offered. It seems to us that the jury were as capable of saying what Taylor would likely have done in the face of such warning as the witness was. It at best was a mere matter of conjecture, and it permitted the witness to give his opinion upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>one of the salient features of the case, which was then being stressed by the defense, and therefore calculated to prejudice the rights of appellant. The assignment complaining of this ruling, in our judgment ought to be sustained. See DeWalt v. Houston, E. &amp; W. T. Ry. Co., <em>22 </em>Texas Civ. App., 403, 55 S. W., 537; Kansas, G. S. S. Ry. Co. v. Scott, 1 Texas Civ. App., 1, 20 S. W., 725-6; Clardy v. Callicoate, 24 Texas, 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">We have carefully considered the other errors assigned, challenging the correctness of the charge of the court, as well as its failure to give several special charges requested by appellant, none of which we think are well taken. The charge, in our judgment, clearly presents the law of the case as made by the evidence, and is not subject to the objection urged against it, and the special charges, where correct, were covered by the main charge, so that their refusal was not error. For obvious reasons it is unnecessary to discuss those assignments questioning the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict, but for the error heretofore pointed out the judgment of the court below is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
