The verdict recovered was for $7500.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-16\">The court in his charge did not submit in direct terms to find for defendant if appellee was not injured by the derailment, nor if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>disabilities he complained of were due to his old age or to_ causes other than from injuries received in the derailment. This is complained of as error by appellant\u2019s first assignment of error. The submission was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\">\u201cIf you believe from the evidence that on or about the 19th day of March, 1908, plaintiff was a passenger on one of defendant\u2019s trains; and you further believe from the evidence that said train was wrecked and derailed, as alleged in plaintiff\u2019s petition; and you further believe from the evidence that such wreck and derailment, if any, were directly caused by defendant\u2019s negligence, if any, as alleged in plaintiff\u2019s petition; and you further believe from the evidence that by reason of such wreck and derailment, if any, and such negligence, if any, that plaintiff directly received any of the injuries alleged in his petition, then I charge you that your verdict must be for the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">As, under this charge, the jury were required to find from the evidence that plaintiff directly received the injuries complained of by him by reason of said derailment before finding for plaintiff, the defenses referred to were not ignored. Defendant was entitled to a more particular presentation of these matters to the jury, but did not request it.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The rest of appellant\u2019s brief deals with the verdict, alleging it to be excessive in amount. The examination of the testimony leads to the conclusion that the sum awarded was not clearly out of proportion to the injuries and damages sustained, although plaintiff was 67 years of age. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">\"Writ of error refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
