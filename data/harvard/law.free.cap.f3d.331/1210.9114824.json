He further contends that the district court\u2019s restitution order was without a substantial basis in fact and that his economic circumstances changed so as to warrant a modification of his restitution payment schedule under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(k).</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-14\">We typically review a district court\u2019s calculation of restitution for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>117 F.3d 459, 462 (11th Cir.1997). However, where an objection to a restitution order is raised for the first time on appeal, it is reviewed only for plain error. <em>See id.; see also United States v. Odom, </em>252 F.3d 1289, 1299 (11th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 1058, 122 S.Ct. 1920, 152 L.Ed.2d 828 (2002). The underlying rationale is that \u201c[effective appellate review is hindered when the asserted error has not been brought to the district court\u2019s attention.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>117 F.3d at 462. This problem is greatly exacerbated when the defendant fails to raise his objections to a restitution order before the sentencing court <em>and </em>on direct appeal, and presents them for the first time only in a collateral proceeding. In such cases, absent exceptional circumstances, we will not consider objections to the district court\u2019s <em>initial </em>restitution calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-15\">Upon thorough review of the record and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court erred insofar as it concluded that Cam\u2019s petition to modify his restitution payment schedule based on changed economic circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>was not cognizable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 S664(k). Accordingly, we address this claim on its merits. Upon doing so, however, we conclude that appellant\u2019s argument is plainly unmeritorious. By contrast, Cani has waived his challenge to the district court\u2019s initial restitution calculation, as he failed to raise it at sentencing or on direct appeal, and has demonstrated no exceptional circumstances that would excuse this failure. Because none of appellant\u2019s claims warrant relief, we affirm the denial<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-5\">The relevant facts are straightforward. Pursuant to a written plea agreement, Cani pled guilty to one count of assaulting a person having lawful custody of property of the United States with the intent to rob such property, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2114. Prior to sentencing, Cani objected to the presentence report, arguing that (1) he was entitled to a three-level sentencing reduction for acceptance of responsibility; and (2) he was entitled to a downward departure because the victim\u2019s conduct provoked his offense behavior. The district court rejected both of these contentions and sentenced appellant to 96 months imprisonment and 3 years of supervised release, and ordered him to pay $4994.23 in restitution and a $100 assessment. On direct appeal, Cani challenged only the denial of the offense level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. On October 13, 1999, we affirmed appellant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-6\">Subsequently, on February 22, 2002, Cani filed the instant \u201cPetition for Recalculation of Amount and Manner of Payment of Restitution as per 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663.\u201d In support of this motion, he argued that (1) there was an insufficient factual basis at sentencing for the amount of restitution ordered; (2) the district court had failed to establish a payment schedule; and (3) he was being penalized by the Bureau of Prisons for his inability to pay restitution. The district court referred the motion to a magistrate judge, who reported and recommended that it be construed as a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct appellant\u2019s sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The magistrate judge further suggested that this motion be denied, as \u00a7 2255 is not a mechanism by which an order of restitution may be attacked. <em>See Blaik v. United States, </em>161 F.3d 1341, 1342 (11th Cir.1998). The district court adopted the Report and Recommendation in its entirety, and dismissed Cani\u2019s motion. The district court ruled specifically that Cani\u2019s challenge to the restitution order was not cognizable under \u00a7 2255, and that no relief was available under either 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A)(i) or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-9\">Preliminarily, we note that a single judge of this court found in an order dated August 26, 2002 that appellant\u2019s petition is not properly construed as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. This determination was plainly correct. <em>See Blaik, </em>161 F.3d at 1343 (\u201c[Section] 2255 cannot be utilized by a federal prisoner who challenges only the restitution portion of his sentence because \u00a7 2255 affords relief only to those prisoners who 'claim[ ] the right to be released\u2019 from custody.\u201d (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255)). Accordingly, that aspect of the district court\u2019s ruling was erroneous. Instead, we interpret Cani\u2019s motion as (1) challenging the district court\u2019s initial calculation of restitution in this case; and (2) alleging, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(k), a change in his ability to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-10\">We do not address the merits of the first claim, however, because by (1) failing to challenge the district court\u2019s calculation of restitution before either that court <em>or </em>on direct appeal; and (2) failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>demonstrate the existence of exceptional circumstances that would excuse this failure,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Cani has waived his right to object to the initial restitution calculation. <em>See United States v. Woodworth, </em>39 Fed.Appx. 376, 377-78, 2002 WL 857755 (7th Cir.2002) (\u201cWoodworth ... raises a number of objections to the underlying restitution order. Specifically, he argues that the district court erred by failing to take into consideration his ability to pay.... But the appropriate time for Woodworth to raise these arguments was during his original criminal proceedings, which he did not do.\u201d); <em>United States v. Cannistraro, </em>871 F.2d 1210, 1214 (3d Cir.1989) (\u201cBy failing to contest the underlying factors used by the district court imposing the order of restitution, Cannistraro has waived his right to contest this order.\u201d); <em>United States v. Ahmad, </em>225 F.3d 664 (9th Cir.2000) (table disposition) (\u201cThe district court ... properly declined to consider Ahmad's challenge to the restitution component of his sentence because he waived this issue by failing to raise it on direct appeal.\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>see also generally United States v. Collins, </em>20 Fed.Appx. 144, 145 (4th Cir.2001) (describing the waiver of the defendant\u2019s objections to his sentence based on his failure to raise those objections on his direct appeal); <em>Greene v. United States, </em>880 F.2d 1299, 1305 (11th Cir.1988) (\u201cPetitioner\u2019s claim ... was available on direct appeal as a basis on which to challenge his sentence. Thus, petitioner must demonstrate cause and actual prejudice before this Court will consider his argument on the merits.\u201d). Indeed, although a restitution calculation may be contested for the first time on direct appeal, which will give rise to plain error review, we can find no case (and have been cited to none) in which a defendant has been permitted to advance such a challenge for the first time in a collateral proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-6\">The calculation of restitution is a matter over which district courts possess limited discretion. As we have explained, \u201c[u]nder the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act[] [(\u2018MVRA\u2019)], the district court must order restitution to each victim in the full amount of each victim\u2019s losses for, <em>inter alia, </em>crimes against property.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>320 F.3d 1285, 1288 (11th Cir.2003) (citations and internal punctuation omitted). Indeed, the MVRA explicitly excludes from the initial restitution calculation any consideration of the defendant\u2019s ability to pay. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(1)(A). Although the district court enjoys more flexibility and can consider the defendant\u2019s financial circumstances in setting a schedule for the payment of restitution, the initial determination of the amount payable is limited to a valuation of the victims\u2019 losses. <em>See United States v. Futrell, </em>209 F.3d 1286, 1290 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201cThe plain language of the MVRA requires the district court to order restitution \u2018in the full amount of each victim\u2019s losses as determined by the district court.\u2019 The government bears the burden of demonstrating the amount of the victim\u2019s loss by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(1)(A) and citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(e))).</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-7\">Plainly, this is a determination that necessarily is rooted in the evidence, and accordingly it should be made as temporally close to the presentation of the evidence as possible. Moreover, the benefits of a prompt, binding restitution calcu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>lation on which the victim(s), the defendant and the court can rely are significant. Indeed, it is important to avoid upsetting all interested parties\u2019 settled expectations regarding restitution at a time far removed from the district court\u2019s calculation of the amount owed; over time, the degree of reliance on the original determination is likely to grow, and the details of the victims\u2019 losses may become obscured by the passage of time and the degradation of the proofs upon which the district court\u2019s original calculation was based. A prohibition on collateral attacks on such calculations plainly serves these important pragmatic and evidentiary functions. As the Sixth Circuit has said in a related context, \u201c[given society\u2019s substantial interest in the finality of judgments, only the most serious defects in the trial process will merit relief outside the normal appellate system.... Defendants must assert their claims in the ordinary course of trial and direct appeal.\u201d <em>Grant v. United States, </em>72 F.3d 503, 506 (6th Cir.1996) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-5\">Moreover, limiting restitution challenges to sentencing proceedings and direct appeal also serves the equally significant goal of judicial economy. For these reasons\u2014 coupled with the fact that the defendant in every case is assured ample opportunity to challenge the district court\u2019s calculation of restitution at sentencing and again on direct appeal \u2014 we conclude that absent exceptional circumstances not present in this case, a criminal defendant who fails to object to the calculation of restitution at both of these stages of the judicial process loses the right to advance a challenge to this calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-9\">This does not mean, however, that a defendant who opts against challenging the initial calculation of restitution is precluded from <em>subsequently </em>notifying the district court and Attorney General \u201cof any material change in [his] economic circumstances that might affect [his] ability to pay restitution.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(k).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Indeed, there is an important difference between contesting the district court\u2019s initial determination of the amount of the victim\u2019s losses and, once that calculation has been made, asserting that the defendant\u2019s ability to compensate the victim has changed. In this vein, the MVRA enables the district court to modify a restitution order to reflect subsequent losses discovered by the victim, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(d)(5), or a <em>bona fide </em>change in the defendant\u2019s financial condition, either positive or negative. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(k). Thus, although Cani cannot contest the district court\u2019s initial restitution calculation, his argument concerning his changed economic circumstances is fully cognizable under section 3664(k), and the district court erred insofar as it concluded otherwise.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>On its merits, however, this contention is unpersuasive. Cani bases his assertion of changed economic circumstances on a printout showing his history of participation (and non-participation) in the Inmate Financial Responsibility Program at USP Coleman and a prepared summary of the consequences of refusing to participate in a financial responsibility program or to comply with a financial plan. However, neither of these documents demonstrate that appellant\u2019s economic circumstances have changed in any way since the imposition of his sentence, and thus his present financial status is no different from that contemplated by the district court when it imposed the restitution order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">Accordingly, Cani is not entitled to relief based on his motion pursuant to section 3664(k). We note as a technical matter, however, that the district court should have denied the motion as opposed to dismissing it. The court plainly enjoyed subject matter jurisdiction in this case, and accordingly the appropriate disposition was a merits denial as opposed to a dismissal. However, given that none of the arguments raised by Cani are meritorious, in this case this is a distinction that makes no significant difference. As such, we construe the district court\u2019s dismissal as a denial and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1225-7\">. Although the district court technically dismissed the petition, for reasons more fully set forth <em>infra, </em>we construe this dismissal as a denial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1226-4\">. Such circumstances would be analogous to a showing of \"cause and actual prejudice\u201d such as would render reviewable a constitutional claim asserted for the first time in a habeas corpus petition. <em>See generally United States v.
