(\u201cAnastasia\u201d), is a debtor in bankruptcy. Esso Nederland B.V. (\u201cEsso\u201d) had a claim against Anastasia in the amount of $106,748.91 for marine lubricant products sold and delivered to Anastasia. Esso assigned the claim to Pied Rich B.V. (\u201cPied Rich\u201d), a Dutch company, for $10,000 consideration and retained a contingency interest of $40,000 in the event Pied Rich collected $100,000.00 or more on the debt. Pied Rich then caused an arrest and hen to be placed upon a cruise ship owned by Anastasia and docked in Aruba. The ship was an asset of Anastasia\u2019s bankruptcy estate. The bankruptcy court issued an order holding Pied Rich in contempt for violating the automatic bankruptcy stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-23\">Anastasia filed a motion in bankruptcy court for contempt and sanctions against Esso as well as two other creditors, Exxon Mobil Corporation and Exxon U.S.A. (the \u201cExxon Entities\u201d) on grounds that the Exxon Entities should be imputed with Pied Rich\u2019s conduct in violation of the stay. The bankruptcy court held an evidentiary hearing to determine the relationship and interaction between ah of the creditors involved. It found that neither Esso nor the Exxon Entities took any action to ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1259\">*1259</page-number>vise, assist or request Pied Rich to engage in collection efforts in violation of the stay. The motion was denied. Anastasia appealed to the district court, which affirmed the bankruptcy court order. Anastasia appeals from the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-5\">First, we address jurisdiction to hear the appeal. This court is without jurisdiction to review an appeal of a bankruptcy order unless it is a final decision. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d). <em>See, In re Atlas, </em>210 F.3d 1305, 1307 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cA final order in a bankruptcy proceeding is one which ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute judgment.\u201d <em>Id.; See also, Jove Engineering, Inc. v. Internal Revenue Service, </em>92 F.3d 1539, 1548 (11th Cir.1996); <em>In re Charter Co., </em>778 F.2d 617, 621 (11th Cir.1985); <em>In re Tidewater Group, Inc., </em>734 F.2d 794, 796 (11th Cir.1984). \u201cIn bankruptcy proceedings, it is generally the particular adversary proceeding or controversy that must have been finally resolved rather than the entire bankruptcy litigation.\u201d <em>In re Charter, </em>778 F.2d at 621. <em>See also, In re Boca Arena, Inc., </em>184 F.3d 1285, 1286 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-6\">In <em>Atlas </em>we held that an order holding a creditor in contempt was not a final decision where it left for future resolution the assessment of attorney\u2019s fees, costs and punitive damages. 210 F.3d at 1307-08. The order in this case denied Anastasia\u2019s motion for contempt. This ended the particular controversy regarding violation of the automatic stay by the Exxon Entities. <em>See, Jove, </em>92 F.3d at 1548. Therefore, the order is final and we may properly exercise jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-7\">We turn to the merits. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision on an appeal from the bankruptcy court. <em>See, In re Simmons, </em>200 F.3d 738, 741 (11th Cir.2000). We review the bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1271-9\">Anastasia contends that the bankruptcy court erred in holding that the Exxon Entities may not be imputed with the debt-collection conduct of Pied Rich that violated the automatic stay. We find no plain error in the bankruptcy court\u2019s determination that neither Esso nor the Exxon Entities was affiliated or otherwise related to Pied Rich nor did they advise, assist or encourage Pied Rich to engage in unlawful collection practices in violation of the automatic stay. The fact of the assignment, made for consideration, is not in itself an unlawful collection practice or an act encouraging or assisting Pied Rich in engaging in an unlawful practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
