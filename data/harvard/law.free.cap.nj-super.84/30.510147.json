J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Aka\">Defendant was convicted in 1980 on an indictment charging breaking and entering and larceny. On June 10, 1960 he was sentenced by a judge of the Monmouth County Court to 2-3 years imprisonment on the count for breaking and entering and given a suspended sentence on the larceny count. On October 25, 1960 the sentence was amended so as to run concurrently with a \u201cpresent parole sentence.\u201d No direct appeal was ever filed from these convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">Thereafter, beginning in March 1962, defendant instituted several post-conviction applications in the Monmouth County Court which culminated in a <em>\u201chabeas corpus\u201d </em>proceeding heard by Judge Simmill on August 24, 1962. Defendant was represented therein by attorney Richard O. Venino, who was assigned by the court. Mr. Venino is an experienced and reputable member of the bar. The only issue raised by defendant and argued on his behalf at the time was whether he was required to serve out a previous sentence with respect to which parole had been revoked in addition to the sentence imposed for the current conviction before being entitled to release. Judge Simmill denied the application, and we have no present concern with the correctness of that ruling as it is not raised on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>The issue before us now is whether defendant had the right, on appeal from the post-conviction determination of Judge Simmill, to raise for the first time a question as to the alleged violation of the Fourth Amendment at his 1960 trial by the introduction in evidence against him of a weapon and certain coins found in a search of an automobile at the time of defendant\u2019s apprehension. The issue was not raised at the trial, and it would have been futile for defendant to have done so in view of <em>Eleuteri v. Richman, </em>26 <em>N. J. </em>506 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">At the outset it must be observed that the defendant is not correct in contending that the instant appeal is from the original conviction rather than from the dismissal of the post-conviction application. The <em>pro se </em>\u201capplication\u201d for leave to appeal <em>in forma pauperis </em>was filed October 17, 1962. Time for appeal from the 1960 conviction had long since expired. <em>R. R. </em>1:3-l(a). If viewed as an appeal from the conviction, the present proceedings would therefore have to be dismissed as beyond the jurisdiction of the court. Jurisdiction exists only to the extent that this appeal is regarded as having been taken from the denial of the post-conviction application and that our order granting leave to appeal <em>in forma pauperis </em>is to be taken as entered on that premise. (Actually, no order was entered on Judge Simmill\u2019s determination until January 9, 1963, when we directed that step be taken to complete the supporting record on this appeal.)</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">In the light of the foregoing, this appeal might be dismissed as based on grounds not urged at trial level. However, without intending to set any precedent, we will eschew such a course in view of the question of public policy involved here in the issue of post-conviction relief for a <em>pre-Mapp (Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 <em>U. S. </em>643, 81 <em>S. Ct. </em>1684, 6 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>1081 (1961)) violation of the Fourth Amendment and the fact that the search and seizure issue was briefed and argued on the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Defendant\u2019s present effort to invalidate his conviction on search and seizure grounds is, of course, based upon <em>Mapp v. Ohio, supra, </em>which was decided June 19, 1961. It has been held that <em>Mapp </em>has retroactive effect insofar as the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>of illegality of search and seizure is raised in a direct appeal from a <em>pre-Mapp </em>conviction in a case whose record suggests a basis for questioning the validity of the search. <em>State v. Smith, </em>37 <em>N. J. </em>481, 488-489 (1962). Tt has not been held in this State, however, that a defendant who was convicted prior to <em>Mapp </em>and took no direct appeal at all, may nevertheless challenge the validity of his conviction on illegal search grounds by means of a post-conviction proceeding. Upon a review of the authorities up to that time this court concluded in <em>State v. Kaiser, </em>80 <em>N. J. Super. </em>176, 183 <em>(App.Div. </em>1963), that \u201ca collateral attack should not be allowed,\u201d the procedural approach there having been by a motion for a new trial after determination of a <em>post-Mapp </em>appeal of a pre<em>Mapp </em>conviction in which appeal the search issue was not raised notwithstanding the appeal was argued eight months after <em>3Iapp. </em>In <em>Kaiser, supra, </em>we were impressed with the reasoning of the concurring opinion of Justice Traynor in <em>In re Harris, </em>56 <em>Cal. 2d </em>879, 16 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>889, 366 P. <em>2d </em>305, 308 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1961), that the <em>pro-Mapp </em>use of illegally obtained evidence did not bear upon the issue of defendant\u2019s guilt or the fairness of his trial and that the exclusionary rule required by <em>Alapp </em>is designed to deter unconstitutional methods of law-enforcement. And see <em>State v. Smith, supra </em>(37 <em>X. J., </em>at <em>pp. </em>484\u2014485).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Most of the decisions since <em>Stale v. Kaiser, </em>supra, are in accord with the view that after a <em>pve-Mapp </em>conviction has become final, including exhaustion of any direct appeal which may have been taken, it may not be attacked by a post-conviction proceeding based for the first time upon the asserted illegality of a search and seizure of evidence adduced at the trial. <em>Commonwealth v. ex rel. Wilson Rundle, </em>412 <em>Fa. </em>109, 194 <em>A. 2d </em>143 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1963); <em>Villasino v. Maxwell, </em>174 <em>Ohio St. </em>483, 190 <em>N. E. 2d </em>265 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1963); <em>Moore v. State, 41 Ala. App. </em>657, 146 <em>So. 2d </em>734 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1962); <em>United States ex rel. Linkeletter v. Walker, </em>323 <em>E. 2d </em>11 (5 <em>Cir. </em>1963), <em>certiorari </em>denied 370 <em>U. S. </em>928, 82 <em>S. Ct. </em>1570, 8 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>507 (1963); <em>United Stales ex rel. McCrea v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>LaVallee, 219 <em>F. Supp. </em>917 (N. <em>D. N. Y. </em>1963); <em>People of Ihe State of New York v. </em>Fay, 207 <em>F. Supp. </em>595 <em>(S. D. N. Y. </em>1962); <em>United States ex rel. Emenick v. Denno, </em>220 <em>F. Supp. </em>890 <em>(S. D. N. Y. </em>1963). See also <em>People v. Muller, 11 N. Y. 2d </em>154, 227 <em>N. Y. S. 2d </em>421, 182 <em>N. E. 2d </em>99 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1962). A contrary position has been taken in <em>Hall v. Warden, Maryland Penitentiary, </em>313 <em>F. </em>2d 483 (4 <em>Gir. </em>1963), <em>certiorari </em>denied <em>sub. nom. Peppersack v. Hall, </em>374 <em>U. S. </em>809, 83 <em>S. Ct. </em>1693, 10 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>1032 (1963); <em>People of State of California v. Hurst, </em>325 <em>F. 2d </em>891 (9 <em>Cir. </em>1963); <em>United States v. Fay, </em>225 <em>F. Supp. </em>677 <em>(S. D. N. Y. </em>1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Upon consideration of the foregoing authorities we see no reason to depart from the position we took in <em>State v. Kaiser, supra. </em>See Bender, \u201cThe Retroactive Effect of an Overruling Constitutional Decision: <em>Mapp v. Ohio,\u201d </em>110 <em>Pa. L. Rev. </em>650 (1962). Thus, even were we with the broadest liberal^ to accept defendant\u2019s appeal as the equivalent of a first-instance post-conviction effort to invalidate the conviction as infected by the use of the product of an illegal search, it would have to fail. In fact, however, our action here is fortified by the circumstance that as late as 14 months after <em>Mapp </em>the defendant was litigating his sentence on conviction in post-conviction proceedings before the Monmouth County Court wherein he failed to raise the question of illegal search at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
