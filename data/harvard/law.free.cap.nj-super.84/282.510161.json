A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AhV\">This is a workmen\u2019s compensation case which involves the application of the \u201chumane instincts\u201d doctrine. The judge of compensation dismissed the petition of Sarah G. Lanier for dependency benefits for herself and minor child as the result of the death of her husband A. Y. Lanier (hereafter Lanier). On review by the County Court a judgment of reversal and remand was entered. Lanier\u2019s employer appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">The crucial facts are not in dispute; they were adduced from the testimony of William Clements, a fellow employee. No medical evidence was proffered. The opposing conclusions reached by the Division and the County Court respectively stem from the discordant inferences drawn from the uncontroverted facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">Appellant was engaged in the business of manufacturing paper and paper products. At its factory in Delair, a two-bed hospital was maintained with a full-time nurse on duty. About two miles away, the company operated its Merchant-ville plant (employing approximately 125 persons) where paper milk bottles were manufactured. Eirst aid at the latter location was handled by an employee staff committee, and Clements, a maintenance machinist, was the \u201cfirst aid man\u201d in charge of the emergency supplies. His training was through a volunteer fire company with which he had been connected, and an advanced course given by the American Red Cross. In case of need, a station wagon was available for transportation from Merchantville to the dispensary at Delair.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">On November 9, 1959 Lanier was working in the printing department of the Merchantville plant when, at about 2 p. u., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Clements was requested by a workman to see what was the matter with Lanier. Lanier was found \"standing on his feet leaning against one of the rolls of paper and just staring with no apparent reason, just standing there.\u201d Upon being spoken to, he made no reply and gave no sign of recognition. With assistance he was \"walked\u201d 40 to 50 feet to the locker room; George Mason (a foreman) and Clements held on to him because they feared he might fall. They seated him on a bench and sent for his foreman, Earl Cox, who on arrival endeavored to talk with Lanier but, likewise was unable to obtain any recognition or response. Lanier just \u201cmumbled,\u201d then \"more or less\u201d started to answer questions. After deciding that the stricken employee should he taken to the dispensary at Delair, Clements and Cox aided him in walking approximately 15 feet to his locker. Clements said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\">\u201cI still thought there is a possibility he might fall * * * I opened his locker and I got his jacket * * * lie said, \u2018I can put it on.\u2019 His voice was mumbly and heavy, but I assumed he had his faculties about him and I let him go ahead.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">The foremen departed from the locker room, and Lanier was left standing, unattended, in front of his locker where no seat or bench was available. Another employee, Joe Suty, was in the area hut he was not within reach. Clements proceeded to his locker which was beyond his view of Lanier. Clements further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-9\">\u201cI got my jacket, started back to him; I was about 15 feet from him and looked at him. He was staring at the ceiling and just turning his head, looking up at the ceiling, and I thought\u2014well, this is what I had been more or less thinking was going to happen. I ran over to him and grabbed him. Just as I was grabbing Mm, his body was rigid but it W\u2019as trembling. Just as I got to him, he fell.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">When Lanier fell his entire body was in \u201chard contact\u201d with the tile floor. Blood appeared under his head, and he was frothing at the mouth. An ambulance was summoned, and Lanier was taken to the Cooper Hospital in Camden where he died a few days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Petitioner produced a death certificate identifying the cause of death as \u201cSub. Arachnoid Hemorrhage.\u201d The hospital records were also admitted in evidence, and they indicated a diagnosis of \u201ctraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage,\u201d with complicating \u201cacute brain syndrome, alcoholic intoxication,\u201d and accompanying lacerations and contusions of scalp.\u201d Additionally, petitioner\u2019s proofs included the records of the same institution relating to decedent\u2019s hospitalization as the result of an accident during the previous year (December 39, 1958). Those reports contained a statement: \u201cThis patient fell at work. Cause unknown. He had been a heavy drinker &amp; suddenly stopped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Clements was familiar with Lanier\u2019s idiopathic fall and consequent injuries in 1958. He had been called upon to render first aid assistance on that occasion and had observed Lanier lying on the floor, bleeding from the back of his head, frothing at the mouth, rigid and trembling. He testified under cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\">\u201cQ. So that this experience or this condition which you saw in November of 1959 was substantially the same condition which you had experienced with him about a year before? A. Yes, it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">Q. At that time, what did you do? A. When I got there, I run up and got the stretcher and the blanket and some compresses. We put them on him and put him in the stretcher and they called the ambulance and this time I went to the hospital with him; the first time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">In his \u201cDetermination of Pacts and Judgment of Dismissal,\u201d the judge of compensation made reference to <em>Dudley v. Victor Lynn Lines, Inc., infra, </em>and after analyzing the evidence concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-8\">\u201cI am satisfied in this case both the respondent and the decedent\u2019s fellow employees, for whose acts or failure to act respondent is responsible, did everything that could reasonably be required of them to render aid or procure aid in the emergency which presented itself. I find that the decedent\u2019s fellow employees were not negligent but acted as reasonable men should have acted under the circumstances, and therefore there is no causal relationship between Lanier\u2019s employment and his death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>The Comity Court, upon reviewing the record on appeal, found the existence of negligence on the part of Kieckhefer\u2019s employees in (1) not immediately summoning a physician or nurse, (2) walking Lanier to the locker room instead of laying him on the floor at the site of the original seizure, (3) allowing him to go for his jacket when there was no ascertainable reason why it could not have been brought to him, and (4) permitting him to stand unattended in front of his locker. We pause at this point to note appellant\u2019s objection to the trial court\u2019s consideration of and quotation from a Red Cross first-aid manual which had not been admitted in evidence. Under all the circumstances of this case, we are satisfied that it was not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Within the guiding pronouncements stated in <em>Russo v. United Stales Trucking Corp., </em>26 <em>N. J. </em>430 (1958), we have independently assessed the facts. Clearly, decedent encountered a post-seizure accidental fall during working hours at the company plant and in the course of employment. The precise question posited is whether the untoward event arose out of decedent\u2019s employment, <em>i. e., </em>did the circumstances of employment establish a causal connection?</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The so-called \u201chumane instincts\u201d doctrine was first applied in this State in <em>Szabo v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., </em>132 <em>N. J. L. </em>331 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1945), a case arising under the Eederal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, 45 <em>U. S. 0. A. </em>\u00a7 51 <em>ei seq. </em>That authority was approvingly cited by our Supreme Court when considering a workmen\u2019s compensation matter in <em>Dudley v. Victor Lynn Lines, Inc., </em>32 <em>N. J. </em>479 (1960), wherein the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">\u201cAt the common law, an employer has no general duty to provide medical service or other means of relief to an ill or injured employee. But there is at least one exceptional situation in which there is such a duty, <em>i. e., </em>when an employee becomes ill on the job, and he is rendered helpless to provide for his own care. In that situation the employer must exorcise reasonable care to put in the reach of the stricken employee such medical care and other assistance as the emergency thus created may in reason require, so that the employee may have his life saved or may avoid further bodily harm.\u201d (at <em>p. </em>489)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Note, generally, 2 <em>Harper &amp; James, </em>Torts, \u00a7 18.6, <em>p. </em>1048 (1956); Annotation, \u201cIll or Injured Servant\u2014\u2019Master\u2019s Duty,\u201d 64 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>1108 (1959); Comment, 15 <em>Rutgers L. Rev. </em>366 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Here, Clements had training and several years\u2019 experience in first aid work and, in times of emergency, he occupied an important position of responsibility to his fellow employees. While he was not called upon to make a prognosis or correctly diagnose the symptoms manifested by Lanier, he could or should have known of Lanier\u2019s physical and mental incapacity or inability to care for himself. He saw and knew that Lanier, although seemingly ambulatory, was ill, \u201cglassy-eyed\u201d and not responsive to questions or even able to recognize his fellow workmen. The need for prompt medical care was obvious, and Clements, notwithstanding his apprehension that Lanier might fall, caused him to walk and then to be left standing alone and unguarded, albeit for only a short time\u2014 but long enough and under circumstances which deprived decedent of the assistance or support necessary to avoid falling. Moreover, Clements was familiar with the events attending a prior experience with the same employee, which should have alerted him to greater precautions. What finally happened was reasonably foreseeable and should have been foreseen. As a first aid administrator, Clements had assumed an obligation to use due care for the welfare and safety of the co-worker in peril who had been entrusted to his charge. The employer had knowledge through its foremen and employees of the exceptional situation which gave rise to a general duty as recognized and discussed in <em>Dudley v. Victor Lynn </em>Lines, <em>Inc., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\"> We conclude from the evidence that the emergent circumstances under review required more and greater care than that which was exercised by appellant\u2019s employees. Their failure was a condition of employment that contributed to an employee\u2019s death. It is not necessary that such a contribution be the sole or proximate cairse.
