All concur, except Harris, J., who dissents and votes for affirmance on the ground that on the question of damages the record shows no reason to substitute the judgment of this corat for that of the jury. (The judgment is for plaintiff in a railroad negligence action. The order denies defendant\u2019s motions for a new trial.) Present \u2014 Taylor, P. J., Dowling, Harris, McCurn and Love, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
