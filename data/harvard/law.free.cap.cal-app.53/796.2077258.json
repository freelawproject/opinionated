Thereafter, under and in accordance with the provisions of section 1254 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the court made an order under and by virtue of which plaintiff was authorized to take immediate possession and use of the property, from which order defendants have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-13\">In the case of <em>Adamson </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>52 Cal. App. 125, [198 Pac. 52], the plaintiff therein, alleging the order was void, sought to have the county enjoined from the prosecution of work in the construction of the road. From an adverse judgment rendered by the superior court, Adamson appealed. The court of appeal held the order was valid and that no ground existed for the attack made thereon. The determination of the court there had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>must be deemed decisive of the question. Upon the authority of that case and what is said by this court in <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Rindge Co. et al., ante, </em>p. 166, [200 Pac. 27], the order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">Conrey, P.
