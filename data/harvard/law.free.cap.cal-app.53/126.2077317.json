J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aih\">The plaintiff was granted an interlocutory decree of divorce on the ground of extreme cruelty and the defendant appeals. The complaint alleges many specific acts of cruelty. The answer denies some of the alleged acts and pleads justification of those not denied. With his answer the defendant filed a cross-complaint charging the plaintiff with extreme cruelty and specifying several instances of improper conduct on her part with one Walter Stampfli, a cousin of the defendant, in support of said charges. 'The plaintiff answered the cross-complaint, denying the alleged improper conduct. Evidence was introduced by both parties in support of their respective allegations and denials. The testimony was of such character as to create a substantial conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">The findings of the court upon the charges and counter-charges of cruelty are as follows: \"That all the material allegations of plaintiff\u2019s complaint are true. That it is true that since the said marriage and for more than one year prior to the commencement of this action, the defendant has treated the plaintiff in a cruel and inhuman manner and that said defendant is subject to violent fits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>of jealousy and anger, and while so angered, without any just cause or reason or provocation, has violently abused, insulted, and upbraided the plaintiff without any just or any cause, and has accused plaintiff falsely of intimacy with other men without any cause or foundation in fact; that defendant on many and divers occasions, has applied vile, obscene, and insulting epithets and names to plaintiff in the presence of their two minor children; that there is not sufficient evidence to establish any theft by said defendant and the court finds that there were no thefts as set forth in plaintiff\u2019s complaint; that such acts and conduct of defendant toward plaintiff has caused nlaintiff -grievous bodily injury; that plaintiff was guilty of misconduct with one Walter Stampfli, not amounting to adultery but that said conduct was condoned by defendant prior to the commencement of this action and was not repeated. . . . That all the material allegations of the answer of defendant except as herein otherwise found are untrue; that all of the material allegations set forth in the cross-complaint of defendant except as herein otherwise found are untrue; that it is not true that since the said marriage that plaintiff has treated defendant in a cruel and inhuman manner and has inflicted on defendant great and grievous mental suffering and anguish, and it is not true that any acts, conduct, and behavior of plaintiff caused defendant great mental anguish and suffering or has seriously impaired his health; that there was misconduct on the part of plaintiff but that the same has been fully condoned prior to the commencement of this action. That all the material allegations of the answer of plaintiff to defendant\u2019s cross-complaint except as herein otherwise found are true.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The appellant contends that the findings are insufficient to support the interlocutory decree. <bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The findings \u201cthat all the material allegations of plaintiff\u2019s complaint are true\u201d and \u201cthat all the material allegations of the answer of defendant except as herein otherwise found are untrue\u201d are clearly insufficient as findings of fact and must be dismissed from consideration in determining the question under discussion. On appeal a party is entitled to contest the decision of the trial court that any particular fact in issue is material. Obviously this right would be denied an appellant if a finding that all \u201cmaterial\u201d allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>tions are true or untrue were held sufficient. There would be no means by which the appellate court could ascertain what facts the trial court held to be material. In the case of <em>Ladd </em>v. <em>Tully, </em>51 Cal. 277, in passing upon the sufficiency of a similar finding it was said: \u201cThe finding is that all the \u2018material\u2019 facts stated in the complaint are true. But we have no means of determining what facts the court deemed \u2018material,\u2019 and have no information from the findings on this point. So loose a method of finding the facts cannot be tolerated, and would lead to the most serious perplexities.\u2019\u2019 (See, also, <em>Krug </em>v. <em>F. A. Lux Brewing Co., </em>129 Cal. 323, [61 Pac. 1125].) \u201cThe general omnibus finding \u2018that all the <em>material </em>denials and averments of the answer to the complaint herein are true, and all the <em>material </em>averments of the amended complaint in intervention are true,\u2019 is insufficient for any purpose.\u201d <em>(Holt Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>154 Cal. 276, [97 Pac. 520].)</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The court did not make specific findings upon the particular facts alleged in the cross-complaint, but found generally \u201cthat plaintiff was guilty of misconduct with one Walter Stampfli, not amounting to adultery.\u201d The court further found that \u201csaid conduct was condoned by defendant prior to the commencement of this action and was not repeated.\u201d This further finding is supported by the evidence. The most serious acts of misconduct occurred, according to the defendant\u2019s testimony, on the evening of September 20, 1919. The defendant\u2019s testimony relative to subsequent events on the same evening is as follows: \u201cI told her I would overlook it this time but I didn\u2019t want it to happen again. So after we had got into bed, she put her arms around my neck, and started to cry. She says, \u2018Dutch, you won\u2019t like me no more, will you?\u2019 I says, \u2018Yes, Suz, I will overlook it this time, but don\u2019t let me ever see it happen again.\u2019 \u201d In response to questions propounded by the court the defendant testified that, after the occurrences of September 20th, he and the plaintiff continued to live together as husband and wife up to September 28th and \u201cgot along fine,\u201d \u201cnever had a word,\u201d and that there was no repetition of her conduct with Walter Stampfli. <bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The plaintiff did not plead condonation. In <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>132 Cal. 476, [64 Pac. 773], it is said: \u201cAs condonation is a specific defense to an action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>for divorce, it should be pleaded like any, other defense. It is true that an action for divorce differs from an ordinary proceeding, in that a decree may not be rendered upon the admission of a party, or upon the uncorroborated evidence of either of the spouses. If, therefore, the evidence had shown condonation, it would have been the duty of the court, even without a pleading, to have found to that effect.\u201d Appellant urges that plaintiff failed to comply with the condition subsequent of treating the defendant with conjugal kindness, though admitting that there was no further act of improper conduct \"with Walter Stampfli. The evidence bearing upon the subsequent conduct of the plaintiff was conflicting, and the court\u2019s finding is therefore conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">It is alleged in the complaint and admitted in the answer that in July, 1918, the defendant told the plaintiff that he was going to leave her and did leave their home with his suitcase; that he carried \u2022 his suitcase around the town of Crescent Mills and told several persons that he was going away; that in September, 1919, the defendant, in the presence of their minor children and said Walter Stampfli, accused the plaintiff of having had .sexual relations with said Stampfli. The defendant pleads justification of his conduct by alleging that at that time he had gone home and found the plaintiff and said Stampfli in a room together, \u201ccaressing, embracing, and kissing each other.\u201d It is alleged that at the same time the defendant shoved the plaintiff in a violent manner. The defendant admits that he shoved the plaintiff out of the way in an endeavor to see said Walter Stampfli, who, he alleges, was hiding in the room. It is alleged and admitted that on that occasion the defendant looked for his rifle and pistol, but defendant denies that he threatened to use the same or to injure the plaintiff. It is further alleged and admitted that, on the 28th of September, 1919, the defendant accused the. plaintiff, in the presence of her sister-in-law and the latter\u2019s minor children and within the hearing of a number of persons on the street, of having had sexual relations with said Walter Stampfli, and that he made the same charge against the plaintiff to her mother. The defendant attempts to justify his conduct by alleging that such statements were made in the heat of a quarrel provoked by the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>and which became violent on the part of both; that on that occasion the plaintiff had gone to the defendant\u2019s shop and \u201cstarted to upbraid and criticise him and continued to upbraid him to such an extent that he finally referred\u201d to the occurrences of September 20th involving plaintiff\u2019s conduct with said Stampfli. <bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The defendant\u2019s conduct, expressly admitted by him, is sufficient to constitute gross cruelty unless justified by the plaintiff\u2019s misconduct. No finding is required of an admitted fact. It only remained to find upon the plea of justification. The court found that the defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201cwithout any just cause or reason or provocation\u201d; \u201cwithout any just or any cause\u201d; that his accusations of infidelity were \u201cwithout any cause or foundation in fact.\u201d Under the authorities these findings are sufficient. The plea of justification did not present any new issue, as the facts alleged could have been given in'evidence under the denials of the answer and it was not necessary to find specially as to such facts. The court found the ultimate fact that there was no cause or provocation for the defendant\u2019s conduct. <em>(Terrill </em>v. <em>Terrill, </em>109 Cal. 413, [42 Pac. 137]; <em>Howard v. Howard, </em>134 Cal. 346, [66 Pac. 367]; <em>Kepfler </em>v. <em>Kepfler, </em>134 Cal. 205, [66 Pac. 208].)</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> Appellant contends that the findings do not show that the parties were residents of the county for one year preceding the commencement of the action, citing <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>23 Cal. App. 424, [138 Pac. 363], In that ease the finding held insufficient recited that the parties \u201chave been residents in said city and county and state for a period of more than <em>one year now last past.\u201d </em>In this ease the finding is \u201cthat plaintiff and defendant now are and for more than one year last past, <em>preceding the commencement of this action, </em>have been residents of the county of Plumas, state of California.\u201d The difference between the two findings is apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Appellant objects to the findings as insufficient to support the allowance of thirty dollars a month for the support of the wife and fifteen dollars a month for the support of each of the two minor children. The court finds that said sums are reasonable sums to be paid for the support of the wife and children and that the defendant is an able-bodied man and able to earn sufficient to pay the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>sums allowed. The plaintiff alleges in her complaint that the defendant is making in excess of $100 per month. The defendant does not deny this allegation but alleges that since the marriage of the parties he has been \u201ccontinuously\u201d employed at \u201cgood wages.\u201d The finding is sufficient under the circumstances disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> The interlocutory decree awarded the plaintiff $150 as attorney\u2019s fees. The court is not authorized to allow attorney\u2019s fees for past services. <em>(Loveren </em>v. <em>Loveren, </em>100 Cal. 494, [35 Pac. 87]; <em>Lacey </em>v. <em>Lacey, </em>108 Cal. 46, [40 Pac. 1056]; <em>Wickland </em>v. <em>Wickland, </em>19 Cal. App. 562, [126 Pac. 507]; <em>Sheppard </em>v. <em>Sheppard, </em>15 Cal. App. 619, [115 Pac. 751].) The judgment is modified by striking therefrom the allowance of $150 attorney\u2019s fees, and as so modified is affirmed, neither party to recover costs of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Hart, J., and Burnett, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
