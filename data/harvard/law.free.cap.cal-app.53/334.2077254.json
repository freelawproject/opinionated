Prior, an employee of said copartners, so unskillfully and negligently operated an automobile truck that he ran into and collided with the plaintiff, causing him serious physical injuries, to his damage in the sum of twenty thousand dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">The general demurrer to the amended complaint was sustained by the trial court upon the theory that as to the defendants composing the aforesaid copartnership the plaintiff in entering upon the said premises by the medium of said runway was a mere licensee, such entry not being made upon the invitation of said defendants; and this is the question discussed in the briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> If he were a mere licensee the defendants owed him no duty except to abstain from willfully and wantonly injuring him, for when one enters the premises of another as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>a licensee he does so at his own peril and subject to the ordinary risks which attach to such premises. <bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> If, on the other hand, the plaintiff was an invitee, the defendants would be liable to him for their mere failure to use ordinary care for his safety. <em>(Giannini </em>v. <em>Campodonico, </em>176 Cal. 548, [169 Pac. 80]; <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Hornung, </em>30 Cal. App. 312, [169 Pac. 705].)</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> We are of the opinion that the plaintiff while using the common entrance to the basement to transact business with the tenant of the defendants was an invitee of both the tenant and the defendants; and that having been injured while he was such an invitee the complaint states a cause of action against the defendants. <bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> It has been repeatedly held that when a building is let in flats or offices the hallways, entrances, and stairways not being demised to the tenants but used in common by all, the landlord owes a duty to those visiting the premises to use ordinary care to avoid injuring them. (3 Shearman &amp; Redfield on Negligence, 6th ed., sec. 710; 1 Taylor\u2019s Landlord and Tenant, sec. 175a.) So here, the defendants having retained the right to use the driveway in common with their tenant, they are liable for an injury sustained by persons rightfully visiting such tenant due to their ordinary negligence. While the allegations of the complaint are not as clear as might be desired, we think it sufficiently appears that the plaintiff was where he had a right to be, and that the defendants owed him the duty to exercise proper care for his safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Waste, P. J., and Richards, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
