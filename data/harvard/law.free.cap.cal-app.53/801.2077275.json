While the affidavits in this case are fewer in number and go less into detail, it is tacitly agreed by the respective counsel in their briefs that the same reasons for and against the granting of the motion obtain in both cases. Therefore, and for the reasons stated in the opinion in <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Kalin, </em>the order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-24\">Finlayson, P.
