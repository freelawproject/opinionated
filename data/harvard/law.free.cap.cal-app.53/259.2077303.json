The court rendered judgment against the defendant on the complaint for $538.65, and for the defendant on the counterclaim for $70.63. The action is for goods, wares, and merchandise sold and delivered, and the counterclaim -is for commissions earned under contract. Plaintiff was a manufacturer of a polish and did business under the name of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>\u201cVolrox Manufacturing Company.\u2019\u2019 Defendant was engaged in the wholesale grocery business. The court found that on or about October 10, 1918, plaintiff sold to defendant seventy cases of \u201cVolrox\u201d for $538.65, to be delivered to the defend\u00e1nt in Los Angeles; that plaintiff and defendant entered into an agreement by which defendant was to act as the sole distributor of \u201cVolrox\u201d in a certain territory and that the defendant was to receive five per cent of the selling price of any of the polish which the plaintiff might sell therein except to the defendant; that plaintiff sold $1,407.55 worth of the polish to others than defendant, which was the basis of the court\u2019s judgment for the defendant on the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">We will first consider the appellant\u2019s arguments as applied to the record on appeal pertaining to the cause of action alleged in the complaint and the defendant\u2019s answer ' thereto. Later the question presented by the counterclaim will be passed upon. The plaintiff\u2019s case is based upon a written agreement, signed by the Channel Commercial Company through its buyer, Smith, concerning the seventy eases of polish for which the court gave judgment. This agreement was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">\u201cWholesale Order Book\u2014Duplicate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">\u201cVolrox Manufacturing Co.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">\u201cManufacturers and Jobbers of Volrox Polish,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">\u201cLos Angeles, California.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-9\">\u201cChicago, Ill.

W. Ackerman held a conversation with Smith, the buyer of defendant, in which J. W. Ackerman made certain statements and promises. Subsequently, the above instrument was executed. Smith testified that he did not read it before signing and that he must have done so through carelessness. The oral representations were merged in the written agreement. It was a contract and was binding upon the parties even if J. W. Ackerman had been authorized to make verbal alterations in the written forms provided by his company and though he had done so previously. <bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> This writing, being a complete contract in itself, superseded any former oral statements, if any were made, and could not be varied by them. (Civ. Code, sec. 1625; <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>McCormick, </em>89 Cal. 327, [23 Am. St. Rep. 469, 26 Pac. 830].) <bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> We are not unmindful- of the fact that the contract was signed \u201cPurchaser, J. A. Smith.\u2019\u2019 Appellant has not disclaimed Smith\u2019s authority or that it is bound by this signature, and it could not well do so because the uncontradicted evidence appearing elsewhere in the record establishes that in executing the above contract he was acting within the scope of his authority and that he was in fact exercising that' authority in affixing his signature. Under such circumstances the principal is bound. <em>(Montgomery </em>v. <em>Dorn, </em>25 Cal. App. 666, [145 Pac. 148]; <em>Southern Pac. Co. </em>v. <em>Von Schmidt Dredging Co. et al., </em>118 Cal. 368, [50 Pac. 650].)</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">It appears that subsequent to the delivery of the goods under the contract above set forth J. II. Ackerman attempted to secure payment for them. The negotiations in that regard finally culminated in a meeting at which were present J. H. Ackerman, J. W. Ackerman, C. H. Ackerman, E. S. Wright, and P. A. Smith. As to what was said upon this occasion there is a conflict in the evidence, but the court apparently accepted J. H. Ackerman\u2019s testimony concerning it, which was that Smith and Wright said that they did not care to keep the seventy-seven eases and suggested that plaintiff take them back, to which proposition he agreed. Thereupon, Wright said he would _ deliver them in the next two or three days. It appears from the testimony of J. C. Williams, an employee of the defendant company, that after the conversation just related, when the truck of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>the plaintiff called for the seventy-seven cases, the defendant did not have them on hand and did not deliver them. The trial court apparently treated the arrangement for the redelivery of the seventy-seven cases as a modification of the written contract, but one which was not carried out by the defendant, and the evidence does not disclose that the defendant, upon any occasion, did anything toward returning these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">From the foregoing it follows that the testimony bearing upon the scope of the authority of J. W. Ackerman, as plaintiff\u2019s agent, was immaterial to any issue tendered in plaintiff\u2019s complaint and joined by defendant\u2019s answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The proof was ample as to the execution of the written contract; the delivery of the goods thereunder; demand for payment, and that the defendant had failed and refused to pay. The findings that allegations of these facts were true are sufficient and a lack of other findings upon other and immaterial facts is not ground for a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> It is claimed that the judgment for plaintiff should not have included interest because there were items on both sides of the account. Section 1917 of the Civil Code is cited to sustain this contention. The court gave judgment for seven per cent interest from the date of the execution of the contract. There was no dispute concerning the amount found due the plaintiff, as to the number of cases delivered to defendant nor as to the price to be paid for them. The same was true with reference to the amount owing from the plaintiff to the defendant, that is, it was only a matter of computation. The total sum owing from the defendant to the plaintiff could readily be ascertained by subtracting the amount of $70.43 from $538.65. Under such circumstances the plaintiff should have judgment for the interest. <em>(Robinson </em>v. <em>American Fish etc. Co., </em>17 Cal. App. 212, [119 Pac. 388].)</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">We now proceed to the counterclaim and the findings and rulings that concern it.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">The court found further, \u201cThat all the allegations of plaintiff\u2019s complaint are true except as herein found, and that all of the allegations of defendant\u2019s answer and counterclaim are untrue except as herein expressly found to be true.\u201d It thereby found the defendant\u2019s allegation \u201cthat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>J. W. Ackerman was the duly authorized agent of plaintiff\u201d to be untrue. J. H. Ackerman, the plaintiff, testified that it was the duty of J. W. Ackerman \u201cto make arrangements with wholesalers and jobbers for the handling of this product\u201d; \u201cthat he was to attend to the selling end of this business.\u201d J. W. Ackerman testified that in the conversations he had with J. H. Ackerman, his brother, it was understood that he was to have charge of handling the jobbers and that J. H. Ackerman was to do the manufacturing. While other testimony given might be construed to limit the agent\u2019s authority, in view of the uncontradicted testimony of both J. H. and J. W. Ackerman that J. W. Ackerman represented the plaintiff, there seems to be no basis for the finding of the court that he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">It is alleged in the counterclaim, and the court found it to be a fact, that J. W. Ackerman, representing the plaintiff, entered into a contract with defendant by which defendant was to act as the sole and exclusive distributor of \u201cVolrox\u201d in the territory in which defendant had its business. <bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> The counterclaim also states that it was further agreed that should any purchaser return \u201cVolrox\u201d distributed to him, the plaintiff would remove the same from defendant\u2019s warehouse and repay defendant the entire purchase price of the returned goods. This last allegation the court \u25a0 finds to be untrue. Without here quoting the testimony, it may be fairly said that it appears from the evidence that such promise was made by J. W. Ackerman, but the plaintiff claims that this agent had no authority to make this and certain other promises. The defendant, in this phase of the case, is asking for affirmative relief. He based his claim upon an alleged oral contract entirely separate from the one alleged in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. The plaintiff, therefore, had a right to dispute the authority of J. W. Ackerman as his agent; to show, if he could, that the representations made, as alleged, were outside the scope of the agent\u2019s authority. J. H. Ackerman testified: \u201cWhat had been said between us as to the method of introducing and selling these goods to the trade was just he would sell to the trade on these order blanks,\u201d and also, \u201cmy brother did not tell me the terms of any agreement which he had entered into with Mr. Smith; no one else told me; I first discovered that my brother had made an arrangement with de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>fendant other than a written agreement when we three brothers called on Mr. Smith and Mr. Wright in regard to payment of the seventy-seven cases; I told them he had exceeded his authority.\u201d When asked, \u201cWhat, if anything, did you say to your brother at the time he called on the Channel Commercial Company to sell these goods\u2014did you have a conversation .with reference to the sale of the goods to the Channel Commercial Company, with your brother?\u201d J. H. Ackerman replied, \u201cNothing in particular, other than he was to go and sell them merchandise, receive an order. \u2019 \u2019 This evidence is sufficient to. support the court\u2019s finding that the allegations in the answer concerning the existence of a verbal agreement were untrue. Even if the conversation related by J. W. Ackerman and Wright took place it could not bind the plaintiff. <bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> A verbal arrangement made by a salesman, outside the scope of his agency, is not his principal\u2019s contract. It was within the province of the trial court to accept J. H. Ackerman\u2019s version of the employment of J. W. Ackerman, and the limitations that had been placed upon his authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Appellant complains that the court\u2019s finding that the allegation of the counterclaim \u201cthat plaintiff has not paid for the goods returned\u201d is not true is not supported by the evidence. This finding is immaterial because the court had first determined that J. W. Ackerman\u2019s agreement that returned goods should be paid by plaintiff was outside of the agent\u2019s authority and that plaintiff had made no agreement to pay for such returned articles.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">It is next alleged that several rulings of the court overruling and sustaining objections were erroneous. The objection to the offer of Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 1\u2014the contract for seventy-seven cases of \u201cVoirox\u201d\u2014should have been sustained. At the time the ruling was made the foundation had not been fully laid. However, the foundation was subsequently supplied and defendant\u2019s manager, Smith, admitted the execution of the contract. It is urged that the court erred in overruling defendant\u2019s objection to the introduction of Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 2. This was one of the order blanks used by the \u201cVoirox Manufacturing Company\u201d and exhibited to Smith when the first order was taken by defendant and which plaintiff\u2019s salesman, J. W. Ackerman, was required to use in making sales. It tended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>to contradict that part of the counterclaim based upon the supposed verbal agreement between J. W. Ackerman and the defendant. The objection was that the exhibit was irrelevant and immaterial. This objection was clearly untenable. The following question asked by counsel for the plaintiff was objected to on the ground, among others, that it called for a conclusion of the witness, etc.: \u201cI will ask you now what, if any, agreement you ever made, or authorized your brother, J. W. Ackerman, to make with Channel Commercial Company for the sale of these goods other than written contracts between the wholesalers and retailers.\u201d The objection should have been sustained, but that part of the answer which consisted of a conclusion may be disregarded and still the plaintiff\u2019s case be unaffected. Without discussing each ruling on the admission of evidence relied upon for reversal, it is sufficient to say that the substantial rights of the defendant were unaffected by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Finlayson, P. J., and Works, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">A petition for a rehearing of this cause was denied by the district court of appeal on July 15, 1921, and a petition to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on August 15, 1921.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">All the Justices concurred, except Angellotti, C. J., and Wilbur, J., who were absent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
