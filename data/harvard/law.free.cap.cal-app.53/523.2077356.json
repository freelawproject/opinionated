Coincident with the return of the indictment upon which he was convicted, the grand jury returned five other indictments, accusing the defendant with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>various felonies growing out of the same offenses. Petitioner complains that the superior court refuses, without cause, to proceed to trial on any of the charges contained in said last-mentioned indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\">Assuming that to he true, the petitioner is not in a position to avail himself of this proceeding in <em>habeas corpus. </em> Where the superior court, without good cause, has postponed the trial of a defendant, without his consent, beyond the sixty days within which the statute requires he must be tried or the indictment against him dismissed, he is entitled to relief by a proceeding in <em>mandamus, </em>on a proper showing, to compel a dismissal of the indictment. <em>(In re Ford, </em>160 Cal. 334, [Ann. Cas. 1912D, 1267, 35 L. R. A. (N. S.) 882, 116 Pac. 757].)</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">The application for the writ is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
