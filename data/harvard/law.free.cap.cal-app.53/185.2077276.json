The court granted the motion, and further stated that unless the bill of particulars is furnished the court will dismiss the action. The district attorney has declined to comply with the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-12\">The question whether or not, in a criminal action, the court may require the people to furnish a bill of particulars apparently has not been passed upon in this state, except that in <em>People </em>v. <em>Alviso, </em>55 Cal. 230, the supreme court stated that the furnishing of such bill of particulars is not required by any section of the Penal Code \u201cand we do not call to mind any rule of law requiring the same to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>done.\u201d For authorities generally covering this subject, see Annotated Cases 1913A, 1207.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">It is not necessary to pass upon the question above stated, and we express no opinion thereon. We think that respondent has jurisdiction to- dismiss the action for any reason that it determines to be in furtherance of justice. (Pen. Code, sec. 1385; <em>People </em>v. <em>More, </em>71 Cal. 546, [12 Pac. 631].) For this reason the petition is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
