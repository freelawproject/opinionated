Here, the plaintiff has not demonstrated that he served counsel for the defendants with his motion for sanctions and afforded her twenty-one days to withdraw or correct the purportedly legally untenable arguments in the defendants' motion to dismiss before filing his motion for sanctions. Rather, the plaintiff contends that counsel for the defendants should have been aware of her allegedly fraudulent conduct because she was notified of it through his opposition to the defendants' motion to dismiss before he filed his motion for sanctions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Sanctions Mot. at 2 (noting that the defendants' counsel's \"fraudulent violation of Rule 11 has added a new controversy as detailed [in his opposition to the defendants' motion to dismiss, a]nd yet she had not withdrawn her known fraudulent submission to the court\").

Consequently, the MSPB's decision on November 17, 2016, resolving that appeal was within the 120-day statutory time period, and therefore, the plaintiff did not timely exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to that claim before he instituted a cause of action asserting that claim in this Court. Although dismissal of that claim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction may be warranted, the Court nonetheless will permit the plaintiff to proceed with that claim at this juncture, given that (1) the MSPB has issued a ruling on the merits of that claim and (2) the Federal Circuit has reviewed that ruling and issued an opinion on the validity of that ruling.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Butler\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1381168,3667646\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/164/634/\">\n     164 F.3d at 643\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (noting the benefit the district court receives, including the conservation of judicial resources when allowing the MSPB process to conclude);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1381168,3667646\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/164/634/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (\"In this case ... the MSPB's final decision was issued in December of 1994, a little more than two months after [the] appellant filed her complaint; the district court did not rule on her complaint, however, until February of 1997.
