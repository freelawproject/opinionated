(\"Phillips 66\") was incorporated in Delaware in 2011 as a wholly owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips Corporation (\"ConocoPhillips\"). On April 30, 2012, Phillips 66 was spun-off from ConocoPhillips and became a separate, independent company. As a result of the spinoff approximately 12,000 former ConocoPhillips employees became Phillips 66 employees. Phillips 66 established the Plan on May 1, 2012, for Phillips 66 employees in connection with the spinoff. The Plan is an employee benefit plan within the meaning of ERISA Sections 3(3) and 3(2)(A),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3) and 1002(2)(A). The Plan is a \"defined contribution\" or \"individual account\" plan that maintains individual accounts for each participant within the meaning of ERISA Section 3(34),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (34).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Participants designate the manner in which amounts allocated to their accounts will be invested in an array of investment funds. ConocoPhillips employees are not eligible to participate in the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Assets of Phillips 66 employees who were former ConocoPhillips employees that were held in participant accounts under the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan (\"ConocoPhillips\n   Plan\") were transferred to the Phillips 66 Plan. Included among the assets transferred from the ConocoPhillips Plan to the Phillips 66 Plan were shares of ConocoPhillips stock. The shares were originally contributed by ConocoPhillips to an employee stock ownership plan (\"ESOP\") and held in the ConocoPhillips Funds of the ConocoPhillips Plan. After the spinoff the shares became part of the ConocoPhillips Funds in the Phillips 66 Plan. The ConocoPhillips Funds invested exclusively in ConocoPhillips stock. The ConocoPhillips Funds were closed to new investments after the spinoff, but participants of the Phillips 66 Plan could \"exchange out of the funds at any time.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Board of Directors of Phillips 66 appointed the Phillips 66 Savings Plan Committee. The Committee is a named fiduciary with respect to the general administration of the Plan having \"all powers necessary or desirable to discharge the duties relating to the administration of the Plan as are delegated to it by the Plan and Trust Agreements....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant Sam Farace is the Plan Financial Administrator who \"shall be a fiduciary and shall have responsibility to manage and control the assets of the Plan in accordance with the terms of the Plan....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Defendants breached their fiduciary duties of diversification and prudence by retaining the ConocoPhillips Funds in the Plan after the spinoff because the ConocoPhillips stock no longer qualified as an \"employer security\" under ERISA.
