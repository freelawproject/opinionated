In particular, the state court found that petitioner's trial counsel was \"well prepared to try this case and exerted significant effort on defendant's behalf.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The record supports these conclusions. Before trial, Hughes's counsel made several motions, including motions to dismiss the indictment, to compel the production of information, and to suppress Hughes's statements to law enforcement officers. Trial counsel also moved to preclude testimony from numerous witnesses, arguing that such testimony would constitute hearsay from the victim, would not be probative of any material fact, and would \"merely bolster the People's case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   At trial, Hughes's counsel pursued a credible theory of defense, arguing that C.D. was motivated by her dislike for petitioner, her stepfather, and the fact that she was forced to \"split her [mother's] attention [and] affection\" with him. In a cogent opening statement, trial counsel asserted that C.D. \"didn't like\" the family's \"rules\" that she \"had to live by,\" and that she falsely accused petitioner of abusing her to avoid getting into trouble after she ran away from home and was discovered by the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Moreover, trial counsel argued that the videotaped interrogation demonstrated that Hughes had actually been coerced by law enforcement-who confronted him with false evidence-to provide an inculpatory, and untrue, statement. Petitioner's trial counsel also made numerous objections to testimony or exhibits offered by the People. Trial counsel also conducted vigorous cross-examination of the People's witnesses and moved for a trial order of dismissal at the close of the People's case and at the conclusion of evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \"[I]t is difficult to establish ineffective assistance when counsel's overall performance indicates active and capable advocacy,\" as it does here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <em>\n    Richter\n   </em>\n   , 562 U.S. at 111,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12439786,6005083\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/86/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, and for the reasons discussed below, each of Hughes's ineffective-assistance claims will be denied.

Indeed, while trial counsel may have validly chosen to object to the prosecutor's question about C.D. getting \"thrown out of the house\" after petitioner was arrested, doing so would have only further drawn the jury's attention to the fact that, having made accusations of heinous abuse at the hands of her stepfather, C.D. was the one displaced from the family residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n    <em>\n     Bolstering\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Hughes also argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the prosecution's elicitation of bolstering testimony from Child Protective Services (\"CPS\") caseworker Jennifer Mengel (\"Caseworker Mengel\") Lieutenant Edward Watson (\"Lieutenant Watson\"), and Sergeant Patrick Donlon (\"Sergeant Donlon\"). Petitioner argued on direct appeal that these witnesses' \"sole aim was to bolster and repeat statements and allegations\" made by the victim to police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Third Department did not unreasonably apply clearly established Supreme Court precedent in rejecting this basis for Hughes's ineffective-assistance claim. As the Third Department correctly noted, Caseworker Mengel's limited testimony regarding C.D.'s allegations-that petitioner abused her from age \"ten till approximately eighth grade\"-served to \"describe the reaction of the victim's mother to [Caseworker Mengel's] report to her of [those] allegations.\"\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3823639\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/114/1021/#p1021\">\n    114 A.D.3d at 1022\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3823639\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/114/1021/#p1021\">\n    981 N.Y.S.2d 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Caseworker Mengel's testimony regarding C.D.'s allegations also gave context to the subsequent steps she took as part of her investigation, and her observations about the demeanor of petitioner's mother upon learning of the allegations were relevant to explain C.D.'s \"apparent delay in disclosing the abuse.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3823639\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/114/1021/#p1021\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3823639\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/114/1021/#p1021\">\n    at 1023\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3823639\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/114/1021/#p1021\">\n    981 N.Y.S.2d 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Moreover, this testimony was also relevant to C.D.'s decision to run away from home, which Hughes's trial counsel cast as C.D.'s attempt to avoid getting into trouble for disobeying his household rules. The Third Department properly concluded that, even if Caseworker Mengel's testimony concerning C.D.'s allegations constituted bolstering, its admission was harmless because the prosecution did not rely upon that \"brief\" testimony as direct evidence of petitioner's guilt.\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3823639\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/114/1021/#p1021\">\n    114 A.D.3d at 1023\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3823639\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/114/1021/#p1021\">\n    981 N.Y.S.2d 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Given that the Third Department considered the merits of petitioner's bolstering argument with respect to Caseworker Mengel's testimony-and specifically rejected that argument-it cannot be said that defense counsel was ineffective for failing to \"consistently object\" to that testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Turning to the testimony of Lieutenant Watson and Sergeant Donlon, the Third Department aptly characterized these witnesses's testimony as being \"limited to a brief repetition of the general allegation of sexual abuse made by the victim, without reference to any time frame or other details.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3823639\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/114/1021/#p1021\">\n    114 A.D.3d at 1023\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3823639\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/114/1021/#p1021\">\n    981 N.Y.S.2d 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In particular, Sergeant Donlon's testimony provided background information regarding his limited role in the preliminary stages of the investigation, including his brief interview of C.D. and his encounter with Hughes. Sergeant Donlon testified that, on March 20, 2011, he was working as shift supervisor at the Watervliet Police Department when law enforcement from Green Island contacted him about a missing person-C.D.-who had been located. Sergeant Donlon directed another officer to transport C.D. to the Watervliet Police Department, and, while there, C.D. disclosed that petitioner had subjected her to physical and sexual abuse. Later that day, after petitioner agreed to come to the police station to speak about C.D. (but before he was aware of the allegations made by her), Sergeant Donlon gave petitioner a ride to the station.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The prosecution limited its questioning to background information and repeatedly advised Sergeant Donlon that he should not testify as to \"specifics about what [the victim] said.\" Instead, Sergeant Donlon testified that C.D. stated she \"wasn't exactly sure\" regarding the time frame of alleged abuse, and that he had \"concerns ... that [C.D.] may be making this up\" to avoid being disciplined at home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Lieutenant Watson also provided background information, testifying, in part, that he interviewed the victim at the request of Sergeant Donlon. Notably, Lieutenant Watson testified that C.D. was \"unable to recall dates and times of ... particular sexual assaults\" except for the date of the first assault, and that he had \"concerns\" about the veracity of C.D.'s statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   On cross-examination, defense counsel elicited testimony from Lieutenant Watson to the effect that \"a lot of information [the victim provided to him] just didn't flow\" and he \"[a]bsolutely\" was skeptical of the information she provided to him; in fact, he advised her that making a false statement was a crime. Defense counsel also elicited testimony that Lieutenant Watson \"misled [petitioner's wife] about the nature and circumstances of what the allegations were,\" and did not tell her of the \"potential punishments\" in order for her to ask petitioner to come to the police station.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In short, rather than improperly bolstering the victim's account, Lieutenant Watson's and Sergeant Donlon's testimony merely served to provide background information and explain their subsequent actions in pursuing the investigation. The Third Department did not unreasonably apply\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   in rejecting petitioner's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Failure to Argue a Violation of the\n     <em>\n      Ex Post Facto\n     </em>\n     Clause\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Hughes contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object and preserve \"the\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   violation contained [in] Count One of the Indictment-Predatory Sexual Assault Against a Child.\" Petitioner argued on direct appeal that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance because, among other things, he did not \"raise an objection with respect to the\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   nature of the top count\" of the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Hughes first advanced this\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   challenge in his post-trial motion to set aside the verdict.

Although petitioner argued on direct appeal that he was deprived of a fair trial because the prosecution \"improperly used\" Dr. Hamill's testimony in order to draw similarities between the victim's behavior and behaviors consistent with the victims of sexual abuse, he did not specifically argue that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to that testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Additionally, although Hughes argued conclusorily in his CPL \u00a7 440.10 motion that trial counsel \"[f]ailed to object to the scope of the People's expert testifying on\" CSAAS, that claim was plainly record-based and should have been raised on direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046877\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/510/382/#p390\">\n    510 F.3d at 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A] motion to vacate based on facts visible on the trial record must be dismissed\n   where the defendant unjustifiably failed to raise the issue on direct appeal.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   In any event, however, Hughes's claim is plainly meritless. Petitioner does not identify with specificity what questions posed by the prosecutor to Dr. Hamill to which trial counsel purportedly should have objected, or what aspect of Dr. Hamill's testimony was constitutionally improper. The Third Department rejected petitioner's standalone claim that Dr. Hamill's testimony should have been precluded, explaining that it\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   is well settled that testimony to explain the range of behaviors of sexually abused children-including why they may delay in reporting sexual abuse-may be admitted as beyond the ordinary understanding of the average juror.

Trial counsel opposed the prosecution's pretrial motion in limine to introduce the testimony of an expert on CSAAS to explain in general terms the behavior of abuse victims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Moreover, Dr. Hamill's testimony at trial was limited to CSAAS in general. On direct examination, he explicitly stated he was not testifying with regard to whether C.D. was a victim of sexual abuse. During cross-examination, trial counsel elicited testimony reiterating that Dr. Hamill \"knew very little about the specific factual allegations [in] this case,\" had never met the victim, had not reviewed any of \"her documents\" or \"any notes,\" and was not testifying to offer an opinion as to whether or not petitioner was guilty. Notably, petitioner also presented his own expert, Dr. Jacqueline Bashkoff, who testified regarding CSAAS in general.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Based upon the foregoing, even if it can be said that trial counsel \"[f]ailed to object to the scope of\" Dr. Hamill's testimony on CSAAS, the Third Department plainly considered, and found proper, Dr. Hamill's testimony in the context of the trial record. There is no basis on which to conclude trial counsel's strategy with respect to countering the prosecution's expert was deficient, or that further objection to the expert's testimony would have swayed the state courts to reach a different conclusion. Accordingly, this basis for petitioner's ineffective-assistance claim is lacking in merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Failure to Interview and/or Call Certain Prospective Witnesses\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Hughes contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to interview, and/or call as trial, certain \"critical witnesses\" who would have established his innocence. More specifically, petitioner argues that counsel unreasonably failed to investigate or call at trial the following\n   prospective witnesses: (1) petitioner's wife (C.D.'s mother); (2) Meghan Hughes (petitioner's sister); (3) Linda Hughes (petitioner's mother); and (4) Patrick \"Rico\" Hughes (petitioner's son). Respondent argues the petitioner's claim is without merit because trial counsel was concerned about the credibility of petitioner's wife, and argues that petitioner failed to provide information to trial counsel regarding these individuals that would have necessitated interviews with those individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   While this action was stayed, Hughes raised this argument in a counseled CPL \u00a7 440.10 motion. In support of his motion, petitioner filed affidavits from each of the witnesses at issue, and he attached the same affidavits to his original petition in this action. The affidavits supplied by Hughes asserted, in essence, that petitioner could not, and would not, have committed the acts alleged by C.D., who the affiants characterized as dishonest and manipulative. Petitioner's wife averred,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that (1) she was never interviewed by trial counsel, (2) she never observed petitioner abusing the victim, (3) petitioner could not have sexually assaulted the victim in the garage of their residence in the summer of 2006\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   because (a) he \"could not obtain an erection\" when he was intoxicated, (b) the garage was too cluttered to complete an assault there, (c) if petitioner were ever left home alone with the victim, petitioner \"would have been in bed drunk and asleep\" and would not have had sufficient time to assault the victim, and (4) petitioner could not have sexually assaulted the victim in petitioner's camping trailer in the summer of 2009\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   because the camper was \"small and cramped\" and offered no privacy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Hughes's sister averred,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that (1) she \"believe[s] that [petitioner] is innocent,\" (2) even if she and other family members left petitioner and the victim home alone on one occasion to purchase dinner, as the victim claimed happened preceding the summer 2006 incident, the family members returned home \"no more than 15 minutes\" later and petitioner was drunk in bed, (3) the garage where that alleged sexual assault occurred had \"junk all over the floors,\" (4) the victim regularly lied \"to get her way\" and never reported being abused before her allegations precipitating the prosecution, and (5) on one occasion in the past, the victim stated that she was \"going to come up with something that is going to put [petitioner] in jail for the rest of his life.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Hughes's mother averred,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that (1) she did not live in the same house as petitioner and the victim, (2) the victim never complained to her that petitioner\n   was abusing her, (3) the victim \"would frequently lie, deceive and generally act out to try and get what she wanted or to get her way with things,\" and (4) petitioner could not have assaulted the victim at petitioner's camp because (a) petitioner told his mother that \"he could not go to camp that summer\" due to \"financial troubles\" and (b) someone would have heard or seen the assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Finally, Hughes's son averred,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that (1) on the night of the alleged garage assault in the summer of 2006, he, petitioner's wife, and petitioner's sister left the residence for \"no more than ten (10) minutes\" to pick up dinner, (2) there was \"no room at all for anyone to lay down in the garage\" due to \"boxes, trash and other objects,\" (3) the family did not go to the camp during the summer of 2009, (4) the victim had a reputation for lying, and (5) petitioner \"drank too much and he abused\" his son, but could not have committed the crimes charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The prosecution opposed Hughes's motion and filed as exhibits trial counsel's witness list, which listed petitioner's wife as a potential witnesses along with an affidavit from petitioner's trial counsel. In his affidavit, trial counsel asserted that his \"two-fold\" strategy at trial was to present (1) testimony that petitioner \"was coerced to provide a false confession\" and (2) expert testimony related to CSAAS, a \"controversial and oft-litigated condition,\" for the purpose of \"undermin[ing]\" the victim's credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Trial counsel averred that the affidavit proffered by Hughes's wife was \"woefully inaccurate,\" particularly regarding \"whether [he] interviewed\" her. Counsel recalled that he met with petitioner on multiple occasions to discuss the case, that petitioner's wife was present and \"actively engaged in\" the discussion \"at all of our meetings,\" and frequently asked questions, answered questions, \"offered suggestions\" on the defense, and \"often commented on the evidence against\" petitioner. Petitioner's wife \"believed that ... the victim was lying\" and, according to counsel, \"fully supported [his] defense strategy.\" Additionally, counsel averred that he had over \"sixteen telephone conferences with\" petitioner, and that petitioner's wife was \"on speaker phone actively participating in\" \"[m]any of\" those conversations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Counsel asserted that he \"at one point ... contemplated\" calling Hughes's wife as a witness at trial, but, based on his many interactions with her, \"made the strategic decision\" not to call her. He had \"concerns about her appearance of credibility to the jury\" because she \"did not appear candid as to many of the important issues regarding\" petitioner's case, and \"had an excuse for each piece of evidence against him[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   On the prosecution's direct case, C.D. testified that she had, \"very early on,\" disclosed Hughes's abuse to her mother, who had \"minimized the seriousness of the abuse\" and \"discouraged\" C.D. from reporting it to anyone else.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Counsel \"[f]ear[ed] that\" C.D.'s account would place C.D.'s \"credibility directly at odds with\" that of her mother, \"or worse, require\" her mother to answer questions on cross-examination about that conversation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   With respect to C.D.'s credibility, trial counsel averred that, during his investigation, \"several instances\" of C.D.'s \"deceitful behavior\" and \"fabrication of minute details became known to\" him. Nevertheless, counsel decided to present this evidence only through cross-examination, due to his concern that the prosecution's \"countervailing theory that the victim's overall\n   behavior was due to her being a victim of abuse,\" a prospect to which he \"did not want to draw the jury's attention[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Counsel asserted that he also \"invited [Hughes] and [his wife] to provide insight into the family dynamic, the background of camp in the Town of Berne, and the overall behavior of the victim.\" At no point did petitioner or his wife \"mention any of the information sworn to in the affidavits\" proffered by petitioner in support of his motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Finally, counsel noted that he had also interviewed C.D.'s \"Aunt Faith and Uncle Tim\" prior to trial. Contrary to the assertions of Hughes and his wife, however, counsel found that these prospective witnesses \"could provide no meaningful testimony\" on petitioner's behalf, and what little they could provide \"would drastically undermine the theory of [petitioner's] defense[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The Albany County Supreme Court rejected Hughes's argument, explaining as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   Without submitting any affidavit from trial counsel or explaining the lack thereof, defendant has submitted affidavits from family members who did not testify at trial and asserts that trial counsel failed to properly investigate issues and without any good or strategic reason failed to call these people as witnesses. However, the list of potential witnesses makes it clear that defense counsel did consider calling defendant's wife as a witness but elected not to do so. Furthermore, defense counsel has refuted defendant's current claims concerning defense counsel not having interviewed defendant's wife in an effort to determine if her testimony would be helpful to him. It is noted that two children who lived in the house with defendant did testify for the prosecution at trial. These witnesses corroborated the victim's account of various incidents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   Defendant has failed to meet his burden of establishing any absence of strategic or other legitimate explanations for defense counsel's representation at trial. At trial, defense counsel attacked the credibility of the victim and the police actions in obtaining defendant's statement, vigorously cross-examined the prosecution witnesses and presented an expert to refute the conclusions of the prosecution expert. The prosecutor has submitted an affidavit from defense counsel detailing his numerous contacts with defendant's wife and defense counsel's concerns about the wife's credibility. The court record indicates that, in listing defendant's wife as a potential witness, defense counsel had clearly considered calling [her] as a witness but, in the end, did not call her. T he record thus supports the statements made by defense counsel in his affidavit such that it is not simply a matter of defendant saying one thing and defense counsel, without support in the record, saying another. Defense counsel's vigorous defense evinced a reasonable defense strategy. Defendant's present attempt to characterize it as otherwise and to submit statements from persons who were not present when the crime occurred, and which do not offer an alibi, are insufficient to establish, or even suggest, ineffectiveness. It is noted that in making a statement to the police, defendant mentioned various details which the police had not told him about when they explained what the victim had reported to them. These details supplied by defendant supported the credibility of the allegations. The statements in the affidavits, by family members who were not present during the two charged crimes, are insufficient to overcome this proof or to require a hearing on any material fact. Clearly, defense counsel was well\n   prepared to try this case and exerted significant effort on defendant's behalf. Defendant has not made a sufficient showing that there was any lack of strategic explanation for defense counsel's course of action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The state court reasonably concluded trial counsel was not ineffective for refraining from calling Hughes's wife as a witness or from interviewing the other individuals identified by petitioner. Regarding petitioner's wife, as the \u00a7 440.10 court found, trial counsel stated in his affidavit that he conducted several in-person and telephone meetings with petitioner for which petitioner's wife was present, invited petitioner's wife to provide certain information, and listed petitioner's wife on the witness list. Trial counsel stated he ultimately made a \"strategic decision\" not to call her as a witness due to credibility concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Regarding the other individuals, trial counsel stated that prior to trial, he \"thoroughly discussed his trial strategy and defense\" with Hughes and his wife and \"[a]t no point did [petitioner] or [petitioner's wife] mention any of the information sworn to in the affidavits\" provided by these individuals. In any event, the state court reasonably concluded that petitioner's claim was without merit, noting the \"statements in the affidavits ... [from individuals] who were not present during the two charged crimes, are insufficient to overcome this proof or to require a hearing on any material fact.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The decision \"regarding whether to call witnesses on behalf of a defendant, and, if so, which witnesses to call, is a tactical decision that generally should not be disturbed on habeas review.\"\n   <em>\n    Baptiste v.

Petitioner contends trial counsel \"could have sought corroborating testimony from [p]etitioner's family\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   could have presented objective, corroborating documentation in the form of financial records as circumstantial evidence that [p]etitioner never went to Berne, New York in the summer of 2009 because of financial difficulty.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The Albany County Supreme Court reasonably rejected this claim. Among other things, the trial noted that the individuals who submitted affidavits \"were not present\n   when the crimes occurred[.]\" Moreover, the trail court observed that petitioner's trial counsel asserted that he \"thoroughly discussed his trial strategy and defense, including [petitioner's] testimony,\" with petitioner and his wife, and expressly \"invited\" them to provide information regarding \"the background of camp in the Town of Berne[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The state court credited trial counsel's assertion that they did not provide the information referenced in the affidavits submitted by Hughes, and this Court finds no basis for upsetting that determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cardoza v.

In any event, as respondent notes, it is not clear how petitioner's financial difficulties would have established that he did not visit the camp in the summer of 2009, and counsel reasonably pursued the theory that no sexual encounter ever took place rather than focusing on the specific date of the alleged incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <strong>\n    6.\n    <em>\n     Failure to Present Certain Other Evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Hughes contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present \"strong evidence rebutting many of the charges\" and for failing to \"meaningfully attack\" the victim's credibility. Petitioner appears to refer to the following as the purported evidence: (1) testimony and affidavits from \"character witnesses,\" who allegedly could have impeached the victim; (2) \"notes from CPS which indicate the [victim] was regularly considered untruthful and manipulative;\" and (3) photographs of locations where incidents occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The record supports the state court's observations that trial counsel \"attacked\" the victim's credibility, presented a \"vigorous defense,\" and \"evinced a reasonable defense strategy.\" Trial counsel challenged the victim's credibility during his opening statement, elicited testimony from the victim that she was untruthful at times, and questioned the victim's credibility during his summation by noting the victim was untruthful, had a motive to lie, and provided few details about the extensive abuse that she was alleging.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   As noted above, Hughes's wife, sister, mother, and son averred that C.D. was untruthful.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, trial counsel explained that he made a \"strategic decision\" to highlight the victim's purported dishonesty primarily through cross-examination because he \"did not want to draw the jury's attention\" to the prosecution's \"countervailing theory\" that the victim was dishonest or deceitful as a result of the abuse she suffered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   That strategy was not an unreasonable one. \"The decision to call, or not call, a witness is a classic example of trial strategy,\" and the decision of \"whether to call a specific witness-even ones that might offer exculpatory evidence-is ordinarily not viewed as a lapse in professional representation.' \"\n   <em>\n    Moore v.

Here, trial counsel made strategic decisions to refrain from calling certain witnesses, including witnesses to statements unrelated to the incidents at issue. The state court reasonably found that this decision did not constitute ineffective assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Regarding the CPS notes, Hughes filed certain \"Family Services Progress Notes,\" documenting conversations case workers had in 2011 with the victim and/or the victim's aunt (with whom the victim resided after petitioner posted bail).

The photographs of the trailer also do not appear to seriously undermine C.D.'s trial testimony, which was that the encounter occurred on the bed in the trailer, outside the presence of the other children, and lasted only a brief time. Similarly, counsel could have reasonably concluded that photographs of the garage, merely depicting its messiness, would not have been a persuasive strategy for countering C.D.'s allegation that petitioner assaulted her there.

Specifically, petitioner claims that he suffered from erectile dysfunction during the time of the incidents and that this condition would have precluded him from committing the offenses. He contends that trial counsel should have obtained his medical records and interviewed his wife regarding his condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   In rejecting this claim, the Albany County Supreme Court concluded that trial counsel contemplated calling Hughes's wife as a witness at trial and \"refuted [petitioner's] current claims\" that he failed to interview\n   his wife to determine if her testimony would be helpful to the defense. The affidavit from Hughes's wife, which was prepared after petitioner was convicted, asserts that he \"could not obtain an erection\" when he was \"heavily intoxicated.\" However, the affidavit does not establish that petitioner was diagnosed as suffering from erectile dysfunction, and the trial evidence supported the conclusion that petitioner's wife was not present during the trip to the camp at issue or the assault in the garage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Moreover, Hughes has not alleged, much less shown, that he provided this information or medical records to trial counsel during any of their numerous meetings, and counsel asserted that neither petitioner nor his wife advised him of any of the matters set forth in his wife's affidavit. Accordingly, the state court reasonably determined trial counsel was not ineffective in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   <strong>\n    8.\n    <em>\n     Failure to Present an Expert Witness Regarding False Confessions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Hughes argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for pursuing the strategy of \"claiming a coerced confession\" without consulting with, or calling as a witness, an expert on the subject of false confessions. Petitioner claims his confession was a result of interrogation techniques that were \"overwhelmingly deceptive and coercive,\" and which a typical juror \"would not understand ... without expert assistance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   There is no basis on which to conclude that the state court unreasonably rejected this claim. As an initial matter, Hughes has not established that testimony from a false confessions expert would have been admissible under New York law at the time of his trial. New York courts have long rejected attempts by defense counsel to call a false confessions expert and found that the failure to call such an expert does not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Curry v.

Both the transcript of the interrogation filed by Hughes and the video recording of the interrogation, which was played for the jury at trial, support the conclusion that petitioner's statements were voluntarily made after\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings were provided. While Lieutenant Watson did convey to petitioner that \"there is a range of things that happen to people [he] see[s],\" including that some \"get probation,\" \"some go to jail,\" and \"most of the time we send people out to get help\" and \"go to classes and stuff like that,\" he never assured petitioner of any particular outcome to the investigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Additionally, Lieutenant Watson showed Hughes a pair of underwear purportedly saved by C.D. after a sexual encounter and asserted that semen was discovered on them.

Under the circumstances, neither the recorded interrogation nor the trial\n   testimony of the witnesses supports the proposition that petitioner's will was overborne by any deceptive tactics employed by the police officers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1792614\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/850/894/#p901\">\n    850 F.2d at 900\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   In sum, appellate counsel's decision not to challenge the voluntariness of Hughes's admissions on direct appeal was a matter of reasonable strategy in the selection of arguments to pursue, rather than a deficiency in performance. Moreover, neither the state court record nor the Third Department's observation, in discussing the weight of the evidence, that petitioner was \"clear[ly] ... not coerced\" suggest that, had appellate counsel advanced this argument, he would have prevailed.

As discussed above, C.D. testified that the encounter underlying the predatory sexual assault charge occurred during the summer between her time in fifth grade and sixth grade, and as, petitioner acknowledged, that summer break started in late June 2006. Petitioner argues that \"the first day of summer during that year was June 21, 2006.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   The Court takes judicial notice of the fact that June 21, 2006, was a Wednesday. During his videotaped interview, which was admitted into evidence and played for the jury, petitioner stated that \"people were at the house\" on the day of the garage encounter, and that it was a weekend. As a result, the record supports the conclusion that the jury convicted petitioner of count one based upon conduct that occurred on or after June 23, 2006, the effective date of the statute and as alleged in the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     Legal Sufficiency of Other Counts and Double Jeopardy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   Hughes contends that his convictions upon counts two, three, and four were also unsupported by legally sufficient evidence. Petitioner further contends that his convictions upon counts two, three, and four \"must be vacated as the evidence is deficient and [he] is exposed to multiple punishments for the same conduct\" in violation of principles of double jeopardy. Finally, petitioner argues that the prosecution's \"charging strategy\" gave him \"inadequate notice\" with respect to these counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   Count two charged Hughes with first degree rape and alleged that, on \"an unknown date on or about and in between June 25, 2009 and September 9, 2009,\" he engaged in sexual intercourse with C.D. by forcible compulsion at his camp in East Berne, New York. Count three charged petitioner with second degree rape and alleged that he engaged in sexual intercourse with C.D. when she was less than fifteen years old, during the same timeframe and at the same location as alleged in count two. Count four charged petitioner with endangering the welfare of a child and alleged that, between June 23, 2006 and September 9, 2009, he \"repeatedly subjected [C.D.] to various acts of sexual conduct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Regarding Counts Two, Three, and Four\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   On direct appeal, Hughes argued that his predatory sexual assault against a child conviction was not supported by legally sufficient evidence because the prosecution \"failed to establish that this alleged offense occurred between\" the dates alleged in the indictment. Petitioner also argued that the conviction for \"this offense\" was against the weight of the evidence. In concluding his weight argument, petitioner contended conclusorily that \"[t]he same is true with respect to the remaining charges upon which [he] was convicted.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   The Third Department held that the jury's verdict was not contrary to the weight of the evidence, namely because (1) Hughes's admissions of \"oral sexual conduct and sexual intercourse with the victim,\" including \"telling details\" that he supplied in his interview with law enforcement, and (2) the victim's \"unequivocal[ ]\" testimony concerning the incidents at issue, as well as the jury's weighing of her credibility, which was \"fully explored at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3823639\" index=\"311\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/114/1021/#p1021\">\n    114 A.D.3d at 1022\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3823639\" index=\"312\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/114/1021/#p1021\">\n    981 N.Y.S.2d 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Second, even if petitioner had properly exhausted his legal sufficiency claim on these counts by arguing that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, this argument would be without merit for the reasons set forth in respondent's memorandum of law.

This was the only incident at the camp about which C.D. testified. C.D. also testified that, during the relevant time period, petitioner, among other things, touched her buttocks and fondled her breasts. C.D.'s stepbrother and stepsister testified that they both witnessed petitioner (their biological father) touch C.D.'s breasts \"once in a while\" and \"[o]ccasionally,\" and her stepbrother recalled petitioner stating to C.D., \"they're mine until you're 18.\" In sum, the convictions were supported by legally sufficient evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Double Jeopardy-Related Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   On direct appeal, Hughes argued that the predatory sexual assault against a child, first degree rape, and second degree rape counts (i.e., counts one, two, and three) were duplicitous because C.D. testified\n   that petitioner engaged in sexual intercourse with her ten or more times, but could provide no specific dates for those occurrences. He also argued that count six, charging endangering the welfare of a child, was duplicitous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   The Third Department held that count six was not duplicitous, but concluded that Hughes's other duplicity-related contentions were among those arguments not preserved for review.\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3823639\" index=\"348\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/114/1021/#p1021\">\n    114 A.D.3d at 1024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3823639\" index=\"349\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/114/1021/#p1021\">\n    981 N.Y.S.2d 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
