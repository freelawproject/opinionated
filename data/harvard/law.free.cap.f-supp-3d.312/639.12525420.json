The lawsuit,\n   <em>\n    Coley v. Lucas Cnty., et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 3:08CV9 (N.D.

(Doc. 17 at \u00b6\u00b6 2-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Pending are the parties' counter-motions for summary judgment. (Docs. 30, 32). For the following reasons, I grant Clarendon's motion and deny Lexington's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Death of Carlton Benton\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After Benton had received medical care on May 30, 2004, at a hospital in Toledo, sheriff's deputies returned him to the county jail. (\n   <em>\n    Coley\n   </em>\n   Cmplt. at \u00b6\u00b6 9-11). Benton, who had resisted the deputies while at the hospital, was wearing leg irons, handcuffs, and a belly chain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 12, 15). As the deputies escorted Benton to the jail's medical wing, Deputy Jay Schmeltz, allegedly upset at Benton's earlier show of resistance, shoved Benton from behind, causing him to trip over his feet, knock his head against a wall, and fall on the floor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 18-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Schmeltz and the other deputies picked Benton off the floor and proceeded to the medical wing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24). There Benton began to \"squirm around\" and \"struggle\" as the deputies placed him on a bed and tried to remove his restraints. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27). Sergeant John Gray grabbed Benton from behind and put him in a choke hold. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28). Benton began \"to gasp for air, making choking and ... gurgling sounds,\" but Gray did not release him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29). A few seconds later, Benton \"went limp and was completely unconscious.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The deputies left the room and did not seek medical attention for Benton. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 31-32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Ten minutes later, a deputy doing rounds entered Benton's cell and found him unconscious and not breathing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34). An ambulance took Benton to the hospital, where, on June 1, medical staff declared him brain dead. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 34-35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The county coroner performed an autopsy and found no signs of trauma or foul play. (Doc. 32-1 at 8-9). Nor did the coroner detect damage to Benton's neck. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8). In October, 2004, the coroner returned a verdict that Benton died of a seizure disorder associated with Welbutrin use. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Meanwhile, in early June, 2004, the Lucas County Corrections Administrator opened an internal-affairs investigation into Benton's death. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The officer in charge, Captain Robert McBroom, interviewed the deputies who transported Benton from the hospital to the jail. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Schmeltz and Gray filed reports that made no mention of Schmeltz shoving Benton or Gray placing him in a choke hold. (\n   <em>\n    Coley\n   </em>\n   Cmplt. at \u00b6 38). But another deputy, Pat Mangold, told McBroom that Benton had been \"choked to death\" by Sergeant Gray. (McBroom Dep. at 92).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Nevertheless, the county closed the investigation after the coroner reported that there were no signs of trauma to support Deputy Mangold's claim. (Doc. 32-1 at 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Four years later, in March, 2008, the county reopened the investigation when a former employee, Tina Anaya, alleged that Gray, Schmeltz, and others had been \"jumping, and stomping and kicking and punching and smothering [Benton's] face and choking him.\" (Stipulated Exh. Q). This caused the coroner to opine that, had she previously known that a deputy placed Benton in a choke hold, she likely would have ruled Benton's cause of death \"undetermined.\" (Beisser Dep. at 74-75). Ultimately, in 2010, the coroner revised her verdict to identify the cause of death as homicide. (Doc. 32-1 at 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   County prosecutors referred the matter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. During that investigation, 1) Schmeltz told FBI agents that he did not see Gray use a choke hold; 2) Gray claimed that he saw Benton moving and breathing after he released him from the choke hold; and 3) Telb-who allegedly knew that Gray choked Benton to death and lied about it-denied that Gray had used a choke hold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The Insurance Dispute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Policies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Clarendon issued a Municipal Retained Amount policy to Lucas County that was effective from January 1, 2004, until January 1, 2005. The policy contained a $5 million aggregate limit and a $500,000 \"Retained Amount\" (i.e., a deductible).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Lexington, in contrast, issued Municipal Retained Amount policies to Lucas County for the periods of April 1, 2007, to April 1, 2008, and April 1, 2008, to April 1, 2009. Like the Clarendon policy, each Lexington policy had a $5 million limit and a $500,000 Retained Amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Three features of Lexington's policy are critical here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   First, the policy's \"Insuring Agreement\" provides that Lexington \"will pay on behalf of the Insured that portion of the Ultimate Net Loss in excess of the Retained Amount or Other Insurance, whichever is greater, which the Insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages and related Claims Expenses because of Bodily Injury, Property Damage, Personal and Advertising Injury or Public Officials' Errors or Omissions.\" (Doc. 10-2 at 146).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Under the policy, \"Other Insurance\" means \"any other insurance paid on behalf of the Insured for damages which affords coverage with respect to injury, damages or acts to which this policy also applies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Second, coverage under the Lexington policy for \"Public Officials' Errors and Omissions\" is available only for \"such damages that are caused by a Wrongful Act that is first discovered or becomes manifest during the Policy Period.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The policy defines \"Public Officials' Errors and\n   Omissions\" as \"any and all Wrongful Acts by an Insured in the performance of their duties for the Named Insured.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 121). A \"Wrongful Act,\" in turn, means \"any actual or alleged error or misstatement, omission, act of neglect or breach of duty or actual or alleged violation of federal or state civil rights.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 122).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Third, the Lexington policy does not cover \"Public Officials' Errors and Omissions arising out of Bodily Injury[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 113). The term \"Bodily Injury\" refers to \"bodily injury, sickness or disease sustained by a person.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 117). It also includes \"death\" when \"resulting from such bodily injury, sickness or disease.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Earlier Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In December, 2008, Lucas County tendered the\n   <em>\n    Coley\n   </em>\n   litigation to Clarendon for defense and indemnification. (Doc. 9 at \u00b6 4). Clarendon accepted the tender subject to a reservation of rights, though it advised Lucas County that its obligations under the policy would not arise until the county satisfied the policy's $500,000 retained amount. (Stipulated Exh. U at 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Lucas County's legal expenses exceeded the retained amount in early or mid-June, 2016. (Stipulated Exh. AT at 1). Thereafter, Clarendon paid $213,991.42 in litigation expenses and $1,280,000.00 to settle the case. (Doc. 31-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 39-40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Meanwhile, in February, 2015, Lucas County also demanded that Lexington cover the\n   <em>\n    Coley\n   </em>\n   litigation. (Stipulated Exh. AE). Lexington refused, however, as it likewise refused Clarendon's subsequent demand for contribution. That refusal gives rise to this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Clarendon's Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Clarendon's complaint raises a claim for equitable contribution and requests that I issue a declaratory judgment that Lexington must contribute to the expenses incurred in, and the settlement of, the\n   <em>\n    Coley\n   </em>\n   litigation. (Doc. 9 at \u00b6\u00b6 24-35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Equitable Contribution\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \"The aim of equitable contribution is to apportion a loss between two or more insurers who cover the same risk, so that each pays its fair share and one does not profit at the expense of the other.\" 16 Couch on Insurance \u00a7 222:98.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \"Under Ohio law, courts may allocate liability among multiple insurers in certain contexts, such as when all insurers at issue provide primary coverage or when all provide second-tier excess coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    IMG Worldwide, Inc. v.

Whether Lexington Is an Excess Insurer\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Lexington first argues that it is an excess insurer\n   <em>\n    vis-a-vis\n   </em>\n   the claims in the\n   <em>\n    Coley\n   </em>\n   litigation. (Doc. 30-1 at 16-22). This argument relies on language in the policy's \"Insuring Agreement\" stating that Lexington will pay \"that portion of the Ultimate Net Loss\n   <em>\n    in excess of the Retained Amount or Other Insurance, whichever is greater\n   </em>\n   \" that its insured becomes obligated to pay. (Doc. 10-2 at 146) (emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   According to Lexington, this language means that it has no obligation to cover a claim \"unless and until the greater of the 'Retained Amount' or 'Other Insurance' is properly exhausted.\" (Doc. 30-1 at 17) (internal emphasis omitted). Because Clarendon's policy qualifies as \"Other Insurance,\" and because Clarendon paid only about $1.5 million of its $5 million policy limit, Lexington argues that it has no obligation to contribute to the\n   <em>\n    Coley\n   </em>\n   litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Clarendon responds that Lexington is a co-primary insurer, not an excess insurer, as to the\n   <em>\n    Coley\n   </em>\n   litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   It relies on the Lexington policy's definition of \"Other Insurance\" as \"any other insurance\n   <em>\n    paid on behalf of the insured for damages\n   </em>\n   which affords coverage with respect to injury, damage or acts to which this policy also applies.\" (Doc. 10-2 at 146) (emphasis supplied). According to Clarendon, an insurance policy is not \"Other Insurance\" unless it has, in fact, paid damages on behalf of the insured; absent such a payment, Clarendon contends, the other policy does not qualify as \"Other Insurance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Because Clarendon had not made any payments on Lucas County's behalf as of either early or mid-June, 2016 (when Lucas County exhausted its deductible) or August 22, 2016 (when the\n   <em>\n    Coley\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs accepted the offer of judgment and settled the case), Clarendon argues that its policy is not \"Other Insurance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Lexington's Policy Is Not Excess to Clarendon's Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Given the specific definition of \"Other Insurance\" in the Lexington policy, I conclude that the Clarendon policy does not qualify as \"Other Insurance,\" and that the Lexington policy is therefore not excess to the Clarendon policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Lexington policy defines \"Other Insurance\" with express reference to sums already paid on behalf of the insured for damages the insured has incurred: \"Other Insurance means any other insurance\n   <em>\n    paid on behalf of the insured for damages\n   </em>\n   which affords coverage with respect to injury, damages or acts to which this policy also applies.\" (Doc. 10-2 at 146) (emphasis supplied). Here, however, it is undisputed that when Lexington's coverage obligations arose, Clarendon had not \"paid on behalf of [Lucas County] for damages[.]\" Thus its policy is not \"Other Insurance\" under the Lexington policy, and Lexington's policy is not excess to the Clarendon policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   I granted Lexington leave to file a sur-reply addressing this issue in greater detail (non-document entry of Feb. 15, 2018), but the arguments it put forth are unconvincing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Lexington contends that focusing on \"the past-tense term 'paid' ignores the import\n   of the term in the context of the Lexington policies' 'Insuring Agreement.' \" (Doc. 35 at 2). According to Lexington, the Insuring Agreement \"contemplates a\n   <em>\n    prospective\n   </em>\n   obligation\" to pay damages that its insured becomes obligated to pay in the future. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (emphasis in original). But focusing on the term \"paid\" would, in Lexington's view, \"have the effect of removing the clause 'or Other Insurance, whichever is greater,' subject to the other insurer's timing in writing a check[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   That conclusion does not follow from Lexington's premise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Lexington is correct, of course, that the Insuring Agreement contemplates a prospective obligation. The policy guarantees that if Lucas County \"becomes legally obligated to pay ... damages\" that the policy covers, Lexington will pay that portion of the damages that is \"in excess of ... Other Insurance.\" (Doc. 10-2 at 146). But pointing out the prospective nature of this obligation does not answer the question whether a given loss that occurs in the future is \"in excess of ... Other Insurance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Lexington told Lucas County that it would act as an excess insurer only if a given loss were \"excess to ... other insurance paid on behalf of [the county] for damages[.]\" Because Clarendon's policy had not \"paid on behalf of the insured for damages\" owed in the\n   <em>\n    Coley\n   </em>\n   litigation, that policy is not \"Other Insurance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Rather than confronting the significance of the \"Other Insurance\" definition, Lexington falls back on public-policy concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   It contends that interpreting \"Other Insurance\" to encompass only those policies that have already paid damages on behalf of the insured \"would create a perverse incentive for [another] insurer\" to delay paying a loss in the hopes that an ostensible excess insurer \"could be 'brought in' as a co-primary insurer.\" (Doc. 35 at 3). Even if that were true, however, the incentive would arise, not from my adoption of an otherwise debatable construction of Lexington's policy, but from the way Lexington chose to define \"Other Insurance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   On this score it is worth noting that Lexington has not cited a single case involving an insurance policy with a similar definition of \"other insurance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   I searched for such a case, moreover, but I could not find one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   To the contrary, the policies in the cases I reviewed tended to define \"other insurance\" as an insurance policy that is simply \"available to\" an insured-regardless of whether the policy has also \"paid on behalf of the insured for damages[.]\"\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Viking Pump, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188318\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/148/633/#p661\">\n    148 A.3d 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 661 (Del. 2016) (\"other insurance means any other valid and collectible insurance ... which is available to the Insured\");\n   <em>\n    Jensen v.

Rather, this \"Other Insurance\" clause would, like its counterpart in the Insuring Agreement, simply apply in a more limited set of cases, given the narrow definition of \"Other Insurance.\" More importantly, any such problem-which this case does not even present-flows directly from the Lexington policy's seemingly peculiar definition of \"Other Insurance.\" Accordingly, I will not ignore the policy's definition of \"Other Insurance\" and thereby relieve Lexington of its obligation to cover the\n   <em>\n    Coley\n   </em>\n   litigation in order to avert a hypothetical problem that may or may not arise in an entirely different context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Because Clarendon's policy is not \"Other Insurance\" under the Lexington policy, Lexington is not an excess insurer as to the\n   <em>\n    Coley\n   </em>\n   litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Whether a Wrongful Act Was \"First Discovered or Bec[a]me[ ] Manifest\" During the Lexington Policy Period\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Clarendon argues that Lexington has an obligation to indemnify Lucas County because its policy covers damages that are \"because of ... Public Officials' Errors and Omissions.\" (Doc. 10-2 at 106). Coverage is available under that section, however, only if the damages are \"caused by a Wrongful Act that is first discovered or becomes manifest during the Policy Period\"-i.e., from April 1, 2007, until April 1, 2009. (Doc. 10-2 at 106).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Parties' Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Lexington argues that the wrongful acts that caused or contributed to Benton's death-Schmeltz's shoving of Benton from behind, Gray's use of a choke hold, and the collective failure to treat Benton-manifested \"at the time of [Benton's] death\" in 2004. (Doc. 30-1 at 23). According to Lexington, Benton's death \"was the ultimate 'manifestation' of each alleged 'Wrongful Act' leading up to and causing his death.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Clarendon responds that, even if the wrongful acts first became manifest in 2004, Lexington still must cover the\n   <em>\n    Coley\n   </em>\n   litigation because those acts were also \"first discovered\" in 2008. (Doc. 32-1 at 29-30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   According to Clarendon, \"the wording of the grant of coverage\" for Public Officials' Errors and Omissions \"is in the disjunctive,\" such that coverage exists not only when a wrongful act first manifests during the policy period, but also when a wrongful act is first discovered during the policy period-regardless of whether a wrongful act also manifested earlier. (Doc. 32-1 at 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Relying on the\n   <em>\n    Coley\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs' allegations that they did not discover the wrongful acts until 2008-when Lucas County employee Tina Anaya exposed the cover-up surrounding Benton's death-Clarendon argues that the wrongful acts were \"first discovered\" during the Lexington policy period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In reply, Lexington contends that the wrongful acts were \"discovered\" in 2004 because those acts were \"known ... by the officers who committed and then purportedly sought to cover-up those alleged acts.\" (Doc. 33 at 18 n.8). It also argues that, because certain Lucas County employees beyond the perpetrators (most significantly, Tina Anaya) knew about the wrongful acts, I should impute that knowledge to the County. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The critical issue is when are wrongful acts-here, the shove, the choke hold, and the failure to provide needed medical care, among others-\"first discovered,\" or when do they \"become[ ] manifest,\" particularly when those who committed the wrongful acts intend to, and do successfully, cover them up for a lengthy period of time. That issue turns on related subsidiary questions: whose discovery of the \"Wrongful Acts\" counts, and to whom must they \"become[ ] manifest?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Neither party has cited any Ohio case law-or, indeed, any relevant authority from any jurisdiction-to support its argument. Each side's position, moreover, begs the question at issue: Lexington asserts, without any authority, that the perpetrators' or the county's knowledge is dispositive, just as Clarendon assumes, without any authority, that the\n   <em>\n    Coley\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs' knowledge controls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   To resolve the issue, I consulted Ohio case law discussing the kinds of events that can trigger coverage under an insurance policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Insurance Policies and Trigger Theories\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The Ohio courts have several approaches for determining when coverage under an insurance policy is \"triggered.\"\n   <em>\n    Lightening Rod, supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-3473\">\n    2016-Ohio-3473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at \u00b6 28,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=55%20N.E.3d%201174\">\n    55 N.E.3d 1174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006-Ohio-452\">\n    2006-Ohio-452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%20256881\">\n    2006 WL 256881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ohio App.) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   Under the \"manifestation trigger,\" coverage is triggered when property damage becomes known to the owner. Under the \"injury-in-fact trigger,\" coverage is triggered when the damage first occurs. Under the \"exposure trigger,\" coverage is triggered when the first injury-causing conditions occur. Finally, courts often apply the concept of \"continuous trigger\" if multiple policies are in effect over a period of time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Courts ordinarily apply these theories in cases involving \"occurrence-based\" liability policies, which \"cover[ ] ... damages\n   <em>\n    occurring\n   </em>\n   within the policy period.\"\n   <em>\n    Reynolds v. Celina Mut. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2000%20WL%20202107\">\n    2000 WL 202107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *3 (Ohio App.) (emphasis supplied). Because it is often debatable when damages \"occur,\" the court must select the appropriate event that triggers coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   In contrast to those cases, Lexington's grant of coverage for Public Officials Errors' and Omissions is expressly manifestation- or discovery-based. Accordingly, I can ignore the three other triggers and focus on the manifestation trigger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The Ohio cases applying the manifestation trigger suggest that the relevant party-the party whose discovery of the wrongful act or damages matters, and to whom such act or damage must manifest-is not the wrongdoer, but the \"victim\" of the wrongful act or the \"owner\" whose property is damaged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Plum, supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006-Ohio-452\">\n    2006-Ohio-452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at \u00b6 16 (\"Under the 'manifestation trigger,' coverage is triggered when property damage becomes\n   <em>\n    known to the owner\n   </em>\n   .\") (emphasis supplied);\n   <em>\n    GenCorp, Inc. v.

It is instead concerned with situations where an injury occurs or happens at one point, but the ascertainable or identifiable damages flowing from that injury do not \"manifest\" or become apparent until a later date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

In no way did his dying, of its own force, manifest the wrongful acts that caused his death. Benton's death was just that: a death. Even the county coroner, after performing an autopsy and conducting a lengthy investigation, found no trauma or damage to Benton's neck-and thus remained unaware of what had really transpired.

According to Lexington, \"the term 'arising out of' is given broad application under Ohio insurance law,\" such that all of the\n   <em>\n    Coley\n   </em>\n   claims arise out of Bodily Injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Clarendon, in contrast, contends that the exclusion does not apply because none of the wrongful acts arises out of Benton's death.

In that case, the Ohio Supreme Court held that an exclusion in a homeowner's policy for injuries \"arising out of\" premises that the insured owned, but that were not insured under the policy, applied only if the condition of the uninsured premises \"caused or contributed\" to the injury for which coverage was sought.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 544,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=948%20N.E.2d%20931\">\n    948 N.E.2d 931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Ohio) (discussing \"arising out of\" in context of supplemental jurisdiction); Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(a)(1)(A) (compulsory counterclaims are those that \"aris[e] out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   But Ohio insurance law gives that term a different, more restrictive meaning: it requires that what is excluded \"cause or\n   contribute to\" the injury, wrong, or damage. That means that the Bodily Injury must cause or contribute to the wrongful acts, yet in no sense did Benton's death at the hands of Schmeltz and Grey cause or contribute to Schmeltz's shove of Benton from behind or Gray's use of a choke hold. Indeed, taking that position would require me to find that effects produce causes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   For these reasons, I conclude the Bodily Injury exclusion does not apply to Counts One through Six of the\n   <em>\n    Coley\n   </em>\n   complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   However, I agree with Lexington that the Bodily Injury exclusion applies as to the remaining claims in Count Seven, alleging conspiracy, civil RICO, and aiding and abetting. These claims \"arise out of\" Benton's death because it was Benton's death that motivated the defendants to commit, and contributed to their decision to commit, the wrongful acts alleged in Count 7-i.e., lying to the FBI and submitting false reports designed to cover up their use of excessive force and failure to treat Benton.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Whether the 2008-2009 Lexington Policy Applies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Finally, Lexington argues that, even assuming that its policies \"potentially respond to the\n   <em>\n    Coley\n   </em>\n   litigation ... only one policy would be triggered.\" (Doc. 30 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   This argument relies on language in the \"Limits of Insurance\" section of the policy stating that \"Public Officials' Errors and Omissions arising out of a Wrongful Act which takes place over more than one Policy Period insured by [Lexington] shall be deemed as arising from a single and the same Wrongful Act[.]\" (Doc. 10-2 at 115). The policy also states that \"[n]o Public Officials' Errors and Omissions arising from the same loss or series of facts may become manifest in more than one policy period.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   According to Lexington, \"all of the claims of the\n   <em>\n    Coley\n   </em>\n   action 'arise from' the same 'loss' and 'series of facts' i.e. Benton's death (the 'loss') and the alleged acts and/or omissions surrounding his death.\" (Doc. 33 at 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Clarendon's briefs do not address this issue, and I therefore find that it has forfeited any argument in response. Furthermore, I agree with Lexington that, in light of the policy's plain language, only one of its policies-that for the policy period from April 1, 2007, to April 1, 2008-responds to the\n   <em>\n    Coley\n   </em>\n   action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Because the 2007-2008 Lexington policy requires it to contribute to the expenses incurred in and the settlement of the\n   <em>\n    Coley\n   </em>\n   litigation, Clarendon is entitled to summary judgment on its claim for equitable contribution and to a declaratory judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   I cannot enter a final judgment at this juncture, however, because it appears the parties have agreed that, in the event I denied Lexington's motion for summary judgment, Lexington would have an opportunity to raise issues of \"untimely notice\" by Lucas County and the alleged prejudice this caused Lexington. (Doc. 30-1 at 14 n.6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   It is, therefore,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   ORDERED THAT:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n   1.
