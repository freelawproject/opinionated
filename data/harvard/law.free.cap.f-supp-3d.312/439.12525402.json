Conner, Chief Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Metropolitan Group Property and Casualty Insurance Company (\"Metropolitan\") advances this action for declaratory judgment against defendant William Hack (\"Hack\"). (Doc. 1). Hack brings a counterclaim of bad faith pursuant to 42 PA. CONS. STAT. \u00a7 8371. (Doc. 14). Metropolitan moves to dismiss Hack's counterclaim for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) (\" Rule 12\"). For the reasons that follow, the court will grant the motion in part and deny it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. Factual Background &amp; Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Hack resides in Neelyton, Pennsylvania with his sister. (Doc. 1 \u00b6 2, 14; Doc. 14 \u00b6 2, 14). Metropolitan issued a personal automobile insurance policy to Hack's sister that covers Hack. (Doc. 1 \u00b6 8; Doc. 1-2 at 2; Doc. 14 \u00b6 8). Shortly after midnight on December 21, 2014, a motor vehicle struck his sister's home directly below Hack's second floor bedroom. (Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 9-10, 17-18; Doc. 14 \u00b6\u00b6 9-10, 17-18, 49). Hack was asleep at the time of the accident. (Doc. 1 \u00b6 17; Doc. 14 \u00b6 17). During two recorded statements, Hack told insurance investigators for Metropolitan and the driver's insurance company that the force of the impact threw him out of bed causing him to hit and break a desk. (Doc. 1 \u00b6 17-18; Doc. 14 \u00b6\u00b6 17-18, 23;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1-4; Doc. 1-5). Hack did not report any injuries the night of the accident. (Doc. 1 \u00b6 17-18; Doc. 14 \u00b6 17-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Following the accident, Hack experienced pain in his right arm and shoulder, and numbness in his fingertips. (Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 17-18; Doc. 14 \u00b6\u00b6 17-18). After a few months of self-treating with Ibuprofen, Hack obtained professional treatment at his family's insistence. (Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 17-18; Doc. 14 \u00b6\u00b6 17-18, 51). Hack saw an orthopedic surgeon who diagnosed him with C5 and C6 disc injuries and a pinched nerve. (Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 17-18; Doc. 14 \u00b6\u00b6 17-18). Hack underwent physical therapy for his injuries at the Fulton County Medical Center. (Doc. 1 \u00b6 17; Doc. 14 \u00b6 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Hack filed an insurance claim with Metropolitan for services rendered to treat his injuries arising from the motor vehicle accident. (Doc. 14 \u00b6\u00b6 16, 21-23, 52). As requested, Hack provided Metropolitan with medical bills and authorizations, photographs of the vehicle and home involved, a copy of the police accident report, a diagram, and a recorded statement. (Doc. 14 \u00b6\u00b6 43, 53, 56, 58, 59). Metropolitan retained an accident reconstruction expert in furtherance of its investigation into Hack's claim. (Doc. 1 \u00b6 26; Doc. 1-8). The expert's report indicates that the accident likely did not cause Hack's injuries. (Doc. 1 \u00b6 28;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Metropolitan filed a complaint on June 30, 2016 seeking declaratory judgment and punitive damages for common law fraud. (Doc. 1). In its complaint, Metropolitan alleges that Hack made a fraudulent insurance claim and misrepresented the cause and extent of his injuries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-35). The court dismissed Metropolitan's fraud claim pursuant to the gist of the action doctrine. (Doc. 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Hack filed an answer on May 22, 2017 and asserted a counterclaim against Metropolitan for bad faith under 42 PA. CONS. STAT. \u00a7 8371. (Doc. 14 \u00b6\u00b6 71-78). He alleges that Metropolitan violated Section 8371 when it acted in bad faith toward Hack as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (a) By unilaterally denying William Hack's medical claims without sufficient foundation to do so;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (b) By failing to utilize the ability to have William Hack to [sic] submit to a medical exam to determine the causal relationship of his injuries to the December 21, 2014, motor vehicle incident, as authorized by 75 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1796 ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (c) By failing to communicate with William Hack's medical providers to determine the causal relationship of his injuries to the December 21, 2014, motor vehicle incident;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (d) By failing to have William Hack's medical file referred to a Peer Review Organization for a determination of the reasonableness or necessity of treatment as authorized by 75 Pa.C.S.A \u00a7 1797(b) ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (e) By purposefully withholding from William Hack transcribed recorded statements until it was on the verge of filing suit;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (f) By refusing to pay benefits under the policy when it knew, or should have known, it has no reasonable basis for doing so;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (g) By failing to investigate Plaintiff's claim in good faith;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (h) In being motivated by such improper purposes such as self-interest and ill-will;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (i) By conducting itself in such a manner so as to breach a known duty of good faith and fair dealing;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (j) By not attempting, in good faith, to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable coverage of claims, once the [sic] its responsibility under its policy of insurance had become reasonably clear, in violation of 40 P.S. \u00a7 1171.5(10)(vi) ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (k) By failing to affirm or deny coverage of its claims within a reasonable time after proof of loss was communicated and supplied to a representative of Metropolitan, in violation of 40 P.S. \u00a7 1171.5(10)(v) ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (l) By failing to promptly provide a reasonable explanation of the basis of a denial of coverage in relation to the facts or applicable law for the denial of the claim, in violation of 40 P.S. \u00a7 1171.5(10)(xvi)\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (m) By instituting litigation alleging William Hack was fraudulently seeking to make claims for medical expenses;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (n) By misrepresenting to William Hack and his counsel the company's true position on the claim, in violation of 40 P.S. \u00a7 1171.5(10)(i) ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (o) By failing to state its position on William Hack's claim prior to filing a lawsuit against its insured in order to deny coverage owed to William Hack;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (p) By failing to state its position on William Hack's claim for more than one year after the claim was initiated;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (q) By failing to state its position on William Hack's claim for more than six months after receiving a recorded\n   statement from William Hack; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (r) By refusing to pay claims without conducting a reasonable investigation based upon all available information, in violation of [ 40 P.S. \u00a7 1171.5(1)(iv) ].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Doc. 14 \u00b6 77).
