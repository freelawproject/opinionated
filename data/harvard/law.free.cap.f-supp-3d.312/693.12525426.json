Affected SURS annuitants-all of whom worked at Oakton as part-time, or adjunct, faculty members prior to July 2015-filed three separate lawsuits against Oakton. Daniel Filipek and Donald Krzyzak have each alleged that Oakton's decision not to employ SURS annuitants violates the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20623\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the Illinois Human Rights Act (IHRA), 775 ILCS 5/2-102. Barry Dayton has filed a related suit against Oakton and a number of past and present administrators on behalf of himself and a class of similarly situated persons. In addition to alleging violations of the ADEA, Dayton alleges that Oakton's decision not to employ any SURS annuitants violates section 5 of Article XIII of the Illinois Constitution. Dayton also asserts a claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as well as a claim for retaliatory discharge under Illinois tort law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court consolidated all three lawsuits against Oakton and, in May 2017, granted Dayton's motion for collective and class certification. The certified class consists of \"all part-time and adjunct faculty who were denied employment at Oakton Community College as the result of its policy not to employ or re-employ State Universities Retirement System annuitants and who are not 'affected annuitants' pursuant to 40 ILCS 5/15-139.5(b)(2).\"\n   <em>\n    Dayton v.

Ill. May 17, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendants (collectively, \"Oakton\") have moved for summary judgment on all claims. For the reasons stated below, the Court grants Oakton's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Oakton Community College is a two-year community college with campuses in Des Plaines and Skokie, Illinois. Oakton employs both full-time and part-time faculty. Included within Oakton's part-time faculty are adjunct faculty members who generally teach at least six credit hours in a given semester and are represented via the 2014-2017 Adjunct Faculty Association Collective Bargaining Agreement. Through the department chairs and coordinators, the deans of Oakton's various academic divisions offer adjunct faculty course assignments on a term-by-term basis. The maximum number of lecture hour equivalents (LHEs) an adjunct faculty member can teach during the academic year is 27. In addition to course assignments, adjunct faculty members may receive tutoring assignments, for which they are compensated on an hourly basis. Tutoring assignments do not count toward adjunct faculty's LHEs. Adjunct faculty also may receive additional pay for substitute teaching and attending meetings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As a public community college, Oakton participates in the State Universities Retirement\n   System. SURS provides retirement benefits to eligible employees of state universities and public community colleges. SURS-eligible employees make financial contributions to SURS until their retirement, at which point they may begin to collect a retirement annuity from SURS. Most SURS participants are not eligible to draw a SURS retirement annuity until they are at least 55 years old.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   40 ILCS 5/15-135. SURS participants who return to work for a covered university or community college\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   they have retired and begun collecting a SURS annuity (\"SURS annuitants\") are subject to earnings limitations. Under Illinois' Return to Work law, if a SURS annuitant who retired before reaching the age of 60 receives monthly compensation in excess of her monthly retirement annuity for \"services performed after the date of retirement\" for any employer covered by SURS, she is not entitled to the portion of her monthly annuity that is funded by employer contributions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   40 ILCS 5/15-139(b). If, during any academic year after retirement, an annuitant who retired at age 60 or over receives compensation that exceeds the difference between her highest annual pre-retirement earnings and her annual retirement annuity, the portion of the monthly retirement annuity that is provided by employer contributions is reduced accordingly.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202152419\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2012, the Illinois legislature amended the Return to Work law. The amended version of the law imposes a number of reporting requirements on SURS-covered educational institutions related to the employment and compensation of SURS annuitants. Specifically, covered institutions that employ or re-employ SURS annuitants are required to determine whether they are \"affected annuitant[s]\" under the statute. 40 ILCS 5/15-139.5(a). An employee who receives a SURS retirement annuity of at least $10,000 per year\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"becomes an 'affected annuitant' on the first day of the academic year following the [first] academic year in which the annuitant\" returns to work for a covered institution and earns compensation (excluding certain types of grants) in excess of 40 percent of her highest annual pre-retirement earnings. 40 ILCS 5/15-139.5(b)(2)-(3). A covered university or community college that employs an affected annuitant after August 1, 2013 is required to make an \"employer contribution\" to SURS equal to 12 times the amount of the gross monthly retirement annuity payable to that annuitant. 40 ILCS 5/15-139.5(e). Once an employee becomes an affected annuitant, she remains an affected annuitant unless she returns to active service and stops receiving a SURS annuity or receives a SURS annuity that is less than $10,000 for the year. 40 ILCS 5/15-139.5(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Until July 1, 2015, Oakton often employed as adjunct faculty members retirees who had previously worked for Oakton or other covered educational institutions and thus were receiving a SURS retirement annuity. In response to the changes in the Return to Work law, however, the college decided not to employ or re-employ any affected annuitants as of the fall of 2014. Oakton's human resources department was tasked with monitoring SURS annuitants' earnings limitations and course loads for compliance with the Return to Work law. To this end, Craig Ahrndt, assistant to the chief human resources officer, created a spreadsheet to monitor identified annuitants' course loads and track their earnings\n   limitations, including the new limit on earnings in excess of 40 percent of an annuitant's highest annual pre-retirement earnings (the 40 percent limitation). Mercedes Lizalde, a human resources specialist, began monitoring annuitants' earnings in spring or summer of 2013. Instead of monitoring both the overall earnings limitation and the 40 percent limitation for each annuitant, Lizalde monitored only the overall earnings limitations for annuitants who retired before the age of 60. Consequently, Oakton unwittingly employed three affected annuitants after September 1, 2014. In October 2014, Lizalde discovered these errors and informed Mum Martens, Oakton's chief human resources officer, that the college would be required to pay SURS approximately $75,000 in employer contributions as a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Sometime thereafter, then-president Margaret (Peg) Lee decided that Oakton would no longer employ any SURS annuitants, regardless of whether any individual annuitant posed a risk of becoming an affected annuitant for purposes of the Return to Work law. The President's Council-which consisted of Oakton's vice presidents for academic affairs, student affairs, information technology, and business, the assistant vice presidents, and the chief human resources officer-discussed the issue at a meeting. The council specifically discussed the fact that some SURS annuitants were not at risk of becoming affected annuitants under the Return to Work law in light of the caps on adjunct compensation and the number of LHEs adjunct faculty were allowed to teach per semester. The council also discussed, however, the concern that it would be fiscally irresponsible to continue running the risk that a monitoring error could again result in the employment of an affected annuitant, potentially costing Oakton thousands of dollars. The council ultimately agreed that it was too great of a burden to employ any SURS annuitant, regardless of whether he or she was likely to become an affected annuitant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In November 2014, the college announced its decision to discontinue the employment of all SURS annuitants effective July 1, 2015, except where the college's president determined that there was a specific and unique need. In a November 2014 e-mail to all SURS annuitants employed by the college, Martens explained that the decision was based on \"challenges\" in maintaining a system to monitor annuitants' earnings and \"concerns about SURS' administration and enforcement\" of the Return to Work law. Defs.' Statement of Undisputed Material Facts Ex. K at 104. A number of adjunct faculty members who were SURS annuitants, but not affected annuitants, urged the college to reconsider its decision and subsequently filed grievances through the Oakton Community College Adjunct Faculty Association (OCCAFA). They were unsuccessful. Ultimately, over 80 SURS annuitants-all of whom were age 55 or older-lost their jobs at the college as a result of the decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that the defendants' decision to terminate the employment of all SURS annuitants based on their status as annuitants violates the ADEA, IHRA, and the Illinois Constitution. They also assert a claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and a retaliatory discharge claim.

The plaintiffs were among a group of approximately 80 SURS annuitants who were employed part-time at Oakton.\n   <em>\n    All\n   </em>\n   SURS annuitants were fired, and\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   employees-regardless of age-who remain employed by the college are not SURS annuitants. Plaintiffs' attempt to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Carson\n   </em>\n   on the ground that the county terminated only those rehired retirees who were members of the supplemental insurance plan instead of terminating all rehired retirees misses the point. This contention does not address the plaintiffs' lack of a comparator group, and, as explained below, although Oakton could have devised a more narrowly tailored policy to avoid employing affected annuitants, the ADEA did not obligate the college to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   For these reasons, the Court concludes that the plaintiffs cannot make out a prima facie case of discrimination under the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   framework. The Court therefore proceeds to evaluate whether the cumulative admissible evidence would otherwise permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that Oakton's decision not to employ SURS annuitants was based on age.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that three facts undermine the veracity of defendants' explanation for Oakton's decision to discontinue the employment of all SURS annuitants rather than just those who ran a risk of becoming affected annuitants. Specially, plaintiffs contend that the defendants knew at the time of the decision that \"a significant number of annuitants could\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   be impacted by the Return to Work law\" because either (1) their annuities were less than $10,000 a year or (2) it was impossible for them to exceed their 40 percent earnings limitation in light of the cap on the number of LHEs adjunct faculty members were allowed to teach per semester and the maximum compensation rates for adjunct faculty. Pls.' Resp to Mot. for Summ. J. at 1-2, 9. Plaintiffs further contend that the defendants knew that the costs the college had incurred by inadvertently employing affected annuitants were the result of a mistake by a human resources employee. Defendants do not contest either point. Instead, they argue that terminating all SURS annuitants was the only way to make sure that the college would never again have to pay for employing an affected annuitant. Defendants knew that the college had inadvertently employed affected annuitants due to its failure to correctly monitor and identify those annuitants who might become affected annuitants; the decision to no longer employ any SURS annuitants eliminated the risk of a future similar mistake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The imposition of a blanket ban on the employment of SURS annuitants was by no means the only option available to the college. Oakton could have attempted to craft a more narrowly tailored policy that would have allowed certain annuitants who were clearly not at risk of exceeding any SURS income limitation to keep their jobs. Its failure to do so, however, does not give rise to a reasonable inference that the decision was motivated by age discrimination. Plaintiffs also argue that Martens' statement that the decision not to distinguish between individual SURS annuitants based on risk of becoming an affected annuitant involved equitable considerations constitutes direct evidence of discrimination because it is \"simply another way of saying that the decision was to not employ people within a certain age range regardless of the actual impact of the [Return to\n   Work] law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. This argument ignores the other obvious characteristic other than age shared by all of the affected employees: they were all SURS annuitants. Although an employee's age and status as a SURS annuitant are correlated, age and pension status remain analytically distinct concepts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kentucky Ret. Sys. v.

This is likely sufficient to establish a prima facie case under a disparate impact theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court next considers whether defendants have shown that the decision was \"based on reasonable factors other than age.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20623\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1). Defendants contend that the decision to discontinue the employment of all SURS annuitants was based on a reasonable factor other than age. Specifically, they contend it was based on concerns about the burden of monitoring annuitants to ensure that they did not become affected annuitants under the Return to Work law, as well as the risk that the college might again have to pay an employer contribution to SURS for inadvertently employing an affected annuitant. Plaintiffs contend that this defense fails, for three reasons: (1) the defendants knew at the time they made the decision that some SURS annuitants could never become affected annuitants, (2) the defendants knew that the employer contributions they were required to pay to SURS for employing affected annuitants was the result of a monitoring error by a human resources employee, and (3) Martens' statement that the decision not to distinguish between individual SURS annuitants based on risk of becoming affected annuitants involved \"equitable considerations\" indicates that the decision was not actually driven by the Return to Work law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As previously noted in the discussion of plaintiffs' disparate treatment claim, none of the evidence cited by the plaintiffs undermines the defendants' explanation that the only sure way to prevent mistaken employment of an affected annuitant and the resulting payment to SURS was to discontinue the employment of all SURS annuitants. Though there may have been other reasonable and more narrowly tailored ways for Oakton to address this problem, no reasonable jury could find that its decision to no longer employ any SURS annuitants was unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877522\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/228/#p240\">\n    544 U.S. at 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877522\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/228/#p240\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Unlike [Title VII's] business necessity test, which asks whether there are other ways for the employer to achieve its goals that do not result in a disparate impact on a protected class, the reasonableness inquiry includes no such requirement.\").

As a court in this district explained in reference to a very similar claim, this state constitutional provision was adopted to secure employees' pension plans \"as they existed when the employees agreed to an employment contract, and to protect the plans against legislative abrogation.\"\n   <em>\n    Kastel v.

The Court sympathizes with those who elected to retire and begin receiving a SURS annuity with the expectation that their status as a SURS annuitant would not prevent them from continuing to work part-time as adjunct faculty members. But Oakton's decision not to employ SURS annuitants does not directly affect plaintiffs' ability to continue to collect their full annuity-which is what the Illinois Constitution protects-and plaintiffs identify no SURS provision that would entitle them to simultaneously receive an annuity and engage in post-retirement employment.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7657118\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/946/1329/#p1342\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7657118\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/946/1329/#p1342\">\n    at 1343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the right not to have future employment made conditional on a surrender of early retirement pension rights is not a right protected by the Illinois Constitution because the pension plan itself establishes no such right).

Plaintiffs argue that, just as the discharge in\n   <em>\n    Kelsay\n   </em>\n   was designed to prevent the employee from asserting her statutory right to worker's compensation, Oakton's decision to discontinue the employment of all SURS annuitants was designed to prevent employees from exercising their statutory rights to draw a SURS retirement annuity. This argument fails because the plaintiffs were already collecting SURS annuities when they were employed (or re-employed) by the college and they do not allege that Oakton previously discouraged its adjunct faculty from collecting a SURS annuity. There is simply no evidence that, in deciding to discontinue the employment of SURS annuitants, Oakton intended to discourage retirees from exercising their statutory right to collect a SURS retirement annuity. Indeed, regardless of whether such a discharge would be considered to violate a clear mandate of public policy, plaintiffs have produced no evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude that they were discharged in\n   <em>\n    retaliation\n   </em>\n   for their participation in SURS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court therefore grants summary judgment for the defendants on plaintiffs' state constitution and retaliatory discharge claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Court grants plaintiffs' motions to file under seal [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20Cow.%202902\">\n    16 C 2902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , dkt. no. 51] and to file excess pages [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20Cow.%202902\">\n    16 C 2902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , dkt. no. 52].
