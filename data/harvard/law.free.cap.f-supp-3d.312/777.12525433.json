INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This diversity suit asks this Court to construe two provisions of a Directors &amp;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Officers liability insurance policy (the \"D &amp; O Policy\") between Security National Insurance Company (\"Security National\") and H.O.M.E., Inc. (\"H.O.M.E.\"), a closely-held company incorporated under the laws of North Dakota. Security National seeks declaratory relief stating it has no obligation to pay for any costs or losses resulting from the legal defense of H.O.M.E.'s President, Lauris Molbert, in an unrelated suit brought against him by his three siblings. Because the siblings allege their brother acted simultaneously in covered and noncovered capacities, the Court must determine as a threshold matter whether the siblings' suit is covered under the policy, which limits coverage to \"insured persons acting solely in their capacity as director [or] officer.\" If the Court finds coverage it must then decide whether the insurance company is nevertheless exempted from coverage under the policy's exception for suits brought by \"any insured person in any capacity.\" Specifically, the Court must decide whether the siblings' joint claims are excepted given that one of the siblings is also an insured person under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Because the language of the insurance policy is clear on its face, Security National is entitled to judgment as matter of law. For the reasons stated herein, the Court grants Security National's motion for summary judgment and denies H.O.M.E.'s motion for partial summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Undisputed Facts Surrounding Security National's Denial of Liability Insurance Coverage.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In his capacity as President and a director of H.O.M.E., Lauris emailed Security National, H.O.M.E.'s D &amp; O liability insurance provider, to request coverage for the costs of defending him against the siblings' counterclaims. Aff. Counsel Supp. of Security National's Mot. Summ. J. (\"Pl.'s Aff.\"), Ex. 8, ECF No. 26-8; Pl.'s Mem. 6; Defs.' Mem. 5. Security National responded with a letter denying coverage based on the D &amp; O Policy's Insured vs. Insured Exclusion while also reserving the right to deny coverage based on other provisions. Compl., Ex. D, Aug. 10, 2015 Letter from Security National to H.O.M.E. (\"Rejection Letter\") 10-11, ECF No. 1-4; Pl.'s Mem. 6; Defs.' Mem. 5. The Insured v. Insured Exclusion (\"IvI Exclusion\") provides that Security National will not be liable to cover \"any\n   <em>\n    claim\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   by, on behalf of, or at the behest of ... any\n   <em>\n    insured person\n   </em>\n   in any capacity.\" Compl., Ex. C, Directors and Officers Liability Insurance Policy (\"D &amp; O Policy\") 17-18 (Section IV.A.20), ECF No. 1-3. Because directors and officers of H.O.M.E.'s subsidiaries are insured under the Policy, and Kristi was a director at the Bank, Kristi was an insured person under the D &amp; O Policy-a fact that is not contested. Pl.'s Mem. 11; Defs.' Mem. 12. The initial letter denying coverage stated that as an insured person, Kristi's counterclaims against Lauris, who was also an insured person, brought \"her claim within the scope of the insured-versus-insured exclusion.\" Rejection Letter 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In correspondences between the parties at the end of 2015, Security National reaffirmed its denial of coverage several times and reserved all rights and defenses with regard to coverage. Pl.'s Aff., Ex. 9, ECF 26-9; Pl.'s Aff., Ex. 10, ECF 26-10; Defs.' Mem. 5. Security National nevertheless agreed to cover some defense costs under an arrangement, the terms of which are currently disputed by the parties. Defs.' Mem. 5; Defs.' Mem. Opp'n Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. (\"Defs.' Opp'n\") 3-4, ECF No. 32; Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n Defs.' Partial Mot. Summ. J. (\"Pl.'s Opp'n\") 3-5, ECF No. 30. Under this contested arrangement, Security National paid, over the course of the following year, around $142,000 in defense costs. Defs.' Mem. 6; Compl. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In a subsequent letter to H.O.M.E., Security National described the coverage arrangement as a \"provisional offer to reimburse ... defense costs for the Lawsuit ... as an accommodation to the insureds, and in order to potentially avoid the expense of a declaratory judgment action.\" Pl.'s Aff., Ex. 11, at 2, ECF 26-11; Pl.'s Mem. 6; Defs.' Mem. 5. Lauris and H.O.M.E. dispute this characterization and argue the arrangement was made pursuant to Security National's obligation under Section VIII.B of the D &amp; O Policy to \"pay\n   <em>\n    defense expenses\n   </em>\n   , determined by the Insurer to be part of a covered\n   <em>\n    loss\n   </em>\n   , on a current basis.\" Defs.' Opp'n 3-4, 24-25. In addition to contesting the extent and nature of this arrangement, the parties dispute whether H.O.M.E. exceeded the agreed upon coverage by hiring a different lawyer and whether Security National withdrew coverage prior to the trial in the underlying litigation.

General Principles of Insurance Policy Interpretation in North Dakota\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The North Dakota Supreme Court has provided extensive guidance on how it interprets insurance policies:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Our goal when interpreting insurance policies, as when construing other contracts, is to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties as it existed at the time of contracting. We look first to the language of the insurance contract, and if the policy language is clear on its face, there is no room for construction. \"If coverage hinges on an undefined term, we apply the plain, ordinary meaning of the term in interpreting the contract.\" While we regard insurance policies as adhesion contracts and resolve ambiguities in favor of the insured, we will not rewrite a contract to impose liability on an insurer if the policy unambiguously precludes coverage. We will not strain the definition of an undefined term to provide coverage for the insured. We construe insurance contracts as a whole to give meaning and effect to each clause, if possible. The whole of a contract is to be taken together to give effect to every part, and each clause is to help interpret the others.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Exclusions from coverage in an insurance contract must be clear and explicit and are strictly construed against the insurer. Although [a policy's exclusionary clauses are strictly construed, this Court] will not rewrite a contract to impose liability on an insurer if the policy unambiguously precludes coverage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    North Dakota State Univ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9014731\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/694/225/#p229\">\n    694 N.W.2d 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 229 (N.D. 2005) (first paragraph quoting\n   <em>\n    Ziegelmann\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    TMG Life Ins.

If and only if a coverage provision applies to the harm at issue will the court then examine the policy's exclusions and limitations of coverage. An exclusionary provision, or the absence of one, cannot be read to provide coverage that does not otherwise exist. Likewise, although an exception to an exclusion from coverage results in coverage, an exception to an exclusion is incapable of initially providing coverage; rather, an exception may become applicable if, and only if, there is an initial grant of coverage under the policy and the relevant exclusion containing the exception operates to preclude coverage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    K &amp; L Homes, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Am.

Security National contends, \"[t]he word 'solely' is not ambiguous or unclear.

Pl.'s Opp'n 24. In short, because the siblings' counterclaims all rely on a \"common course of conduct\" without alleging any action that Lauris performed only as a director or officer of H.O.M.E., Security National argues the siblings do not claim a \"management practices wrongful act\" as defined in the Policy.

That is, the language following the reference to \"such claim\" in H.O.M.E.'s D &amp; O Policy is only invoked in and applies if the claim were otherwise excepted from the exclusion. None of the exceptions are relevant, nor does H.O.M.E. contend that they are.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the only relevant comparison is to the language the\n   <em>\n    Jerry's Enterprises\n   </em>\n   court found actually to exclude coverage. H.O.M.E.'s D &amp; O Policy in fact provides a narrower exclusion than the one quoted in\n   <em>\n    Jerry's Enterprises\n   </em>\n   -it applies not only to the claim itself but also to any \"claim based upon, arising out of, relating to, in consequence of, or in any way involving\" a claim by an insured person.

H.O.M.E.'s D &amp; O Policy does not contain an allocation clause similar to those cited\n   in the other cases. The only type of allocation the policy contemplates is in the case that a claim is brought against both an insured person/entity and an uninsured person/entity, in which case the policy states the Insured and Insurer will agree to \"a fair and proper allocation of all amounts\" and sets forth the process by which the allocation will be determined. Nevertheless, H.O.M.E. asks this Court to analogize to this provision and allocate the loss of the uncovered matter (Kristi's claim) from the loss of a covered matter (Karna and Eric's claim).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   H.O.M.E. invites this Court to apply some concerns raised by Judge Posner in interpreting an IvI Exclusion in\n   <em>\n    Level 3 Communications, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fed.
