Under a worst case scenario, the supplemental analyses and related procedures aimed at addressing the flaws the Court identified in the FIES/R and BiOp/ITS should be complete by early 2019. ECF No. 81 at 1-2. The Authority has determined that it will not participate in transfers from either crop fallowing or groundwater substitution this year. ECF No. 76 at 3. While Reclamation initially expected some \"inter-basin\" transfers from fallowed fields to the Tehama Colusa Canal Authority (\"TCCA\") this year,\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, Reclamation later clarified that in light of more recent water supply information, TCCA will not be requesting inter-basin crop fallowing transfers this year.

Therefore, there will be no impact to water users as a result of being unable to transfer water under the Project this year, because no water users wish to transfer water under the Project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The United States points to only one other potential \"disruptive consequence\" of vacatur in this case: if the BiOp/ITS is\n   vacated (rather than remanded without vacatur to make corrections) Federal Defendants will be required to re-start the ESA consultation process and Reclamation will need to submit a new request for ESA consultation to FWS, which will require the preparation of a new biological assessment to include an updated description of the project, updated information about the status of the species, and updates regarding any additional science that published since the last consultation package was forwarded to FWS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 81 at 1-2. Federal Defendants anticipate that these additional procedures would add approximately two months to the schedule, meaning that any new BiOp would be completed by late February 2019.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Because Reclamation generally begins processing requests for transfers after February, any delays to the schedule could \"greatly complicate\" the transfer approval process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, Federal Defendants point out that the closeness in time between the completion of the remand process and the transfer season would increase the likelihood that any future challenges would need to be brought by way of an emergency motion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   All the above assertions are reasonable, but they do not justify remand without vacatur.

First, the facts and circumstances presented here suggest that there will be absolutely no consequences, environmental or otherwise, from vacatur of the\n   <em>\n    FIES/R\n   </em>\n   . Therefore the second\n   <em>\n    Allied-Signal\n   </em>\n   factor weighs in favor of vacatur of the FEIS/R. The Court finds it unnecessary to apply in detail the first\n   <em>\n    Allied-Signal\n   </em>\n   factor to the FEIS/R, as a court may only decline to vacate agency decisions \"when vacatur would cause serious and irremediable harms that significantly outweigh the magnitude of the agency's error.\"\n   <em>\n    Klamath-Siskiyou\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365245\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/109/1238/#p1241\">\n    109 F.Supp.3d at 1242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even if,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , the magnitude of the agency's error is slight, the scale still cannot swing away from vacatur if there will be\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   irremediable harm whatsoever caused by vacating the FEIS/R.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As to the BiOp/ITS, the Court accepts Federal Defendants' assertions that vacatur may result in an additional delay, putting out completion of remand until late February 2019, increasing the likelihood of disrupting the transfer approval process in 2019 and increasing the likelihood of emergency motions practice in any future lawsuit. Yet, Federal Defendants fail to identify (and the Court cannot locate) any cases that even remotely suggest such\n   <em>\n    possible procedural difficulties\n   </em>\n   warrant departure from the default of vacatur. Federal Defendants' position, taken to its logical extreme, would turn the law on its head in the context of almost every complex environmental document. If a project is worth doing, someone, somewhere is waiting for it to happen. Delay (and/or related urgency) cannot on its own constitute the kind of disruptive consequence intended by\n   <em>\n    Allied-Signal\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Seriousness of the Agency's Errors\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The first\n   <em>\n    Allied-Signal\n   </em>\n   factor-the seriousness of the agency's errors-does not swing in Federal Defendants' favor either. One way to measure the seriousness of an agency's errors is to attempt to evaluate the likelihood that the agency will be able to justify future decisions that would follow the status quo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fox Television Stations, Inc. v.

In addition, the MSJ Order called for clarification of how certain \"high priority areas\" in which crop idling will not be permitted relate to \"priority areas\" in which idling may be permitted under certain circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 127. Without this clarification, the bar against crop idling in high priority areas may be impossible to implement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Second, the MSJ Order found that the BiOp/ITS failed to articulate why the conservation measures identified therein avoid jeopardy in light of the absence of constraints on how close fallowed fields may be to one another and the number of consecutive years a field may lie fallow.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 128. This needed to be addressed in light of the fact that the BiOp/ITS otherwise suggests that such constraints may be important to GGS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Finally, and relatedly, the MSJ Order found that the BiOp/ITS failed to justify its focus on maintaining water in canals and ditches, while failing to require maintenance of water in rice fields.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Again, this needs to be addressed in light of the fact that the BiOp/ITS suggests maintaining water in all of these environments, including rice fields, may be important to GGS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 128-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants suggest that these issues can be addressed without much effort, promising the required \"clarification\" by the end of this calendar year if the BiOp/ITS is not vacated. ECF No. 76 at 4. Defendants present the Declaration of Jennifer Norris, Ph.D, the Field Supervisor of FWS's Sacramento Office. ECF No. 76-2. Dr. Norris explains that each year, FWS will review proposed water transfers and, if appropriate, will append an incidental take statement to the BiOp prior to any 2018 water transfers. \"If FWS is not satisfied that the water transfers planned in any given year will not result in jeopardy to the GGS, it will not issue an incidental take statement. In issuing any ITS this year, FWS will take into account the issues identified by the Court with respect to the BiOp.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4. This assertion, while aiming in the right direction, is totally devoid of specifics. For example, will FWS impose constraints on how close fallowed fields may be to one another or whether a field fallowed in a previous year may be fallowed this year? Or, will FWS determine, as it did in the BiOp, that such constraints are not necessary? If the latter, how can that be explained and justified? Without such detail, the court simply cannot evaluate the likelihood that the agency will be able to justify future decisions that would follow the status quo, with the status quo being permitting transfers that rely on this legally inadequate BiOp.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On balanced, in light of the fact that courts are generally inclined to \"tip the scales in favor of the endangered species under the 'institutionalized caution' mandate,\"\n   <em>\n    Klamath-Siskiyou\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365245\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/109/1238/#p1241\">\n    109 F.Supp.3d at 1242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations and quotations omitted), the Court finds that vacatur of the BiOp/ITS is warranted.
