(Dkt. # 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On July 30, 2012, plaintiff filed an application for a period of disability and DIB under Title II of the Act, alleging disability beginning on October 1, 2008.

On December 21, 2012, plaintiff requested and was granted a hearing before Administrative Law Judge Roxanne Fuller (the \"ALJ\"). (Tr. 113-19, 144-48). The ALJ conducted a video hearing on April 3, 2014, at which plaintiff and a vocational expert testified. (Tr. 31-44). In a decision dated June 20, 2014, the ALJ found that plaintiff was not disabled. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). That decision became the final decision of the Commissioner when the Appeals Council denied review on April 1, 2016. (Tr. 1-4). The instant appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The plaintiff has moved, and the Commissioner has cross moved, for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. For the reasons set forth below, plaintiff's motion seeking remand (Dkt. # 10) is granted, the Commissioner's cross motion for judgment dismissing the complaint (Dkt. # 13) is denied, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

At step one, the ALJ found that plaintiff had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since October 1, 2008, the alleged onset date. (Dkt. # 8 at 33). At step two, the ALJ found that plaintiff had the following severe impairments: degenerative disc disease ; asthma ; fibromyalgia ; chronic pain syndrome; and a history of polysubstance abuse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). At step three, the ALJ found that such impairments, alone or in combination, did not meet or medically equal a listed impairment. (Dkt. # 8 at 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Next, the ALJ determined that plaintiff retained the RFC to perform sedentary work\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   with certain limitations. Specifically, the ALJ found that plaintiff could: occasionally climb ramps, stairs, ladders, ropes, and scaffolds; occasionally balance, stoop, crouch, kneel, and crawl; frequently reach with both arms, including overhead; frequently, but not constantly, handle objects, \"that is gross manipulation with both hands\"; frequently, but not constantly, finger, \"that is fine manipulation with both hands\"; occasionally be exposed to irritants such as fumes, odors, dust, and gases; occasionally be exposed to poorly ventilated areas, chemicals, moving mechanical parts, and unprotected heights; occasionally operate a motor vehicle; and perform simple, routine, repetitive tasks. (Tr. 36). At step four, the ALJ found that based on plaintiff's RFC, she was unable to perform her past relevant work as a cook. (Tr. 42). At step five, the ALJ relied on the testimony of vocational expert Thomas H. Heiman (the \"VE\"), and found that plaintiff is capable of performing other work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy. (Tr. 43). Specifically, the VE testified that plaintiff could work as a document preparer, microfilming (DOT 249.587-018), final assembler, optical goods (DOT 713.687-018), and addresser (DOT 209.587-010). (Tr. 43-44). Accordingly, the ALJ found that plaintiff was not \"disabled\" under the Act. (Tr. 44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the Commissioner's decision is not supported by substantial evidence and is based on errors of fact and law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

(Dkt. # 8 at 40). Evidence cited by the ALJ in support of that finding included: (1) examination findings showing intact strength, sensation and reflexes; (2) plaintiff's testimony that she had been \"cleaning houses as a part-time job [for a portion of] the period at issue\"; and (3) plaintiff's \"activities of daily living,\" including engagement in activities such as personal care, washing dishes, doing laundry, and grocery shopping.

LEXIS 53388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *24 (N.D.N.Y. 2017) (\"a sweeping and persistent dismissal of Plaintiff's complaints of pain because of the lack of objective evidence ... is precisely what the Second Circuit has warned against whenever fibromyalgia is at play\"). As such, the absence of such signs cannot, as a matter of law, be relied upon to undermine plaintiff's subjective pain complaints, and the ALJ's reasoning to the contrary was in error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Indeed, even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that a lack of neurological signs (e.g., intact strength, sensation and reflexes) was relevant to the ALJ's analysis in some other manner, the records to which the ALJ cited do not actually evidence a lack of neurological signs. In referring to plaintiff's \"intact strength, sensation and reflexes during the period [at issue],\" the ALJ cited to Exhibits 2F, 4F, 7F, 10F, 11F, 12F, 14F, 15F, 16F and 18F (Dkt. # 8 at 40, 302-566). However, the bulk of these records include\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   objective findings concerning plaintiff's strength, sensation and reflexes, and many do not even pertain to a physical examination. (For example, Exh. 2F is an emergency room record describing treatment for a burned arm, 4F describes treatment for a sprained ankle, and 7F is a laboratory report).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Furthermore, to the extent that the ALJ relied on plaintiff's activities of daily living in rejecting her statements concerning the severity of her symptoms, the ALJ described \"part-time\" work as a housekeeper, and found that the plaintiff can \"cook, clean, do laundry, shop, maintain her own care,\" etc. (Dkt. # 7 at 40). However, the ALJ's characterization overlooks important details. For example, plaintiff's prior work as a housekeeper was significantly less than \"part-time\": it took place only two hours per week for a period of time, and ended due to plaintiff's symptoms. Plaintiff testified that her participation in\n   her own \"personal care\" such as dressing and showering requires extensive physical assistance from family members, and any housekeeping is limited to light chores such as dish washing, with rest breaks every few minutes. Plaintiff grocery shops only when a neighbor or family member is able to drive her and assist her in the store.

The ALJ's Assessment of the Medical Opinion Evidence of Record\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Court also notes that the ALJ gave no more than \"little\" weight to the medical opinion evidence of record bearing on plaintiff's nonexertional and postural limitations, including the opinion of consulting internist Dr. Harbinder Toor, who was the only acceptable medical source of record who purported to specifically assess those limitations. (Dkt. # 8 at 385-89). The ALJ rejected Dr. Toor's opinion largely on the basis of \"vague[ness],\" based on his use of terms such as \"moderate\" and \"severe,\" which the ALJ found insufficient to indicate \"what the claimant could or could not do in a work setting.\" (Dkt. # 8 at 41). The ALJ likewise rejected the \"opinion\" of plaintiff's treating physician, Dr. Steven Lasser (Dkt. # 8 at 491-92), which took the form of a treatment note which described plaintiff's \"severe and disabling\" hip, buttock and lower back pain due to severe sacroiliac joint dysfunction syndrome, but failed to meaningfully assess plaintiff's ability to perform the exertional requirements of work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Finally, the ALJ gave no more than \"little\" weight to the physical RFC assessment of occupational therapist Ms. Maria C. Aguilera (Dkt. # 8 at 574-82), because her findings concerning plaintiff's ability to sit, stand, lift, carry, etc., were more limiting than \"any other examination of record,\" and because Ms. Aguilera is not an \"acceptable medical source.\" (Dkt. # 8 at 41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Initially, the mere use of terms such as \"moderate\" and \"severe\" does not automatically render an opinion \"too vague to constitute substantial evidence,\" particularly where \"the examiner conducts a thorough examination and explains the basis for the opinion.\"\n   <em>\n    O'Bara v. Colvin,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202618096\">\n    2017 WL 2618096\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   at *2,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2093441\">\n    2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *6 (W.D.N.Y. 2017). The Court\n   observes that Dr. Toor's opinion, which finds, among other things, \"moderate to severe limitations for standing, walking, squatting, bending and lifting,\" includes examination findings such as abnormal gait, difficulty in changing and rising from a chair, significantly impaired spinal flexion, numbness and tingling in extremities, and tenderness in the hips, legs and shoulders. (Dkt. # 8 at 384-89).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Even assuming that Dr. Toor's opinion was properly characterized as \"vague,\" the ALJ ultimately rejected\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the medical opinion evidence of record as to plaintiff's exertional and postural limitations. Although an ALJ may base an RFC assessment on evidence other than medical opinions, such as treatment notes and activities of daily living, the instant record lacked sufficient evidence to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Monroe v.

As discussed above, to the extent that plaintiff's treatment notes contained raw medical data, the ALJ was not entitled to rely upon it in determining the extent of plaintiff's fibromyalgia-related limitations, and the ALJ's analysis of plaintiff's daily activities was factually flawed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In the absence of the medical opinions rejected by the ALJ, the instant record lacked evidence sufficient for the ALJ to reach an informed decision as to plaintiff's RFC. As such, the ALJ's RFC finding amounted to an improper substitution of her \"own expertise or view of the medical proof [in place of] any competent medical opinion,\" and remand is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Greek v.
