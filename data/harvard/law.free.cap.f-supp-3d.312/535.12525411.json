Ducore\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:18-cr-68 (E.D. Va. Feb. 7, 2018) (Indictment). The indictment arises out of an incident that occurred on a JetBlue flight traveling from the Dominican Republic to New York City, New York in July 2017. At issue, pretrial, is the parties' dispute over whether the crime defined in \u00a7 46504 requires the government to prove specific intent-that defendant had the specific intent to intimidate the flight crew-or whether the crime defined in \u00a7 46504 is a general intent crime requiring only that the government prove that defendant's acts were voluntary and intentional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The matter has been fully briefed, and because oral argument would not aid in the decisional process, the issue is now ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The indictment alleges that on July 29, 2017, on JetBlue Flight 1528 flying from the Dominican Republic to New York City, defendant assaulted a flight attendant, disregarded flight attendant instructions, directed aggressive and abusive language towards the flight crew and fellow passengers, and engaged in other inappropriate behavior. Ultimately, as a result of defendant's actions, Flight 1528 was diverted from New York, its original destination, to Washington Dulles International Airport.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The parties dispute whether \u00a7 46504 defines a crime that requires specific intent or general intent with respect\n   to the intimidation element. General intent crimes require only that the act be done \"voluntarily and intentionally, and not because of mistake or accident.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Blair\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7411328\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/54/639/#p642\">\n    54 F.3d 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 642 (10th Cir. 1995). Thus, if \u00a7 46504 requires only general intent, then the government need not prove that defendant specifically intended to intimidate flight crew members. By contrast, specific intent crimes require that a defendant act \"not only with knowledge of what he is doing, but [also] with the objective of completing some unlawful act.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7411328\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/54/639/#p642\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, if \u00a7 46504 is a specific intent crime, then the government must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant specifically intended to intimidate flight crew members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The parties' dispute presents a question of statutory interpretation, and accordingly, analysis properly begins with the text of the statute at issue which provides in pertinent part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [a]n individual on an aircraft in the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States who, by assaulting or intimidating a flight crew member or flight attendant of the aircraft, interferes with the performance of the duties of the member or attendant or lessens the ability of the member or attendant to perform those duties, or attempts or conspires to do such an act, shall be fined under title 18, imprisoned for not more than 20 years, or both.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2046504\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On its face and by its plain terms, \u00a7 46504 does not require the government to prove specific intent with respect to the assault or intimidation elements of the offense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is important, as it is well-settled that \"[i]n the absence of an explicit statement that a crime requires specific intent, courts [ ] hold that only general intent is needed.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1531120\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/780/1140/#p1142\">\n    780 F.2d 1140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1142-43 (4th Cir. 1986).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This presumption, paired with the plain language of the statute, points convincingly to the conclusion that \u00a7 46504 requires only general intent with respect to each of its elements; \u00a7 46504 is not a specific intent offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This interpretation of \u00a7 46504 comports not only with the statute's plain text, but also serves to promote the statute's purpose of ensuring air travel safety. The Ninth Circuit, in interpreting \u00a7 46504's essentially identical predecessor statute,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   made clear that the general intent requirement\n   serves the statute's underlying purpose:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [T]he goal which Congress sought in this provision of the statute was to deter the commission of crimes which, if committed on the terrain below, might be considered relatively minor, but when perpetrated on an aircraft in flight would endanger the lives of many. The primary danger to be averted is not the formation of a specific intent to interfere with aircraft operations but the criminal act of an assault [or] intimidation ... upon airline personnel during flight.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    United States v. Meeker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1084278\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/527/12/#p14\">\n    527 F.2d 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 14 (9th Cir. 1975) (internal citations omitted). More recently, the Tenth Circuit has confirmed that \"a general intent interpretation of \u00a7 46504 best achieves the statute's legislative purpose of protecting air travel safety.\"\n   <em>\n    Lynch\n   </em>\n   , 881 F.3d at 816. Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Meeker\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lynch\n   </em>\n   , a general intent interpretation of \u00a7 46504 best advances the statutory purpose of protecting air travel safety by criminalizing acts of assault or intimidation perpetrated against members of a flight crew which might interfere with the flight crew's performance of their duties, irrespective of whether the perpetrator is shown to have specific intent to interfere with the operation of the flight or intimidate the crew.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Nor are\n   <em>\n    Meeker\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lynch\n   </em>\n   isolated examples of this principle; significantly, all other courts that have addressed \u00a7 46504 and its predecessor statute, have held that \u00a7 46504 is a general intent crime. In 2003, the Fourth Circuit held that \u00a7 46504\"does not require specific intent.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Persing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=318%20Fed.%20Appx.%20152\">\n    318 Fed.Appx. 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 154 (4th Cir. 2008). More recently, in 2008, in a second per curiam opinion, the Fourth Circuit quoted\n   <em>\n    Meeker\n   </em>\n   , noting that \"[i]n order to prove intimidation within the meaning of \u00a7 46504, 'it is sufficient that the conduct and words of the accused would place an ordinary, reasonable person in fear.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Nor is the Fourth Circuit singular in reaching this conclusion; the Fifth, Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh circuits have also concluded that \u00a7 46504 requires general intent, not specific intent.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Petras\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263703\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/879/155/\">\n    879 F.3d 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2018).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The unanimity with which courts have concluded that \u00a7 46504 is a general intent crime further bolsters that conclusion here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant, seeking to avoid this conclusion, argues that the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Elonis v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12589931\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2001/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12589931\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2001/\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), compels a reading of \u00a7 46504 that requires the government to prove that defendant had a specific intent to intimidate the flight crew. This argument is unpersuasive;\n   <em>\n    Elonis\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable as it does not involve \u00a7 46504, but instead addresses the federal threats statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20875\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Elonis\n   </em>\n   concluded that that the federal threats statute requires a showing that a defendant either intends to issue a threat or knows that others will view a communication as a threat.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20875\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20875\">\n    at 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant argues, unpersuasively, that\n   <em>\n    Elonis\n   </em>\n   changes the legal landscape surrounding \u00a7 46504, and requires the government to prove that defendant specifically intended to intimidate flight crew members. Ultimately, the\n   <em>\n    Elon\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   decision does not compel such a result because significant differences between the statutes require different conclusions with respect to their intent requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant first argues that applying a general intent standard to the intimidation element of \u00a7 46504 would-similar to the reading of the threats statute pre-\n   <em>\n    Elonis\n   </em>\n   -allow defendant to be convicted for non-criminal actions which were objectively intimidating. That argument is simply incorrect; a general intent reading of \u00a7 46504 still requires that a defendant's intimidating behavior be severe enough to interfere with the flight crew, and such conduct cannot reasonably be claimed to be inadvertent, innocent, or non-culpable. As the Tenth Circuit explained in\n   <em>\n    Lynch\n   </em>\n   , \"[i]f a passenger's behavior is intimidating enough to prevent an attendant or crew member from fully performing his or her duties as usual, this moves beyond normal aircraft protocol and undermines the safety of everyone on the aircraft.\" 881 F.3d at 817. And even if intimidating conduct is the kind of conduct \"which, if committed on the terrain below, might be considered relatively minor[,]\" intimidating conduct sufficient to interfere with the duties of a flight crew could \"endanger the lives of many.\"\n   <em>\n    Meeker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1084278\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/527/12/#p14\">\n    527 F.2d at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Elonis\n   </em>\n   is also inapposite here because, \u00a7 46504, as distinct from the threats statute in\n   <em>\n    Elonis\n   </em>\n   , does not just criminalize intimidation; it criminalizes intimidation that \"interferes with the performance of\" the flight crew's duties. Thus, there is no risk of criminalizing innocent conduct, such as angry or offensive statements made to the flight crew, where those statements do not both amount to intimidation\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   interfere with flight crew duties. Intimidating conduct sufficient to interfere with the duties of a flight crew is clearly not the kind of \"non-culpable\" conduct that the Supreme Court was concerned about criminalizing in\n   <em>\n    Elonis\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Moreover, to accept defendant's argument that specific intent is required for the intimidation and interference elements of \u00a7 46504, but not with the assault element, impermissibly imports different mens rea requirements to different means of committing the same crime without any basis in the text of the statute for concluding that Congress intended such a result.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lynch\n   </em>\n   , 881 F.3d at 817 (requiring specific intent to intimidate \"would create a cumbersome interpretation of the statute in which a different mens rea applied to separate means of committing the same crime without any textual support that Congress intended such a division.\"). Particularly where, as here, reading in an additional mens rea requirement would undermine Congress's purpose of promoting airline safety,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hicks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10516690\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/980/963/#p971\">\n    980 F.2d 963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 971 (5th Cir. 1992),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   there is little reason to accept defendant's invitation to imply an additional mens rea requirement with respect to intimidation element of the statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant next argues that treating \u00a7 46504 as a general intent crime would violate the holding of\n   <em>\n    Virginia v. Black\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030793\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/343/\">\n    538 U.S. 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030793\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/343/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030793\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/343/\">\n    155 L.Ed.2d 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003). According to defendant,\n   <em>\n    Black\n   </em>\n   held that only conduct intended to be threatening or intimidating is criminally punishable under the First Amendment. Specifically, defendant points to the Supreme Court's statement in\n   <em>\n    Black\n   </em>\n   that \"[i]ntimidation in the constitutionally proscribable sense of the word is a type of true threat, where a speaker directs a threat to a person or group of persons with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030793\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/343/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030793\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/343/\">\n    at 360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030793\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/343/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant's reading of\n   <em>\n    Black\n   </em>\n   is unpersuasive.\n   <em>\n    Black\n   </em>\n   held that cross-burning, by itself, could not be used as prima facie evidence of a defendant's intent to intimidate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1540.\n   <em>\n    Black\n   </em>\n   did not hold that crimes including an intimidation element must be read to require specific intent to intimidate. The discussion of intimidation in\n   <em>\n    Black\n   </em>\n   referred to the intent to intimidate requirement in the Virginia statute at issue, not to intimidation generally. Courts that have been called upon to decide whether\n   <em>\n    Black\n   </em>\n   altered the requirements for intimidation in \u00a7 46504 have uniformly held that\n   <em>\n    Black\n   </em>\n   had no effect on the intent requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Petras\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263703\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/879/155/\">\n    879 F.3d at 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"although\n   <em>\n    Black\n   </em>\n   discussed \"intimidation\" as it was defined in that statute, it did not mandate that all statutes with \"intimidation\" be interpreted accordingly.\"). Indeed, in the context of \u00a7 46504, a statute designed to \"ensur[e] safety in air travel, a delicate environment ... it makes sense [ ] to view 'intimidation' differently\" than it was viewed in the context of the cross-burning statute in\n   <em>\n    Black\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Petras\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263703\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/879/155/\">\n    879 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   155 n. 13. Ultimately, the\n   <em>\n    Black\n   </em>\n   case is inapposite and does not alter the conclusion that \u00a7 46504 requires a showing of general, rather than specific, intent to intimidate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant's other arguments merit little discussion. Defendant argues that the severe penalty imposed by \u00a7 46504 -up to twenty years imprisonment-compels the conclusion that specific intent is required, but general intent crimes often have severe penalties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant also attempts to invoke the rule of lenity, arguing that if the language of \u00a7 46504 is susceptible to any ambiguity with respect to the intent to intimidate, then the statute must be read in favor of defendant. Here, however, there is no ambiguity or uncertainty as to the meaning of the lenity.\n   <em>\n    Burgess v.

Whatever merits there may or may not be to defendant's proposed amendment to \u00a7 46504, it is the role of Congress, not the courts, to amend statutes. To be sure, where a statute is amenable to two readings, one of which raises constitutional concerns, that fact may be a reason for a court to infer that Congress intended the constitutional reading.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Clark v.
