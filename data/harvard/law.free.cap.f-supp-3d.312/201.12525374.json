Having prevailed in that suit, Langan now brings this action under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201961\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"RICO\"), and state law. Because the complaint fails to allege a plausible RICO claim, Defendants' motions to dismiss (Dkt. Nos. 30, 35, and 42) are\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ALLOWED\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   with respect to the RICO counts. The Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims. Accordingly, the case is\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISMISSED\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   without prejudice to filing the state-law claims in state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts are drawn from the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     The Defendants\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Defendants fall into three groups: the Smith Defendants, the Arrowood Defendants, and the Keegan Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Smith Defendants include the entity at the center of this case: AMPM Facility Services Corporation (\"AMPM\"), a janitorial services company. Defendant John Smith owns and operates AMPM, and is its president, treasurer, secretary, director, registered agent, and sole shareholder. Defendant Mary Beauregard is Smith's wife and an AMPM employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Arrowood Defendants include the Massachusetts law firm Arrowood LLP, as well as two of its attorneys: Lisa Arrowood, a partner, and Elizabeth Kayatta, an associate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Keegan Defendants include another Massachusetts law firm, Keegan Werlin LLP, and one of its former partners, Matthew Zayotti.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Cleaning Up an Employment Contract\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the fall of 2010, Smith began to negotiate new terms of employment with J. Kenneth Foscaldo, who had served as AMPM's general manager since 1990. In September 2010, Smith and AMPM retained attorney Richard Paster to represent them in these negotiations. Over the course of several months, the negotiations produced three interrelated documents, all drafted by Paster: a stock-purchase agreement, a five-year promissory note, and an employment agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Via the stock-purchase agreement, Foscaldo sold his shares of AMPM stock to Smith; in exchange, Smith signed the note, which bound him to pay Foscaldo in annual installments of $112,500. At the same time, Foscaldo signed the employment agreement, which provided that AMPM could only terminate Foscaldo \"for cause.\" The promissory note and the employment agreement were connected by way of an acceleration clause that permitted Foscaldo to demand immediate payment on the full amount of the note if AMPM terminated his employment without cause or if Smith missed a payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In July 2011, Foscaldo and AMPM agreed to modify the employment agreement. George Shay, then the president of AMPM, retained Langan to memorialize these changes via an addendum to the employment agreement, which provided that either AMPM or Foscaldo could terminate it without cause upon 30 days' written notice. However, Langan did not alter\n   the note's acceleration clause, which continued to require full payment if Foscaldo were terminated without cause. Langan billed one hour of time to prepare the addendum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Things Get Messy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In November 2011, AMPM fired Foscaldo without cause, and Foscaldo sued to enforce the note's acceleration clause. In November 2012, a Massachusetts Superior Court judge awarded summary judgment in Foscaldo's favor, determining that the addendum, as drafted by Langan, could not be read to alter the note's acceleration clause, and thus the entire note was due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Faced with this adverse ruling, Smith and AMPM, in May 2013, sued Paster for malpractice over his drafting of the documents. This malpractice complaint was drafted and filed by Zayotti, one of the Keegan Defendants. Over the next several months, AMPM, Smith, and Beauregard retained Arrowood and her firm to represent them in the malpractice suit. In November 2013, Kayatta filed an amended complaint adding Beauregard as a plaintiff. It also added Langan as a defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The amended complaint asserted three claims against Langan: legal malpractice, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and loss of consortium. In essence, it alleged that Langan's role in drafting the addendum to the employment agreement was to \"ensure Foscaldo's smooth termination,\" but that Langan failed to consult the note or stock-purchase agreement, and failed to advise AMPM that a termination without cause could still trigger the note's acceleration clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Ultimately, the malpractice claims against Langan foundered, and, in April 2015, the Superior Court granted Langan's unopposed motion for summary judgment. The case against Paster settled shortly thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In November 2017, Langan, acting on his own behalf, commenced this suit. His complaint contains six counts: Count I, malicious prosecution (against AMPM, Smith, Beauregard, Kayatta, and Arrowood); Count II, civil RICO,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201961\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   .

Gen. Laws ch. 93A, \u00a7 11 (against all Defendants); and Count VI, civil conspiracy (against all Defendants).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Each set of Defendants has moved to dismiss.

Defendants argue that Plaintiff fails to adequately allege these RICO predicates for at least two reasons. First, they contend that litigation activities-even if undertaken in bad faith-cannot, as a matter of law, constitute RICO predicates. Second, they argue that the specific conduct alleged in the complaint does not rise to the level of extortion or fraud. Alternatively, Defendants argue that the RICO counts fail because the complaint does not adequately allege a \"pattern\" of activity that poses a serious threat of continuation. Plaintiff contends that his complaint details a sufficient pattern of racketeering activity beyond the scope of any litigation conduct, such that his RICO claims must survive a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Extortion as a RICO Predicate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiff's 77-page complaint is wide-ranging, but the alleged RICO-extortion theory is relatively straightforward. At core, Plaintiff argues that Arrowood's March 2015 settlement demand of $50,000 in the malpractice suit constituted attempted extortion. He alleges that Kayatta assisted in this scheme by filing the initial lawsuit, and by serving Smith's and AMPM's answers to interrogatories despite knowing that they contained false statements. Plaintiff's briefs do not discuss any specific extortive conduct by the Smith Defendants or the Keegan Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Federal courts have overwhelmingly rejected attempts to base extortion claims on litigation conduct, even when that conduct is abusive or undertaken in bad faith.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Raney v.

Without any further factual allegations to support it, this bare assertion is not sufficient to establish the sort of genuine threat of ongoing criminality that the \"open-ended\" test requires.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    H.J.

Plaintiff is correct that courts (including this Court) have found the continuity requirement satisfied based on shorter periods of illicit conduct.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Laker v.

Mass. 1994) (37 months). But duration alone is not dispositive. The First Circuit has prescribed a \"natural and commonsense approach\" that looks to additional \"indicia of continuity,\" such as: (1) whether\n   the scheme affected many people, or only a closed group of targeted victims; (2) whether the defendants were involved in multiple schemes, as opposed to one scheme with a singular objective; and (3) whether the scheme had the potential to last indefinitely, instead of having a finite nature.\n   <em>\n    Home Orthopedics Corp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076437\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/521/#p528\">\n    781 F.3d at 529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations and quotation marks omitted). The core inquiry is \"whether the specific fact pattern of the case ... suggests the 'kind of broad or ongoing criminal behavior at which the RICO statute was aimed.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076437\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/521/#p528\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Efron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11238066\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/223/12/#p15\">\n    223 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   18 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   These factors point decisively away from \"closed\" continuity in this case. Plaintiff does not identify any of the six purported victims of the alleged RICO scheme, and the Court is hard-pressed to imagine who they might be aside from Langan (and, perhaps, Paster, who is not a party to this litigation). Further, although Plaintiff posits \"140 or more\" predicate acts as part of the alleged scheme, the nucleus of his complaint is the allegedly extortive and fraudulent malpractice litigation. Plaintiff painstakingly details individual acts undertaken in the course of that litigation. But he does not allege any scheme untethered from his drafting of the addendum and the ensuing imbroglio over Foscaldo's termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   For this reason, the facts in this case stand in sharp contrast to a case like\n   <em>\n    United States v. Eisen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514420\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/974/246/\">\n    974 F.2d 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 1992). Plaintiff cites\n   <em>\n    Eisen\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that frivolous litigation as part of a broader scheme of illicit conduct may constitute a RICO predicate. But the scheme in\n   <em>\n    Eisen\n   </em>\n   was expansive in scope. There, the Second Circuit upheld mail fraud as a criminal RICO predicate where several law-firm defendants pursued a host of counterfeit personal injury claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514420\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/974/246/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514420\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/974/246/\">\n    at 253-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unlike the litigation against Langan, the misconduct in\n   <em>\n    Eisen\n   </em>\n   extended well beyond the bounds of a malicious prosecution claim.
