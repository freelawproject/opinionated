(\"PFI\") for the right to operate a Peterbrooke chocolatier shop in Miami (the \"Shop\"). (ECF No. 166 \u00b6 1). The McDonalds purchased and assumed operation of the Shop in September 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Agreement sets forth specifications and procedures for operating the Shop. It provides,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the owner/operator shall use and record all sales using a computer register or point-of-sale (\"POS\") system. (ECF No. 1-1 at 14, \u00a7 4.6.1). In relevant part, the Franchise Agreement states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-13\">\n   When so instructed by Us, You shall procure and install for the Shop such computerized cash register polling packages, a POS register station, designated accounting software and software options, associated computer hardware, required dedicated telephone and power lines, modem(s) for polling purposes, printer(s), and other related accessories or peripheral equipment, and bar coding equipment as We specify in our manual and otherwise. You shall provide any assistance required by Us to bring such system on-line with Our system at the earliest possible time and You expressly agree that We shall thereafter have the free and unfettered right to retrieve such data and information from Your system as We, in Our sole and exclusive discretion, deem necessary or appropriate.

(ECF No. 63 \u00b6 14). Under a separate agreement with Peterbrooke Idea Company, LLC, PFA also possesses the right to use Peterbrooke trademarks worldwide to operate chocolate stores and to grant franchises and licenses to third parties to do the same. (ECF No. 63 \u00b6 10), and to pursue legal action against third parties, including former franchisees, for infringement and unfair competition. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    When the McDonalds purchased Miami Chocolates, Peterbrooke stores used an Iciniti Corp POS. (ECF No. 166 \u00b6 6). According to Defendants, initial discussions about transitioning away from the Iciniti Corp POS began in 2012. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 7). In November 2013, PFA sent Miami Chocolates a notice requiring it to change over to a Micros Simphony System (the \"Micros System\"). (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 8). Miami Chocolates refused, asserting that the Micros System was not appropriate for a chocolatier shop and did not meet Peterbrooke specifications. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 10).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    On October 14, 2015, PFA sent Miami Chocolates another notice requiring it to change its POS system, this time to the NCR Silver POS System with Simplebox software (the \"New POS System\"). (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 21; ECF No. 163 \u00b6 10). Miami Chocolates refused for the same reasons it refused to install the Micros System. (ECF Nos. 163 \u00b6 22, 166 \u00b6\u00b6 30-31). On December 2, 2015, PFA sent Miami Chocolates a Notice of Default. (ECF No. 163 \u00b6 24). Miami Chocolates responded by confirming its refusal to change over to the New POS System (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 25), prompting PFA to send the Notice of Termination on January 28, 2015. (ECF Nos. 20, 163 \u00b6 12).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Miami Chocolates continued operating following the termination (ECF No. 163 \u00b6 16-17), but Defendants claim they took\n    several steps to disassociate it from PFA and its trademarks.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    (ECF No. (ECF No. 166 \u00b6\u00b6 48-49). PFA disagrees:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n    It was not until PFA filed for emergency preliminary injunctive relief in this Court ... that Defendants made any effort to cease operating as a Peterbrooke shop. But even those efforts were woefully inadequate and ineffective. Defendants took half-hearted measures (e.g., sloppily spray painting over the word \"Peterbrooke\" on the distinctively shaped and colored outdoor Peterbrooke Chocolatier sign, placing a garbage bag over another prominent exterior sign) that actually harmed PFA, making the premium Peterbrooke Chocolatier brand look d\u00e9class\u00e9 and unreliable....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n    Even after removing the word \"Peterbrooke\" from the premises, Defendants continue to still use PFA's trade dress, phone numbers, social media pages, and operate at the location in violation of the Franchise Agreement's valid non-compete provision.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    (ECF No. 163 \u00b6\u00b6 18-20).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    PFA filed this lawsuit on February 4, 2016. (ECF No. 1). The five-count Amended Complaint alleges: (1) Lanham Act infringement (Count I); (2) Lanham Act false designations (Count II); (3) common-law trademark infringement (Count III); (4) common-law unfair competition (Count IV); and (5) breach of the Franchise Agreement (Count V). (ECF No. 63).\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    The trademark infringement claims (Counts I, II, and III) and the unfair competition claim (Count IV) are against all Defendants. The breach of contract claim (Count V) is against Miami Chocolates alone.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    On February 25, 2016, Defendants asserted five counterclaims: (1) breach of contract (Count I); (2) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (Count II); (3) violation of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20501.203\">\n     Fla.

I granted PFA's motion to dismiss Counts IV and V on August 1, 2016. (ECF No. 73).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    PFA and Defendants filed the instant motions for summary judgment on June 29, 2018 (ECF No. 164) and July 1, 2018 (ECF No. 167), respectively. Both sides seek dismissal of the other side's claims. PFA also asks for summary judgment on its own claims. Defendants do the same, but only as to Count I, their breach of contract claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    <strong>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Summary judgment \"shall be granted if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"\n    <em>\n     Allen v.

PFA's Termination of the Franchise Agreement\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    PFA claims that it was entitled to terminate the Franchise Agreement because Miami Chocolates breached it by refusing to install the New POS System. Defendants dispute that assertion on several grounds, arguing,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    : (1) PFA did not adequately test the POS system before rolling it out; (2) the New POS System did not meet industry standards and was inferior to the POS system Miami Chocolates already was using; and (3) even if Miami Chocolates did breach the Agreement, the breach was not material.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    <em>\n     1.

(ECF No. 1 Ex. A at 25, \u00a7 4.64). Defendants contend the record is \"devoid\" of\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    evidence that PFA conducted the required testing and analysis. (ECF No. 167 at 3). To the contrary, Jeff Smith, PFA's CEO, testified:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n    When PFA was considering the decision to implement the NCR and Simplebox POS System, we did extensive testing to evaluate whether this system would benefit the franchise as a whole, as well as individual franchised shops. We first implemented the NCR and Simplebox system in two kiosk locations for approximately six months, and the results were extremely positive. As a result, we implemented the new system in two company-owned Peterbrooke Chocolatier Shops, which also had positive results. It was only after implementing the NCR and Simplebox system in every corporate-owned Peterbrooke Chocolatier Shop, all with positive results, that we made the decision to require franchised shops to implement the new system.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    (ECF No. 8-1 \u00b6 12).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Smith gave similar testimony at the April 20, 2016 preliminary injunction hearing. (ECF No. 136-6 at 30 (\"We continued the testing phase. We went and installed it in corporate locations first, got any additional bugs worked out that may have been in there, and reduced the price. We went to Micros and got a cost reduction.\"), 33-34 (\"Q. As you began testing NCR Silver, what did you learn about it in terms of its comparison to the prior Micros system that was being used?\" \"A. It was more efficient, gathered more data. It gave us the ability to do more inventory control. It allowed to us track employee as well as device sales. It just gave us a whole lot of technology ability, and the speed of the transaction was much faster as well.\"), 37-38 (\"We tested in one corporate store and.... [h]aving completed that test ... rolled it into corporate locations across the course of the next four to five months.\") ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Defendants point to nothing in the record that contradicts Smith's testimony. To the extent they argue that PFA's testing regime was inadequate, PFA correctly points out that \"[t]here is no language in the Franchise Agreement that sets out some kind of gauntlet of testing and analysis that PFA must carry out until a franchisee is satisfied before it can institute a POS change.\" (ECF No. 183 at 4). Thus, the record establishes that PFA tested the New POS System in good faith before requiring Miami Chocolates to install it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    <em>\n     2. Quality of the New POS System\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Defendants also argue that the New POS System did not comport with what they claim are new \"industry standards\" requiring a \"chip reader\" to protect against credit card fraud. (ECF No. 166 \u00b6 30). They assert that Miami Chocolates' old POS system was superior to the New POS System because it had a \"chip reader,\" and that PFA ignored this issue because the franchisees, not PFA, bore the risk of credit card fraud. Defendants quote two excerpts from Smith's testimony to support their position:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n    The whole [credit card] technology industry caught us off guard for the October 1, 2015 [deadline] for the chip readers. Like I said earlier, it is not a mandatory program. All it does is shift liability from the banks to the retailers....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n    [The credit card \"chip reader\" innovation] is purely a financial matter by the\n    banks. We used to write checks. When the bank got a returned check, they [re]turned it to the retailer, and they took money back out of the retailer's account so the bank had no exposure. As we went to debit cards and credit cards, the exposure shifted to the banks. This is just the banks shifting the responsibility back to the retailers like they used to do with checks. It's all about the money with the bank.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    (ECF No. 136-6 at 61).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    According to Defendants, Smith's \"cavalier attitude\" toward \"chip readers\" is evidence that PFA terminated the Agreement in bad faith. (ECF No. 167 at 6). But Smith's testimony does not show he acted in bad faith; it shows he is skeptical about the importance of \"chip readers\" to a retailer's business. Defendants may disagree with Smith's opinion, but mere disagreement does not mean PFA acted in bad faith.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     King v.

Again, however, nothing in the Agreement required PFA to share the details of its testing, analysis, and selection process with Miami Chocolates. The decision belonged to PFA, and to PFA alone.

Burger King later introduced a new POS policy requiring franchisees to replace their POS system when it became \"obsolete.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *2. The franchisee failed to replace the POS system when required, so Burger King terminated the franchisee agreement and sued the franchisee for trademark infringement and breach of contract.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *2-3. The franchisee argued, as Defendants do here, that \"he [was] not using the marks without consent because BKC improperly terminated the Franchise Agreements.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *4-5. The court concluded that there was a \"substantial factual question\" as to whether the POS systems that were installed at the franchisee's restaurants were \"obsolete\" at the time Burger King issued the new POS policy:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n    [I]t is not this Court's task to question BKC's business judgment whether the data and operational improvements offered by the New POS System is substantially the same or better than the old system, BKC's permissive business decisions must be within the parameters outlined in the Franchise Agreements. Clearly, the new POS system makes is easier for the BKC to monitor royalty payments and to audit sales. However, whether this ability makes the older POS system \"obsolete\" is a much closer and debatable question that should be resolved on the full record and at trial if necessary. In today's rapid growing world of technology new creative inventions are uncovered on nearly daily basis. Each new invention, although it may be a clear improvement over the older version of the same product, does not necessarily make the older product \"obsolete.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *6.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Based on that holding, Defendants argue \"a franchisee's failure to install a New POS System when its POS system is adequate cannot constitute a material breach justifying termination.\" (ECF No. 176 at 7).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    PFA counters that unlike the Franchise Agreement here, the\n    <em>\n     Cabrera\n    </em>\n    agreement \"explicitly stated that [Burger King] could only demand that franchisees replace a POS system under certain circumstances.... The plain and unambiguous language of the\n    <em>\n     Cabrera\n    </em>\n    Agreement set forth conditions precedent that needed to transpire before [Burger King] could require franchisees to replace a POS system: (1) when it was obsolete or inoperable; (2) due to a change in menu; (3) due to a change in method of preparation and service of product, or (4) for health and safety considerations.\" (ECF No. 123 at 2). The court was not convinced that defendant's\n    failure to make changes to its POS system rendered the system \"obsolete,\" at least not at the preliminary injunction stage.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *6. The court clarified, however, that its ruling\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n    does not mean ... that [Burger King] will not ultimately prevail on this issue, either on summary judgment or at trial.\n    <em>\n     If the Court or trier of fact determines that [Burger King's] policy to update the POS systems on this timetable rendered the existing equipment obsolete [thus meeting one of the franchise agreement's conditions precedent, Burger King] will then be able to shut down Defendants' operations.\n    </em>\n    The question here is a more limited one: can [the court] make that determination before a plenary review of the case on a preliminary injunction motion. [The court is] much less certain of that.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *7 (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Thus,\n    <em>\n     Cabrera\n    </em>\n    does not stand for the proposition Defendants claim. Moreover, unlike the agreement in\n    <em>\n     Cabrera\n    </em>\n    , the Franchise Agreement imposes no conditions precedent on PFA's right to require installation of a new POS system, assuming that it first tests the system and determines it would benefit Miami Chocolates.\n    <em>\n     Cabrera\n    </em>\n    , then, is inapplicable, and Defendants' reliance on it to argue that their alleged breach was not material is misplaced.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    In sum, Defendants' arguments challenging the validity of PFA's termination of the Franchise Agreement are unpersuasive. The termination was valid because Miami Chocolates breached the Agreement by refusing to install the New POS System. No questions of material fact preclude summary judgment on that issue.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    <strong>\n     B.\n     <em>\n      Breach of the Non-Compete Provision\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    The Franchise Agreement contains a restrictive covenant that prohibits a former franchisee from operating a competing business within twenty-five miles of its former location or other franchise locations for two years (the \"Non-Compete Provision\"). (ECF No. 1-1 \u00a7 19.4). Defendants allege \"PFA lacks any evidence demonstrating that it has a legitimate business interest in protecting the goodwill associated with its trademark and the franchise system as a whole.\" (ECF No. 167 at 16).

They point to the fact that the magistrate judge declined to enforce the Non-Compete Provision at the preliminary injunction stage.

A preliminary ruling on a partial record is therefore not dispositive as to any factual issue.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    For its part, PFA contends its legitimate business interests include protecting the goodwill associated with Peterbrooke in the geographic region and protecting the ability to sell new franchises.

First, Defendants do not seriously dispute that the Franchise Agreement between PFI and Miami Chocolates is valid.

Given the extensive harm PFA claims to have suffered from Miami Chocolates' continued operation after termination, it makes no sense that PFA would agree to such a term. Indeed, if the Agreement required Miami Chocolates to stop using Peterbrooke trademarks immediately upon termination, it makes no sense that PFA would even want two separate notification deadlines.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    On the other hand, under Defendants' interpretation of Section 19, Section 19.2.1 imposes a general obligation on Miami Chocolates to stop using Peterbrooke trademarks upon termination or expiration of the Agreement, and Section 19.2.2 establishes a timetable for Miami Chocolates to comply and notify PFA.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     World of Beer Franchising, Inc. v.

In that scenario, the Agreement permitted Miami Chocolates to leave outdoor signs in place until PFA decided whether it was going to purchase the Shop. That would explain why PFA agreed to two separate deadlines in Section 19.2.2, and why one of them is two months longer than the other. I therefore adopt Defendants' interpretation.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     In re Finevest Foods, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6527080\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/159/972/#p978\">\n     159 B.R. 972\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 978 (M.D. Fla. 1993) (\"[I]f one interpretation would lead to an absurd conclusion then that interpretation should be abandoned and one adopted that accords with a reasonable, logical and rational interpretation.\") (citing\n    <em>\n     Triple E.

Defendants insist that it did not (ECF No. 166 \u00b6\u00b6 47-50), and there is no evidence showing otherwise. Accordingly, PFA cannot prove its trademark infringement claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    PFA also alleges that Defendants misappropriated other valuable PFA business assets, including PFA's phone numbers, social media pages, and the Shop location. (ECF Nos. 70-1, 70-2, 163 \u00b6 20). Defendants do not appear to dispute that assertion.

Thus, to prevail, PFA must show (1) Defendants used a term, name, symbol, or device in commerce; (2) in connection with goods, services, or container for goods; (3) which is likely to cause confusion, or mistake, or to deceive the public; (4) as to the affiliation, connection or association of Defendants and PFA.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Dunkin' Donuts Inc. v.

Even if it could, its damages argument fails. PFA seeks statutory damages under \u00a7 1117(c). (ECF No. 164 at 12-13). PFA contends that it may elect an award of $1,000 to $200,000 for each of the three \"counterfeit marks\" Defendants allegedly used post-termination.

If, however, Miami Chocolates operated at a loss during the period it competed unfairly, the royalties PFA normally received and the expenditures necessary to establish a new franchise will be elements of the damages award.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ramada Inns, Inc. v.

(ECF No.1-1 at 78). Specifically, the Addendum modifies Section 19.7 of the Agreement as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n    [L]iquidated damages equal to the present value ... of the Royalty Fees You would have paid on the product of (a) the Shop's average monthly Gross Revenue during the twelve (12) months of operation preceding the effective date of termination multiplied by (b)\n    <s>\n     the number of months remaining in the Agreement had it not been terminated by Us or You.\"\n    </s>\n    twelve months.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    PFA makes no attempt to argue that the Addendum does not apply. Indeed, it is well settled that when liquidated damages provisions \"are fair and reasonable attempts to fix just compensation for anticipated loss caused by breach of contract,\" they are enforceable.\n    <em>\n     Priebe &amp; Sons v.

Accordingly, by the Court's calculation, PFA is entitled to $10,275.36 for breach of the Non-Compete Provision under the post-Addendum liquidated damages provision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    <strong>\n     II.\n     <em>\n      Defendants' Counterclaims\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Defendants' three remaining counterclaims are: (1) breach of contract (Count I); (2) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (Count II); (3) violation of FDUTPA (Count III). (ECF No. 6 \u00b6\u00b6 55-85). PFA moves for summary judgment on all Counts, while Defendants seek summary judgment only as to Count I.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    <strong>\n     A. Breach of Contract\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    In Count I, Defendants assert that Peterbrooke \"has breached the Agreement by not providing Miami Chocolates with the high-quality products contemplated by the Agreement.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 60). Defendants generally complain about the quality of a few product shipments Miami Chocolates received, but fail to present evidence identifying particular shipments they claim were substandard. Nor do they offer any evidence of harm.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    Defendants further assert that PFA has not provided a host of services delineated in Paragraph 64 of the Counterclaim, including not \"regularly updat[ing] the recipe book\" or \"operations manual\" and not establishing a \"Public Relations Strategy.\" But none of the alleged obligations listed in Paragraph 64 even exist in\n    the Franchise Agreement. Section 5.2.1 states that PFA\n    <em>\n     may\n    </em>\n    provide additional training. (ECF No. 1-1 at 10-11, \u00a7 5.2.1). Section 5.4 states that the operations manual\n    <em>\n     may\n    </em>\n    be modified from time to time. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 11, \u00a7 5.4). And although Section 5.3 provides that PFA will provide special training if requested by Miami Chocolates (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 11, \u00a7 5.3), there is no evidence that Miami Chocolates ever made such a request.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    In short, Defendants have not established that PFA breached the Franchise Agreement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    <strong>\n     B. Breach of Good Faith and Fair Dealing\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    It is well settled that there can be no breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing absent a breach of contract.\n    <em>\n     Burger King Corp. v.

As PFA did not breach the Franchise Agreement, Count II of Defendants' Counterclaim fails.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    <strong>\n     C. FDUTPA Violation\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    A FDUTPA claim has three elements: \"(i) a deceptive act or unfair practice; (ii) causation; and (iii) actual damages.\"\n    <em>\n     City First Mort.
