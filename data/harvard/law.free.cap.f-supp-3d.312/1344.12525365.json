Donall's Motion for Summary Judgment, (\"Motion,\" D.E. 46), filed November 30, 2017. Plaintiff Aynour Soliman filed a Response on December 22, 2017, (\"Response,\" D.E. 50), to which Defendants filed a Reply on January 5, 2018, (\"Reply,\" D.E. 54). Upon review of the Motion, Response, Reply, and the record, the Court finds as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff worked as a server at Palace Bar-a restaurant and bar located in Miami Beach, Florida-from February 2, 2015 through October 9, 2016. (Defs.' Facts \u00b6\u00b6 1-2.) Defendant Donall owns Palace Bar. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Servers at Palace Bar are paid an hourly wage, a portion of a 20% service charge that is added to every customer's bill, and tips paid by customers at their discretion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.) In 2015 and 2016, Florida's minimum wage was $8.05, (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-11); \"time-and-a-half\" was $12.08 for non-tipped employees, and $7.55 for tipped employees, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12). According to Defendants, Plaintiff was paid $5.03 per hour, which represents the minimum wage reduced by the \"tip credit\" of $3.02 per hour. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.) However, Plaintiff states that she was actually paid less than $5.03 per hour. (Pl.'s Facts \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The 20% service charge is split among the staff as follows: 15% to the server, 1% to the host, 1% to the food runner, 1% to the bartender, and 2% split between the manager and housemen, with the manager receiving 1/3 of the 2% and the remainder going to the housemen. (Defs.' Facts \u00b6\u00b6 17-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Although Defendants claim that the 20% service charge is referred to as \"mandatory gratuity\" or \"auto gratuity,\" (Defs.' Facts \u00b6 14), Plaintiff states that the service charge is a \"suggested\" gratuity, is not\n   mandatory, and can be removed from the bill at the customer's discretion, (Pl.'s Facts \u00b6 13). Plaintiff states that \"customers had the right and ability to not pay the service charges and often\" exercised that right. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff's wages, less withholdings, were paid bi-weekly. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) While the servers were paid their portion of the service charge and tips at the end of their shifts, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21), those monies were recorded on their paystubs, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23). According to Plaintiff, the \"reported tips\" entry on her paystubs stated the full amount of the 20% service charge without reduction for payouts to other staff. (Pl.'s Facts \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff was paid a total of $45,353.92 in 2015, and a total of $44,620.69 in 2016; (Defs.' Facts \u00b6\u00b6 25-26); these amounts are reflected on the W-2 forms Palace Bar issued Plaintiff for 2015 and 2016, respectively, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 74-75).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff's total compensation divided by the number of hours Plaintiff worked shows that Plaintiff consistently earned more than 1.5 times the minimum wage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71.) According to Defendant's calculation, Plaintiff earned on average $26.00 per hour.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff's portion of the 20% service charge always constituted more than 50% of her pay. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On November 28, 2016, Plaintiff filed her Complaint against Defendants. (D.E. 1.) Count I alleges a minimum wage violation under the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\") against both Defendants-specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Palace Bar was not entitled to take the tip credit and, therefore, her hourly wage fell below Florida's minimum wage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-23.) Count II alleges an overtime wage violation\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   against both Defendants based on Palace Bar's failure to pay Plaintiff \"time-and-a-half\" for all hours worked over 40 hours per week. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-27.) Count III alleges that Defendants violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207434\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) by issuing Plaintiff fraudulent W-2 forms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28-34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 14, 2017, Defendants filed their Amended Answer and Affirmative Defenses. (D.E. 29.) Therein, Defendants admitted the following allegations contained in the Complaint:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant Donall was the owner, operator, and manager of Palace Bar, \"and was actively involved in, supervised, and ran the day-to-day operations and financial affairs of [Palace Bar].\" (Compl. \u00b6 6; Am. Answer \u00b6 6.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant Donall \"was at all relevant times, and still is, a statutory 'employer' under the FLSA in that he acted, directly or indirectly, on behalf of [Palace Bar] in relation to Plaintiff, and regularly exercised authority to hire and fire employees of [Palace Bar], determined the work schedules of employees of [Palace Bar], set the rates of pay and compensation for employees of [Palace Bar], controlled the finances of [Palace Bar], and oversaw, supervised, and controlled the day-to-day operations of [Palace Bar].\" (Compl. \u00b6 7; Am. Answer \u00b6 7.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Among Defendants' Affirmative Defenses: are that (1) to the extent that it is ultimately determined that some hours of work were not properly paid to Plaintiff, such amounts were de minimis; and (2) Plaintiff is exempt from the FLSA's overtime wage provisions as a commissioned sales employee. (Answer at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On November 30, 2017, Defendants filed the instant Motion for Summary Judgment. (D.E. 46.) On March 14, 2018, the Parties appeared before the Court for Pretrial Conference, during which the Court heard argument regarding the instant Motion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 64.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On a motion for summary judgment, the Court is to construe the evidence and factual inferences arising therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\n   <em>\n    Adickes v.

Summary judgment can be entered on a claim only if it is shown \"that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). In addition, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f)(1), the Court may grant summary judgment for the non-moving party \"[a]fter giving notice and a reasonable time to respond.\" Fed.

The Supreme Court has explained the summary judgment standard as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [T]he plain language of [ Rule 56 ] mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial. In such a situation, there can be no genuine issue as to any material fact, since a complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the non-moving party's case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.
