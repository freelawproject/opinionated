Accordingly, this Court reviewed copies of OTB3 [71-2], and the novel [71-1] and film [41-2] versions of\n   <em>\n    Gone Girl\n   </em>\n   , and provides brief summaries of the material. Obviously, spoilers lie ahead for any reader who has not read or seen the works.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    1. OTB3\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   OTB3 opens with a shot of its central protagonist, Mary, immediately after a car accident. Her mother, June, asks in voice-over: \"Do you ever really know anyone?\" The action then flashes back to the first time Mary met her husband, Steve. Mary and her then-partner Carl come across Steve at a night-club and prevent him from driving drunk, which prompts Steve to pursue Mary. From there, the story unfolds chronologically through brief scenes of Steve and Mary's relationship and eventual marriage, which quickly becomes an unhappy one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Steve-\"charming,\" \"confident,\" and \"well-bred\"-comes from a wealthy family that disapproves of Mary. Mary appears naive and vulnerable, insecure about Steve's reasons for marrying her. Carl, a racecar driver, stays in the picture, periodically showing up at Mary and Steve's house and provoking Steve's jealousy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Steve and Mary's relationship deteriorates; Steve drinks heavily and seems to threaten Mary. Then, while Mary is driving, the two end up in the car crash depicted in the opening scene. Following the accident, Mary wakes to discover she has been in a coma for seven years. During that time, she has given birth to a son (Little Steve) and Steve has divorced her to marry Eileen, a \"sleek, sophisticated\" yoga instructor who has become close to Little Steve.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Mary's resentment of Steve and Eileen turns to rage as she sees herself shut out of Little Steve's life. When Carl shows up to visit Mary, the audience learns that the two of them planned the car accident, intending to kill Steve and profit from his life insurance policy. Carl and Mary had been having an affair, and Little Steve might be Carl's son.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Mary's increasingly angry and possessive behavior tips into the criminal as she stalks and threatens Steve. She then attempts to kill Steve at his hunting cabin; the two grapple in an increasingly violent fight that culminates in violent sex. This rekindles their regard for each other and they begin an affair, with Steve drawn to Mary's newly-revealed aggressiveness. Steve loses interest in Eileen, and he and Mary devise a plan to kill Eileen and resume their life as a family with Little Steve. To that end, Steve lures Eileen to the hunting cabin. Mary attempts to shoot Eileen, who escapes. Carl appears, shoots and kills Steve, and drives away. Mary and Eileen then try to kill each other, and Eileen succeeds. OTB3 ends with a final scene between Carl and Steve's estranged brother Mark; the audience realizes that Carl and Mark are lovers who have been plotting Steve's downfall all along.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Alternate Version of OTB\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In response to Defendants' motions to dismiss, Plaintiff contends that her infringed work is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   OTB3 but an earlier draft of the screenplay, [84-2], which Plaintiff now says is the version she gave Alessandra in 2008, [84] at 5 n.1. This contradicts Plaintiff's complaint,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   [55] \u00b6\u00b6 28, 30, and leaves unclear whether the\n   draft that Plaintiff now offers is even protected by copyright-a prerequisite for her claims. Although plaintiffs generally cannot amend a complaint through briefs opposing a motion to dismiss,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perkins v. Silverstein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10522931\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/939/463/\">\n    939 F.2d 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 470 n.6 (7th Cir. 1991), the new draft that Plaintiff provided so closely resembles OTB3 that this Court need not expend resources in permitting a separate, superfluous amendment. Rather, this Court's analysis of OTB3 applies equally to this new version of the screenplay, and this Court briefly notes the minor, immaterial differences between the two drafts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The alternate version of\n   <em>\n    Out of the Blue\n   </em>\n   follows the same structure as OTB3, opening with a flash-forward to Mary and Steve's accident before tracing their relationship through its deterioration, Mary's coma, and the bloody shoot-out at Steve's hunting cabin. The alternate version provides some additional details about Mary (\"she read wedding magazines her whole life\") and Steve (\"like other children of the wealthy, he presents well by hiding emotion\"). It also includes new or expanded scenes of Steve's family, fleshing out his parents' snobbery and Mark's troubled relationship with his family, stemming from their homophobia. Finally, when Mary and Steve enact their plan to kill Eileen, Steve befriends a couple of hunters while Mary stalks Eileen. The remaining scenes substantially match those in OTB3, as do the themes, dialogue, and characters.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   [84-2],\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   [71-2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Gone Girl\n    </em>\n    : Novel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The novel is divided into three parts. Part One opens on \"The Day Of\" the disappearance of Amy Dunne, as her husband, Nick, wakes up on the morning of their fifth anniversary. In the opening passage, Nick conjures an image of his wife's head and recalls how he has often wondered: \"What are you thinking Amy? How are you feeling? Who are you? What have we done to each other?\" A brief exposition establishes that Nick and Amy used to be magazine writers in New York City, but lost their jobs in the Great Recession and moved back to Nick's Missouri hometown when his mother got sick. Amy, a native New Yorker, is the child of two psychologists who wrote a series of instructive children's books about \"Amazing Amy,\" an idealized version of her. The chapter proceeds as Nick narrates (most of) his activities in the hours before Amy's disappearance, which he discovers upon returning from the bar that he runs with his twin sister Margo (Go).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   From there, Part One alternates between Nick's present-the days following Amy's disappearance-and Amy's past, depicted through her diary entries. The diary chapters narrate Nick and Amy's courtship and marriage, eventually catching up to the day of Amy's disappearance. Nick's narrative reveals his estrangement from Amy and his growing self-consciousness and discomfort with the scrutiny he receives from the public, the media, and the police in the wake of Amy's disappearance. Nick relates his troubled relationship with his father-an embittered, misogynist presence in Nick's life-and displays his desperate need for approval. As Nick notes the lies he tells the police and pursues an affair with a much younger woman, his chapters raise the reader's suspicion that he is an unreliable narrator who may have actually killed Amy. Mid-investigation, the public revelation that Amy was pregnant when she disappeared increases national outrage over Amy's case. Unfolding in parallel, Amy's diary entries record her deteriorating relationship with Nick and his spiraling behavior, from maxing out their credit on luxury goods, to infidelity, to domestic violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Part One closes, however, with the reveal that the expensive items Nick supposedly\n   bought are stashed-without his knowledge-in Go's woodshed. Part Two opens with Amy-very much alive-narrating how she staged her disappearance. Along with the reader, Nick realizes that Amy framed him for her own murder, in revenge for his infidelity. Amy's \"diary\" entries are fake, one of many carefully staged clues that Amy left to incriminate Nick. So is her pregnancy, which she invented to inflame public opinion against Nick.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Following this revelation, Part Two continues to alternate between Nick and Amy's points of view, which now follow roughly the same timeline. Nick hires an expensive, media-savvy attorney, Tanner Bolt, and he, Bolt, and Go strategize along dual tracks: how to regain the public's sympathy (as cable news rushes to convict him) and how to tempt Amy out of hiding. Nick finds out that Amy has framed others before him: Hilary Handy, a girl that Amy accused of stalking her in high school, and Tommy O'Hara, an ex-boyfriend that Amy accused of rape. Amy, meanwhile, disguises herself and hides out in the Ozarks until she is robbed and forced to turn to her wealthy ex-boyfriend, Desi Collings. Still obsessed with her, Desi agrees to keep her secret and hides her at his lake house. Over the next weeks, Desi becomes controlling and possessive, effectively making Amy his prisoner. From Desi's lake house, Amy follows news coverage of her disappearance, and, moved by Nick's TV interviews, decides she wants to return to him. As Part Two ends, the police arrest Nick and Amy moves to free herself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In Part Three, Amy returns to Nick covered in blood, causing a frenzy among the media camped in front of their house. Amy tells the police that Desi abducted her and she killed him to escape. The reader and Nick, however, know that Amy decided to murder Desi to return to Nick, who she now believes has proved his devotion to her. Amy convinces the public, but Detective Rhonda Boney does not trust her story. Boney, Nick, and Go try to prove what really happened, even as Nick puts on a front of reconciliation for the media. Nick admits to himself that he remains fascinated by Amy, but his primary desire is to prove what Amy did and to leave her without fear of retribution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Amy knows that Nick wants to leave; in a final act of manipulation she impregnates herself with a stored sample of Nick's sperm. When Amy reveals her pregnancy, Nick decides to stay with her to protect his child. Amy narrates the final chapter, some months in the future. She notes the ways in which Nick has behaved like the perfect husband, but dwells on a criticism he let slip, suggesting that she will soon turn against him again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Gone Girl\n    </em>\n    : Film\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The film closely adheres to the novel, although it necessarily compresses events and omits much of Nick and Amy's interior monologues (parts of which remain as voice-overs). Overall, it follows the same structure, from Nick's opening reverie about Amy's head-which provides the film's opening and closing images- to the protagonists' alternating scenes and timelines. The film reduces the role of Nick's father and places greater emphasis on the presence and effect of the media. The film drops the character of Hilary Handy and the final scene hinting that Amy may turn on Nick. More significantly, the film walks back the idea that Nick retains any affection for Amy at the end; instead, Amy tells him that he could never replace her and Go speculates that Nick must want to stay with Amy. Nick maintains that he has to stay with Amy for the good of their unborn child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

[55] \u00b6\u00b6 67-69. This Court finds no substantial similarity between these protagonists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Amy comes from New York City's upper class, the product of boarding school and multiple institutions of higher education. She is somewhat famous and, initially, wealthy, thanks to her parents' \"Amazing Amy\" series. When she meets Nick, she works as a quiz-writer for magazines. Before the plot twist reveals Amy's psychotic vendetta against Nick, her (falsified) diary entries portray her as witty, charming, and accommodating, while Nick recalls her demanding nature. The events following the twist reveal Amy to be brilliant, cold, and calculating, ready to punish anyone who diminishes her. Amy methodically plots to frame first Nick and then Desi. She revels in the ease with which she assumes different personas and how fully Nick fell for her \"cool girl\" act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Mary, by contrast, comes from a lower-class background that Steve's family disparages, and initially appears demure and na\u00efve. She has no stated job and wants to be a stay-at-home mom for Little Steve. When, post-coma, Mary becomes more aggressive, her goal remains reclaiming her family and she becomes increasingly jealous of Eileen. Although the audience realizes that Mary staged her car accident, nothing in OTB3 suggests that this plan was particularly complex. Moreover, she devised it with her ex, Carl, rather than on her own. After Mary's coma, she acts impulsively and recklessly-attracting the attention of the police when she punctures Steve's tires, showing up at Steve's house to have sex while Eileen is in the shower, and trying and failing to kill first Steve and then Eileen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Although both Mary and Amy initially present more obliging versions of themselves to Steve and Nick, Mary's subsequent transformation results significantly from the external circumstances of her coma and Steve's remarriage, while Amy consistently acts on her own desires and instincts. Mary impulsively and unsuccessfully tries to kill Steve and Eileen, while Amy successfully stages a fake murder (her own) and a real one (Desi's), which she sets up to look like self-defense. Mary acts out of passion for Steve; Amy is her own priority. In short, these women possess different backgrounds, motives, and temperaments.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1793349\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/84/581/#p587\">\n    84 F.3d at 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding no substantial similarity where characters displayed differences in motives, skills, and \"interpersonal relationships\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Nick and Steve are likewise distinct. Steve actually is the arrogant, entitled frat-boy that people believe Nick to be, while Nick desperately wants to please everyone he meets. Steve comes from money and Nick grew up strictly working-class. Steve is homophobic and bluntly cruel to his gay brother Mark; Nick's twin Go is his closest friend. Steve marries Mary to rebel against his parents; Nick marries Amy because he loves her-or the woman she pretends to be. Both men fall out with their wives and behave badly toward them, but Steve's bad behavior extends into a second marriage; in any event, such a souring marriage-complete with an affair and excessive alcohol-is the sort of\n   <em>\n    sc\u00e8ne \u00e0 faire\n   </em>\n   that the Copyright Act does not protect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gaiman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2164121\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/360/644/#p659\">\n    360 F.3d at 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Plaintiff contends that both Steve and Nick become attracted to Mary and Amy\n   after discovering their dangerous sides.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , [84] at 15-16. This may be true of Steve, but Nick hates the Amy he has come to know. True, Nick admits-in the novel, if not the film-that he could never replace Amy (notably, this is not a sentiment discernable in Steve, who initially deems Eileen a reasonable replacement for Mary). But while Steve likes Mary's aggression, Nick remains strangely drawn not to the violence Amy displays in murdering Desi, but to what it represents: the force of her passion to reunite with him. The extreme steps she is willing to take appeals to his need to be needed, a trait\n   <em>\n    Gone Girl\n   </em>\n   explores at length.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Contrary to Plaintiff's contention, nothing in\n   <em>\n    Gone Girl\n   </em>\n   suggests that Amy's violence attracts Nick, or that he wants to \"commit\" to her because of it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. Rather, Nick remains fascinated and obsessed with Amy, and yet loathes her at the same time; he plans to leave her until she reveals her pregnancy. The relationships in these works thus only resemble each other at a highly abstracted level-the idea of a toxic relationship is hardly new,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and certainly not protectable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Atari\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1142338\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/672/607/#p615\">\n    672 F.2d at 615-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (generalized ideas are not protected by copyright).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In sum, these protagonists have little in common at the protected level. Moreover, a quick glance at other important characters shows equally dramatic distinctions: Mark, Steve's brother, plots revenge against him, while Go is Nick's strongest supporter; June, Mary's mother, is single, and \"worn from a hard life,\" while Amy's parents are well-off and in love; Carl, Mary's ex, is a racecar driver who wears \"Wal-Mart's best blue jeans,\" while Desi, Amy's ex, is even wealthier and more meticulously coiffed than she is. Nor does OTB3 offer any possible inspiration or analog for the other characters that populate\n   <em>\n    Gone Girl\n   </em>\n   , including the detectives, cable news hosts, and neighbors so key to\n   <em>\n    Gone Girl\n   </em>\n   's plot.

The \"cool girl\" persona that Amy takes on when meeting Nick matches his idealized expectation of a desirable woman; Amy's hatred of Nick stems, in large part, from her realization that when she dropped that persona Nick no longer loved her. Similarly, when Nick loved Amy he strove to be his \"best\" self for her, but withdraws as she becomes colder. Later, engulfed in the\n   police investigation, Nick appears guiltiest when his public appearances deviate from social expectations of how a grieving husband should behave. In the end, the public remains wholly and happily deceived by the reunion Amy and Nick perform for the media. Within their relationship, Nick and Amy now know their partner's true self, but Nick remains forced to abide by Amy's demanding expectations under the threat of renewed violence and his concern for their child. Thus, among other things,\n   <em>\n    Gone Girl\n   </em>\n   suggests that people often prefer an idealized version of life to the darker, flawed reality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In contrast, OTB3 has nothing terribly insightful to say about the human condition, and fails to provide any answer to the question \"how well one person can really know another.\" Steve and the audience initially perceive Mary to be docile and vulnerable, an image dispelled by the revelation that Mary plotted with Carl to kill Steve. Steve may not \"really know\" Mary when he meets her, but Carl appears to know her well. On the other hand, Mary does not \"really know\" Carl, since she appears unaware of his relationship with Mark. Eileen, however, remains what she appears to be (trusting, maternal), as does Steve (arrogant and entitled). To the extent that these characters illuminate the theme, they suggest that people in relationships may sometimes hide their true motives. OTB3 also focuses entirely upon interpersonal interactions rather than social expectations or unrealized ideals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Such distinct treatments of the theme represent a substantial difference between the works.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Funky Films\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3464199\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/462/1072/#p1079\">\n    462 F.3d at 1079-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff's contention that the works treat the theme similarly because both employ \"a visual of the female lead's head\" is unpersuasive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [55] \u00b6 71; [85] at 18. The \"visual\" in OTB3 shows Mary at the scene of the car crash, depicting her face \"covered in blood,\" while the image in\n   <em>\n    Gone Girl\n   </em>\n   is specifically of Amy's \"head,\" not her face, within a totally different context. The former foreshadows the violence to come; the latter emphasizes Amy's mystery. Here, too, the works offer different expressions of a general idea, which does not prove infringement.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hobbs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063015\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/722/1089/\">\n    722 F.3d at 1094\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally,\n   <em>\n    Gone Girl\n   </em>\n   explores numerous themes lacking any analog in OTB3- including the effects of economic insecurity, the failures of a superficial media, different incarnations of misogyny, and the public fascination with crime-which also weighs against finding similarity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1793349\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/84/581/#p587\">\n    84 F.3d at 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Plot\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   As should be clear from the summaries above, the plots of OTB3 and\n   <em>\n    Gone Girl\n   </em>\n   differ in numerous and important ways. Amy frames Nick for her (faked) death; Mary tries to kill Steve and ends up in a (real) coma. Mary first plots with Carl against Steve, then with Steve against Eileen, while Amy pursues her own ends solo. Steve divorces Mary for Eileen and then cheats on Eileen with Mary; Nick cheats on Amy but is prevented from divorcing her, first by her faked disappearance, and then by the combination of Amy's threats and pregnancy. The \"sequence of events\" in OTB3 traces the interactions of five lovers, four of whom engage in machinations and secret affairs that lead to crimes of passion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Atari\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1142338\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/672/607/#p615\">\n    672 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   616 n.8. In\n   <em>\n    Gone Girl\n   </em>\n   , the police investigation into Amy's disappearance shapes the plot, though its focus expands to draw in Nick and Amy's history and to lay out Amy's intricate deceptions. Quite simply, the works \"tell different stories.\"\n   <em>\n    Hobbs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063015\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/722/1089/\">\n    722 F.3d at 1096\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Again, to the extent that the works share any plot elements, they do so at the level of unprotected general ideas or\n   <em>\n    sc\u00e8nes \u00e0 faire\n   </em>\n   . A wife plotting against her\n   husband, a jealous or vengeful lover, an alienated husband, and a woman who is more dangerous than she appears are no more protectable than the stock characters that evolved from the\n   <em>\n    commedia dell'arte\n   </em>\n   or any other \"standard features\" of a genre.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gaiman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2164121\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/360/644/#p659\">\n    360 F.3d at 659-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stock characters remain unprotected because they \"are the products not of the creative imagination but of simple observation of the human comedy\"); Joseph P.

The works display countless and significant differences within each of these categories, of which this Court provides only a few examples.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The pacing differs in that\n   <em>\n    Gone Girl\n   </em>\n   builds tension deliberately, often by playing Nick and Amy's narratives off each other, with carefully spaced reveals- including Amy's (first, fake) pregnancy and Nick's affair-periodically jolting the story forward. OTB3, by contrast, starts slowly, showing Mary and Steve's courtship, and then shifts into high gear after Mary's coma and stays there, speeding through reveals, twists, and acts of violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The structures of the works differ most obviously in their use of time.\n   <em>\n    Gone Girl\n   </em>\n   first switches between Nick's present and Amy's past, narrated by diary entries covering seven years. The second part finds Amy's narrative still trailing Nick's by some days, until their stories converge in the final section. OTB3, by contrast, contains a single flash-forward and then proceeds strictly chronologically.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Finally,\n   <em>\n    Gone Girl\n   </em>\n   provides specific settings, mainly New York City in the 2000s and the (fictional) North Carthage, Missouri, in 2012. North Carthage is a suburban town buffeted by the Recession; its mall-a key source of employment- recently closed and many homes bear foreclosure signs. OTB3 never locates its setting in a real-world place or time. It never depicts the town where Steve and Mary live, though it mentions an ocean and cliffs, suggesting perhaps the American west coast. It shares no traits with New York and it resembles North Carthage only in its generic suggestions of suburbia-Eileen visits a mall, the houses have yards, and everyone drives. North Carthage's deliberately Midwestern feel and location on the Mississippi river sufficiently distinguish it from the generic and nameless setting of OTB3.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Herzog v. Castle Rock Entm't\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11567270\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/193/1241/#p1260\">\n    193 F.3d 1241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1260 (11th Cir. 1999) (distinguishing \"small town\" settings showing distinct characterization).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Overall, no ordinary observer could conclude that OTB3 and\n   <em>\n    Gone Girl\n   </em>\n   are substantially similar. Their common elements are standard in thrillers and at the level of particular expression they tell very \"different stories.\"\n   <em>\n    Hobbs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063015\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/722/1089/\">\n    722 F.3d at 1096\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff's alleged similarities either rely upon distortion or remain \"too general or tenuous to meet the legal standard for similarity.\"\n   <em>\n    Stromback\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9182039\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/384/283/#p297\">\n    384 F.3d at 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To take one example, Plaintiff notes that in both works \"the reader learns that the wife was purportedly pregnant at the time of the incident.\" [55] \u00b6 51. The relevant \"incident\" in OTB3 is the car accident; in\n   <em>\n    Gone Girl\n   </em>\n   it is Amy's disappearance. The car accident is real, albeit intentional; the disappearance is staged. In\n   <em>\n    Gone Girl\n   </em>\n   , Nick discovers that this particular pregnancy is another one of Amy's ruses. In OTB3, Mary is truly pregnant at the time of the car accident but learns of it upon waking from her coma. The vast majority of Plaintiff's alleged similarities rely upon such selectively truncated accounts of the works, avoiding the differences in expression that undermine her claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In sum, the works are not \"substantially similar\" as a matter of law and this Court dismisses Plaintiff's claims with prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hobbs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063015\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/722/1089/\">\n    722 F.3d at 1096\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming dismissal of direct infringement claim with prejudice for lack of substantial similarity);\n   <em>\n    Frerck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203512991\">\n    2014 WL 3512991\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (vicarious infringement requires showing of direct infringement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
