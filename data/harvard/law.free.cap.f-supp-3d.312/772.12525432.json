According to Plaintiffs, RAC regularly uses court process to collect on lease agreements it asserts are in default. (AC \u00b6 7) In Count I of the amended petition, Plaintiffs allege that RAC violated the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act (\"MMPA\") by taking default judgments against them in state court without having\n   obtained personal jurisdiction. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege the default judgments were based on returns of service signed by special process servers who were not appointed by the Court to serve process in accordance with Missouri law. (AC \u00b6\u00b6 8-15, 21-23) In Count II of the amended petition, Plaintiffs allege that RAC was unjustly enriched at the expense of Plaintiffs and the putative class members by the default judgments and monies collected after those judgments were entered. (AC \u00b6\u00b6 56-60) Plaintiffs seek damages and an order declaring RAC's prior judgments against them void as a matter of law and directing RAC to set the judgments aside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   RAC removed the case to this Court on January 5, 2018 based on diversity jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1441, 1446 and 1453, and the Class Action Fairness Act (\"CAFA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).

(\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 11)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Eighth Circuit and courts in this district have distinguished between claims attacking a state court decision and claims attacking an adverse party's actions in obtaining and enforcing that decision, holding that\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   bars only the former. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Skit\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3106837\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/487/1154/#p1157\">\n    487 F.3d 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , plaintiff sought to have a state court judgment against it set aside for lack of service and lack of personal jurisdiction. Because \"the alleged injury for which Skit seeks redress ... stems directly from the state court judgment itself rather than from some separate injury caused by the defendant, the court found Skit's complaint to be \"a classic illustration of the cases covered by the\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine,\" and affirmed the district court's dismissal of the action for lack of jurisdiction under\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3106837\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/487/1154/#p1157\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3106837\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/487/1154/#p1157\">\n    . at 1157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

To the extent the claims were premised on Wells Fargo's activities in filing the state action and enforcing the resulting judgment, plaintiff did not seek \"review and rejection\" of the judgment. Likewise, in\n   <em>\n    Mueller v. Barton\n   </em>\n   , No. 4:13-CV-2523 CAS,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204546061\">\n    2014 WL 4546061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Mo. Sept. 12, 2014), the court denied Barton's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, holding that\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   did not bar plaintiff's claims premised on Barton's alleged improper activities in filing the state court suit and in collecting under the consent judgment.

Mo. Jan. 5, 2009) (doctrine applied where defendant's actions in state court case formed the basis for plaintiff's case).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Here, Plaintiff was the losing party in state court proceedings that resulted in final judgment in favor of RAC. This judgment was entered before the current federal proceeding was commenced by way of removal. Plaintiff challenges the validity of the state court judgments based on defective service and requests this Court declare the judgments void and direct that they be set aside. Granting Plaintiff the relief she seeks would require this Court to effectively reverse the state court decision or void its ruling, exactly what the\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine prohibits. The Court therefore determines that the\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine divests this Court of subject matter jurisdiction over this action, and that this provides a basis for remand, as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff asks that the Court review and reject a state court judgment. Such a request is clearly outside the jurisdiction of this Court and must be remanded. Because the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction\n   over this action, RAC's pending motion to stay and compel arbitration will be denied without prejudice as moot\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Accordingly,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Plaintiffs' Motion To Remand [7] is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and this matter is\n   <strong>\n    REMANDED\n   </strong>\n   to the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendant Rent-A-Center, Inc's Motion for Leave to File Short Surreply in Further Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion to Remand [31] is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FINALLY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendant Rent-A-Center, Inc.'s Motion to Compel Individual Arbitration and Stay Litigation [15] is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   without prejudice to refiling in state court.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    RAC has requested leave to file a surreply in further opposition to Plaintiff's motion to remand (Doc.
