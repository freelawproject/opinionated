(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Case No. 13-408(GAG) at Docket No. 16.) After extensive plea negotiations, Defendant and the Government entered into a plea agreement whereby Defendant agreed to plead guilty by way of an information to violating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202421\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the transportation of an individual, as opposed to a minor, with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity.

Both parties agreed that the mandatory minimum of ten years imprisonment of section 2423(a) was excessive given the particular facts of this case. On July 31, 2014, the court held a change of plea hearing, whereby Defendant filed a waiver of indictment and pled guilty by way of information to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202421\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   in criminal case 14-466(GAG). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 1, 2, 6, and 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Thereafter, on May 11, 2015, the court sentenced Defendant to fifty-seven months imprisonment, based on a violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202421\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but reserved judgment on the following jurisdictional matter.

The court questioned whether section 2421 applies to an offense wholly within the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico because unlike section 2423(a), which applies to acts wholly within \"any commonwealth, territory or possession of the United States,\" section 2421\n   applies only to acts wholly within any \"Territory, or Possession of the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202421\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (transportation generally) with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202423\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (transportation of minors). Accordingly, the court ordered the Government to address this paramount issue of statutory interpretation. The Government timely filed its brief, arguing that section 2421 does indeed apply to Puerto Rico because despite its commonwealth status, it remains a territory of the United States. (Docket No. 43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Upon reviewing the Government's arguments, interpreting the applicable statutes along with the history of the unique relationship between the United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and adhering to binding judicial precedent, the court held that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202421\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which makes it a federal crime to transport any individual with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity \"in interstate or foreign commerce, or in any Territory or Possession of the United States,\" does not apply to a purely intrastate criminal act committed within the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Accordingly, the court vacated the Judgment at Docket No. 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Thereafter, the Government filed a motion for reconsideration of the court's Opinion and Order that vacated Judgment at Docket No. 46, which is now presently before the court. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 55.) The Government argues that contrary to the court's conclusion, it is not well-settled law that Puerto Rico is no longer a mere territory and that an examination of the purpose of section 2421 reveals that Congress intended to treat Puerto Rico as a territory for purposes of the statute. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Upon considering the Government's submission and the pertinent law, the court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   the Government's Motion for Reconsideration at Docket No. 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 46 at 4-11.)

After recognizing that \"Puerto Rico's status changed from that of a mere territory to the unique status of Commonwealth,\" the court explained that \"[t]he significance of this change from the point of view of the Sherman Act arises out of the fact that, as a general matter, the Sherman Act ceases to apply to purely local affairs once territories become states ....\"\n   <em>\n    C\u00f3rdova,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1235905\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/649/36/#p41\">\n    649 F.2d at 41-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

An examination of these two per curiam opinions reveals, however, that the Supreme Court did not hold, or even suggest, that Puerto Rico remains an unincorporated territory\n   <em>\n    for purposes of statutory interpretation.\n   </em>\n   Indeed, the undersigned acknowledges that the Territorial Clause continues to be the principle source of federal power over non-state areas, which encompasses Puerto Rico because it is not a State of the Union.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Franklin,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358040\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/805/322/#p344\">\n    805 F.3d at 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing the plenary powers conferred by the Territorial Clause).

By merely focusing on the constitutional status of the island, the Government is comparing apples and oranges. The court is not disputing that Puerto Rico is\n   <em>\n    constitutionally\n   </em>\n   a territory of the United States;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 46 at 4 n. 2; rather, it is recognizing that the congressional acts and juridical interpretations of federal laws over the past six decades have shown that Congress recognizes Puerto Rico as a commonwealth as opposed to a mere territory\n   <em>\n    for purposes of statutory interpretation.\n   </em>\n   By including the term \"commonwealth\" into the jurisdictional element of a statute, particularly section 2343(a), there could hardly be a clearer intention of said congressional purpose. Therefore, by amending section 2421 at the same time\n   and not including \"commonwealth,\" it appears that Congress intended to exclude the application of 2421 to intrastate activities within Puerto Rico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Accordingly, while the court recognizes that Puerto Rico continues to be governed by the scope of the Territorial Clause, contrary to the Government's contentions, Congress may not legislate as to purely local matters governed by the Puerto Rico Constitution, as binding First Circuit precedent denotes. For example, taking matters to the preposterous extreme, if the Government's position was indeed the norm, then Congress could again vest upon the President the power to appoint the island's governor and Supreme Court justices-actions that were permissible prior to 1952, or otherwise unilaterally amend the Commonwealth's Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    C\u00f3rdova,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1235905\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/649/36/#p41\">\n    649 F.2d at 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"prior to 1950, Puerto Rico's legal status was closer to that of a 'territory' than of a 'state.' \"). As such, the mere fact that the Commonwealth is still within the ambit of the Territorial Clause does not render it an unincorporated territory\n   <em>\n    for purposes of statutory interpretation.\n   </em>\n   Rather, the Territorial Clause continues to allow Congress to treat Puerto Rico differently from the States in as much as federal legislation is concerned,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   but not as to purely local intrastate affairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Upon considering the Government's submission and the pertinent law, the court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   its Motion for Reconsideration at Docket No. 55. Despite the Government's prayer for this court to pick and roll past First Circuit precedent and slam dunk in its favor, the court once again emphasizes that it is bound to adhere to binding authority, regardless of whether it agrees with it or not. Nonetheless, the Government of the United States is highly encouraged to exercise its right of appeal to the Court of Appeals to revisit and challenge the precedent applied by this court, which as noted in the previous Opinion and Order (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 46 at 15 &amp; n. 8), is contrary to precedent from the Eleventh Circuit, and more recently, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, the undersigned again emphasizes that this opinion and the previous one are based on pure statutory interpretation and judicial precedent. It is in no way a political determination of the future political status of Puerto Rico. That is a matter for the local electorate and Congress of the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Indeed, Circuit Judge Juan R.
