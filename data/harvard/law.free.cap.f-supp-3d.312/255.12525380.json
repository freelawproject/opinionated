(Docket No. 1 at p. 5.) The following facts are deemed admitted by both parties pursuant to Local Rule 56. Loc. Rule 56(e);\n   <em>\n    P.R. Am. Ins. Co. v.

(Docket No. 32, Ex. 3 at p. 9.) The defendants agreed to \"punctually pay the principal and interest\" in 60 monthly installments over the course of five years. (Docket No. 32, Ex. 3 at pp. 1 and 7.) The loan agreement permitted Westernbank to \"collect amounts due or about to become due\" in the event of default.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Reyes, Gonz\u00e1lez, and Pag\u00e1n provided Westernbank with a mortgage note for a property in R\u00edo Piedras, Puerto Rico as collateral for the loan. (Docket No. 32, Ex. 5 at p. 4.) Westernbank held this mortgage note for one month, until the Commissioner of Financial Intuitions for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico closed Westernbank on April 30, 2010. (Docket No. 32, Ex. 1 at p. 3.) The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, serving as receiver for Westernbank, assigned the mortgage note to Banco Popular de Puerto Rico (\"Banco Popular\"). (Docket No. 32, Ex. 4 at p. 5.) Banco Popular subsequently assigned the mortgage note to Condado. (Docket No. 32, Ex. 1 at p. 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Gonz\u00e1lez and Pag\u00e1n conceded that they \"fail[ed] to make the agreed upon payments.\" (Docket No. 40, Ex. 1 at p. 6.) Condado sent Gonz\u00e1lez and Pag\u00e1n a collection letter in December 2016, requesting that the defendants pay the outstanding balance within ten days. (Docket No. 32, Ex. 7 at p. 1.) The defendants failed to satisfy the loan within the requested timeframe. The defendants owe $265,480.28 and $26,672.07 in principal and interest, respectively.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docket No. 31, Ex. 1 at p. 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Condado commenced this action on January 24, 2017. (Docket No. 1.) In Condado's motion for summary judgment, it seeks to foreclose the mortgaged property, to collect from the defendants any deficient balance that may remain following foreclosure, and attorney's fees. (Docket No. 32 at pp. 8-10.) Gonz\u00e1lez and Pag\u00e1n opposed Condado's Rule 56 motion, and Condado replied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docket Nos. 40 and 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Aug. 20, 2011) (Casellas, J.) (granting summary judgement motion and permitting mortgage note holder to foreclosure on debtor's property).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   No genuine issue of material fact exists in this foreclosure action. Defendants borrowed $297,500.00 from Westernbank, securing this loan with property pursuant to the mortgage note. (Docket No. 32, Ex. 1, at pp. 2-5.) Reyes, Gonz\u00e1lez and Pag\u00e1n failed to make payments in contravention of the loan agreement and mortgage note. (Docket No. 32, Ex. 1 at p. 3.) Condado, as holder of the mortgage note, is entitled to foreclose on the property subject to the mortgage note. Gonz\u00e1lez and Pag\u00e1n oppose Condado's motion for summary judgment for two reasons: (1) Gonz\u00e1lez and Pag\u00e1n deny that Condado is the \"holder\" of the mortgage note, and (2) Banco Popular is an indispensable party pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19. (Docket No. 40 at pp. 3-10.) Neither reason is persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Condado is the Holder of the Mortgage Note\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As holder of the mortgage note, Condado may move for foreclosure. Puerto Rico law entitles the following individuals to enforce an instrument such as a mortgage note:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (1) The holder of the instrument, (2) a nonholder in possession of the instrument who has the rights of a holder, or (3) a person not in possession of the instrument who is entitled to enforce the instrument.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 19. \u00a7 601. According to Gonz\u00e1lez and Pag\u00e1n, Condado's \"problem is that the documentation submitted in support of its Motion for Summary Judgment does not support the fact that it is entitled to foreclose on the Mortgage Note.\" (Docket No. 40 at p. 3.) Condado's failure to demonstrate ownership of the mortgage note, Gonz\u00e1lez and Pag\u00e1n argue, precludes Condado from enforcing the mortgage note. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Condado presents two documents to establish ownership of the mortgage note: the mortgage note itself and Demnati's unsworn statement. (Docket No. 32, Ex. 2; Docket No. 44, Ex. 1.) Condado produced the original mortgage note between Westernbank and defendants. (Docket No. 44, Ex. 1 at p. 1) Attached to the original mortgage note is an assignment from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, acting as receiver for Westernbank, to Banco Popular.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 2. Furthermore, Condado presents an allonge to the mortgage note.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 3. This allonge indicates that on that June 30, 2016, Banco Popular assigned the mortgage note to Condado.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In addition to the allonge, Demnati attests under penalty of perjury that \"Condado 3 is the holder, by endorsement, of the Mortgage Note.\" (Docket No. 32, Ex. 2 at p. 3.) The Court finds that Condado has provided sufficient evidence\n   to demonstrate that it holds the mortgage note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In Gonz\u00e1lez and Pag\u00e1n's opposing statement of material facts, they deny that Condado owns the mortgage note. (Docket No. 40, Ex. 1 at pp. 4-6.) Gonz\u00e1lez and Pag\u00e1n premise their denial on Condado's failure to produce an allonge demonstrating that Banco Popular endorsed the mortgage note to Condado.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 5. According to Gonz\u00e1lez and Pag\u00e1n:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   For Condado 3 CFL to be considered the 'holder' of the Mortgage Note, and therefore, the person entitled to enforce it, not only should Condado 3 CFL have possession of the mortgage note, but it should have been indorsed to its order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Puerto Rico Negotiable Instruments Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=P.R.%20Laws%20Ann.%20tit.%2019%2C%20%C2%A7%20551\">\n    P.R.

Condado, however, subsequently submitted the original mortgage note with the allonge. (Docket No. 44, Ex. 1.) By Gonz\u00e1lez and Pag\u00e1n's own reasoning, Condado is the holder of the mortgage note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   A decision by this Court with analogous circumstances is illustrative.
