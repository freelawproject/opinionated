HUFF, District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 8 and February 27, 2018, Plaintiff Pulte Home Corporation (\"Pulte\") filed two motions for partial summary judgment. (Doc. Nos. 37, 38.) On March 5, 2018, Defendant TIG Insurance Company (\"TIG\"), the successor by merger to the American Safety Indemnity Company (\"ASIC\"), filed its own cross-motion for summary judgment. (Doc. No. 42.) The parties filed their respective opposition papers on April 2, 2018, (Doc. Nos. 48, 49, 50), and their reply briefs on April 9, 2018. (Doc. Nos. 52, 53, 54.) The Court held a hearing on the motions on April 16, 2018. Robert C. Carlson and Sharon Ann Huerta appeared for Pulte, while Robert Wayne Keaster appeared for TIG. For the reasons below, the Court denies Pulte's motions, and grants summary judgment to TIG.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This diversity action presents an insurance coverage dispute wherein Pulte asserts that it qualifies as an \"additional insured\" under several insurance policies issued by ASIC, and that TIG is now responsible for by merger. (Doc. No. 1, Compl. \u00b6 8.) In its third partial summary judgment motion, Pulte asks the Court to bar TIG from re-litigating certain issues decided by the California Court of Appeal under California law in a related state court lawsuit between the parties. (Doc. No. 37.)\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pulte Home Corp. v. Am. Safety Indem. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513826\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/223/47/\">\n    14 Cal.

In its fourth partial summary judgment motion, Pulte seeks a declaration that one of ASIC's insurance policies-issued to non-party Tunstill Plastering, Inc. (\"Tunstill\")-obligated ASIC to defend Pulte in\n   <em>\n    Morris, et al. v. Pulte Home Corporation, et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. RIC1211981 (\"\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   \"), a settled action formerly pending in the San Diego County Superior Court. (Doc. No. 38.) TIG, by contrast, argues that the relevant insurance policies affirmatively exclude coverage for Pulte's claims, and seeks summary judgment against each of Pulte's causes of action. (Doc. No. 42-27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Relevant Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Pulte is a residential real estate developer. (Doc. No. 1 at \u00b6 9.) Between 2003 and 2007, it served as the general contractor for two real estate development projects relevant to this lawsuit: (i) \"The Reserve at the Woods\" in Chula Vista, California, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ); and (ii) \"The Meadows\" in Temecula, California. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10). Pulte hired numerous subcontractors to work on these projects, including non-parties Concrete Concepts, Inc. (\"CCI\"), Foshay Electric Co., Inc. (\"Foshay\"), MJW &amp; Associates, Inc. (\"MJW\"), and Tunstill (collectively, \"Pulte's subcontractors\" or \"the subcontractors\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Pulte required its subcontractors to maintain general commercial liability (\"GCL\") insurance, and to obtain additional insured endorsements (\"AIEs\") listing Pulte as an added beneficiary under the subcontractors' GCL policies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18.) The GCL policies provided that ASIC had a duty to defend insured parties against any lawsuit seeking damages for property damage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc No. 20-26, CCI Policy, PageID 1892.) Each of the AIEs contained language extending coverage to Pulte, but \"only\" as to \"ongoing\" operations performed by the subcontractors for Pulte \"on or after the effective date of\" the AIEs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 42-2, CCI Policy Dated 10/20/2004, PageID 4400; Doc. No. 42-3, Foshay Policy Dated 7/3/2003, PageID 4471; Doc.

No. 42-8, Tunstill Policy Dated 3/25/2007, PageID 4800.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 2012 and 2013, several persons who purchased homes in \"The Reserve at the Woods\" and \"The Meadows\" contacted Pulte seeking damages for alleged construction defects. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 20-3, Pulte Statement of Facts, at \u00b6 3; Doc. No. 38-27, Pulte Statement of Facts, at \u00b6 2.) Homeowners at \"The Meadows\" filed the\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   lawsuit against Pulte on August 7, 2012, (Doc. No. 38-27 at \u00b6 2), and homeowners at \"The Reserve at the Woods\" filed a separate lawsuit,\n   <em>\n    Salazar, et al. v. Pulte Home Corp., et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 37-2013-00079447-CU-CD-CTL (\"\n   <em>\n    Salazar\n   </em>\n   \"), against Pulte in the San Diego County Superior Court on December 10, 2013. (Doc. No. 20-3 at \u00b6 4.) Pulte tendered both lawsuits to ASIC seeking a defense, but ASIC denied coverage in letters dated January 11, 2013 and January 9, 2014, respectively. (Doc. No. 20-3 at \u00b6\u00b6 12-13; Doc. No. 38-27 at \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.) Pulte subsequently settled both actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On October 14, 2016, Pulte filed the instant lawsuit, seeking: (i) declarations that ASIC had a duty to defend Pulte in the\n   <em>\n    Salazar\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   actions under the AIEs for ASIC's policies with CCI, Foshay, MJW, and Tunstill, (Doc. No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 25-44); (ii) breach of contract damages stemming from ASIC refusal to tender a defense in\n   <em>\n    Salazar\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Morris,\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 45-50); and (iii) damages for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51-60.) ASIC answered the suit on December 16, 2017, (Doc. No. 2, Answer), and the parties proceeded to discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On May 26, 2017, Pulte filed a partial summary judgment motion asking the Court to declare that the Georgia choice of law provisions in ASIC's insurance policies were invalid and unenforceable, and to apply California law to this dispute instead. (Doc. No. 11.) The Court denied this motion on June 28, 2017, and determined that Georgia law should govern the construction of ASIC's policies. (Doc. No. 19.)\n   <em>\n    Pulte Home Corp. v. Am.

Cal. 2017) (\n   <em>\n    Pulte II\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Pulte then filed a second partial summary judgment motion on August 8, 2017, seeking a declaration that ASIC owed Pulte a duty to defend the\n   <em>\n    Salazar\n   </em>\n   lawsuit pursuant to CCI's GCL policy. (Doc. No. 20.) The Court denied the motion on September 13, 2017, concluding that the j(5) and j(6) business risk exclusions in ASIC's policies with CCI unambiguously excluded coverage for the construction defects referenced in the\n   <em>\n    Salazar\n   </em>\n   complaint. (Doc. No. 25)\n   <em>\n    Pulte Home Corp. v. Am. Safety Indem.

Cal. 2017) (\n   <em>\n    Pulte III\n   </em>\n   ). The Court denied reconsideration on October 17, 2017. (Doc. No. 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   While this federal lawsuit was pending, the parties litigated substantially similar claims in the San Diego County Superior Court stemming from ASIC's refusal to tender a defense in two other lawsuits alleging construction defects at Pulte-built properties in Southern California. On August 30, 2017, the California Court of Appeal rejected ASIC's various coverage defenses under California law, and held that ASIC had a duty to defend Pulte under GCL policies and AIEs substantially similar to those at issue in this suit.\n   <em>\n    Pulte I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513826\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/223/47/\">\n    14 Cal.

(Doc. No. 37.) On February 27, 2018, Pulte filed a fourth partial summary judgment motion seeking a declaration that ASIC owed Pulte a duty to defend the\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   action under ASIC's policy with Tunstill. (Doc. No. 38.) On March 5, 2018, TIG filed a cross-motion for summary judgment as to each of Pulte's causes of action, arguing that coverage for the\n   <em>\n    Salazar\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   lawsuits was unambiguously excluded under various provisions in the GCL policies and AIEs.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The parties raise a number of issues in their respective summary judgment motions. TIG argues that: (i) Pulte's claims stem from the subcontractors' completed, rather than ongoing operations, and are thus precluded by limiting language in the policies' AIEs; (ii) the\n   <em>\n    Salazar\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   lawsuits did not allege that the subcontractors caused any damage to property unrelated to their construction work, and thus coverage was precluded under the policies' business risk exclusions; (iii) the\n   <em>\n    Salazar\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   lawsuits were not \"occurrences\" as the policies define that term, and thus did not trigger ASIC's duty to defend; (iv) the liability asserted in the\n   <em>\n    Salazar\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   lawsuits did not arise out of any subcontractor's sole negligence, as required by the policies; (v) ASIC's coverage position was objectively reasonable, and therefore there could not have been any violation of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (vi) Foshay's policy did not require Pulte to be added as an additional insured, and thus Pulte cannot prevail on its second cause of action; and (vii) Pulte failed to properly elect coverage with respect to the\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   lawsuit by failing to forward ASIC a copy of the\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   complaint. (Doc. Nos. 42-27, 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   By contrast, Pulte argues that each of the coverage defenses offered by TIG were either: (i) already adjudicated by the California Court of Appeal, and thus TIG is collaterally estopped from re-litigating them here; (ii) not relied upon by ASIC in issuing its coverage denial, and thus forfeited; or else (iii) wrong on the merits. (Doc. Nos. 37, 38, 50.) The crux of Pulte's argument is that the duty to defend is exceedingly broad, the\n   <em>\n    Salazar\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   actions alleged liability that at least arguably fell within the scope of Pulte's coverage, and the policy exclusions TIG relies upon are too ambiguous to support TIG's coverage position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As explained below, the Court agrees with TIG that: (i) its coverage defenses stemming from Georgia law are not barred by the California Court of Appeal's rejection of those defenses under California law; (ii) the policies' AIEs expressly restrict Pulte's coverage to claims stemming from the subcontractors' ongoing operations; and (iii) the claims alleged in the\n   <em>\n    Salazar\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   suits did not arise from the subcontractors' ongoing operations. As the Court's resolution of these issues is dispositive as to each of Pulte's causes of action, the Court declines to address the parties' remaining issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

(Doc. No. 37.) Pulte thus argues that TIG should be collaterally estopped from arguing that: (i) the policies limit coverage to claims stemming from the subcontractors' ongoing operations; (ii) the policies' business risk exclusions and \"sole negligence\" limitation bar coverage for the type of claims asserted in the\n   <em>\n    Salazar\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   actions; and (iii) ASIC's coverage denial was undertaken in bad faith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pulte I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513826\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/223/47/\">\n    14 Cal.

Rather, the purpose of a CGL policy is to protect businesses from liability to third parties for bodily injury or property damage resulting from accidents.\" (citation omitted) ). The Court finds all three of these rationales persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Pulte advances two arguments in opposition to the Court's construction. Neither are convincing. First, Pulte argues that the policies explicitly promised coverage for liabilities stemming from completed construction operations when they granted\n   coverage for \"liability arising out of 'your work,' \" and defined \"your work\" as \"work or operations performed\" by Pulte's subcontractors. Pulte argues that the past tense of the word \"performed\" references to \"work that was complete; i.e., completed operations.\" (Doc. No. 50 at 16-17.) Pulte asserts that, read against this context, the AIEs' limitation restricting coverage to work which was \"ongoing ... on or after the effective date of this Endorsement\" operates \"to exclude work completed prior to the policy inception, not as a completed operations exclusion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.) However, Pulte's interpretation of the AIEs' restricting language renders the term \"ongoing\" essentially superfluous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Noble\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6926525\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/145/714/#p720\">\n    145 So.3d at 719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[F]or 'ongoing operations' to have any meaning, it cannot encompass liability arising after the subcontractor's work was completed.\"). The AIEs already provide that coverage is restricted to liabilities arising \"on or after the effective date of this Endorsement,\" and it is thus implausible to read the reference to \"ongoing operations\" as merely restricting coverage to work completed prior to the policies' inception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Second, Pulte argues that because ASIC drafted the AIEs, and the AIEs do not define \"ongoing operations,\" the AIEs should be construed strictly against TIG. (Doc. No. 50 at 17.) Relatedly, Pulte argues that the AIEs are at least ambiguous as to whether they provide completed operations coverage, and therefore ASIC had a duty to defend Pulte in the\n   <em>\n    Salazar\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   lawsuits, while reserving the right to litigate its coverage defenses later. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.)\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hoover\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3647942\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/291/402/\">\n    730 S.E.2d at 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But as the Court has already explained, the \"ongoing operations\" language is unambiguous when those words are given their usual and common meaning as Georgia law requires. The fact that ASIC could have drafted its ongoing operations exclusions more clearly does not automatically mean that the language it did choose is unclear. And because the \"ongoing operations\" language is unambiguous, ASIC was permitted to rely upon it as a coverage defense without first incurring the costs of representing Pulte in the\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Salazar\n   </em>\n   actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Moreover, the Court is not persuaded by Pulte's broader insistence that it was unfairly surprised by ASIC's refusal to provide completed operations coverage. As a large corporation, Pulte is a sophisticated, high-volume consumer of commercial insurance products. (Doc. No. 49-15, Pulte Form 10-K, PageID 5626, 5655.) Pulte's Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(6) deponent, Jean Marusak, testified that she \"understood that [subcontractors in] California had a hard time getting full, completed operations coverage, [and] so [Pulte was] asking for ongoing [operations coverage], as a minimum,\" during the policy periods relevant to this lawsuit. (Doc. No. 42-23, Marusak Dep'n, PageID 5287-88.) This testimony is binding on Pulte,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Kelly Servs., Inc. v. Creative Harbor, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12134657\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/857/#p867\">\n    846 F.3d 857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 867 (6th Cir. 2017), and strongly suggests that Pulte not only knew the difference between ongoing and completed operations coverage, but understood that its subcontractors would likely only be able to obtain ongoing operations coverage. It would be illogical for the Court to contort the language of the policies Pulte's subcontractors did buy to provide coverage that they did not pay for and could not acquire in the marketplace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Finally, the Court notes that the California Court of Appeal's contrary conclusion in Pulte I that the \"ongoing operations\" language in similar policies did not clearly exclude coverage for completed operations is distinguishable. Pulte I relied on California precedent that essentially imposed a clear statement rule on insurers drafting ongoing operations limitations, and found that the language at issue was\n   not clear enough to satisfy California law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513826\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/223/47/\">\n    14 Cal.

Similarly, the\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   action alleged that Pulte and its subcontractors \"breached ... contracts\" with residential real estate purchasers \"by delivering to Plaintiffs ... homes and residential lots ... which were not built in a reasonably workmanlike manner, were not of merchantable quality and were not built in conformance with building codes, local ordinances, and/or plans and specifications.\" (Doc.
