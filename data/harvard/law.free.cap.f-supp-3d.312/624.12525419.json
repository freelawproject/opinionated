The 51st Judicial District and the 52nd Judicial District are both within Oakland County, Michigan, and relatively close to one another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Both parties have moved for summary judgment.

(Def.'s Resp. Ex. A, Master Deed.) The Master Deed provides, relevantly, on its first page that Fountain Park South is subject to\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   the covenants, conditions, restrictions, uses, limitations, and affirmative obligations set forth in this Master Deed and the Exhibits hereto, all of which shall be deemed to run with the land and shall be a burden and a benefit to the Developer, its successors and assigns, and any persons acquiring or owning an interest in the said real property, their grantees, successors, heirs, executors, administrators and assigns.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (Master Deed at 2, Pg ID 181.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Master Deed has two Exhibits: the by-laws of the Fountain Park South Condominium Association (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Association\n   </strong>\n   \") (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Master Deed at 19-59, Pg ID 198-238); and a series of surveys and maps that together constitute the Condominium Subdivision Plan (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Master Deed at 60-67, Pg ID 239-246). Article II of the by-laws governs monetary assessments by the Association against unit owners. Specifically, Article II empowers the Association to levy (and requires unit owners to pay) annual assessments, and provides for the levying of both discretionary and unit-owner-approved assessments by the Association. Article II of the by-laws also provides that unpaid assessments shall constitute liens upon the units of delinquent unit owners, and authorizes various enforcement mechanisms including collection and lien foreclosure lawsuits. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20559.101\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20559.101\">\n    at 19-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Pg ID 198-202.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In February 2007, Plaintiff purchased the subject property by warranty deed. (ECF No. 15, Pl.'s Mot. Ex. 1, Warranty Deed.) The final clause of the warranty deed provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Subject to easements, reservations and restrictions of record, and further subject to, [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] this deed is given in fulfillment of a certain Land Contract dated 8/22/2006 between the parties hereto and is further subject to such encumbrances which may have attached or accrued since the date of said contract through the acts or ommissions [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] of persons other than the grantors herein.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, Pg ID 144.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff financed the purchase with a $172,475.00 loan from non-party Quicken Loans, Inc., which was secured by a mortgage\n   on the condominium. The mortgage was recorded in Oakland County, Michigan on February 13, 2007. (ECF No. 21, Def.'s Resp. Ex. B, Mortgage.) The mortgage had several attachments, including a Condominium Rider which Plaintiff signed separately, and which provides that Plaintiff (identified in the Condominium Rider as \"Borrower\")\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   shall perform all of Borrower's obligations under the Condominium Project's Constituent Documents. The \"Constituent Documents\" are the: (i) Declaration or any other document which creates the Condominium Project; (ii) by-laws; (iii) code of regulations; and (iv) other equivalent documents. Borrower shall promptly pay, when due, all dues and assessments imposed pursuant to the Constituent Documents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23, Pg ID 269.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff represents that in October 2009, he \"left the State of Michigan and his Condominium [and] subsequently moved to Maryland where he maintains employment and residency.\" (Pl.'s Mot. at 2, Pg ID 123.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On November 19, 2010, a lien was recorded against the subject property for nonpayment of assessments. The lien specified that the amount due to the Association was $770, \"exclusive of interest, costs, attorney fees, and future assessments, which are also secured by this lien and must be paid in full to discharge the obligation.\" (Def.'s Resp. Ex. C, Lien.) Plaintiff defaulted on his mortgage shortly thereafter, and after foreclosure proceedings, he relinquished the condominium pursuant to a sheriff's sale in December 2010. Approximately four years later, on December 11, 2015, the Association assigned to Defendant Equity Experts, LLC \"all of [the] Association's right, title, interest, powers and options\" in any unpaid sums owed by Plaintiff along with other unit owners, as well as any interest, collection and late charges, attorney fees, fines, and liens associated with the unpaid assessment. (Def.'s Resp. Ex. D, Assignment.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On March 4, 2016, Defendant initiated a collection action against Plaintiff in the 51st Judicial District Court in Waterford, Michigan, where the property was located. In connection with that action, Defendant sent a summons and complaint by certified mail to Plaintiff at his Maryland address. (Pl.'s Mot. Ex. 2, Summons and Complaint.) The complaint alleged that Plaintiff (named as the defendant in that action) failed to pay his \"share of assessments, special assessments, fines, and late fees,\" and that the sum of his deficiency plus accrued interest was $1204.47. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5, Pg ID 148-49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On May 11, 2016, Defendant moved in the 51st Judicial District Court for a determination that Plaintiff had been served, representing in its motion that Plaintiff had informed Defendant's counsel of his receipt of the summons and complaint, and that Plaintiff rejected an initial settlement offer. (Pl.'s Mot. Ex. 3, Request for Special Consideration and Order Determining Proof of Service.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The foregoing is all that the record contains regarding the collection action, and there is no indication of how, when, or even whether the action was terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

(ECF No. 8, Answer.) Defendant denies that Plaintiff had paid the assessments. (Answer \u00b6 11; ECF No. 21, Def.'s Resp. at Pg ID 169-70.) Plaintiff has provided no evidence that he paid the assessments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   After the close of discovery, Plaintiff moved for summary judgment on May 1, 2017. (ECF No. 15, Pl.'s Mot.) Defendant filed a response brief on June 1, 2017 (ECF No. 21, Def.'s Resp.). Plaintiff did not file a reply brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This Court held a hearing on Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment on June 27, 2017. At that hearing, Defendant's counsel orally moved for summary judgment, and the Court permitted Plaintiff to file a brief in response to Defendant's oral motion. Plaintiff did so on July 13, 2017.

Second, the record establishes that Defendant's choice of forum for the collection action was permissible under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692i, which, depending on the nature of the debt sued upon, requires a debt collector to bring a collection action against a consumer only in the \"judicial district or similar legal entity\" where the real property at issue is located, where the contract sued upon was signed, or where the consumer resides at the commencement of the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As to the MRCPA claim asserted in Count II of the Complaint, Plaintiff's failure to prove-or even allege-conduct by Defendant that violates any provision of the MRCPA both precludes summary\n   judgment for Plaintiff and warrants summary judgment for Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Consequently, the Court will deny Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, and grant Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

It is undisputed that Defendant purchased the debt at issue in this case, and then brought the action in the 51st Judicial District Court to collect on the debt for its own account. Moreover, Plaintiff alleged in the Complaint that Defendant \"is in the business of purchasing defaulted homeowners association fees from local associations at a discount, and them [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] initiates collection actions in state court as an effort to collect said accounts.\" (Compl. \u00b6 8.) Defendant admitted that \"it purchases defaulted homeowners' association debts and pursues recovery of those outstanding debts\" but denied the remainder of the allegation. (Answer \u00b6 8.) Defendant also admitted that it \"regularly attempts to collect defaulted debts in the form of defaulted homeowner association fees in the ordinary course of its business,\" and that it \"regularly uses the state courts of Michigan to sue consumers and obtain judgements\n   [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] in the ordinary course of its business of collecting debts.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7; Answer \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.) There is no real dispute that Defendant regularly purchases defaulted debts and collects them for its own account, and is therefore an entity which, under\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   , does not meet the \"regularly collects...debts...owed or due another\" prong of the FDCPA's definition of \"debt collector.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Plaintiff must therefore show that Defendant meets the other prong of the definition of \"debt collector\": \"any person who uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails in any business the\n   <em>\n    principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts\n   </em>\n   .\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6) (emphasis added).

Plaintiff cannot obtain summary judgment for that reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   For a separate reason, as set forth below, even if Defendant is in fact a debt collector under the FDCPA, its decision to prosecute a collection action in the Michigan 51st District Court, while it may not have been permissible under the \"real property\" subprovision of 15 U.S.C. 1692i(a)(1), was permissible under the \"contract\" subprovision of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692i(a)(2)(A), as discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.

The 51st Judicial District Court was a proper venue under the \"contract\" subprovision of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692i(a)(2)(A).\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   While Defendant's choice of Michigan's 51st Judicial District Court as a forum for its 2016 collection action may not have been justifiable under \u00a7 1692i(a)(1), and it is undisputed that Plaintiff no longer resided in the 51st Judicial District at the time the collection action was commenced, more analysis is required with regard to the \"contract\" subprovision of \u00a7 1692i(a)(2)(B). If Defendant was in fact a \"debt collector\" under the FDCPA and\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff would be entitled to summary judgment only if no reasonable jury could find that Defendant's filing the collection action in the 51st Judicial District Court was permissible under that subprovision. Plaintiff cannot make this showing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Actions by debt collectors that do not fall within \u00a7 1692i(a)(1)'s real property subprovision,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   that are not initiated in the consumer's home forum under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692i(a)(2)(B), must be brought \"in the judicial district or similar legal entity...in which [the] consumer signed the contract sued upon.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692i(a)(2)(A). Plaintiff argues that the 51st Judicial District Court was not a proper venue for Defendant's collection action under this subprovision because Plaintiff \"has never signed a contract obligating him to pay condominium association dues.\" (Pl.'s Mot. at 5, Pg ID 126.) Instead, Plaintiff argues, Defendant merely \"relies upon a deed, unsigned by the Plaintiff\" in attempting to justify filing the action in the 51st Judicial District Court under the contract subprovision. (Pl.'s Mot. at 6, Pg ID 127.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Plaintiff's assertion that he never signed a contract obligating him to pay assessments is frivolous and belied by the record. Plaintiff appears to refer to the Warranty Deed by which he was granted the subject property in 2007, and it is true that that document does not bear his signature. But Plaintiff did sign the mortgage contract (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. Ex. B, Mortgage at Pg ID 261), which incorporates the Condominium Rider, and he separately signed the Condominium Rider itself (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20600.3236\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Pg ID 269-71). The Condominium Rider\n   contains a covenant in which Plaintiff agreed to \"perform all of [his] obligations under the Condominium Project's Constituent Documents.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Pg ID 269.) The Constituent Documents, in turn, include both the Association's by-laws (which obligated Plaintiff to pay assessments) and the Master Deed (which incorporates the by-laws). (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20600.3236\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Apart from this, Plaintiff specifically covenanted in the Condominium Rider that he would \"promptly pay, when due, all dues and assessments imposed pursuant to the Constituent Documents.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff's contention that no signed document obligated him to pay assessments is incorrect on its face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The relevant question then becomes in what \"judicial district or similar legal entity\" the contracts mentioned above were signed. The record is clear that the mortgage was both notarized and recorded in Oakland County, Michigan (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. Ex. B, Mortgage at Pg ID 248, 262), and the parties do not appear to dispute this fact. Instead, Plaintiff maintains that Defendant sued him in the wrong venue\n   <em>\n    within\n   </em>\n   Oakland County, which contains nine judicial districts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20600.8123\">\n    Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 600.8123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . One of these is the 51st Judicial District, which consists of the township of Waterford, Michigan, the location of the condominium unit, and which is the forum in which Defendant brought its collection action in 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20600.8123\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 600.8123(8). Another district is the 52nd Judicial District, which contains (among other municipalities) the city of Troy, Michigan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20600.8123\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 600.8123(9)(d). Plaintiff's position appears to be that only the 52nd Judicial District Court would have been a proper venue under the contract subprovision: his counsel represented at the June 27, 2017 hearing that the relevant contracts were signed in Troy, and he argued in the Response to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment that \"[t]he only District that was proper for Defendant to sue Plaintiff in for the unsecured defaulted association fees that it attempted to collect was: a) in the 52nd District Court of Troy, or b) in the Rockwood District Court in the State of Maryland where [Plaintiff] resides.\" (Pl.'s Resp. at 3, Pg ID 284.) However, these on-the-fly oral representations by Plaintiff's attorney are not competent evidence as to where the contract was signed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In addition, for a separate reason, this Court is not persuaded that Defendant was required to file suit in the 52nd Judicial District in order to comply with the contract subprovision of the FDCPA's fair-venue provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The FDCPA does not define \"judicial district or similar legal entity,\" and federal courts have not settled on a definition of the term. Indeed, only three of the federal circuits appear to have weighed in on the question at all. The Ninth Circuit held in 1994 that two Arizona counties were different \"judicial districts\" under the FDCPA because the state had \"provided a formal transfer mechanism...between courts in the two counties,\" notwithstanding that Arizona \"constitutes a single federal judicial district and has a unitary state superior court.\"\n   <em>\n    Fox v.

More recently, the Second Circuit held that a debt collector violates the FDCPA's fair-venue provision \"by suing a consumer in a city court...when that court lacks power to hear the action because the consumer does not reside in that city or a town contiguous thereto.\"\n   <em>\n    Hess v.

More specifically, the court in\n   <em>\n    Hess\n   </em>\n   determined that \"[b]ecause the court system of which [the defendant debt collector] availed itself is governed by laws that limit the territorial extent of those courts based on,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , a defendant's contacts with the forum,...those laws delimit the 'judicial district' by which compliance with the\n   FDCPA's venue provisions must be measured.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4197928\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/637/117/#p119\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4197928\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/637/117/#p119\">\n    at 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As the court has explained,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   [t]he basic purpose of the least-sophisticated-consumer standard is to ensure that the FDCPA protects all consumers, the gullible as well as the shrewd. This effort is grounded, quite sensibly, in the assumption that consumers of below-average sophistication or intelligence are especially vulnerable to fraudulent schemes. The standard thus serves a dual purpose: it (1) ensures the protection of all consumers, even the naive and the trusting, against deceptive debt collection practices, and (2) protects debt collectors against liability for bizarre or idiosyncratic interpretations of collection notices.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=238%20Fed.%20Appx.%2024\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Gionis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=238%20Fed.%20Appx.%2024\">\n    238 Fed.Appx. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   28 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In light of these principles, this Court is not persuaded that Defendant's filing the collection action in the 51st Judicial District, the location of the subject condo unit, rather than the 52nd District amounted to a violation of the FDCPA's fair-venue provision, given the factual location realities in the instant case, which are far different from the facts in the Second and Seventh Circuit decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Defendant filed suit to collect Plaintiff's allegedly unpaid condominium association fees in a forum that was the forum in which the subject condominium was situated, near the district in which Plaintiff alleges, without evidence, that the governing contracts were signed. The contract subprovision of \u00a7 1692i(a)(2)(A) is still in play, and whatever the proper test for \"judicial district or similar legal entity\" under the\n   FDCPA, it is clear that the circumstances in this case do not involve the animating purposes behind the statute that the Sixth Circuit recognized in\n   <em>\n    Stratton\n   </em>\n   . Even viewed through the lens of the least sophisticated consumer, the forum in which Defendant filed the collection action cannot be fairly characterized as \"so distant or inconvenient that [Plaintiff was] unable to appear,\"\n   <em>\n    Stratton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265982\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/770/443/#p448\">\n    770 F.3d at 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as would make clear that Defendant was attempting to obtain a default judgment, or otherwise engaging in deceptive collection practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Moreover, the decisions discussed above that would suggest that Michigan's district courts are the relevant \"judicial districts\" for FDCPA purposes are both nonprecedential in this Circuit and distinguishable from the instant fact situation. In\n   <em>\n    Hess\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit found it relevant that the forum chosen by the debt collector did not actually have jurisdiction over the collection action because of the consumer's lack of connections to the forum, and noted that the city court had dismissed the action for that reason.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hess\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4197928\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/637/117/#p119\">\n    637 F.3d at 122-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And in\n   <em>\n    Suesz\n   </em>\n   , the Seventh Circuit prefaced its analysis as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   As this case illustrates, one common tactic for debt collectors is to sue in a court that is not convenient to the debtor, as this makes default more likely; or in a court perceived to be friendly to such claims; or, ideally, in a court having both of these characteristics. In short, debt collectors shop for the most advantageous forum. By imposing an inconvenient forum on a debtor who may be impecunious, unfamiliar with law and legal processes, and in no position to retain a lawyer (and even if he can afford one, the lawyer's fee is bound to exceed the debt itself), the debt collector may be able to obtain through default a remedy for a debt that the defendant doesn't actually owe.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <em>\n    Suesz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4124680\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/636/#p639\">\n    757 F.3d at 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The concerns that were identified in the\n   <em>\n    Hess\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Suesz\n   </em>\n   decisions do not appear to be present here. Indeed, one critical distinction between those two cases and the instant case is the nature of the debt sued upon.\n   <em>\n    Hess\n   </em>\n   concerned credit-card debt, and\n   <em>\n    Suesz\n   </em>\n   involved medical bills.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hess\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4197928\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/637/117/#p119\">\n    637 F.3d at 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , with\n   <em>\n    Suesz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4124680\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/636/#p639\">\n    757 F.3d at 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Neither of them addressed a debt like that at issue here: that is, a debt arising from a contract signed by the debtor, but also one which (unlike the debts in\n   <em>\n    Hess\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Suesz\n   </em>\n   ) is inherently connected to a specific piece of real property. Therefore, even though the FDCPA's real property subdivision does not literally apply to this case, the debt that was the subject of Defendant's collection action was more akin to a debt relating to real estate than it was to the strictly consumer debts in\n   <em>\n    Hess\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Suesz\n   </em>\n   . The risk of prejudice to the debtor is measurably less in a situation like this: even the least sophisticated consumer could more reasonably anticipate being sued for condominium fees in the district where the condominium sits (and which is proximate to the place of contracting), than he or she could expect to be sued in a district with no more connection to his or her debt than the fact that it is located in the same county as the building where the contract may have been signed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The unique facts of this specific case support the Court's conclusion that Defendant's prosecution of the collection action in the 51st Judicial District Court did not run afoul of the contract subprovision of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692i(a)(2)(A).

This is not a case where the debt collector is using litigation as a vehicle for \"abusive and unfair practices.\"\n   <em>\n    Stratton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265982\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/770/443/#p448\">\n    770 F.3d at 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(Compl. \u00b6 27-28.) Plaintiff does not make any specific argument regarding these allegations in his Motion for Summary Judgment, however, and so the Court treats the Motion as seeking summary judgment on Plaintiff's FDCPA claim only on an improper-venue theory.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    Under that statute, a purchaser's deed for a foreclosed property is void if the mortgagor or certain other parties in interest \"redeem[ ] the entire premises sold by paying\" the purchaser \"the amount that was bid for the entire premises sold\" plus interest and fees within a specified time.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20600.3240\">\n     Mich.
