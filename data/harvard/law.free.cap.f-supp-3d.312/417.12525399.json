At the first step, USCIS assesses the applicant's eligibility for a waiver. To establish eligibility, USCIS must conclude that the conduct that would otherwise bar an applicant from obtaining an adjustment of status \"relates to a single offense of simple possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h). Once an applicant establishes eligibility, the analysis proceeds to the second step, where USCIS decides whether to exercise its discretion to grant the waiver.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Singh v.

This means the Court can review \"nondiscretionary decisions regarding an alien's\n   <em>\n    eligibility\n   </em>\n   ,\" but cannot review the \"decision to grant or deny relief, made entirely in [USCIS's\n   ] discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Mendez v.

In making its determination, USCIS relied on the fact that \u00a7 221.05 criminalizes marijuana possession but does not specify a quantity. It concluded that Plaintiff had not, therefore, established that his conviction involved fewer than 30 grams of marijuana. Fourth Waiver Denial at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   However, a conviction for a violation under \u00a7 221.05, as opposed to a misdemeanor, necessarily involves no more than 25 grams of marijuana.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.

Plaintiff's guilty plea to a violation under \u00a7 221.05, therefore, \"relates to a single offense of simple possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h). Accordingly, USCIS's conclusion that Plaintiff is not eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under \u00a7 212(h) is reversible legal error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   That, however, does not end the inquiry. USCIS concluded that even if Plaintiff were eligible for a waiver based on his conviction under \u00a7 221.05, it would separately deny Plaintiff's waiver of inadmissibility in the exercise of its discretion. In making this determination, USCIS weighed \"adverse factors,\" including Plaintiff's entering the country with a fake passport and criminal history, against \"favorable factors,\" including Plaintiff's U.S. citizen wife and children, steady employment, and family members' medical issues. Fourth Waiver Denial at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court would have reached a different conclusion in balancing these factors. Plaintiff has lived in the United States for over 25 years, has no serious criminal record, and has built a family of U.S. citizens, including two children born in the United States. He also owns two restaurants and a small construction company. Am. Compl. \u00b6 49. He has, in every sense, become a part of the American fabric. Denying him the legal status to continue his participation in our community would belie the connections and contributions he has made here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The statutory scheme governing this case, however, does not permit the Court to overrule USCIS's exercise of discretion in the absence of legal error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(B), (D). Although Plaintiff fashions his objections to USICS's exercise of discretion as legal in nature, his quarrels are purely with USCIS's application of the facts. Because the Court is without authority to review USCIS's discretionary denial of Plaintiff's application for a waiver of inadmissibility, Plaintiff has failed to meet his burden of showing a likelihood of success on the merits or serious issues going to the merits on his claim challenging the denial of the waiver. Accordingly, Plaintiff's request for a stay his removal pending resolution of that claim is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   B. Release from Custody\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As of April 11, 2018, the date of the show cause hearing, Plaintiff had been detained for 232 days. He argues that his continued detention violates his constitutional rights because his removal is not reasonably foreseeable under\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   . On this claim, Plaintiff has met his burden to show both a likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court begins with the likelihood of success on the merits. Defendants' principal challenge to Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   claim is that the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the claim because venue is only proper in the District of New Jersey, where Plaintiff is detained. Defendants rely on the Supreme Court's decision\n   <em>\n    Rumsfeld v.

All Defendants in this case are officers of the U.S. Government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201391\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e), venue for actions against U.S. Government officers is appropriate in any district where \"a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred.\" All four of Plaintiff's applications for a waiver of inadmissibility were processed and decided by USCIS in Manhattan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 25-3, 25-6, 25-8, &amp; 30, Ex. B. Accordingly, venue for Plaintiff's INA claim is appropriate in this District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Because Plaintiff's INA claim is properly venued in this District, the Court next considers whether to exercise pendent venue over his habeas claim. First, the INA claim and habeas claim are closely related. The denials of Plaintiff's waiver of inadmissibility have prevented him from obtaining an adjustment of status, and his lack of legal status provides the authority for the detention he challenges on his habeas claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In addition, all of the discretionary factors weigh in favor of exercising venue over the habeas claim. The Court has already held a Rule 26(f) conference in this case and received full briefing on the motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. Judicial economy, therefore, supports the exercise of pendent venue. Keeping the habeas claim in this District will also avoid piecemeal litigation of Plaintiff's habeas claim in New Jersey while litigation of his INA claim continues here. And Defendants present no evidence that litigating the habeas claim here is inconvenient or unfair to them. Indeed, the Hudson County Correctional Facility is run by ICE's New York City Field Office, and it is not uncommon for courts in this District to hear habeas claims brought by petitioners detained at the Hudson County Correctional Facility.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Birch v.

He does not have a Pakistani travel document to enable him to gain admission to Pakistan. Defendants first requested a travel document from the Pakistani Consulate on September 12, 2017. DeLeon Decl. \u00b6 31, ECF No. 32. They followed up with the Consulate about the status of the request four times in October and November of 2017. Each time, they were told that the request was pending.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-33. They followed up again in January and March 2018, but received no response both times.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34, 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In their opposition papers, Defendants argue that Plaintiff's removal is reasonably foreseeable because he is on the manifest of a flight going to Pakistan at the end of April and because \"Pakistani officials are reviewing the manifest and have not affirmatively\n   dismissed him from the manifest or refused ICE's request for a travel document.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. At the hearing, Defendants notified the Court for the first time that Plaintiff traveled to the Pakistani Consulate on April 9, 2018 for an interview concerning travel documents. Tr. at 5. However, Defendants fail to point to any evidence from Pakistani officials indicating that a travel document is imminent or forthcoming.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Meanwhile, Plaintiff points out that Pakistan is one of a number of countries that the U.S. Government has accused of failing to issue travel documents for detainees in a timely and consistent manner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Carol Morello,\n   <em>\n    Deporting Convicted Criminals from the U.S. Is Not as Easy as It Sounds\n   </em>\n   , Washington Post (Nov. 28, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In short, Defendants have not obtained a travel document for Plaintiff through 232 days of detention; Pakistan is included on a list of countries that fails to process travel documents in a timely or consistent manner; and the Pakistani Consulate has not indicated that it will provide a travel document despite Defendants making six separate requests for such information over the last six months. Together, these facts establish a significant likelihood that Plaintiff will not be removed from the United States in the reasonably foreseeable future. Because he has now been detained for over 180 days, he has established a significant likelihood of success on his\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Having established likelihood of success on the merits, the Court will next consider irreparable harm. To establish irreparable harm, Plaintiff must \"demonstrate that absent a preliminary injunction [he] will suffer an injury that is neither remote nor speculative, but actual and imminent, and one that cannot be remedied if a court waits until the end of trial to resolve the harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Faiveley Transport Malmo AB v.

A number of courts have held that detention in violation of constitutional rights establishes irreparable harm.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abdi v.

Moreover, the consequences of Plaintiff's detention bolster his claim of irreparable harm. Plaintiff has been hospitalized multiple times in the last month for stress-related heart issues. He has been separated from his family throughout his detention, and has been unable to maintain his businesses to support them. Such harms are almost certain to continue if he is not released from custody immediately. Accordingly, Plaintiff has met his burden to establish irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Having established irreparable harm and a likelihood of success on the merits, Plaintiff's motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction immediately releasing him from detention at the Hudson County Correctional Facility is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   For the reasons stated above, Plaintiff's motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction staying his removal pending the resolution of INA claim is DENIED, and his motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction immediately releasing him from custody is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Accordingly, the Hudson County Correctional Facility is ORDERED to immediately release Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Plaintiff was ordered released from custody immediately at the show cause hearing on April 11, 2018.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 40.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    At the hearing, Defendants requested that if the Court found venue to be proper in the Southern District of New York, they be afforded additional time to address the merits of the habeas claim because they did not address it in their moving papers.
