Simply because the inventor of the '392 Patent included reference to the '860 Patent in the '392 Patent does not mean that Defendant, which had no role in inventing the '392 Patent or developing the Cyclean system, knew of the '860 Patent. Further, while Defendant admits to meeting with one of Plaintiff's parent companies regarding the purchase of EcoPower equipment, such a meeting does not suggest knowledge of the '860 Patent on which the EcoPower equipment is based. Plaintiff has provided no evidence that Defendant discussed the patents related to the EcoPower system when it expressed interest in purchasing EcoPower equipment.

Defendant's counsel then asked: \"So the phrase 'small quantities of finely divided liquid'\n    <em>\n     is not referring\n    </em>\n    to the claimed total volumetric flow of .5 to 60 liters per minute.
