(\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6 30.) In 2009, Defendants ignored requests from the public defender for funding to cover those services.

At an April 25, 2017 Beaufort City Council meeting, city operations manager Linda Roper discussed with the city council a request for $10,000 in fiscal year 2018 to contract with a private attorney to provide municipal court indigent defense, which she described as \"a mandate from the state.\" Beaufort City Council, Minutes, April 25, 2017, at 2.

Ms. Roper recommended contracting with a private attorney rather than the public defender because the public defender has a case backlog and because Beaufort would get more \"bang for the buck\" from a local attorney retained by the council than from the public defender for the Fourteenth Judicial Circuit, who operates beyond the control of the City of Beaufort.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 2.

(\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       \u00b6 100.) The charges arose from a fight between students at a high school that occurred when Mr. Nelson was a 17-year-old student. (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       \u00b6 76.) He was not represented by an attorney and he was not advised of his right to counsel.

(\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       \u00b6 108.) Judge Ned Tupper set a cash bond of $2,926.25, an amount apparently calculated to equal the expected fine and court costs of the charges. (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       \u00b6 110.) Mr. Fox's income is below the federal poverty guidelines. (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       \u00b6 107.)

He appeared before Beaufort Municipal Judge Mary Sharp on February 20, 2017. He was not represented by an attorney and he was not advised of his right to counsel.

(\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       \u00b6 115.) Judge Sharp did not hold a plea colloquy with Mr. Fox. (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       ) She sentenced him to a fine and court costs of $2,879.38 and five consecutive 10-day jail sentences for the five charges, even though South Carolina law does not authorize imprisonment for one of those charges (speeding less than 10 mph).\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       S.C. Code \u00a7 56-5-1520(G) ; Beaufort County Judicial Records; (Dkt. No. 1 \u00b6 115). After sentencing, he returned to the Beaufort County Detention Center under two bench warrants from magistrate court. (Dkt. No. 1 \u00b6 117.) Ultimately, Mr. Fox spent 38 days in jail on the five municipal charges. Beaufort County records indicate that may have been sentenced to jail on the traffic charges for inability to pay the $2,879.38 fine, see Beaufort County Judicial Records, but that is unclear because of the warrants for Mr. Fox's arrest on other charges.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-16\">\n       In South Carolina, municipal courts are optionally created by municipalities to hear petty criminal cases.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       S.C.
