He locked himself into legal trouble when he committed a series of crimes that led to both state and federal convictions. He locked himself into a twelve-year prison sentence by agreeing to it in a plea deal. And he locked himself into a sentencing date that happened to occur a month before a landmark bill reducing mandatory minimum sentences was passed into law. Now, Ayers has collaterally attacked his sentence, claiming that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance because she did not seek to continue his\n   sentencing until after passage of the Fair Sentencing Act (FSA). His argument is not without appeal. However, for the reasons explained below, the Court will deny his claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

To begin with, Ayers was sentenced pursuant to an agreement under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C). As will be discussed further below, this meant that, once the Court accepted his plea, it was bound to accept the 144-month sentence outlined in the agreement. Thus, while Abney's sentence would have changed after passage of the FSA, Ayers's sentence could not. The only debate at sentencing was over whether that sentence would run consecutively or concurrently with Ayers's existing Superior Court sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In part because of the 11(c)(1)(C) plea, this case also differs from\n   <em>\n    Abney\n   </em>\n   because there are plausible tactical reasons not to have sought a continuance. \"[A]bsent a\n   strategic decision by counsel, the ineffectiveness prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   turns on whether an objectively reasonable attorney would have [sought a continuance] because the issue had a reasonable likelihood of success.\"\n   <em>\n    Abney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085779,12310061\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/1079/\">\n    812 F.3d at 1088\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alterations in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Payne v.

Cir. 2014) ). Because the\n   <em>\n    Abney\n   </em>\n   court found that the government's proffered strategic considerations were implausible, that court's deficiency analysis focused on the likelihood that a continuance would result in a sentence reduction. In this case, however, we need not get that far, because Ayers likely cannot \"overcome the [strong] presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1087 (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   There is evidence for two alternative courses of events in the record, either of which could have been the result of acceptable trial strategy. According to Ayers's \u00a7 2255 motion and his testimony at the evidentiary hearing, Ayers had asked Peterson to file a motion to continue the July 9 sentencing, but when he asked her on July 9 what had happened to the continuance she said \"she did not file it because the judge would not have granted it because the case has been going on too long.\" Mot. to Vacate at 5;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   Evid. Hr'g Tr. at 10:8-11:6. There is conflicting evidence on this claim, to say the least. Peterson testified that, while she could not specifically recall whether Ayers had requested a continuance, she never opposed a client's request for a continuance and she would have asked the Court for a continuance if he had asked her to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Evid. Hr'g Tr. at 46:11-47:7, 58:8-:17, 60:8-:21, 62:17-:22. Ayers's appellate counsel, Beverly Dyer, claimed in response to questioning at the hearing that she \"believe[d] he did say\" that he had asked Peterson for a continuance and that she had not sought it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 99:11-:15, 100:23-101:1. But she was far from certain on this point. She also conflated Ayers telling her that he had asked for a continuance with Ayers telling her generally that he was upset he was not sentenced after the FSA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Given the mixed evidence as to whether Ayers asked Peterson to request a continuance, Ayers argues that the Court need not decide whether he actually made the request, because Peterson should have sought a continuance in any event. Def.'s Br. at 11-12. As the Court finds Peterson's testimony more credible than Ayers's, the Court must indeed determine whether Peterson should have sought a continuance on her own. As part of this inquiry, however, Ayers must still rebut the government's proffered rationales for going forward with the July 9 sentencing. In its briefs and in the evidentiary hearings, the government has suggested that Peterson sought to take advantage of the uncertainty around what a final FSA might look like, so Ayers could benefit from the atmosphere of legislative change to the mandatory minimum regime without the possible cost to his arguments if the final FSA turned out not to be that helpful to defendants like him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Evid.

Peterson and Dyer stated numerous times throughout their testimony that, due to the nature of Ayers's plea, the only benefit the FSA could provide Ayers was as another argument for concurrent sentencing.

Both also admitted that, at the time, they did not think the timing of the hearing would make much difference to the concurrent sentencing argument Peterson would make-or, at least, that there were costs and benefits to making the argument either before or after the FSA passed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45:7-48:21, 53:4-:23, 56:9-57:10, 59:6-:19, 62:23-63:5, 81:13-:22, 83:6-:14, 85:7-:20, 87:2-88:6, 99:11-103:3.

Unlike at Abney's sentencing on August 2, it was difficult to know, either at Ayers's plea on April 1 or his sentencing on July 9, 2010, whether the FSA had a likely or even a reasonable chance of passing. The Senate reached a deal and passed the FSA by unanimous consent on March 17, after having passed the bill out of the Judiciary Committee six days earlier.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FSA Enactment History.

This statement could have been spin, or a reference to the Senate's passage of the bill in March. There was no indication at sentencing that Peterson believed Congress was going to pass the FSA later that month.

Instead, this case looks more like the cases\n   <em>\n    Abney\n   </em>\n   distinguished away, in which courts denied IAC claims against counsel who either did not ask for or did not receive continuances when the FSA's \"enactment was anything but guaranteed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085779,12310061\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/1079/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085779,12310061\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/1079/\">\n    at 1093\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Finally, unlike the plea in\n   <em>\n    Abney\n   </em>\n   , the plea here included a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) stipulation, in which the parties agreed on the sentence length ahead of time. This matters for two reasons. The nature of the plea made it less likely that any difference in mandatory minimums brought on by the FSA would be relevant to Ayers's sentencing. As explained above, there did not appear to be much benefit to delaying sentencing, since the sentence itself was not at issue but rather only the question of concurrence with Ayers's Superior Court sentence. There was thus no \"substantial sentencing benefit\" from the drop in minimums \"that was reasonably likely to apply to [Peterson's] client if his sentencing were postponed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085779,12310061\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/1079/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085779,12310061\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/1079/\">\n    at 1090\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The nature of the agreement also matters because the prevailing professional norm for those attorneys whose clients were being directly sentenced under the drug statutes did not exist for Rule 11(c)(1)(C) pleas.

The question then becomes whether that decision was reasonable-and it was. \"Although there are basic rights that the attorney\n   cannot waive without the fully informed and publicly acknowledged consent of the client, the lawyer has-and must have-full authority to manage the conduct of the trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

The overwhelming evidence from the record-particularly from the evidentiary hearings-is that Peterson would have made the exact same argument to the Court whether the FSA had passed or not, and that there were benefits and costs to either going ahead with sentencing or waiting for the FSA's passage. If Ayers's account is to be believed, then, Peterson had a sentencing argument that could be made at any time, determined that the Court would likely feel \"the case has been going on too long,\" Def.'s Mot. at 5, and decided that it would be best not to risk frustrating the judge who had sole discretion over whether to run Ayers's sentence concurrently with his existing one.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Court recognizes that Ayers is, in some respects, a victim of poor timing. There is an inherent arbitrariness to being kept in jail longer because one received an agreed-upon sentence a month before the legal status quo changed in a way that might have worked in one's favor. But there was no firm indication at the time of sentencing that the FSA would soon pass, or that it would benefit Ayers if it did. In any event, Ayers had agreed to a particular sentence under Rule 11(c)(1)(C), which allowed him to argue only for concurrent sentencing rather than for a shorter prison term. Thus, even if the FSA had passed, Peterson's argument would have been very similar to the one she in fact made. For the reasons explained above, then, the Court finds that Peterson was not deficient under the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   test.

In either situation, the government could have then brought back its original charges, which could have saddled Ayers with a significantly higher sentence-and this was a possibility that could have led a reasonable attorney to have preferred a pre-FSA sentencing.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Evid.
