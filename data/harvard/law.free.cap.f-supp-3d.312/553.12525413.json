Lee, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The case is before the court on separate motions by defendants Tracy Tullos and\n   Rob Heflin for summary judgment based on qualified immunity pursuant to Rules 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c). Plaintiff Alan Atwood has responded in opposition to the motion. The court, having considered the memoranda of authorities, together with attachments, submitted by the parties, concludes that defendants' motions are well-taken and should be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Alan Atwood (Atwood) has brought the present action against Rob Heflin and Tracy Tullos, officers with the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks (MDWFP), alleging federal claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for violations of his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure and for excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment, together with myriad state law claims relating to his December 27, 2015 arrest and subsequent prosecution on various charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The basic facts are undisputed. On the night of December 27, 2015, around 9:00 p.m., Atwood was driving his truck along Summerall Road in Issaquena County. Miles Hallberg, a friend, was in the passenger seat and Atwood's wife, Donna, was in the backseat. Sergeant Rob Heflin saw the truck from some distance away, as the truck was brightly lit, with LED lights shining to the front, sides and rear. Sergeant Heflin suspected the truck's occupants were headlighting deer, so he pulled the truck over. When he got to the truck, Heflin observed a .223 rifle in plain view in the front seat, next to Hallberg's leg. He inquired whether the gun was loaded, and Atwood responded that it was. Sergeant Heflin ordered the occupants out of the vehicle and placed Atwood and Hallberg in handcuffs. He asked Donna Atwood to activate the truck's auxiliary lights, which he then photographed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In the meantime, Lieutenant Tracy Tullos, Heflin's supervisor, arrived at the scene. At Heflin's request, Tullos contacted the Issaqeuna County Sheriff's Department to request a deputy to transport the arrestees to the county jail and called for a tow truck for Atwood's truck. Both took a long time to arrive, since they were some distance away. While they waited, Atwood and Hallberg stood beside the truck, handcuffed behind their backs, and Heflin filled out paperwork.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   By the time the tow truck arrived, Heflin had decided that he was not going to arrest Donna. Because she was not being arrested, Atwood asked the officers to let Donna drive the truck instead of having it towed. According to Atwood, the officers refused to release the truck to Donna until Atwood paid the tow truck driver $250 in cash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Atwood and Hallberg were charged with headlighting deer in violation of Mississippi Code Ann. \u00a7 49-7-95 ; hunting from a public road in violation of \u00a7 95-15-13; unlawful shot size in violation of MDWFP regulations; and unauthorized use of auxiliary lights in violation of \u00a7 63-7-17. Atwood appeared before the Issaquena County Justice Court on March 3, 2016. The court\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   reduced the charge of headlighting deer to a charge of harassment of wildlife in violation of Mississippi Code Annotated \u00a7 49-7-95(5) and found Atwood guilty of that offense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court also found him guilty on the charges of unauthorized shot size and unauthorized\n   use of auxiliary driving lamps but found him not guilty on the charge of hunting from a public road. On appeal, the Issaquena County Circuit Court, by order entered December 5, 2016, granted a motion by Atwood to dismiss the charges of unauthorized shot size and unauthorized use of auxiliary driving lamps. The court set a February 13, 2016 trial date on the remaining charge of harassment of wildlife. On February 13, 2016, following the trial, the court found Atwood guilty of violating \u00a7 47-9-95(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Atwood filed the present action on March 7, 2017 asserting federal and state claims relating to these events. As to Atwood's federal claims under \u00a7 1983, defendants contend they are entitled to summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity. As to his state claims, they seek dismissal via summary judgment and/or judgment on the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Summary Judgment Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a), summary judgment is required when \"the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Typically on a summary judgment motion, the moving party bears the initial burden of showing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

If the moving party demonstrates an absence of evidence supporting the nonmoving party's case, then the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to come forward with specific facts showing that a genuine issue for trial does exist.\n   <em>\n    Matsushita Elec.

It is undisputed that Heflin seized the .223 rifle he observed in Atwood's vehicle. In the court's opinion, contrary to plaintiff's urging, the seizure of the weapon was supported by probable cause and therefore was permissible under Mississippi Code Annotated \u00a7 49-7-103. Section 49-7-103 identifies certain property that is subject to forfeiture, including \"any firearm .... used directly or indirectly in the hunting ... of deer at night with any headlight, lighting device or light amplifying device....\" The Mississippi Supreme Court has held that seizure is authorized under \u00a7 49-7-103 where law enforcement agents \"have probable cause to believe that the subject property has been used, directly or indirectly, to accomplish the various violations that are enumerated.\"\n   <em>\n    One 1992 Toyota 4-Runner, Vin No. JT3VN39W2N8034941 v.

He alleges that defendants' seizure of the vehicle was specifically forbidden by Mississippi Code Annotated \u00a7 49-7-103, which states, \"No motor vehicle that is of the type required to be titled under the Mississippi Motor Vehicle Title Law is subject to forfeiture.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Atwood alleges that defendants' \"fraudulent and wrongful\" seizure of the truck was either \"negligence, gross negligence, or an intentional tort.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendants argue,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that plaintiff's state law claims, including his unspecified claim relating to their initial decision to have the vehicle towed and their alleged refusal thereafter to release the vehicle until the tow truck driver was paid, are covered by the MTCA.

Miss. June 2, 2015) (finding that claim for trespass to chattels based on seizure of vehicle upon arrest was \"likely one of those intentional torts which fall under the MTCA\"). The court does recognize that Atwood's complaint characterizes Heflin's and Tullos' actions as \"malicious\" and \"fraudulent\". However, he has also specifically alleged that they were acting within the course and scope of their employment, and more pertinently, there is no evidence to suggest that defendants' actions were \"malicious\" or \"fraudulent.\" Rather, what the evidence shows is that at the time called for a tow truck to have the vehicle towed, Heflin intended to arrest all three occupants, which would have meant that no one was available to remove the vehicle from the arrest site. Heflin subsequently reconsidered his initial decision to arrest Donna since he was\n   concerned for her safety if incarcerated at the Issaquena County Jail. By the time Heflin changed his mind about arresting Donna, the tow truck operator was already on his way to the arrest site; and upon the driver's arrival, he was entitled to payment for his services. In the court's opinion, under the circumstances, defendants' decision to have the truck towed was an exercise of discretion for which they are entitled to immunity, as was their decision to release the vehicle to Donna only upon payment of the tow truck driver.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, defendants' motions for summary judgment as to this claim will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Based on all of the foregoing, it is ordered that the motions of defendants Heflin and Tullos for summary judgment and for judgment on the pleadings are granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   A separate judgment will be entered in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   SO ORDERED this 24\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   day of April, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Plaintiff originally filed the case in state court.
