Compl. \u00b6 13; Tucker Decl. \u00b6 4. I conclude that the Government has fully satisfied its FOIA obligations, with a search reasonably calculated to locate responsive records, and production of nearly all non-exempt records. I will therefore grant the Government's Motion for Summary Judgment as to the lion's share of the records at issue, but grant Cornucopia's cross-motion as to three pages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In June 2015, Cornucopia Institute sent the Agricultural Marketing Service, an agency within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), a FOIA request for \"the entire investigative files for five operations targeted for enforcement actions by the NOP [National Organic Program] since the beginning of fiscal year 2013.\" Decl. of Jennifer Tucker Ex. 1, Def.'s Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 14-2; Compl. \u00b6 13. The request listed the operations as \"Rosewood Products,\" \"The Sixty,\" \"Serenigy,\" \"Magill Ranch,\" and \"Organic Avenue Juices.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Cornucopia filed suit in May 2016, having received no documents. Compl. 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"Between January 7 and May 26, 2016,\" the Government searched for responsive records. Tucker Decl. \u00b6 8. The search focused on records held by the NOP's Compliance and Enforcement Division, since that division \"process[es] incoming complaints alleging actionable violations,\" and investigates those complaints.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 13. The search involved the NOP's FOIA specialist, specialists from the NOP's Compliance and Enforcement Division \"who were in charge of the investigations at issue,\" and the Compliance and Enforcement Division's director.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. A complaint's corresponding investigative files are \"store[d] and manage[d] ... on [the NOP's] shared network computer drive,\" and \"each complaint is assigned a unique number when it is received.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. So the search team \"identified the complaints, by number, in an NOP database that tracks complaints,\n   and searched for and retrieved investigative materials stored under those complaint numbers by accessing the program's shared drive.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"NOP employees also searched hard copy paper investigative records that were maintained in storage cabinets\" in the program's Washington, District of Columbia office. This search yielded 881 responsive pages, of which the Government released 420 pages in full, 225 pages in part, and withheld 236 pages in full.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. The Government invoked FOIA Exemptions 4, 5, 6, 7(C), 7(D), and 7(E) for the records withheld.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4)-(7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the parties had filed and briefed two cross-motions for summary judgment, I ordered the Government to \"either search for and release to the Plaintiff all non-exempt portions\" of nine records or categories of records that the Plaintiff claimed were obvious omitted portions of the five investigative files, or else to \"submit a supplemental declaration describing in greater detail the efforts that Defendant has taken with respect to these documents, including why [ ] additional efforts ... are not required by law.\" Order of Jan. 12, 2018, ECF No. 23;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem.

Decl. of Lynnea Schurkamp \u00b6\u00b6 4-16, Notice of Filing Supplemental Decl., ECF No. 25-1 (Schurkamp Decl.).

Cir. 1984) (citation omitted). Here, the Government's search team looked in the pertinent shared electronic drives and in headquarters hard-copy files, and then conducted extensive follow up searches for specific documents. Tucker Decl. 3-4; Schurkamp Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-16. Cornucopia makes (or has made\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) three arguments challenging the legal adequacy of the Government's extensive search efforts, but each fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   First, Cornucopia briefly contends that the Government failed to describe any pre-litigation search, and \"did not undertake a search until January 7, 2017.\" Pl.'s Mem. In Support of Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. and in Opp. To Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. 6 (Pl.'s Opp.). But even if a pre-litigation search is required-an assumption for which Cornucopia cites no authority-the Government\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   perform such a search. \"Between January 7 and May 26,\n   <em>\n    2016\n   </em>\n   ,\" the Government searched for responsive records. Tucker Decl. \u00b6 8 (emphasis added). Cornucopia seems to have simply misread Ms. Tucker's affidavit on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Second, Cornucopia argues that the Government's original search was legally inadequate. Because the Government \"did not disclose the name of the database searched [or] disclose the other databases that were considered but rejected for the search,\" the Government did not search by using the subjects of the investigations as keywords, and \"there is no discussion of a search or regional offices or other [Agricultural Marketing Service] offices,\" Cornucopia concludes that \"it is fair to say that [Ms. Tucker] fails to provide any useful description whatsoever as the agency's search methodology.\" Pl.'s Opp. 6-7. Not so. We must remember that Cornucopia specifically requested \"the entire\n   <em>\n    investigative files\n   </em>\n   for five operations targeted for enforcement actions by the NOP.\" Tucker Decl. Ex. 1 (emphasis added). The Government knows that it \"stores ... investigative and other files ... on [NOP's] shared network computer drive,\" and \"hard copy\n   paper investigative records ... in storage cabinets within NOP office space in Washington, [District of Columbia].\" Tucker Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 10-11. By searching these locations, the Government conducted a search \"reasonably calculated to uncover\" the investigative files at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Weisberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"593091,3804036\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/745/1476/\">\n    745 F.2d at 1485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Cornucopia offers only speculation that the Government would have been better served using search terms (even though investigative files are organized by complaint number), or looking in other databases or offices, and speculation cannot rebut the presumption of good faith given to agency declarations.\n   <em>\n    SafeCard Servs. Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10546712,3488360\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/926/1197/\">\n    926 F.2d at 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Finally and most substantially, Cornucopia contends that the Government has failed \"to follow-up on clear leads indicating the existence of additional agency records responsive to Plaintiff's FOIA request.\" Pl.'s Opp. 7. Cornucopia identified many documents that certainly seem like part of pertinent investigative files, including the complaint that kicked off the Magill Ranch investigation, and \"exhibits\" mentioned by various investigation summaries that the Government produced.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   10-12. And the Government does have an obligation to \"follow through on obvious leads to discover requested documents.\"\n   <em>\n    Valencia-Lucena v. U.S. Coast Guard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11662837,3669414\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/180/321/\">\n    180 F.3d 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 325 (D.C. Cir. 1999). But the follow-up search that the Government has conducted here satisfies this standard, and indeed appears to have been exhaustive and successful. Schurkamp Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-20. Cornucopia seems to agree, above n. 1, and I conclude that the Government has discharged any duty to track down obvious leads.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Government Largely Applied FOIA's Exemptions Correctly\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   FOIA \"allows agencies to withhold only those documents that fall under one of nine specific exemptions, which are construed narrowly in keeping with FOIA's presumption in favor of disclosure.\"\n   <em>\n    Pub. Citizen, Inc. v.

Plaintiff only contests records withheld under Exemptions 4 and 5, and I conclude that the Government properly applied those exemptions except as to three pages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Under Exemption 4, Cornucopia Is Entitled to One Disputed Page\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Exemption 4 applies to \"commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4). Cornucopia contends that (1) the Government has withheld a page of product labels that cannot be considered confidential because they have \"already [been] disclosed to the public,\" Pl.'s Opp. 14, (2) the Government has withheld entire organic handling plans when it could have produced some details,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    18-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and (3) the Government has redacted the phrase \"Aloha Medicinals\" only occasionally, thus waiving the privilege for that phrase,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    17-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Only the first of these arguments holds water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Government characterizes a page of product labels they have withheld as \"unpublished drafts of proposed product labels\" sent to Organic Avenue's certifying agent \"as a requirement of continued certification.\" Vaughn Index 1 (citing bates-stamped page 6). But Cornucopia persuasively argues that the labels are not \"unpublished,\" because the redacted page is the enclosure to a \"Notice to Cease and Desist.\" Pl.'s Reply 10 (citing Supplemental Fantle Decl., Exhibit C at 1-3 (bates stamped 4-6) ). Reading the Notice to Cease and Desist confirms the argument: Organic Avenue is told to stop using\n   <em>\n    current\n   </em>\n   product labels that used the term \"Organic Avenue,\" since they have no certification from the NOP. The Notice references\n   an \"Enclosure,\" and the Government has redacted the following page. Vaughn Index 1. The context makes it clear that page 6 constitutes the referenced \"Enclosure,\" and that the product labels therein were published without certification, rather sent to Organic Avenue's certifying agent \"as a requirement of continued certification.\"\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Vaughn Index 1\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Supp. Fantle Decl., Exhibit C at 1-3 (bates stamped 4-6). In short, the context proves that the redacted product labels were publicly posted, not unpublished.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Since the labels were being publicly displayed, and thus the subject of the cease and desist notice, the Government cannot invoke Exemption 4's protection for \"confidential\" information. Under D.C. Circuit precedent, the test for whether material is \"confidential\" depends on whether the information was disclosed to the Government on a voluntary or mandatory basis.\n   <em>\n    Ctr. for Auto Safety v.

Competitors can use this information to identify and exploit weaknesses, or duplicate processes without investing resources.\" Tucker Decl., ECF. No. 14-4 at 8 (Vaughn Index). The case on which Cornucopia purports to rely does not apply. It cites\n   <em>\n    Animal Legal Def. Fund v. United States Food &amp; Drug Admin.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%204511936\">\n    2013 WL 4511936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 23, 2013) for the proposition that \"disclosure of limited, non-exempt information within a [larger] document\" is appropriate, because that disclosure would not work \"substantial competitive harm.\" Pl.'s Opp. 18-20. Not only is that case in another jurisdiction, but the Ninth Circuit has since reversed and remanded it, destroying any persuasive value.\n   <em>\n    Animal Legal Def. Fund v.

In any event, I am convinced that the Government has carried its burden of showing that organic production plans are commercial, obtained from investigated businesses, and confidential, and thus subject to Exemption 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Third, Cornucopia argues that the Government \"inconsistently applied (b)(4) exemptions to [the phrase] 'Aloha Medicinals,' \" Pl.'s Reply 13, and that since Cornucopia has since posted the revealed uses of the phrase on a permanent public website, the phrase now fits the \"public-domain doctrine,\" under which \"materials normally immunized from disclosure under FOIA lose their protective cloak once disclosed and preserved in a permanent public record.\"\n   <em>\n    Cottone v.

Cir. 1999). But as the Government points out, this contention rests on a false inference. Just because \"Aloha Medicinals\" preceded \"/Serenigy\" in a disclosed email subject line, it is not true that every redaction of a phrase before \"/Serenigy\" must represent a deletion of \"Aloha Medicinals.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp. To P.'s Mot. Summ. J. and Reply 17 (Def.'s Reply). Emails regarding Serenigy may well mention other commercially-relevant products or phrases. In other words, Cornucopia has not shown that the hidden phrase they want to see has already been disclosed, and so fails to rebut the Government's contention that the information is commercial and confidential.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

Cir. 1980) (citations omitted). The Government has invoked Exemption 5 to protect several categories of records, including \"draft notices\" of civil penalties and proposed settlement, \"draft ... recommendations on whether to uphold adverse actions,\" draft requests to investigate, internal communications about investigations, proposed penalties, and settlements, and \"communications ... between NOP and the USDA, Office of General Counsel regarding the investigations.\" Tucker Decl. 8. Cornucopia's challenges to these withholdings fail except as to two pages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Cornucopia begins with vague allegations that the Government has not identified deliberative records \"clearly\" enough to establish that all fall within the deliberative process privilege, Pl.'s Opp. 22, and that the Government \"fail[s] to identify any of the specific people [relating] to the withheld [attorney-client privilege] records as an attorney.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23. But vague claims do not rebut the presumption of good faith afforded the Government's affidavits, particularly when an affidavit and corresponding 67-page\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index provide the reasonable level of detail seen here. Tucker Decl. 8;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   Vaughn Index 4-5 (invoking Exemption 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Cornucopia then takes a more productive tack, and challenges specific withholdings. It first argues that in describing a \"Memorandum report from [an] NOP manager to agency Office of General Counsel attorneys\" about the \"SereniGy\" investigation, Vaughn Index 37, the Government \"fails to identify specific people ... as an attorney,\" \"does not specify why the communication is entitled to 'confidential' treatment,\" and gives a \"wholly conclusory\" basis for invoking Exemption 5. Pl.'s Opp. 23. But these accusations are off-base. After describing the information withheld as a \"[m]anager's policy and enforcement action recommendations and questions to attorneys,\" Vaughn Index 37, Ms. Tucker gives a thorough justification:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Deliberative process privilege-pre-decisional and deliberative.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   The draft document contains the author's recommendations about prospective enforcement action options. The document was drafted expressly for use by agency Office of General Counsel staff during attorney-client communications with NOP staff. The record is pre-decisional because it was developed before the agency took any official action regarding the enforcement action at issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Attorney-Client Privilege: The withheld portions contain information prepared by [Agricultural Marketing Service] and provided to the USDA, Office of the General Counsel, for the purpose of soliciting legal advice about the enforcement action at issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   I am satisfied that these enforcement questions posed by the NOP to \"attorneys\" in the \"Office of General Counsel\" are attorney-client privileged, and subject to the deliberative process privilege. Ms. Tucker's description easily satisfies the legal requirement that \"affidavits describe the documents and the justifications for nondisclosure with reasonably specific detail, demonstrate that the information withheld logically falls within the claimed exemption, and are not controverted by either contrary evidence in the record nor by evidence of agency bad faith.\"\n   <em>\n    Military Audit Project\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1267816,3518669\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/656/724/\">\n    656 F.2d at 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Next, Cornucopia argues that the Government has improperly redacted parts of four \"notices of non-compliance.\" Pl.'s Opp. 23 (citing Exhibit A to Fantle Decl. in support of Pl.'s Opp. at 62-63, 65, 72-73, 74-75 (referencing records that are bates stamped 84-85, 622, 290-291, and 296-297) ). The Government quickly explained that \"Each and every notice of\n   noncompliance cited by Plaintiff was excepted under either Exception 4 or Exception 6 ... [and] [n]one of them were excepted under Exception 5.\" Def.'s Reply 22. Cornucopia had nothing to say in response. Pl.'s Reply 13-14 (never mentioning Exemption 5). Reviewing Cornucopia's cited pages largely confirms the Government's point: only two of the relevant pages are redacted under Exemption 5 at all, Exhibit A to Fantle Decl. at 62-63 (bates stamped 84-85), and those pages are not part of any notice of noncompliance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   But review also reveals that the Government has provided no description at all for those two pages, and appears to have simply invoked Exemption 5 without explaining why in either the Vaughn Index or the Tucker Declaration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   It is the Government's \"burden ... to establish their right to withhold information from the public and they must supply the courts with sufficient information to allow us to make a reasoned determination that they were correct.\"\n   <em>\n    Coastal States Gas Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787061,1386646\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/617/854/\">\n    617 F.2d at 861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"[C]onclusory assertions of privilege will not suffice to carry the Government's burden of proof in defending FOIA cases.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787061,1386646\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/617/854/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If the Government fails to carry this burden, then a court may order release of the documents at issue.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787061,1386646\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/617/854/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787061,1386646\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/617/854/\">\n    at 870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \"the defendant ... has failed to carry its burden of establishing that the documents involved in this appeal were properly withheld ...
