Conclusion...1270\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   This case arises from the uncertainty inherent in the overlapping jurisdictional reach of the Utah state courts and the Ute tribal courts when a dispute arises between the Tribe and a non-Indian under a series of complex commercial contracts that create an issue of whether there is an enforceable waiver of sovereign immunity. The case puts at issue the interests of three sovereigns: the United States, the state of Utah, and the Ute Tribe. It is undisputed that Congress, exercising its power as the sovereign, has and may grant-as well as limit-the authority of both the state and the Tribe to exercise their separate jurisdictional authority. And the boundaries of that authority have and continue to evolve.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Traditionally, state courts have general subject matter jurisdiction to resolve disputes that arise within the state's boundaries. When Congress, as the sovereign, has not waived immunity or reserved to the federal courts exclusive jurisdiction in certain areas, the state court's jurisdiction extends to disputes arising within the state's geographic boundaries. Similarly, the doctrine of tribal immunity preempts state court jurisdiction for disputes arising within tribal boundaries. The scope and breadth of tribal immunity and preemption have evolved and continue to evolve, both by congressional action and court decisions. This case requires the court to determine the circumstances under which such tribal sovereign immunity preempting state court jurisdiction may be waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Inherent in the recognition of tribal sovereign immunity is the goal of supporting tribal self-governance and control over the Tribe's property, assets, and the management of tribal affairs. The tribal lands have been held in trust by the federal government for the benefit of the tribal members. To avoid misappropriation and abuse, the federal government, as the guardian for the tribal members, has been required to approve alienation of trust assets. As valuable resources have been found on tribal lands, the motivation for non-Indians to engage in corruption and deceit to deprive tribal members of the value of these resources has often been astounding and a sad commentary on the development of the West's natural resources.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The natural and appropriate response by the tribes has been to be increasingly vigilant and zealous in asserting and protecting their right to control their own affairs. The principal legal mechanism has been for the tribes to assert their rights to sovereign immunity, arguing that disputes over trust assets must be resolved in tribal courts. The tribes, however, have also recognized the value of participating in the commercial development of their resources. These commercial transactions by their very nature are often complex and require significant capital contribution from non-Indian entities. These commercial arrangements, as is customary in all similar complex transactions, require agreements between the parties on how disputes will be resolved, and by which courts. In this case, the agreements have ripened the uncertainty about the overlapping jurisdiction of the state and tribal courts, and about when and under what\n   circumstances tribal sovereign immunity comes into play. The very nature of the agreements themselves requires the parties to determine whether sovereign immunity has been waived and the jurisdiction of the state courts recognized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Indian tribes rightly are strongly motivated to enjoy the fullest protection possible to control the resolution of such disputes. Similarly, non-Indians are also appropriately motivated to protect the value of their capital and labor investments. The motivations and intentions of both sides are understandable and cannot be faulted. This case requires the court to resolve how those interests, in compliance with existing law, statutes, and agreements, should be resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   For the reasons stated below, the court concludes that this contract dispute should be resolved in Utah state court and the pending action in the Ute Tribal Court enjoined. The court reaches this conclusion after reviewing hundreds of pages of briefing, considering extensive oral argument, and conducting a careful analysis of a record of more than 5,000 pages. The transaction is complex and the parties' attempts to simplify in order to support their positions have sometimes missed the essential facts and terms upon which the decision must be based.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   To address these issues, the court has been required to provide detail and analysis beyond what would be typical or even desired on a motion for preliminary injunction. The detailed analysis has been necessary, however, to fairly and adequately address the facts and legal issues raised. Because of the complexity of the agreements, laws, and issues, the court provided the parties with a draft copy of this memorandum decision as a tentative ruling and held an additional hearing on Friday, April 13, 2018, for the parties to address any errors or misunderstanding in the draft decision. The final decision incorporates relevant issues raised by the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   This action is before the court on the tribal parties' motion for a preliminary and/or permanent injunction against Mr. Lynn Becker and Judge Barry G. Lawrence proceeding in the matter of\n   <em>\n    Becker v. Ute Indian Tribe et al\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 140908394, Third Judicial District Court, Salt Lake County.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 54.) A brief history of how this court came to consider this motion is set forth in the Memorandum Decision and Order Granting Temporary Restraining Order dated February 17, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 85.) The motion concerns the provisions of Article 23 of Becker's Independent Contractor Agreement and its implications for the jurisdictional conflict and the issue of tribal exhaustion. In its entirety, Article 23 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    Article 23. Limited Waiver of Sovereign Immunity; Submission to Jurisdiction.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   If any Legal Proceeding (definition follows) should arise between the Parties hereto, the Tribe agrees to a limited waiver of the defense of sovereign immunity,\n   to the extent such defense may be available, in order that such legal proceeding be heard and decided in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a \"Legal Proceeding\" means any judicial, administrative, or arbitration proceeding conducted pursuant to this Agreement and relating to the interpretation, breach, or enforcement of this Agreement. To the extent the course of dealing between the Parties might be interpreted to have modified or extended the terms of this Agreement, the limited waiver of sovereign immunity shall apply to such modification or extension. A Legal Proceeding shall not include proceedings related to royalty or similar interests in lands held by the Tribe that are not expressly subject to the terms of this Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   The Tribe specifically surrenders its sovereign power to the limited extent necessary to permit the full determination of questions of fact and law and the award of appropriate remedies in any Legal Proceeding. The Parties hereto unequivocally submit to the jurisdiction of the following courts: (i) U.S. District Court for the District of Utah, and appellate courts therefrom, and (ii) if, and only if, such courts also lack jurisdiction over such case, to any court of competent jurisdiction and associated appellate courts or courts with jurisdiction to review actions of such courts. The court or courts so designated shall have, to the extent the Parties can so provide, original and exclusive jurisdiction, concerning all such Legal Proceedings, and the Tribe waives any requirement of Tribal law stating that Tribal courts have exclusive original jurisdiction over all matters involving the Tribe and waives any requirement that such Legal Proceedings be brought in Tribal Court or that Tribal remedies be exhausted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Each Party hereto consents to service of processing [sic] for any such Legal Proceeding filed in the court or courts so designated. The Tribe's limited waiver of sovereign immunity and submission to jurisdiction also extends to any arbitration and all review and enforcement of any decision or award of the panel so convened in the court or courts so designated. The Tribe's limited waiver of sovereign immunity shall be further evidenced by a Tribal Resolution delivered at the time of execution of this Agreement in accordance with Tribal Laws, that expressly authorizes the foregoing submission to jurisdiction of the courts so designated and the execution of this Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   (App'x 98-99, ECF No. 55-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Temporary Restraining Order was scheduled to expire on March 3, 2018. Thus, the court held an evidentiary hearing on the tribal parties' motion on February 28, 2018, during which no party objected to the court extending the Temporary Restraining Order enjoining the state court action until the court could issue its written opinion. (ECF No. 106.) At the hearing, the court also took evidence and clarified the purpose for which all evidence would be considered. The court further stated that in deciding this motion, it should consider all documents and exhibits on record in this case as well as in the record of companion case\n   <em>\n    Becker v. Ute Indian Tribe et al\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 2:16-cv-958, United States District Court for the Central Division of Utah.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties did not\n   object to this statement. (Feb. 28 Hrg. Tr. 154, 161; ECF No. 111.) The court therefore DENIES as MOOT the tribal parties' motions in limine seeking to limit the evidence the court should consider. (ECF Nos. 97, 98, &amp; 99.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the hearing, the court also authorized Mr. Becker to submit additional authority for the court's consideration, (ECF No. 106), which he has now done, (ECF No. 109).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On February 28, 2018, the Ute Indian Tribal Court issued an opinion (February 28 Opinion) granting the tribal parties' Motion for Summary Judgment on Grounds of Illegality Under Federal and Tribal Law. (ECF No. 108-1.) On March 1, 2018, the day after the hearing in this court on the tribal parties' motion for preliminary injunction, the tribal parties filed a notice of the February 28 Opinion. (ECF No. 108.) The tribal parties subsequently moved this court to give preclusive effect to the Tribal Court's February 28 Opinion and to consolidate and advance the court's consideration and ruling on the questions of preliminary and permanent injunctive relief as set forth in the tribal parties' motions for summary judgment and/or preliminary and permanent injunctive relief. (ECF No. 110.) Becker has objected to their motion. (ECF No. 115).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons stated below, the court DENIES the tribal parties' motion to give preclusive effect to the February 28 Opinion and to consolidate and advance consideration of their other motions. (ECF No. 110.) Based on the court's review of the evidence, the arguments, the briefing, and relevant case law, the court DENIES the tribal parties' motions for preliminary injunction. (ECF No. 54 and the injunction portions of ECF Nos. 52 &amp; 53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Because this court has previously set forth the factual background in this matter in its January 31, 2018 Memorandum Decision, (ECF No. 78), the court begins here with the legal standard it must follow when ruling on a preliminary injunction. The court may grant a preliminary injunction, in its sound discretion, if the movant shows a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of the relief sought, irreparable harm to the moving party absent an injunction issuing, that the damage an injunction will cause to the non-moving party is outweighed by the threatened injury to the moving party, and that if issued, an injunction will not be adverse to\n   the public interest.\n   <em>\n    Kiowa Indian Tribe of Okla. v.

The court first addresses the most disputed-and dispositive-element of the standard in this case: whether the tribal parties have met their burden to show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Citing case law from as early as 1832, the tribal parties argue that it is a fundamental tenet of federal law that states lack jurisdiction over Indians for conduct occurring within Indian country.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Worcester v.

Because a state's jurisdiction may be bound by its Enabling Act, the court begins its analysis of state court subject matter jurisdiction with Utah's Enabling Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In 1894, Utah adopted \"[a]n Act to enable the people of Utah to form a constitution and State government, and to be admitted into the Union on an equal footing with the original states.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20Stat.%20107\">\n    28 Stat. 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Article III, Sec. 2 of the Constitution of Utah repeats this disclaimer verbatim. The tribal parties argue that the jurisdictional disclaimer contained in these founding documents means that the state\n   of Utah has no subject matter jurisdiction over \"Indian lands and Indian people on Indian lands in Utah\" and that only the United States Congress can grant such jurisdiction. (Pl.'s Reply 11, ECF No. 101.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The tribal parties acknowledge that where Congress has provided \"clear federal authorization,\" (Pl.'s Emerg. Mot. 18, ECF No. 54 (citing COHEN'S HANDBOOK OF FEDERAL INDIAN LAW \u00a7 7.03(1)(a)(ii), p. 608 (2012 ed.) ) ), and when \"Congress has expressly so provided,\"\n   <em>\n    Cal. v.

Mot. 18, ECF No. 54). Indeed, since\n   <em>\n    Worcester\n   </em>\n   , Congress has authorized state jurisdiction over a number of types of actions involving Indian parties on Indian lands, and even over Indian water rights in state courts.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    San Carlos Apache Tribe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6197434\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/545/#p563\">\n    463 U.S. at 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6197434\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/545/#p563\">\n    103 S.Ct. 3201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that \"we must conclude that the District Courts were correct in deferring to the state proceedings\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Nonetheless, the tribal parties argue here that Congress has not spoken and that there is not \"a single act of Congress that empowers the State of Utah to exercise adjudicatory jurisdiction over the Ute Indian Tribe for actions undertaken by the Tribe within the exterior boundaries of its reservation.\" (Pl.'s Reply 12, ECF No. 101.) Without such authorization, they argue, the Tribe's alleged contractual waiver of sovereign immunity is ineffective because, even if Becker's Independent Contractor Agreement is valid, Congress has not authorized Utah to exercise subject matter jurisdiction over this civil action. But the tribal parties are incorrect. The Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968, codified in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201321\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , addresses congressional grants of authority for states to exercise jurisdiction over criminal and civil actions involving Indians.

Therefore, if the action involves trust property, Utah would be precluded from having subject matter jurisdiction over this action, regardless of its acceptance of \u00a7 1322(a) via \u00a7 1324 and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%209-9-201\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 9-9-201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   At this point, because answers to the questions regarding trust property and selective waiver of the tribe's sovereign immunity dictate the tribal parties' likelihood of success on the merits of their argument that the state court has no jurisdiction over this action, the court must consider in full the validity and terms of the Becker Independent Contractor Agreement at issue. Before doing so, however, the court addresses the tribal parties' motion that the Tribal Court's February 28 Opinion should be given preclusive effect. (ECF No. 110.) This is because the Tribal Court's ruling directly addresses the validity of the contract under federal and tribal law, and if preclusive would dictate the court's evaluation of the tribal parties' likelihood of success on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    B. February 28, 2018 Tribal Court Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1.\n     <em>\n      Background\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   On August 18, 2016, the Ute Indian Tribe, the Uintah and Ouray Tribal Business Committee, and Ute Energy Holdings, LLC, filed a declaratory judgment action against Becker in The Ute Indian Tribal Court of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation. The tribal parties first filed\n   their complaint in Tribal Court three and a half years after Becker initiated federal court action on this contract, (\n   <em>\n    Becker v. Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation et al\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 2:13-cv-123 (dismissed for lack of federal question jurisdiction) ), twenty months after Becker sued in state court, and two days after this court, Judge Robert J. Shelby presiding, dismissed the instant action for lack of federal court jurisdiction, (ECF No. 40). Becker's companion case seeking to enjoin the tribal parties from pursuing the 2016 Tribal Court action is Case No. 2:16-cv-958 in this court. (Compl. for Decl. J., ECF No. 2-3, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) The Tribal Court issued its February 28 Opinion as a result of the following circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   On September 14, 2016, this court initially granted Becker's motion for a temporary restraining order enjoining the parties from pursuing the Tribal Court action, and followed that order with a preliminary injunction on September 28, 2016. (ECF No. 50, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) The tribal parties had previously filed a motion for summary judgment in Tribal Court on September 12, 2016, two days before this court's temporary restraining order, seeking a ruling that Becker's contract was void as an ultra vires act under tribal law. (App'x 178, ECF No. 122-1, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) Becker had filed a motion to dismiss the Tribal Court action on September 14, 2016, on the grounds that the contract validly waived the Tribe's sovereign immunity and exhaustion remedies and that the Tribe had submitted to jurisdiction elsewhere. (App'x 206, ECF No. 122-1, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) The tribal parties immediately appealed this court's preliminary injunction, and on December 30, 2016, the Tenth Circuit stayed the preliminary injunction to allow the parties to pursue the Tribal Court action during the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   After the injunction was stayed, the parties continued litigating in Tribal Court, completing their briefing on the above two motions. On March 9, 2017, the Tribal Court, Judge Pro Tem Thomas Weathers presiding, denied Becker's first motion to dismiss and denied without prejudice the tribal parties' motion for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   (App'x 4, ECF No. 122-3, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) Judge Weathers also ordered the parties to show cause why the Tribal Court \"should not dismiss or at least stay this lawsuit pending resolution of the state and federal lawsuits as a matter of comity, preservation of limited judicial resources, and avoidance of conflicting judgments.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) Following briefing on the order to show cause, the Tribal Court issued an Order on June 9, 2017, declining to stay or dismiss the case primarily so that it could rule on the tribal law questions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 257-58.) Judge Weathers bifurcated the tribal parties' complaint and scheduled discovery to proceed only on issues related to the validity of the contract and its terms under tribal and federal law, including the waiver of sovereign immunity and the need for federal approval of the contract. (ECF No. 70-12, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   On August 25, 2017, during the discovery period on these issues, the Tenth Circuit\n   reversed this court's preliminary injunction, holding that because Becker had not shown a likelihood of success on the validity of the contract waiving tribal exhaustion, the Tribal Court should address in the first instance whether it had jurisdiction. (ECF No. 69, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In the meantime, discovery disputes had ensued in the Tribal Court action. On September 19, 2017, shortly after the Tenth Circuit's August reversal and well in advance of the Tribal Court's dispositive motion deadline-but in compliance with Tribal Court rules-the tribal parties filed three motions for partial summary judgment in Tribal Court: one arguing the Becker Independent Contractor Agreement is void ab initio under federal law, one arguing the contract's waiver of sovereign immunity is invalid under tribal law, and one arguing the contract is invalid under both federal and tribal law because it concerns trust property and failed to receive the required federal approval. (App'x 678-737, ECF No. 122-4, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) Becker, after locating a Tribal Ordinance and Tribal Court decision that he believed directly related to the tribal parties' second motion for partial summary judgment as to tribal law, filed a second motion to dismiss on November 2, 2017. (App'x 236, ECF No. 122-5, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   On December 18, 2017, Judge Weathers decided both of these motions because they raised the same legal issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 70-15, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) Judge Weathers again issued an order to show cause why the Tribal Court action \"should not be dismissed or stayed as a matter of comity and preservation of limited tribal judicial resources given the identical suits pending (for some time) in state and/or federal court.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) The next day, Judge Weathers denied all pending discovery and other motions without prejudice, except for the tribal parties' motion for partial summary judgment on whether the Becker Independent Contractor Agreement is void ab initio under federal law, upon which a new discovery and briefing schedule was set. (ECF No. 70-16, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   On December 21, 2017, the Tenth Circuit issued its mandate reversing the Preliminary Injunction against the Tribal Court action in Becker's federal companion case. (ECF No. 69, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) Following the mandate, Becker immediately filed a second motion for preliminary injunction in that case, (ECF No. 70, Case No. 2:16-cv-958), which this court heard on February 14, 2018. (\n   ECF No. 106, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) This court denied Becker's second motion for preliminary injunction because validity of the contract and tribal court exhaustion were still at issue, according to the Tenth Circuit's mandate, even though Judge Weathers' December 18, 2017 Order had held that the Tribe had validly waived its sovereign immunity by Tribal Resolution 05-147 incorporating the Becker Independent Contractor Agreement by reference. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 107, Case No. 2:16-cv-958). In addition, by December 28, 2017, the tribal parties had filed a motion in Tribal Court to reconsider Judge Weathers' December 18, 2017 Order holding that the contract had validly waived the Tribe's sovereign immunity under tribal law. (App'x 144, ECF No. 122-7, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) The motion also requested that the Tribal Court vacate its December 19 discovery and briefing schedule on the motion arguing that federal law rendered the contract void ab initio. It also asked the Tribal Court to reconsider the denial without prejudice of the tribe's other motions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 147.) They specifically asserted, however, that the Tribal Court should not reconsider Becker's discovery motions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Shortly thereafter, on January 4, 2018, Judge Weathers notified the parties that he would no longer be the judge on the case. (ECF No. 70-18, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) On January 9, Chief Judge Stiffarm stayed the December 19 order setting the discovery and briefing schedule on the tribal parties' motion for partial summary judgment on whether the Becker Independent Contractor Agreement is void ab initio under federal law. (App'x 302, ECF No. 122-7, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) The stay order was silent as to whether it granted the tribal parties' request to vacate the portion of Judge Weathers' Order that denied the then-pending motions without prejudice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On January 10, Chief Judge Stiffarm reassigned the Tribal Court action to Judge Terry Pechota. (App'x 303, ECF No. 122-7, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Following the change in Tribal Court judges, there was a flurry of litigation activity in federal, state, and tribal courts. In the Tribal Court action, the tribal parties moved for expedited rulings on all of their pending motions, including those Judge Weathers previously dismissed without prejudice. Judge Pechota heard these motions in Tribal Court on February 16, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   (App'x 26, ECF No. 122-8, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) Becker actively pursued preparations for the state court trial, set to begin on February 26, 2018, while trying to fend off the tribal parties' efforts to stay the state court trial and precipitously pursue rulings in Tribal Court. The tribal parties filed an interlocutory appeal to the Tenth Circuit regarding this court's January 17, 2018 ruling declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the tribal parties' preliminary injunction motion. Becker filed a third motion to dismiss in Tribal Court asking it to fully consider its jurisdiction on the merits. (App'x 337, ECF No. 122-8, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Among other issues, Becker's third motion to dismiss in the Tribal Court action addressed the merits of the tribal parties' motion to reconsider Judge Weathers' December 18 decision, which found waiver of the Tribe's sovereign immunity under Ute Law and Order Code \u00a7 1-8-5 and\n   <em>\n    Yazzie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   as well as whether the Tribal Court was a \"court of competent jurisdiction\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   under \u00a7 1-2-3(5) of the Ute Law and Order Code. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On February 17, 2018, this court issued a temporary restraining order enjoining the state court action. (ECF No. 85.) On February 20 in the Tribal Court action, the tribal parties objected to Judge Pechota's consideration of Becker's third motion to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds, encouraging the Tribal Court \"to focus like a laser on the action in Tribal Court\" and assuring the Tribal Court they are \"fully prepared to defend the Tribal Court's rulings in subsequent federal court review of this Tribal Court proceeding.\" (App'x 208, ECF No. 122-8, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) On February 26, 2018, the date the state court action had previously been set to begin, the tribal parties responded to Becker's jurisdictional motion to dismiss in Tribal Court, again urging Judge Pechota to rule on motions Judge Weathers had previously dismissed regarding contract validity and to reject Judge Weathers' decision finding that the Tribe had acceptably waived its sovereign immunity under tribal law. (App'x 395, ECF No. 122-8, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Ultimately, the Tenth Circuit's direction to this court clarified its November 29, 2017 mandate in this action. (ECF No. 81.) On February 28, 2018, this court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the tribal parties' preliminary injunction motion to enjoin the state court action and took the matter under submission. (ECF No. 106.) The Tribal Court, Judge Pechota presiding, issued its February 28, 2018 Opinion on the same day. (ECF No. 108.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2.\n     <em>\n      The Tribal Court's February 28 Opinion Does Not Have Preclusive Effect\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The tribal parties quote from 2 Commercial Arbitration \u00a7 40:41 (2017) to support their argument that this court should give the Tribal Court's February 28 Opinion preclusive effect: \"If the federal court\n   <em>\n    concurs\n   </em>\n   with the tribal court's acceptance of jurisdiction and determination of the facts, then the matter is res judicata and cannot be relitigated in federal court.\" (Mot. re Preclusion 4, ECF No. 110) (emphasis added).)

(Opinion 3, ECF No. 108-1.) None of those sections, however, grants the Tribal Court subject matter jurisdiction over civil matters, which \u00a7 1-2-5 apparently does, and then in \u00a7 1-2-6 only concurrently with state and federal courts that have valid jurisdiction. (App'x 53, ECF No. 55-1.) In addition, the February 28 Opinion is silent on the fact that Ordinance 13-010 was not executed until March 27, 2013, about six weeks after Becker filed his first federal action against the tribal parties. (Compl., ECF No. 2, Case No. 2:13-cr-123.) While Ordinance 13-010 could be relevant if the issue was whether the Tribal Court has jurisdiction over a contract with a non-Indian that arose after March 27, 2013, the Opinion does not mention that Ordinance 87-04 governed between November 16, 1987 and March 27, 2013-which includes the time period when Becker worked for the Tribe and the Independent Contractor Agreement was executed. (ECF No. 70-2, Case No. 2:16-cv-00958.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Thus, the Tribal Court failed to analyze that Ordinance 87-04 and the Ute Law and Order Code at the relevant time did not provide broad civil jurisdiction over non-Indians, and, in fact, expressly precluded the Tribal Court from exercising jurisdiction over claims \"against the Ute Indian Tribe [and] the Tribal Business Committee,\" both of which are parties to the Tribal Court action. (App'x 52, ECF No. 55-1.) Had the Tribal Court's February\n   28 Opinion acknowledged that Ordinance 87-04 was the relevant Ordinance in effect at the time the Independent Contractor Agreement was negotiated, the Tribal Court would have been required to analyze whether Becker was an employee or an independent contractor in deciding whether it had jurisdiction over him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   The February 28 Opinion also fails to address that Ordinance 13-010-even if it were the relevant Ordinance-retains Ordinance 87-04's \u00a7 1-2-3(4) of the Ute Indian Law and Order Code, thus resulting in the oddity that under Ordinance 13-010 the Tribal Court can have jurisdiction over claims against non-Indians but prohibits non-Indians from raising their claims against the Tribe or the Business Committee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kremer v.

As will be described,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , the court finds that these exceptions apply to the Tribal Court's February 28 Opinion. Significantly, this court found in its Preliminary Injunction order in Becker's companion case that \"express jurisdictional prohibitions\" against the exhaustion rule applied. (ECF No. 50, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) Yet the Tribal Court's February 28 Opinion purports to have relied on this court for the proposition that the exceptions in\n   <em>\n    Montana v. U.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188224\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/544/#p565\">\n    450 U.S. 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 565-66,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188224\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/544/#p565\">\n    101 S.Ct. 1245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188224\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/544/#p565\">\n    67 L.Ed.2d 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981), grant the Tribal Court jurisdiction over non-Indians who enter consensual relationships with the Tribe. (February 28 Opinion 3-4, ECF No. 108-1.) This is erroneous for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   First,\n   <em>\n    Montana\n   </em>\n   does not create tribal court jurisdiction over nonmembers. It establishes \"a presumption\n   <em>\n    against\n   </em>\n   tribal court civil jurisdiction over non-Indians\" that can only be overcome if a tribe can meet the burden to show that an exception applies.\n   <em>\n    Crowe &amp; Dunlevy, P.C. v. Stidham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7343476,4203886\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/640/1140/\">\n    640 F.3d 1140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1150 (10th Cir. 2011) (emphasis added). Second, this court's Preliminary Injunction did not hold that Tribal Court jurisdiction over Becker was established because of the existence of a consensual agreement. Rather, it held that because the tribal parties' contractual waiver of sovereign immunity in the Becker Independent Contractor Agreement overlaps with the question of \"express jurisdictional prohibitions,\" exhaustion in Tribal Court was not required. (ECF No. 50, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) What the February 28 Opinion fails to analyze is that if a consensual relationship is rooted in a contract, and the terms of that contract expressly waive sovereign immunity for legal proceedings on the contract; explicitly waive any requirement that legal proceedings be brought in Tribal Court or that tribal remedies be exhausted; expressly provide that Utah law governs the contract and any disputes; and state that all contract disputes \"shall\" be resolved in the United States District Court for the District of Utah or any court of competent jurisdiction, that contract cannot represent a \"consensual relationship\" that equates to consent to Tribal Court jurisdiction. The tribal parties argue that a contractual agreement is not a prerequisite to a consensual relationship and that Becker's consensual\n   relationship began through an employment relationship before the parties entered into the contract. (App'x 403-04, ECF No. 122-8, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) While true, this fails to address the complexity created by the terms of the contract that renounced Becker's status as an employee and made the agreement retroactively effective on March 1, 2004, when his relationship with the Tribe began. (Preamble and Art. 6-E, App'x 91-95, ECF No. 55-1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Accordingly, the court DENIES the tribal parties' motion to give preclusive effect to the Tribal Court's February 28 Opinion and to advance this court's consideration of the questions of both preliminary and permanent injunctive relief enjoining the state court from proceeding in the tribal parties' summary judgment motions before this court. (ECF No. 110.) The court will, however, consider the Tribal Court's February 28 Opinion in its analysis below.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MacArthur v.

Additionally, to make the record clear, the tribal parties' motion to clarify this court's ruling on the Tribal Court's consideration of its own jurisdiction, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 88), does not relate to this action in the same way it relates to Becker's federal companion case seeking to enjoin tribal court proceedings. (Case No. 2:16-cv-958). This court clarifies that its February 16, 2018 Order in that case, (ECF No. 107, Case No. 2:16-cv-958), does not separately apply to this case, and the motion in this action is DENIED as MOOT.

The court begins with whether Becker's Independent Contractor Agreement involves trust property because that issue drives the contract's validity under both federal and tribal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The tribal parties' preliminary injunction motion did not cite the court to any specific facts that demonstrate that Becker's agreement alienates Indian assets held in trust by the United States. (ECF No. 54.) They cite the court to numerous cases for the principle that failure to secure federal approval for alienation of Indian trust property renders that alienation invalid, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), but that puts the cart before the horse.

The court has identified no dispute that the May 4, 2005 Operating Agreement of Ute Energy, LLC, was approved by the Superintendent of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The members of Ute Energy included Ute Energy Holdings, LLC, whose initial percentage interest in Ute Energy was 81%.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Op. Agr. 53, ECF No. 79-1, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) Ute Energy Holdings contributed a \"90% undivided interest in the Assigned Rights described in Schedule 1 to the Master Agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54.) The tribal parties failed to include the Master Agreement and its schedules in the record, but the Operating Agreement stated that by unanimous written consent of its managers, Ute Energy Holdings would transfer to Ute Energy \"certain rights and interests relating to their ownership interests in Ute/FNR LLC and the associated development rights in the Naval Oil Shale Reserve No. 2 and Brundage Canyon, as well as their direct working interests in the Lake Canyon Exploration and Development Agreement and the anticipated Wolf Flat project (collectively, the 'Working Interests').\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61.) The \"Fair Market Value\" of these initial contributions was stated by dollar amount. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54.) Tribal Resolution No. 05-116, dated March 3, 2005, authorized the Tribe to transfer its \"ownership interest in Ute/FNR LLC and the related development rights in the Naval Oil Shale Reserve No. 2 and Brundage Canyon\" and its \"working interests in the Lake Canyon Exploration and Development and the anticipated Wolf Flat project\" to Ute Energy Holdings, which then transferred its membership interest in the agreements as a capital contribution to Ute Energy. (App'x 107, ECF No. 55-2.) Resolution 05-116 expressly stated that \"the Tribe is currently the party to the\n   <em>\n    agreements being assigned\n   </em>\n   to Ute Energy Holdings and Ute Energy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).) In other words, the agreements-not the mineral rights themselves-were transferred to capitalize Ute Energy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Tribal Resolution No. 07-124, dated May 2, 2007, authorized the Tribe to \"contribute the Tribe's commercial interests in the SITLA LOI and AMI Agreement to Ute Energy,\" specifically stating that \"the interests to be contributed ... will consist solely of commercial rights under the respective agreements, and will exclude any governmental rights to regulate the conduct of activities on Reservation lands as well as the rights of the Tribe as a landowner and lessor (collectively, the 'Governmental Rights').\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 111.) Resolution 07-124 further stated that approval for assigning the Tribe's commercial interests \"shall affect only the Tribe's commercial interests, and shall exclude any of the Tribe's Governmental Rights in the affected lands.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Finally, Tribal Resolution No. 07-183, dated June 26, 2007, authorized the Tribe\n   to \"assign to Ute Energy its commercial interests\" in the Little Canyon EDA, the Monument Butte EDA, the Section 36 Agreement, the Black Tail Ridge EDA, the CDX Farmount Agreement, the Gas Plant Agreement, and the Three Rivers Gathering LLC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 114-15.) The purpose for transferring these \"Newly Contributed Interests\" was in part to raise capital to pay off and fully discharge operating funds that Ute Energy had initially borrowed from Laminar, a 10% non-Indian owner of Ute Energy, under a Credit Agreement between the members of Ute Energy, without increasing the Tribe's \"financial risk and exposure by contributing cash to Ute Energy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 114-15.) The transfer of the Tribe's commercial interests in these agreements would result in cash investments by new non-Indian investors Quantum Energy Partners IV, LP and Quantum Resources, LP, in exchange for the investors' opportunity to \"share in potential profits of the [Ute Energy] company.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115-16.) This new arrangement to secure investment funds to enable Ute Energy to \"exercise its participation rights under exploration and development agreement[s]\" required an amendment to Ute Energy's Operating Agreement.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7, 16, 46.)

These terms of the Amended and Restated Operating Agreement show that Ute Energy was required to pay the Tribe separately and appropriately for its role as a lessor and landowner of the trust property and/or the Tribe's mineral interests held in trust by the United States, as provided by each EDA and LLC agreement constituting Ute Energy Holding's membership interest in Ute Energy. According to these provisions, \"net revenue interest\" distributed from Ute Energy to Ute Energy Holdings necessarily excluded those costs, and thus represented solely the Tribe's profit from its \"working interests,\" which are not trust property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   On July 2, 2007, the Acting Superintendent of the BIA notified the Chairman of the Ute Indian Tribe Business Committee that the Amended and Restated Operating Agreement \"is not utilizing the Tribe's surface or mineral assets for collateral, or granting any interest in the Tribe's trust assets\" and therefore \"is not the type of agreement that is subject to the BIA review process, and that it is therefore unnecessary for the Tribe to seek the BIA's approval of the Restated Agreement.\" (ECF No. 70-5, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) The BIA noted that it is its responsibility to \"review[ ] and approve[ ] those agreements that grant an interest in\n   <em>\n    tribal trust lands\n   </em>\n   or provide for the development of the Tribe's\n   <em>\n    trust mineral estate\n   </em>\n   \" under The Indian Mineral Development Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202101\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 2108, the Non-Intercourse Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20177\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2081\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and other authorities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   The BIA determined that \"[t]he Restated Agreement creates no interest in trust lands subject to approval by the BIA. Likewise, the Restated Agreement does not provide for the exploration or development of minerals in which the Tribe holds a beneficial or restricted interest.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The BIA also noted that it had previously approved the Original Operating Agreement of Ute Energy \"out of an abundance of caution\" but that it no longer believed such approval was necessary, nor was approval of the Amended and Restated Operating Agreement necessary. The BIA expressed its encouragement for the Business Committee's efforts and stated that \"[t]he Tribe may, at its discretion, proceed with implementation of the Restated Agreement without any further review by the BIA.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The BIA conclusion is consistent with and supported by the court's own review of the transactions as documented in the record. If the various operating agreements did not implicate restricted interests, it is nonsensical that revenue generated from those operating agreements, of which Becker was to receive 2%, somehow converted into restricted interests requiring secretarial approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   <em>\n    Exploration and Development Agreements\n   </em>\n   . Because the EDAs were not expressly warrantied in Ute Energy's Operating Agreement, as the LLC interests were, the court also reviewed (to the extent provided) the Tribe's Exploration and Development Agreements that the Tribe assigned to Ute Energy Holdings and with which Ute Energy Holdings capitalized its membership interest in Ute Energy. (App'x 229-49, ECF No. 55-1, App'x 8-106, ECF No. 55-2.) These agreements support the tribal parties' assertion that \"[t]he Tribe had a dual legal status under the EDAs; not only was the Tribe the lessor of its oil/gas minerals but, in addition, the Tribe had the option to participate (with the oil/gas company 'partners') as a working interest owner in the drilling and production of oil and gas from wells drilled on tribal lands under the EDAs.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   section 1.C at \u00b6 7,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Those portions\n   of the EDAs that the tribal parties produced in the appendix reveal that products from the contractual production of oil and gas on restricted Indian land are owned by the Tribe or by the United States in trust for the Tribe. Sale or other disposition of such trust property requires the payment of specified bonus, royalty, throughput, and similar payments under the terms of the EDAs and thus requires approval by the Secretary of the Interior in satisfaction of all federal laws and regulations. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   App'x 11-15, 22-27, 35-39, 55-62, 74-85.) There is no dispute that the Secretary approved all the EDAs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   The \"working interest\" references in the EDAs-which were the actual interests assigned to Ute Energy Holdings and then to Ute Energy-are a result of The Indian Mineral Development Act of 1982, which gave Indian tribes the opportunity to sell, lease, or dispose of their mineral interests not just as lessors of the trust land and mineral interests, but as participants in the development of their mineral resources through joint venture agreements with mineral developers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202101\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 2108. This type of participation offers an opportunity for greater return on resources. But it also comes with risks, costs, and losses that the United States has declined liability for, so long as the Secretary of the Interior ensured that \"the rights of a tribe or individual Indian are protected in the event of a violation of the terms of any Mineral Agreement by any other party.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2103. Revenue from participation in \"working interests\" is separate and distinct from the revenues earned solely by lease arrangements that federal law requires the Secretary of the Interior to approve as fair and appropriate. Significantly, when trust property is not pledged as security for the costs of future production, revenue from \"working interests\" is thus not revenue from trust property or otherwise a restricted interest that requires secretarial approval.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202101\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2105.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   <em>\n    Liquidation and the Second Amended and Restated Operating Agreement\n   </em>\n   . As the 2007 Amended and Restated Operating Agreement anticipated, a Second Amended and Restated Operating Agreement was executed in 2010 to facilitate liquidation of Ute Energy. (Second Am. Op. Agr. 2, ECF 79-3, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) Both of the amended Operating Agreements provided for distribution in kind of the capital contributions of member Ute Energy Holdings, which means that the increased value attributable to the Tribe's restricted trust interests in its EDAs and LLC agreements could be assigned from Ute Energy back to Ute Energy Holdings without triggering distribution of net revenue. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Op. Agr. 50, ECF No. 79-2 &amp; Second Am. Op. Agr. 47 &amp; 50, ECF 79-3, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) Specific provisions of the Second Amended and Restated Operating Agreement anticipated re-assignment of Ute Energy Holding's capital contributions-the actual EDA and LLC working interests-from Ute Energy to Ute Energy Holdings upon liquidation, describing how the Fair Market Value of the in-kind distributions would be valued in Ute Energy\n   Holdings' member Capital Account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47, ECF No. 79-3, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) After the Net Agreed Value (a defined term) for the in-kind capital contributions was determined and the Permitted Transfer (another defined term) via assignment of the actual agreements back to Ute Energy Holdings, the remaining value in the Capital Accounts was to be distributed to members. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Am. Op. Agr., ECF No. 79-3, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) That value represents unencumbered and unrestricted non-trust net revenue interest Ute Energy distributed to Ute Energy Holdings and to which Becker makes a 2% claim. According to the affidavit of Ute Energy's accountant, that value distributed to Ute Energy Holdings was $378,709,233.74 as of April 15, 2016. (Aff. of Laurie Bales, ECF No. 79-4, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) Of that value, $171,807,157.20 was distributed in cash payments to the Ute Tribe.

If, at any time, Contractor wishes to sell the Contractor Rights, Contractor agrees to notify the Tribe of his intention.

This conclusion is required because under either provision 1 or 2, Becker was to receive 2% of net revenues distributed as defined by the Amended and Restated Operating Agreement, whether from participation rights the Tribe exercised through or independently from Ute Energy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   First, if the Tribe participated in its working interests through Ute Energy, net revenue interests the Tribe received by virtue of its protected role as a lessor were already excluded by the Operating Agreement. In other words, the nature of the capital contributions made by the Tribe-consisting only of the \"working,\" \"participation,\" and \"development\" interests in its various EDAs and LLC interests-do not, the Secretary of the Interior pointed out, \"utilize[ ] the Tribe's surface or mineral assets for collateral, or grant[ ] any interest in the Tribe's trust assets.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 70-5, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) Second, if the Tribe elected to participate in its working interests independently of Ute Energy, paragraph 3 of Exhibit B-Participation Plan specifically excluded interests in or payments related to trust property, while paragraph 2 was carefully drafted to require Becker to pay his proportional share of expenses so that the Tribe's trust assets would never be diminished or alienated by Becker's 2% share of the resulting net revenue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, because paragraph 4 only authorized Becker to sell his rights under the Participation Plan, and those rights did not involve trust property, paragraph 4 also does not represent an alienation of trust property requiring approval from the Secretary of the Interior. In short, Becker's Independent Contractor Agreement is not invalid under federal law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   <em>\n    Tribal Court Decision\n   </em>\n   . Judge Pechota's February 28 Opinion granted the tribal\n   parties' motion for summary judgment on the invalidity of Becker's Independent Contractor Agreement under federal law without first granting a motion to vacate Judge Weathers' December 19 Order allowing Becker to complete discovery and complete briefing on the motion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 108-1 and ECF No. 70-16, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) In addition to this procedural irregularity that calls the ruling into question, the Tribal Court did not examine the Ute Energy Operating Agreements that were directly implicated by the terms of the Independent Contractor Agreement. The Independent Contractor Agreement's provisions distributing revenue from Ute Energy to Ute Energy Holdings can only be interpreted in conjunction with Ute Energy's Operating Agreements. When viewed together, the provisions are not ambiguous. Thus the Tribal Court improperly relied for its interpretation of the term \"net revenue interest\" on parol evidence of early contract negotiation discussions and the reports of expert witnesses, most of whom also did not review the Operating Agreements. (ECF No. 108-1.)\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 209(3) (1981) (\"Where the parties reduce an agreement to a writing which in view of its completeness and specificity reasonably appears to be a complete agreement, it is taken to be an integrated agreement ....\"); Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 213 (1981) (\"A binding completely integrated agreement discharges prior agreements to the extent that they are within its scope.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   The Tribal Court also incorrectly asserts that \"[i]t is undisputed that the revenue upon which Becker's 2% interest was to be calculated came from oil and gas production on land held in trust.\" (February 28 Opinion 11, ECF No. 108-1.) First, Becker expected to conduct discovery and complete briefing based on the December 19 Order; thus the facts were not undisputed, but were unaddressed. Second, at oral argument in Tribal Court Becker hotly disputed this allegedly undisputed fact. (App'x 26, ECF No. 122-8, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) This court is not persuaded that the February 28 Opinion can stand on appeal through the Tribal appellate courts, and thus does not find that it should give comity to the decision or weigh it in favor of the tribal parties' likelihood of success on the invalidity of the Independent Contractor Agreement under federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     State Court Jurisdiction Is Not Preempted Because Contract Revenue Is Not Trust Property Under Federal Law\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Because this court concludes that Becker's 2% \"net revenue\" interest in distributions under the Independent Contractor Agreement is not restricted trust property, it finds that the tribal parties are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their argument that the state court does not have jurisdiction over this action under federal statutes\n   <extracted-citation index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201322\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and 1360(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   In the next section, the court considers whether the Independent Contractor Agreement is invalid under tribal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2.\n     <em>\n      The Independent Contractor Agreement Is Valid Under Tribal Law\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Because of the court's conclusion that Becker's 2% \"net revenue\" interest in distributions under the Independent Contractor Agreement is not restricted trust property, the tribal parties' arguments about the invalidity of the contract related to tribal law restrictions on the power of the Ute Indian Tribal Business Committee to approve transactions involving trust property\n   are already resolved against the tribal parties. With respect to trust property, the Business Committee did not act ultra vires when it approved the agreement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Feb. 28 Hrg. Tr. 89-93, ECF No. 111) (referring to limitations on the Business Committee's authority to alienate trust property under the Tribe's Constitution and Charter).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   The tribal parties assert two additional reasons why the state court cannot exercise jurisdiction over this action under tribal law. The court first examines whether the tribal parties are likely to succeed on their argument that the Business Committee acted ultra vires to waive the Tribe's sovereign immunity and whether such waiver was valid under tribal law. The court then examines whether the tribal parties are likely to succeed on their argument that Becker's Independent Contractor Agreement is otherwise invalid under the Tribe's Corporate Charter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   <em>\n    a.\n    <em>\n     The Tribe Validly Waived Sovereign Immunity Under Tribal Law\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Beyond cursory statements claiming it is so, the tribal parties' pending motions for preliminary injunctions and summary judgment in this action do not argue specific tribal law grounds for the invalidity of the Tribe's waiver of sovereign immunity in the Independent Contractor Agreement. (Pl.'s Mot. 32, ECF No. 54; Pl.'s First Summ. J. Mot. 29, ECF No. 52; Pl.'s Second Summ. J. Mot. 43, ECF No. 53.) The tribal parties' specific assertions of tribal law are in their appendix and were raised at oral argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   The tribal parties state that the Tribe is governed by a six-member body known as the Uintah and Ouray Tribal Business Committee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   art. III, \u00a7 1 Constitution and By-Laws of the Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation. (App'x 61, ECF No. 55-1.) The Tribal By-Laws provide that \"[n]o tribal business shall be transacted\" except through a majority vote of a quorum of the Business Committee.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   By-Laws, art. VI, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 5; ECF No. 55-1 at 71.) Only the Chairman of the Tribal Business Committee (and the Vice-Chairman in the Chairman's absence and when called upon to preside) can individually exercise authority to transact tribal business as delegated by the Business Committee.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   By-Laws, art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 1-2; ECF No. 55-1 at 69.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   The tribal parties argue that Business Committee Resolution 05-147, which references Becker's Independent Contractor Agreement and was adopted on April 27, 2005, does not contain an express waiver of the Tribe's sovereign immunity. (App'x. 89, ECF No. 55-1; Feb. 28 Hrg. Tr. 86-89, ECF No. 111.) Resolution 05-147 states that the Business Committee in Tribal Ordinance 01-007 enacted a long-term Financial Plan for the Tribe and that a referendum vote of the membership of the Tribe on December 20, 2001 ratified and approved the Financial Plan. (App'x 89, ECF No. 55-1.) As part of the Financial Plan, the Business Committee designated a nine-member Venture Fund Board. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Business Committee passed Tribal Ordinance 03.003 to restructure the Energy and Minerals Department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thereafter, the Venture Fund Board recommended that Mr. Becker be engaged as an Independent Consultant to implement Tribal Ordinance 03.003 under the terms and conditions of the Independent Contractor Agreement attached as Exhibit A to Resolution 05-147. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   The resolution goes on to state that the Business Committee determined that it should accept the Venture Fund Board's\n   recommendation, that it specifically agreed to enter into the attached Independent Contractor Agreement, and that it authorized the Business Committee Chairman to execute any document necessary to carry out the resolution consistent with the By-Laws. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The certified version of Resolution 05-147, provided by the tribal parties in their appendix, is stamped as Resolution 05-147 and includes Becker's 13-page Independent Contractor Agreement, including its Services and Participation Plan attachments A and B, each page of which is also stamped with the same resolution number, and included the separately-stamped and numbered Ordinance 03.003 as attachment C.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 89-112.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   Article 23 of Resolution 05-147 bears the title Limited Waiver of Sovereign Immunity; Submission to Jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 98.) In it, the Tribe agrees to a limited waiver of its sovereign immunity defense relating to the interpretation, breach, or enforcement of the agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Tribe also waived tribal law requirements for exhaustion of tribal remedies.

Article 23 concluded as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-197\">\n   The Tribe's limited waiver of sovereign immunity shall be further evidenced by a Tribal Resolution delivered at the time of execution of this Agreement in accordance with Tribal laws, that expressly authorizes the foregoing submission to jurisdiction of the courts so designated and the execution of this Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As stated above, the contract itself was stamped as a part of Resolution 05-147.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   The tribal parties' argument is simple. They claim that \u00a7 1-8-5 of the Ute Law and Order Code requires that any resolution or ordinance of the Business Committee that waives the Tribe's sovereign immunity\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-200\">\n   be clear, unequivocal and express. All waivers must be contained within a resolution or ordinance\n   <em>\n    and cannot be made by reference to a contract, agreement, memorandum of agreement, memorandum of understanding or other writing\n   </em>\n   ... Sovereign immunity cannot be waived by any official, director, employee, or agent of the Ute Indian Tribe. The provisions of this Section 1-8-5 replace and supersede any other conflicting provisions of the Ute Law and Order Code, specifically ... Ordinance No. 98-002.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   (App'x 44-45, ECF 55-1 (emphasis added).) The tribal parties argue that, because Becker's Independent Contractor Agreement was identified as an exhibit in Resolution\n   05-147, the resolution itself did not make or authorize a valid waiver of sovereign immunity under tribal law. Thus, they argue it was an ultra vires act of the Business Committee and Chairman Natchees, who signed the contract. (Feb. 28 Hrg. Tr. 86-89, ECF No. 111.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   Interestingly enough, the version of \u00a7 1-8-5 that the tribal parties rely upon was amended by Tribal Ordinance 14-001 adopted on January 7, 2014. (App'x 44-45, ECF 55-1.) In effect at the time Resolution 05-147 was adopted was the version of \u00a7 1-8-5 attached to the tribal parties' complaint. It does not refer to the \"no incorporation by reference\" argument and simply states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-203\">\n   Except as required by federal law, or the Constitution and Bylaws of the Ute Indian Tribe, or as specifically waived by a resolution or ordinance of the Business Committee specifically referring to such, the Ute Indian Tribe shall be immune from suit in any civil action, and its officers and employees immune from suit for any liability arising from the performance of their official duties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Compl.\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 2-6 at 5.) Thus, the tribal parties argue either that a 2014 Ordinance should govern interpretation of a 2005 Resolution or that a 2014 Ordinance should govern interpretation of the 2005 version of Law and Order Code \u00a7 1-8-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   The parties have identified two prior Tribal Court opinions that interpret waivers of sovereign immunity under the version of \u00a7 1-8-5 in effect at the time Resolution 05-147 was adopted and the contract was executed. The first case is\n   <em>\n    Toole v. Ute Water Settlement Accounting Services, LLC\n   </em>\n   , Case No. CV-09-081, Ute Indian Tribal Court, Ruling and Order dated August 10, 2010. (App'x 653, ECF No. 122-4, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   <em>\n    Toole\n   </em>\n   came before the Tribal Court on defendant's motion to dismiss the action for lack of jurisdiction. Defendant was a limited liability company wholly owned by Ute Enterprises, LLC, and established under Ordinance 01-007 as amended by Ordinance 06-005. Defendant's Executive Director, Roseline Taveapont, had entered into an employment contract with Mr. Toole. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 653-54.) The contract was not signed by the Chairman of the Business Committee and was apparently authorized only by a letter that stated, \"the Business Committee has authorised [sic] by motion the use of a Service Contract to be funded out of the CEO's contract.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 654.) The contract specifically stated that \"[a]ny dispute under this Agreement shall be first heard in the Tribal Court for the Ute Indian Tribe.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   After Toole's employment was terminated, he brought an action in Tribal Court to enforce the contract. Defendant's motion to dismiss argued that under Ordinance 87-04, (the same Ordinance in effect at the time Becker's Independent Contractor Agreement was executed), the Tribal Court lacked jurisdiction to hear Toole's claims against the Tribe, its Business Committee, or Tribal officers or employees in their official capacities. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 655.) Defendant also argued that the Tribal Court lacked jurisdiction because the Tribe had not waived its sovereign immunity in Toole's contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 655.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   After first concluding that the Tribe's sovereign immunity extends to sub-entities and enterprises of the Tribe,\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Tribal Court reviewed federal law to determine\n   that a valid waiver of the Tribe's sovereign immunity must be express, clear, and unequivocal and that it cannot be waived by company \"officials.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 658-59.) It also concluded that under \u00a7 1-8-5 of the Ute Law and Order Code (the same version in effect at the time Becker's Independent Contractor Agreement was executed), \"only the Ute Tribal Business Committee may waive immunity by passing a resolution or ordinance which specifically refers to the express waiver.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 660.) Nothing in the employment contract itself mentioned a waiver of sovereign immunity; instead, Toole relied on contract language stating the availability of fees in actions and choice-of-law provisions to imply a waiver, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 661), along with his own honestly held belief that Defendant's Executive Director waived sovereign immunity on behalf of the Tribe, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 662).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   The Tribal Court noted that while the Business Committee had authorized hiring Toole as part of its usual hiring practices as the chief executive body, those practices did not consist of a specific resolution waiving the Tribe's immunity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 661.) It then went on to say:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-210\">\n   [T]he Law and Order Code sets forth a very specific standard when executive actions are accompanied by a waiver of the Tribe's immunity. No resolution was passed specifically authorizing the waiver. Nothing in the transaction resembled what Defendant asserts is the normal process for waiving immunity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-211\">\n   <em>\n    The actions of the Business Committee were not similar to those it undertakes when the Tribe waives immunity in matters involving Ute Oil, LLC. There, the Business Committee waives immunity by passing a resolution or ordinance which specifically refers to the express waiver as is required by U.L.O.C. \u00a7 1-8-5\n   </em>\n   . Defendant has failed provided [sic] any evidence that the Business Committee even reviewed the Agreement or knew of its specific content. How can the Court find a waiver when the record is bereft of evidence that the Business Committee considered immunity and elected to waive the same?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 661-62 (emphasis added).) As a result of this reasoning, the Tribal Court found that it lacked jurisdiction and dismissed the action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 662.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   The second case is\n   <em>\n    Yazzie v. Ute Indian Tribe\n   </em>\n   , Case No. CV-09-188, Ute Indian Tribal Court, Ruling dated February 14, 2011. (App'x 243, ECF No. 122-5, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.)\n   <em>\n    Yazzie\n   </em>\n   was before the Tribal Court on the Tribe and Business Committee Defendants' motion to alter or amend its previous ruling that the Tribe waived its sovereign immunity in a contract with a Chief Judge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In\n   <em>\n    Yazzie\n   </em>\n   , Defendants argued that the 2010\n   <em>\n    Toole\n   </em>\n   decision established precedent that the Tribal Court lacked jurisdiction because Resolution 07-329 did not contain an express, unequivocal waiver of the Tribe's sovereign immunity and that the contract's enforcement clause did not establish a waiver. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   The Tribal Court found that \"Resolution 07-329 was clear beyond doubt that the\n   contract being incorporated by reference was the Chief Judge Contract.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 244.) Further, it found that \"[t]he resolution authorized the Chairman of the Business Committee to execute all documents necessary to carry out the intent and purpose of the resolution.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The contract was signed by the Business Committee Chairman and certified by the Business Committee Secretary as adopted \"under the authority of the Constitution and By-Laws of the Ute Indian Tribe.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After analyzing the law on incorporation by reference, the Tribal Court concluded that the Chief Judge Contract was a valid contract incorporated into and made a part of Resolution 07-329. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   The Tribal Court ultimately granted the motion to alter the previous ruling but on alternative grounds, not on\n   <em>\n    Toole\n   </em>\n   . The Chief Judge contract contained an \"Enforcement of Contract clause that irrevocably granted to the Ute Tribal Court jurisdiction to hear and decide any and all breach of contract or other claims.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 245) (internal quotations omitted). Tribal Ordinance 87-04, still in place at the time, thus became an issue, because it \"divests the Tribal Court of jurisdiction over claims against the Ute Indian Tribe and Tribal Business Committee.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) While the Tribal Court acknowledged that \"[t]he Business Committee has authority to waive sovereign immunity by a resolution,\" which incorporates the contract by reference into the resolution,\n   <em>\n    Yazzie\n   </em>\n   held that under the Tribe's Constitution and By-Laws it takes a Tribal Ordinance, not a resolution or contract, \"to amend the Law and Order Code to restore the Ute Tribal Court's jurisdiction over claims brought against the Tribe and its officers.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   <em>\n    First Tribal Court Order\n   </em>\n   . On December 18, 2017, Judge Weathers in the parties' Tribal Court action concluded that under\n   <em>\n    Yazzie\n   </em>\n   's reasoning, the requirements of \u00a7 1-8-5 of the Law and Order Code were met. (Order 2, ECF No. 91-5, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) First, while acknowledging the language in\n   <em>\n    Toole\n   </em>\n   that a resolution itself must specifically refer to the waiver of sovereign immunity\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   Judge Weathers stated that the \"incorporation by reference\" reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Yazzie\n   </em>\n   supports the meaning of \"specifically referring to such\" in \u00a7 1-8-5 of the Law and Order Code. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) Second, Judge Weathers reviewed the meeting minutes of the Business Committee immediately before adoption of Resolution 05-147 and noted that there was a discussion \"about Article 23, the applicability of Utah law to the contract, and whether any dispute could go to tribal court first before state or federal court.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.) Because this discussion \"satisfied the purpose behind the 'specifically referring to such' language in Section 1-8-5,\" which he concluded was to ensure the Business Committee knows it is waiving the Tribe's sovereign immunity when it adopts a given resolution, Judge Weathers concluded that the language adopting Becker's Independent Contractor Agreement on the first page of Resolution 05-147 itself was sufficient to satisfy \u00a7 1-8-5\n   of the Ute Law and Order Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   As previously related, the tribal parties moved to reconsider this decision on December 28, 2017, and Judge Weathers notified the parties on January 4, 2018, that he was no longer the judge assigned to the case. (ECF No. 70-18, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   <em>\n    Second Tribal Court Decision\n   </em>\n   . At oral argument in Tribal Court on February 16, 2018, the tribal parties argued that the court should find the waiver of sovereign immunity invalid because \"the facts here are identical to the facts in\n   <em>\n    Toole.\n   </em>\n   \" (Hrg. Tr. 94, ECF No. 122-8, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) This is incorrect. First, here the Business Committee passed a resolution to accept Becker's attached Independent Contractor Agreement. There was no resolution at all in\n   <em>\n    Toole\n   </em>\n   . Second, the agreement here, each page of which was stamped with the same 05-147 resolution number as the first page of the resolution, contained an explicit waiver of sovereign immunity in Article 23. In\n   <em>\n    Toole\n   </em>\n   , the contract specifically provided for jurisdiction first in Tribal Court and did not, as here, explicitly waive tribal exhaustion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   The tribal parties also argued that\n   <em>\n    Yazzie\n   </em>\n   , as a tribal court level case, has no precedential value, unlike an appellate level case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 95.)\n   <em>\n    Toole\n   </em>\n   , however, was also a tribal court level case, a point the tribal parties omit. In the February 28 oral argument in this action, the tribal parties further argued that because the court in\n   <em>\n    Yazzie\n   </em>\n   found that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, its substantive ruling on how \u00a7 1-8-5 is satisfied by a resolution incorporating a contract by reference is not binding authority. (Feb. 28 Hrg. Tr. 110, ECF No. 111.) The court cannot overlook that under that reasoning, neither is\n   <em>\n    Toole\n   </em>\n   binding authority for the tribal parties' argument here, because the\n   <em>\n    Toole\n   </em>\n   court similarly found it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the action.\n   <em>\n    Toole\n   </em>\n   held that the Tribe's sovereign immunity extends to tribal LLCs. It was incidental to that holding that the\n   <em>\n    Toole\n   </em>\n   court noted the Business Committee waives sovereign immunity for tribal LLCs \"by passing a resolution or ordinance which specifically refers to the express waiver as is required by U.L.O.C. \u00a7 1-8-5,\" and that in\n   <em>\n    Toole\n   </em>\n   \"[n]o resolution was passed specifically authorizing the waiver.\" (App'x 661-662, ECF No. 122-4, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.)\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barela\n   </em>\n   , 797 F.3d at 1191 (defining dicta as \"statements and comments in an opinion concerning some rule of law or legal proposition not necessarily involved nor essential to determination of the case in hand\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Rohrbaugh v.

Furthermore, the tribal parties are simply incorrect. A court \"always [has] jurisdiction to determine [its own] jurisdiction,\" and that includes making conclusions of law based on \"jurisdictional facts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez-Alarcon v.

It could only have been applying the 2014 version of \u00a7 1-8-5, however, because it stated that \"it was insufficient under Section 1-8-5 for a contract containing a waiver of immunity to be simply appended to a resolution or ordinance if the resolution or ordinance does not itself expressly authorize a waiver of sovereign immunity\n   <em>\n    within the text of the resolution or ordinance\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 (emphasis added).) Because Becker's Independent Contractor Agreement actually contained an explicit waiver of sovereign immunity and was stamped as Resolution 05-147 as was the first page of the resolution that gave authority for and accepted the agreement, this decision appears to be clear error under the version of \u00a7 1-8-5 in effect at the time. The court is not persuaded that this portion of the February 28 Opinion can stand on appeal through the Tribal appellate courts. Thus, the court declines to give comity to the decision or weigh it in favor of the tribal parties' likelihood of success on the invalidity of the waiver of sovereign immunity under tribal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     The Ute Business Committee's Pattern and Practice Affirmed the Validity of the Waiver\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   In further support of this conclusion, to the extent such materials are provided in the record, the court has examined the tribal parties' pattern and practice during the time period prior to the Tribe's adoption of the 2014 version of \u00a7 1-8-5. For example, on March 31, 2005, the Ute Business Committee adopted Resolution 05-116 authorizing the execution of the Operating Agreement of Ute Energy. (App'x 109, ECF No. 55-2.) The Operating Agreement contained the following waiver:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-225\">\n   19.9\n   <em>\n    Waiver of Sovereign Immunity\n   </em>\n   . The Company hereby waives any sovereign immunity it may have by reason of the character of its Members or otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   (Op. Agr. 46, ECF No. 79-1, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) The Business Committee did not expressly state this waiver within the four corners of Resolution 05-116, yet the tribal parties have not challenged its validity under tribal law nor the authority of the Chairman of the Business Committee to enter into the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   Again on June 26, 2007, the Ute Business Committee adopted Resolution 07-183, approving and authorizing the execution of the Amended and Restated Operating Agreement of Ute Energy. (App'x 117, ECF No. 55-2.) That Operating Agreement contained a very broad waiver of sovereign immunity that the Business Committee did not expressly state within the four corners of Resolution 07-183:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-228\">\n   11.1\n   <em>\n    Waiver of Sovereign Immunity\n   </em>\n   . Each of the Company and Ute Holdings hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any sovereign immunity it may have by reason of the character or identify of its members or otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   (Am. Op. Agr. 54, ECF No. 79-2, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) The tribal parties have not challenged the validity of this waiver under tribal law, nor have they challenged the authority of the Chairman of the Business Committee to enter into the agreement. Notably, it does not appear that either Resolution 05-116 or 07-183 included as attachments the documents containing the waivers of sovereign immunity to the resolutions themselves, as was the case in Resolution 05-147 approving and authorizing the execution of the Becker Independent Contractor Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   As another example found within the record, Resolution 06-216 approved and authorized the execution of the Little Canyon EDA with Dominion Exploration &amp; Production, Inc. \"in substantially the same form as that attached to this Resolution as Exhibit A.\" (App'x 75, ECF No. 55-2, Case No. 2:16-cv-579.) While the record refers to an operating agreement associated with the Dominion EDA, said agreement is not attached to the EDA itself, nor is the EDA stamped with the number of Resolution 06-216. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78.) Whether or not the operating agreement contained a similar limited waiver of sovereign immunity, at a minimum this demonstrates the Business Committee's pattern of approving and executing all manner of agreements based on resolutions that attach the intended documents as exhibits to the resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   Similarly, Resolution 05-283, dated August 30, 2005, approved the FIML Natural Resources LLC, Quester Gas Management Company, and Uintah Basin Field Services, LLC Pipeline Agreements, which are not attached as an exhibit to the resolution nor stamped with the resolution number. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 89-106.) This agreement does not contain a section that expressly waives sovereign immunity, but it does include a section giving original, exclusive jurisdiction to the United States District Court for the District of Utah, or if that court lacks jurisdiction, agreeing instead to arbitration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 103.) Nothing about this effective waiver of tribal sovereignty is mentioned in the four corners of Resolution 05-283, yet the waiver has not been challenged as invalid or lacking Business Committee authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   Resolution 07-124, dated May 2, 2007, approves assignment of the forthcoming SITLA agreements to Ute Energy, even though the final transfer of assignment documents had yet to be created. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 111.) That agreement contained a waiver of sovereign immunity by the State of Utah and the Ute Tribe \"to the extent necessary to allow the enforcement of this Agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 72.) Of course, this waiver was not mentioned in Resolution 07-124, nor has it been challenged as invalid or lacking Business Committee authorization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   The tribal parties' appendix contains several other EDA agreements whose indexes reference the Tribe's waiver of sovereign immunity, but the appendix itself did not include the resolutions authorizing those agreements or the pages of the EDA agreements themselves where the waiver of sovereign immunity is set forth. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20, 33, 53; App'x 239, ECF No. 55-1.) It is reasonable to assume that the indexes to these documents accurately reflect that they contained a waiver of the Tribe's sovereign immunity that was not contained within the four corners of the resolutions accepting the agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   These documents demonstrate that the Tribe had a consistent pattern during the relevant time of authorizing the Ute Business Committee to selectively waive the Tribe's sovereign immunity to enter into\n   commercial agreements by resolutions that did not contain an express waiver of sovereign immunity within the four corners of the document; sometimes failed to mention the words \"sovereign immunity\" but instead agreed to original and exclusive jurisdiction in a non-tribal court or arbitration; did not stamp the attached document waiving sovereign immunity to the resolution with the same number as the resolution; or did not even include the document that waived sovereign immunity as an attachment to the resolution at all. Given this pattern and practice, the court concludes that, of those that the court reviewed, Resolution 05-147 was the most thorough waiver of sovereign immunity the Ute Business Committee issued between 2005 and 2007. It referred to the Independent Contractor Agreement specifically in the resolution, the Agreement was actually attached to the resolution, the Agreement was stamped with the same resolution number, and the Agreement itself had a three-paragraph Article 23 setting forth clear terms of the tribal parties' waiver of sovereign immunity and submission to jurisdiction elsewhere for disputes over the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   It is true that the tribal parties have submitted 2010 and 2011 resolutions in which the Ute Tribal Business Committee waived the Tribe's sovereign immunity within the four corners of the resolutions themselves. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. L, ECF No. 14-12.) The first, Resolution 10-085, specifically waives sovereign immunity for the benefit of JP Morgan Chase in relation to entering into a $65 million loan transaction involving Ute Energy that was attached and incorporated to the resolution. The second, Resolution 11-328, specifically waives sovereign immunity for the benefit of RBC Capital Markets for margin trading and leveraging of the same account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   Notwithstanding the 2010 and 2011 resolutions that waive sovereign immunity consistent with the Tribe's current version of Law and Order Code \u00a7 1-8-5, the court has found no evidence that between 2005 and 2007, the relevant time period, the tribal parties have a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that at the time Resolution 05-147 was adopted in 2005, \u00a7 1-8-5 of the Ute Law and Order code required the resolution to identify the waiver within the four corners of the resolution itself. Therefore, the court concludes that the Becker Independent Contractor Agreement validly waived the tribal parties' sovereign immunity and was not an ultra vires act of the Ute Business Committee in 2005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Contract Is Valid Under Other Tribal Law\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   Finally, the court considers the tribal parties' arguments that the Tribe's Section 17 Corporate Charter invalidates the Becker Independent Contractor Agreement. First, however, the court reiterates that in section I.2.C.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , it concluded that the Ute Business Committee did not act ultra vires in approving Becker's Independent Contractor Agreement under either the Tribe's Constitution or Charter because the contract does not involve restricted trust property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   Second, the tribal parties' final argument is that one provision of the Tribe's\n   Corporate Charter prohibited the Ute Business Committee from entering the Becker Independent Contractor Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Second Exp. Mot. 32-33, ECF No. 53; Pl. Reply 8-9 &amp; 20, ECF No. 101; Feb. 28 Hrg. Tr. 141-43, App'x 81-90, ECF No. 122-8, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) The tribal parties' argument relies on art. VI, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 1(f) of the Tribe's Constitution. Section 1 limits the exercise of the Business Committee's powers as required by the United States Constitution and/or statutes as well as by the \"express restrictions upon such powers contained in [the Tribe's] Constitution and By-Laws.\" (App'x 62, ECF No. 55-1.) Section 1(f) authorizes the Business Committee \"[t]o regulate all economic affairs and enterprises\n   <em>\n    in accordance with the terms of a Charter\n   </em>\n   that may be issued to the Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation by the Secretary of the Interior.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 63 (emphasis added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   The Charter referred to was authorized by section 17 of the Indian Reorganization Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20477\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and approved by the Secretary of the Interior on January 19, 1937, under section 16 of the Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20476\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App'x 74, ECF No. 55-1.) Section 5 of the Charter identifies the powers and limitations of the corporation, section 5(f) of which states that the Business Committee is authorized\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-241\">\n   [t]o make and perform contracts and agreements of every description, not inconsistent with law or with any provisions of this Charter, with any person ...\n   <em>\n    Provided\n   </em>\n   , That all contracts entered into ...requiring payment of money by the corporation ... shall not exceed $10,000 in total amount except with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   The tribal parties argue that because Becker's contract was for value greater than $10,000, it required approval from the Secretary of the Interior. (Pl. Second Exp. Mot. 32, ECF No. 53.) Interestingly, in the state court action, the tribal parties vigorously objected to Becker's characterization of his suit as also being against the Tribe's Section 17 Corporation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 12 at 55-58.) More recently, the tribal parties state that \"[i]n the initial stages of the state court litigation, the Tribe's attorneys mistakenly believed that the Tribe's federally-chartered corporation was defunct.\" (Pl.'s Reply 9, ECF No. 101.) The court notes, however, that even the tribal parties' expert, Pilar Thomas, opines that Sec. 5(b)(1) relates to the Business Committee \"mak[ing] or perform[ing\n   ] agreements greater than $10,000\n   <em>\n    that will be paid by the corporation\n   </em>\n   without Secretarial approval.\" (App'x 216, ECF No. 55-2 (emphasis added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   This court finds no evidence in Resolution 05-147, including Becker's Independent Contractor Agreement or the associated Operating Agreements, that demonstrates the Tribe's Section 17 Corporation was a party to these contracts. (App'x 89-112, ECF No. 55-1 and ECF Nos. 79-1, 79-2 &amp; 79-3, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) As a result, the court finds that the tribal parties are unlikely to succeed on the merits of the contract's invalidity under the Charter or the Constitution that requires compliance with the Charter because there is no evidence of involvement by the Section 17 Corporation. This reasoning is consistent with prior precedent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ute Distrib. Corp. v. Ute Indian Tribe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1362769,7345927\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/149/1260/\">\n    149 F.3d 1260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 1998) (remanding to district court to determine whether the tribal corporate entity or the Ute Tribe itself was the proper defendant);\n   <em>\n    Kenai Oil &amp; Gas, Inc. v.

Pursuant to the Tenth Circuit's mandate, this court has been required to analyze whether the tribal parties are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims. This court concludes that federal law does not preclude state-court jurisdiction because Congress granted subject matter jurisdiction to Utah in these circumstances under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201321\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 1326, because the Becker Independent Contractor Agreement is valid under federal and tribal law, and because the tribal parties' selective waiver of sovereign immunity in the valid contract consented to the state's exercise of that jurisdiction. As a result, the court concludes the tribal parties are also bound by the Agreement's Article 23 provision that waives any requirement for tribal exhaustion. That provision states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-246\">\n   and the Tribe waives any requirement of Tribal law stating that Tribal courts have exclusive original jurisdiction over all matters involving the Tribe\n   <em>\n    and waives any requirement that such Legal Proceedings be brought in Tribal Court or that Tribal remedies be exhausted\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   (App'x 99, ECF No. 55-1) (emphasis added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   This exhaustion waiver, in conjunction with the other provisions of Article 23 that designate \"original and exclusive jurisdiction,\" (App'x 98-99, ECF No. 55-1), to other courts of competent jurisdiction-of which the Utah state court is one-removes this case from the tribal exhaustion policy pronouncements in\n   <em>\n    National Farmers Union Insurance Companies. v.

Lawrence from proceeding in the state court matter of\n   <em>\n    Becker v. Ute Indian Tribe\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 140908394, Third Judicial District Court, Salt Lake County. This court has concluded that the state court has subject matter jurisdiction over the parties' claims because Utah accepted the federal government's offer of jurisdiction in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201322\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), because the Tribe selectively waived its sovereign immunity in Resolution 05-147 properly under tribal law, and because the contract does not involve restricted property held in trust for the Tribe by the United States. Additionally, the court has concluded that the Tribal Court's February 28 Opinion should not be given preclusive effect and that tribal exhaustion is futile. Because the tribal parties cannot succeed on the merits, the court need not analyze the other elements necessary to grant a preliminary injunction motion, and the motion is DENIED. (ECF No. 54.) The court summarizes its rulings herein as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   1. The court DENIES the tribal parties' motions for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the state court action. (ECF No. 54 and the injunction portions of ECF Nos. 52 &amp; 53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   2.

(ECF No. 110.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   5. The court DENIES as MOOT the tribal parties' motion to strike the Declaration of Lynn Becker and its exhibits B-B-5 in Becker's opposition to the tribal parties' preclusion motion because the court did not consider those materials. (ECF No. 124.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   6. The court GRANTS the tribal parties' motion for leave to supplement legal authority. (ECF No. 133.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   7.

While other sections speak to special election requirements for broader Indian acceptance of state jurisdiction, this section speaks to the narrower grounds under which the Utah courts have jurisdiction by \"each resolution ceding jurisdiction to the state, both as to geographical area and subject matter,\" such as the Becker contract.

This is critical because under Ordinance 87-04, the Tribal Court only had subject matter jurisdiction over employees, not independent contractors.

Can any Ute Tribal Court exhaust the question of whether the Tribe has validly waived its sovereign immunity and decide that against the Tribe's interest? It appears not, because the Tribal Court has no jurisdiction to do so. The tribal parties suggest that in this circumstance provisions in the Tribe's Constitution or By-Laws allow the Tribal Business Committee to decide-or delegate the decision to an entity other than the Business Committee-which, even if true would not provide an adequate solution to this problem. These due process concerns support this court's conclusion that it should not give preclusive effect to the February 28 Opinion. In light of this conclusion, it would be futile in the companion case for this court to defer to the Tribal Court to exhaust the issue of its own jurisdiction. Additionally, because Becker's claims against the tribal parties are expressly precluded by \u00a7 1-2-3(4) of Ordinance 87-04 and \u00a7 1-2-3(5) of Ordinance 13-010, the Tribal Court also had no jurisdiction to determine that Becker is not entitled to the 2% of net revenue distributed to Ute Energy Holding from Ute Energy that he is seeking in the state, federal, and Tribal Court actions.

(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 18, ECF No. 2, Case No. 2:17-cv-1064.) In 2012, Crescent Point acquired Ute Energy Upstream and merged it into Crescent Point at which time Crescent Point began receiving the working interest payments under the EDA. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 19-20.) Newfield now alleges that Crescent Point has breached its terms and obligations under the EDA by refusing to allow its acquisition of 65% of the fee mineral leases it is entitled to under the agreement. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 22.) These allegations do not give the court confidence in the tribal parties' assertions that the oil and gas ventures begun in the transactions at issue in this action were a failure. (\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 53, Case No. 2:16-cv-579.) Additionally, Crescent Point's answer and counterclaim do not deny the allegation that the Ute Indian Tribe and the Ute Distribution Corporation do not need to be parties to the suit, even though the original parties to the EDA included them as well as Newfield and Ute Energy. (Compl. \u00b6 16, ECF No. 2; Answ. \u00b6 16, ECF No. 22, Case No. 2:17-cv-1064.) Based on these assertions, the court understands that the Tribe entered into the EDA (after receiving approval from the Secretary of the Interior) and then assigned it to Ute Energy. In preparation for the liquidation of Ute Energy (under the Amended and Restated Operating Agreement at issue here, though irrelevant to this case), the EDA was assigned to Ute Energy Upstream Holdings, LLC in 2010 in exchange for value. During Upstream's merger with Crescent Point in 2012, Crescent Point became the successor-in-interest of the EDA and began receiving the working interest payments under the EDA. If this complicated set of transactions involving payments on the EDA's working interest does not raise questions of Indian trust property requiring participation of the Ute Indian Tribe in the lawsuit, it is difficult to believe that the tribal parties in this action did not fully understand that Becker's 2% \"net revenue\" interest compensation implicated anything other than similar profits from their working interest in the underlying EDAs and not trust property.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"34\">\n   <p id=\"p-307\">\n    Between the issuance of the court's tentative ruling and publication of this opinion, the tribal parties moved to supplement the record with 700-plus additional pages of materials from the tribal court action.

So in other words, the tribe, as the landowner, got its royalties and severance packs.\n    <em>\n     And those were not put into Ute Energy, LLC.\n    </em>\n    \" (App'x 47, ECF No. 122-8, Case No. 2:16-cv-958 (emphasis added).) The tribal parties also admitted that Mr. Becker's agreement specifically excluded payments attributable to restricted trust property:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-315\">\n    THE COURT: And Mr. Becker's agreement specifically excluded those kinds of payments?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-316\">\n    MS. BASSETT: Yes.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-317\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) These admissions made in oral argument to the Tribal Court, while perhaps made in an attempt by counsel to simplify, expose that the oral argument and briefs in this court did not accurately represent the complexity of the transactions and the character of the proceeds at issue. When faced with this issue at the April 13, 2018 hearing on the tentative ruling, the tribal parties argued that they had previously disclosed to this court that Ute Energy was capitalized with only the working interest portion of the Energy and Development Agreements, (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Feb. 28 Hrg. Tr. 33-34, 54; ECF No. 111). They then argued that even if Ute Energy was not capitalized by trust assets, the net revenue distributed from Ute Energy to Ute Energy Holdings, of which Becker was to receive 2%, should be defined under standard oil and gas principles. In their view, net revenue must then necessarily be derived from production of the Tribe's mineral resources, which requires the Independent Contractor Agreement to receive separate approval from the Secretary of the Interior under the Indian Mineral Development Act at\n    <extracted-citation index=\"287\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202102\">\n     25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2102\n    </extracted-citation>\n    or the Indian Non-Intercourse Act at\n    <extracted-citation index=\"288\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20177\">\n     25 U.S.C. \u00a7 177\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . (Apr. 13 Hrg. Tr. 36-43, ECF No. 132.) The court addresses this argument in the immediately following paragraphs.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"42\">\n   <p id=\"p-318\">\n    For example, Congress anticipated that this law would allow an Indian tribe to \"pledge or hypothecate its interest in tribal mineral resources [for] prospective production, products or proceeds of such minerals ... as security for the repayment of loans or other advances to permit the tribe to develop its mineral resources.\" (\"United States House of Representatives Report No. 97-746\" 183, ECF No. 55-2.) Tribal mineral interests to be severed from the land or pledged as security for future production, of course, require approval from the Secretary of the Interior.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"289\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20177\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"43\">\n   <p id=\"p-319\">\n    These provisions of the operating agreements undermine the tribal parties' argument that \"the Tribe's interest in the value of Ute Energy was based exclusively on the ... net mineral acres that were assigned to Ute Energy\" and then \"distributed back to the Tribe after the liquidation of Ute Energy.\" (Apr. 13 Hrg. Tr. 38, ECF No. 132.) Here, the tribal parties seem to revert to the argument that Becker cannot be entitled to a 2% distribution of the appreciated value of Ute Energy distributed to Ute Energy Holdings because \"it's a return of the assets themselves which are trust assets.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) The tribal parties are incorrect. The operating agreements are carefully structured such that the return of the assets themselves does not trigger a distribution of net revenue from Ute Energy to Ute Energy Holdings, so the appreciation and other profits constituting net revenue under the agreements are neither trust assets nor restricted property. Furthermore, even if they were, the tribal parties stated that, when \"the money enters into general commerce,\" a Tribe can use proceeds from trust assets without getting secretarial approval. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 36.) The appreciation and/or profit distributed from Ute Energy to Ute Energy Holdings were not direct proceeds of trust property, mineral production, or other restricted property, but rather money that entered the Tribe's general commerce.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"44\">\n   <p id=\"p-320\">\n    To the extent the tribal parties' experts opined otherwise, the court did not find those opinions persuasive. The court appreciates, however, that at oral argument the tribal parties' expert, Mr. Wozniak, acknowledged that his opinion about the meaning of \"net revenue interest\" was given in the context of his familiarity with oil and gas leases and that he had not been given or reviewed the Operating Agreements at issue here, which he acknowledged could influence his definition of the term.

(App'x at 657, ECF No. 122-4, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) This analysis was necessary because Defendant LLC was established under the Ute Indian Tribe Limited Liability Act of 1998, which expressly stated that \"[t]he sovereign immunity of the Ute Indian Tribe shall not extend to limited liability companies formed under this Title.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 660.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"50\">\n   <p id=\"p-326\">\n    It is worth noting that\n    <em>\n     Yazzie\n    </em>\n    was dismissed with prejudice because Tribal Ordinance 87-04 precluded the Tribal Court's jurisdiction over the Tribe and its Business Committee, while at the same time the valid contract limited jurisdiction exclusively to the Tribal Court. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 245-46.) This is inconsistent with the usual dismissal\n    <em>\n     without\n    </em>\n    prejudice, when a court lacks jurisdiction, to allow the claimant to raise his or her claims in a court of competent jurisdiction. Plaintiff was effectively denied a forum. Becker alleges this is the outcome sought by the tribal parties here.

There's only one line that says 'Article 23,' and it doesn't explain what Article 23 does.\" (Feb. 16 Hrg. Tr. 93, ECF No. 122-8, Case No. 2:16-cv-958.) The February 28 Opinion states that \"nothing in the April 27, 2015 [sic] minutes\" shows that the Business Committee read the Independent Contractor Agreement, and that they \"are absent of any mention about sovereign immunity.\" (ECF No. 108-1 at 10.) This is far from undisputed, and the record reflects that Becker has yet to receive discovery of additional minutes from meetings that discussed the negotiations and understanding of contract terms.
