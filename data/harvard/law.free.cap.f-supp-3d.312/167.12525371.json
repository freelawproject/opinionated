Compl. [ECF No. 1] \u00b6 1. Plaintiffs allege that the Corps' failure to prepare an adequate FEIS violated the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (\"NEPA\"), the Water Resources Development Act (\"WRDA\"), and the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"); and that the Record of Decision authorizing the Corps' update violated NEPA, the WRDA, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, and the APA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs designated this case as related to another lawsuit filed in this district by Alabama,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alabama v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-607-JDB (D.D.C.) (the \"\n   <em>\n    Alabama\n   </em>\n   case\"); Pls.' Notice of Related Case [ECF No. 5] at 1, which alleges that the Corps violated the APA, NEPA, and the Water Supply Act of 1958 by issuance of the Master WCM and the FEIS. Georgia and a group of Georgia Water Supply Providers intervened in both cases and moved to transfer the cases to the Northern District of Georgia, or alternatively to the Southern District of Alabama.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Georgia's Mot. to Transfer [ECF No. 34] at 1; Georgia Water Supply Providers' Mot. to Transfer [ECF No. 37] at 1. The\n   government defendants \"support transfer of venue to any district in the Eleventh Circuit where venue is otherwise proper.\" Gov't's Notice of Concurrence [ECF No. 38] at 1. This Court has now issued a memorandum opinion and order granting the motions to transfer the\n   <em>\n    Alabama\n   </em>\n   case to the Northern District of Georgia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order,\n   <em>\n    Alabama v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs\n   </em>\n   , [ECF No. 40] at 1; Mem. Op.,\n   <em>\n    Alabama v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs\n   </em>\n   , [ECF No. 41]. For the reasons set forth in the order and memorandum opinion in the\n   <em>\n    Alabama\n   </em>\n   case, and those stated briefly below, the Court concludes that the relevant private- and public-interest factors weigh in favor of transferring this case to the Northern District of Georgia, as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In short, this case involves a localized controversy that has far stronger ties to the states that comprise the ACF Basin-Georgia, Alabama, and Florida-than to the District of Columbia. The rivers, reservoirs, and Corps projects at the center of this dispute are all located within the ACF Basin, as are the people, environments, and commercial interests that will be directly affected by a decision in this case. Decidedly, this controversy will have no real-world impact on this district. Hence, the \"most important factor\"-the \"interest in having localized controversies decided at home\"-strongly weighs in favor of transfer.\n   <em>\n    Western Watersheds Project v.

For instance, plaintiffs highlight that the Apalachicola ecosystem: (1) includes a National Estuarine Research Reserve, (2) has been designated by UNESCO as an International Biosphere Reserve, (3) has been the subject of interest by members of Congress, and (4) has garnered national media attention.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n at 4-17. Yet very similar facts were present in\n    <em>\n     Sierra Club v. Flowers\n    </em>\n    , and the court determined that although the controversy had \"a national aspect,\" transfer was appropriate because the controversy was \"local to Florida and is one in which Florida and its residents have a great interest.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9096927\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/276/62/#p70\">\n     276 F.Supp.2d 62\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 70-71 (D.D.C. 2003) ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n v. Harvey\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5663785\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/437/42/#p47\">\n     437 F.Supp.2d 42\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 47 (D.D.C. 2006) (\"[P]recedent in this circuit does not require or even encourage resolution in this forum of ESA and other environmental claims involving national known resources.\" (citation omitted) ). Indeed, the court in\n    <em>\n     Flowers\n    </em>\n    found that letters from members of Congress underscored the localized nature of the controversy: \"[T]he members of Congress to whose letters the plaintiffs cite all represent Floridians, thereby underscoring the unique importance that the permits hold for residents of Florida.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9096927\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/276/62/#p70\">\n     276 F.Supp.2d at 71\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Plaintiffs' other supposed connections are too attenuated from the decisions challenged here. For example, plaintiffs point to an earlier effort by then-Secretary of Interior Kempthorne to mediate a separate dispute in 2007 and 2008 between Florida, Georgia, and Alabama.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pls.' Opp'n at 10-11. But that dispute did not concern the Master WCMor the FEIS challenged here, which the Corps had not even begun to update at that time. Likewise unavailing is plaintiffs' reliance on a one-day workshop convened by the National Academy of Sciences in 2009.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 11. Plaintiffs do not even allege that the workshop had any effect on the Master WCM. And even if it did, almost all of the Corps officials involved came from Mobile or Atlanta.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
