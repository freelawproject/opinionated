In response to the Complaint, on September 27, 2017, Banco Popular filed a\n   <em>\n    Motion Dismiss [sic] the Complaint to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6)\n   </em>\n   (Docket No. 14). The Plaintiff opposed the motion on December 8\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , 2017 (Docket No. 16). Through its\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   , Banco Popular essentially seeks to dismiss the instant case on the basis that the Plaintiff has failed to state a claim. Specifically, Banco Popular alleges that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201643\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which is the federal law under which this civil action arose, requires that the use of Plaintiff's credit card at issue must be\n   <em>\n    unauthorized.\n   </em>\n   Nonetheless, in the present case, the Plaintiff did not comply with this statutory requirement because he\n   authorized Colondres for the use of his credit card. Consequently as expressed in this Opinion and Order, this Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Banco Popular's\n   <em>\n    Motion To Dismiss\n   </em>\n   (Docket No. 14). The Court explains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June of the year 2016, the Plaintiff agreed to lend his credit card to Colondres, which he was to use for the sole purpose of paying some business debts, ascending only to $3,500. (Docket No. 1 at 2) However, when the Plaintiff received his credit card statement for that same month of June, it showed that Colondres had made transactions over $12,500. (Docket No. 1 at 2) The Plaintiff proceeded to contact Colondres to inquire about the charges, to which Colondres explained that he was to receive some money he was owed soon and then he would pay the Plaintiff back. (Docket No. 1 at 2-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On or before June 28\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , 2016, the Plaintiff contacted Banco Popular because he was to go on vacations to Mexico on June 28\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , 2016. (Docket No. 1 at 3) In these calls, the Plaintiff told the bank representative that he only authorized the transactions that were to be made from Mexico. (Docket No. 1 at 3)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Nevertheless, when the Plaintiff arrived from his vacation on July 11\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , 2016, he learned that Colondres had charged over $31,000 on his credit card. (Docket No. 1 at 3) On July 22\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   , 2016, eleven days later, the Plaintiff visited Banco Popular to inquire about these the charges to his credit card made by Colondres. (Docket No. 1 at 3) It is unclear from the Complaint whether Banco Popular effectively canceled the Plaintiff's credit card. Notwithstanding, the Complaint does state that the Plaintiff proceeded to pay the debt incurred by Colondres on his credit card. (Docket No. 1 at 3)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Afterwards, on July 27\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , 2016, the Plaintiff had filed a criminal complaint against Mr. Colondres. (Docket No. 1 at 3) On this day, the Plaintiff also sent a certified letter to Colondres, in which \"[h]e stated\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   that the unauthorized charges, progressively made by the latter, had topped to $37,035.99 and that if the whole amount was not paid by July 29, 2016, we would take legal action against him.\" (Docket No. 1 at 3) Subsequently, the Plaintiff called Colondres to inquire about the increased expenses. (Docket No. 1 at 3) In response, Colondres again reiterated that he was waiting to receive payment for a debt in order to pay the Plaintiff back. (Docket No. 1 at 3)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 30\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , 2016, the Plaintiff hand-delivered a letter to Banco Popular, in which he:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [A]sked for assistance handling the unauthorized debt, as he always has had good credit, advised Banco Popular on the unauthorized usage of his credit card by Mr. Colondres, as well as the filing of the criminal complaint filed against the latter for said actions, and inquired on Banco Popular's actions on allowing charge to his card, without being notified about it, even when he advised Banco Popular before he went off on vacation on June 28, 2016 that he would be out of Puerto Rico on vacation, and charges were still continually being made from Puerto Rico, and not Mexico.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (Docket No. 1 at p. 3-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   To date, Colondres still owes money to the Plaintiff, even though he paid $2,400.00 to the Plaintiff. (Docket No. 1 at 4)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II.

Application to the Case at Bar\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Co-Defendant Banco Popular states that the Plaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Given that Plaintiff filed a\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   based on the \u00a7 1643, essentially the Plaintiff seeks to argue that he is not to be held liable for the \"unauthorized use\" of his credit card by Colondres. Although the Plaintiff first communicated with Banco Popular to report these \"unauthorized use\" on July 22\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   , 2016, the Plaintiff knew of the incidents since before June 28\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , 2016. Nevertheless, he deliberately omitted to inform Banco Popular of the occurrences. Moreover, the Court is concerned that the Plaintiff had the opportunity to notify Banco Popular of said \"unauthorized use\" when he called before his vacations to Mexico, but-as this Court has pointed out-he opted not to notify the bank. Accordingly, the issue before the Court is whether the Plaintiff's actions and omissions constituted an \"unauthorized use\" in accordance to the applicable law standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Complaint in this instant alleges there were two incidents where the Plaintiff acquired knowledge of the \"unauthorized use\" of the Plaintiff's credit card. First, around June of 2016, the Plaintiff\n   authorized Colondres to charge an amount of $3,500 to settle some debts, but instead Colondres charged around $12,000 on the Plaintiff's credit card to pay off business related debt. Second, about a month later, Colondres charged again around $30,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Court is of the opinion that the Plaintiff gave\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   authorization to Colondres when he charged the first $12,000 because on the month of June 2016 the Plaintiff agreed to let Colondres use his credit card to pay off his debts. Where a credit card is misused for reasons outside of the agreed scope, the plaintiff is \"not entitled to rely on the provisions contained in section 1643(a) and he must be held responsible for any purchases made through the use of his card.\"\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9712698\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/361/597/#p600\">\n    361 So.2d at 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For this reason, the Court finds that the Plaintiff gave actual authorization to Colondres for the first charges up to $12,000, even though Mr. Colondres did not use it for the quantity that was agreed. Consequently, this transaction is not covered by the Act and the allegations should be dismissed accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Court must now determine whether the additional $30,000 transactions made after the first $12,000 were \"unauthorized use\" such that they would fall under the protections of the Act. As previously stated, \"unauthorized use\" is defined as the \"use of a credit card by a person other than the cardholder who does not have actual, implied, or apparent authority for such use and from which the cardholder receives no benefit.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201602\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Also, the statute is clear when it states that: \"[a] cardholder shall be liable for the\n   <strong>\n    unauthorized\n   </strong>\n   use of a credit card only if ... the unauthorized use occurs\n   <strong>\n    before\n   </strong>\n   the card issuer has been notified that an unauthorized use of the credit card has occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201602\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1643 (emphasis added).

In other words, when the Plaintiff called the bank for his trip to Mexico, he never mentioned that Colondres had exceeded his authorization of the credit card use, having the opportunity to then to act. As expressed by the Third Circuit, \"[a] cardholder may, in certain circumstances, vest a fraudulent user with the apparent authority to use a credit card by enabling the continuous payment of the credit card charges over a period of time.\"\n   <em>\n    Azur v.

American Express Travel-Related Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3434109,9151437\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/388/886/\">\n    388 F.3d 886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 889 (D.C. 2004) (\"[T]he cardholder is not liable for unauthorized charges incurred after the cardholder notifies the issuer of the fraud.\") The Plaintiff could have also cancelled his card as soon as he found out that Colondres exceeded his authority to charge $3,500 on his card because as \"[w]here a card issuer permits a cardholder to cancel the card, and thereby any contractual obligation to pay, a cardholder\n   can limit his liability even if unable to regain possession by cancelling his card.\"\n   <em>\n    Towers World Airways\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10541685\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/933/174/#p175\">\n    933 F.2d at 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further,\n   <em>\n    Towers World Airways\n   </em>\n   established \"that by foreclosing card issuers from recovering unauthorized charges from cardholders, section 1643(a)(1) undoubtedly encourages card issuers to facilitate the cancellation of cards once a possible unauthorized use has been reported.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10541685\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/933/174/#p175\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, the Court finds that the charges leading up to $30,000 were\n   <em>\n    apparently authorized\n   </em>\n   , using the statute language, because the Plaintiff knew about the alleged unauthorized charges and had the opportunity to notify the bank about them when he called to notify he was going to travel outside the country.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Nonetheless, this Court has to stress the fact that the Plaintiff executed the required written notice, in accordance to \u00a7 1666(a). In said notice, the Plaintiff \"indicate[d his] belief that the statement contain[ed] a billing error and the amount of such billing error, and [he also] set... forth the reasons for [his] belief (to the extent applicable) that the statement contain[ed] a billing error\" (Docket No. 1 at 3-4). Nevertheless, as this Court stated above, the applicable law defines billing error as the \"reflection on or with a periodic statement of an extension of credit that is not made to the consumer or to a\n   <strong>\n    person who has actual, implied, or apparent authority to use the consumer's credit card\n   </strong>\n   .\" Here, the issue is that the Plaintiff hand-delivered this notice\n   <strong>\n    after\n   </strong>\n   his trip to Mexico and the charges occurred before the Plaintiff's vacations to Mexico. Therefore, \u00a7 1643 protection does not apply to instant case because the use of this credit card was authorized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In regards to the Plaintiff's approach towards the fact that before his trip to Mexico he indicated to Banco Popular that only the payments made from Mexico were to be authorized, the Court does not find reasonable to ask of a Puerto Rican bank to permit only the transactions made from a foreign country. In\n   <em>\n    Towers World Airways\n   </em>\n   , the court understood that \"it is totally unrealistic to burden the card issuer with the obligation to convey to numerous merchants whatever limitations the cardholder has placed on the card user's authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Towers World Airways\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10541685\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/933/174/#p175\">\n    933 F.2d at 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   This Court wishes to distinguish that the Plaintiff with some due diligence hand-delivered the written notice within the period of time that is established by law, in which he informed Banco Popular of the \"unauthorized use\" of his card, and has responsibly paid the debt that Colondres has incurred him in.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Permobil, Inc. v. Am. Express Travel Related Servs. Co\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5713963\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/571/825/\">\n    571 F.Supp.2d 825\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (M.D. Tenn. 2008). However, \"[n]othing in the TILA suggests that Congress intended to sanction intentional or negligent conduct by the cardholder that furthers the fraud or theft of an unauthorized card user.\"\n   <em>\n    Minskoff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7649918\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/98/703/#p708\">\n    98 F.3d at 709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9712698\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/361/597/#p600\">\n    361 So.2d at 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Were we to adopt any other view, we would provide the unscrupulous and dishonest cardholder with the means to defraud the card issuer by allowing his or her friends to use the card, run up hundreds of dollars in charges and then limit his or her liability to $50 by notifying the card issuer.\"). Hence, the notice as to \"unauthorized use\" was in reality provided to the bank\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the $30,000 had been charged to Plaintiff's credit card.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   IV. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Recapitulating, this Court finds that for the first transactions mounting up to $12,000 the Plaintiff gave actual authority to Colondres, regardless of the fact that the co-defendant exceeded the agreed amount to be charged up. In regards to the additional charges, which ascended to\n   approximately $30,000, the Court finds that Colondres had apparent authority because the Plaintiff knew of the alleged \"unauthorized\" transactions since June 2016 but he proceeded to cancel his card at the end of July when it was too late as all the billings were already in transit. In other words, the Plaintiff knew of the alleged \"unauthorized use\" since a month before he notified Banco Popular.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In conclusion, there is no basis in law to deny Banco Popular's\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   for the reasons stated above. Even though the Plaintiff was diligent by hand-delivering the written notice to Banco Popular, he was not diligent enough when he decided to not inform Banco Popular of the alleged \"unauthorized use\" before his vacations to Mexico when he had the opportunity to do so during his phone calls with Banco Popular. For the reasons discussed above, this Court grants co-Defendant's\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   (Docket No. 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Nonetheless, the Court will refrain from issuing a partial judgment at this time.
