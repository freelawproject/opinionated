The Court held a hearing on January 22, 2018. The primary issues are: (i) whether the Administrative Procedure Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20702\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"APA\"), waives sovereign immunity for all of Plaintiff New Mexico Health Connections' claims; (ii) whether incorporating statewide average premiums in Defendant United States Department of Health and Human Services' (\"HHS\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   risk-adjustment formula is contrary to law or arbitrary and capricious; (iii) whether HHS' approach to predicting costs for hierarchal condition category (\"HCC\") and non-HCC eligible enrollees is arbitrary and capricious; (iv) whether HHS' decisions regarding partial year enrollees and the use of prescription drug data in its risk adjustment model are arbitrary and capricious; and (v) whether HHS' risk adjustment formula effectively bans bronze health insurance plans and is contrary to law. The Court concludes that: (i) the APA waives sovereign immunity for all of the claims presented, thereby giving the Court subject-matter jurisdiction; (ii) HHS' use of statewide average premiums in its risk adjustment methodology is not contrary to law, but is arbitrary and capricious; (iii) HHS' approach to predicting costs for HCC and non-HCC eligible enrollees is not arbitrary and capricious; (iv) HHS' decisions regarding partial year enrollees and the use of prescription drug data in its risk adjustment model are not arbitrary and capricious; and (v) HHS' risk adjustment formula does not, in effect, ban bronze health insurance plans. Accordingly, the Health Connection's Motion is granted in part and denied in part. The Defendants' Motion is granted in part and denied in part. The Court sets aside and vacates the agency action as to the statewide\n   average premium rules and remands the case to the agency for further proceedings. It otherwise dismisses Health Connections' remaining claims with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Health Connections seeks APA review of agency action, so rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure does not apply even though both Health Connections and HHS ostensibly filed motions for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Olenhouse v.

Several state insurance commissioners have expressed concern about the risk adjustment program. For example, Maryland's Insurance Commissioner testified to Congress:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Over the past few years, new innovative health insurance plans have been created that are providing enhanced competition and patient care. And it is working. For year-end 2014, Carefirst had a 91% market share of the individual market in Maryland. Today, it is 57%, due in part to a more competitive marketplace. These carriers have the potential to continue but their ability to do so is severely\n   jeopardized by the adverse and perhaps fatal financial impact caused by the technical shortcoming of the current risk adjustment and risk corridor programs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   The risk adjustment formula is of concern to state regulators because it has proven to place newer carriers at a distinct disadvantage. For example, the risk adjustment formula quantifies an enrollee's health status based on age and diagnoses recorded during the course of the year. New carriers have very limited information on the health status or previous claims history of the applicants. Therefore, the carrier's population may appear healthier than it actually is if some diagnoses are not captured which may result in improper risk adjustment payments.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Written Testimony of Mr. Al Redmer, Jr., Commissioner Maryland Insurance Administration at 1 (NMHC001331). The New York Superintendent of Financial Services had similar concerns:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   DFS [Department of Financial Services] is concerned that the risk adjustment program has created inappropriately disparate impacts among health insurance issuers in New York and unintended consequences. Specifically, it is DFS's understanding that, based on the data accumulated by CMS for the upcoming report on June 30, 2016, new and smaller issuers generally are considered to have had relatively healthy members than their larger and more established competitors. CMS's anticipated determination appears to be unduly impacted by the dates of diagnoses or recording of diagnoses of members' medical conditions rather than actual relative health of the members. This disparity may be because the new and smaller health insurers have not been in operation long enough to have amassed the long term data and records management systems that have helped to allow the large, established health insurers to convince CMS that their members are relatively unhealthy and, concomitantly, will allow them to receive large payments from the risk adjustment program.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Letter from Maria T.

Health Connections observes that, under the ACA, \"an issuer may only be assessed a charge under the [risk adjustment] program 'if the actuarial risk of the enrollees of such plans or coverage for a year is less than the average actuarial risk of all enrollees in all plans or coverage in such State for such year.' \" Plaintiff\n   Mem. at 24 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018063\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) ). It follows, according to Health Connections, that \"risk adjustment assessments cannot be based on factors other than actuarial risk, and HHS is mandated to follow this clear statutory text.\" Plaintiff Mem. at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Health Connections contends that HHS' use of the state average premium when calculating risk adjustment transfer payments is contrary to that statutory mandate, because the state average premium \"is very different than relative actuarial risk.\" Plaintiff Mem. at 25. According to Health Connections, health-insurance companies base their premiums-and, by extension, the state average premium-\"upon not only whether the population of insureds are healthier or sicker, but also on whether an issuer can control its costs by paying lower prices to hospitals and doctors, by doing a better job managing its members' medical care, by reducing administrative overhead, and by controlling other costs.\" Plaintiff Mem. at 25. Health Connections adds that using the state average premium is particularly unfair, because the state average premium is weighted by each insurer's marketshare, so insurers \"with dominant market positions-such as BCBS [Blue Cross Blue Shield] in New Mexico-drive the statewide average premium through their own prices, which are typically quite high.\" Plaintiff Mem. at 17. Health Connections contends that, instead of the state average premium, HHS should calculate each insurer's risk adjustment transfer payment using that insurer's average premium.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 17-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Health Connections then addresses why, in its view, HHS' proffered justifications for using the state average premium are unavailing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 29. Health Connections asserts that HHS gave two justifications for using state average premiums: (i) doing so assures that risk adjustment is budget neutral; and (ii) doing so provides a straightforward and predicable benchmark.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 21-22. \"The agency's main point was that use of the statewide average premium would be easy from an administrative standpoint, and the agency could achieve budget neutrality without having to make further adjustments or calculations.\" Plaintiff Mem. at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Health Connections argues that, contrary to HHS' first justification, budget neutrality does not justify using the state average premium, because \"there is no statutory requirement that risk adjustment be budget neutral,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that risk adjustment payments that insurers make to HHS must equal the risk adjustment payments that HHS makes to insurers. Plaintiff Mem. at 22. Health Connections argues that the Court should not defer to HHS' budget-neutrality determination, because \"HHS has no specialized expertise in budgeting and appropriations, and thus its views on budget neutrality are entitled to no deference.\" Plaintiff Mem. at 22 (citing\n   <em>\n    King v.

Health Connections notes that there is no explicit ACA language requiring budget neutrality for risk adjustment,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 22, whereas\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2018061\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B)'s language regarding reinsurance-which is,\n   essentially a temporary version of risk adjustment-\"expressly made payments out subject to issuer's payments in,\" Plaintiff Mem. at 23.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2018061\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(B) (\"[T]he applicable reinsurance entity collects payments under subparagraph (A) and uses amounts so collected to make reinsurance payments to health insurance issuers described in subparagraph (A) that cover high risk individuals in the individual market....\"). \"The lack of such a budget neutrality provision in the risk adjustment provision of the ACA strongly suggests that Congress intentionally omitted it and meant for the programs to be administered differently.\" Plaintiff Mem. at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Health Connections also finds it significant that the risk corridors program, like the risk adjustment program, contains no explicit budget neutrality requirement, but HHS concluded that the risk corridor program does not need to be budget neutral, and \"the GAO [Government Accountability Office] opined that the general appropriation to HHS for carrying out its 'other responsibilities' would be available for risk corridors program liabilities.\" Plaintiff Mem. at 23. Health Connections reasons that HHS could likewise fund risk adjustment through its general appropriations if HHS implements risk adjustment in a way that is not budget neutral.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 24. Health Connections adds that, even \"if HHS's agency budget lacked sufficient appropriations, underpaid issuers could sue in the Court of Federal Claims and recover any unpaid monies from the Judgment Fund.\" Plaintiff Mem. at 24. Health Connections also argues, in the alternative, that even if the risk-adjustment program must be budget neutral, HHS need not use \"a formula in which it will be mathematically impossible for payments in and out to ever be imbalanced,\" Plaintiff Mem. at 24, because HHS could still base assessments and payments on each issuer's own premium, and make any necessary\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   adjustments if there is a shortfall of payments in,\" Plaintiff Mem. at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Turning to HHS' second justification for using the state average premium when calculating risk adjustment payments,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that doing so provides a straightforward and predicable benchmark, Health Connections asserts that HHS has \"no explanation or backup data for this statement.\" Plaintiff Mem. at 25. Health Connections explains, on the contrary, that the state average premium \"is a black box for smaller issuers like NMHC,\" because larger insurers' pricing decisions \"drive the statewide average.\" Plaintiff Mem. at 25. Health Connections also explains why it cannot predict its risk-adjustment liability for one year by looking at its liability in the previous year: \"NMHC must set its premiums for a given benefit year in the previous calendar year, so that, for example, it had to finalize 2015 premiums in 2014[, but] NMHC does not lean of its risk adjustment liability [for a given benefit year] until well into the following year.\" Plaintiff Mem. at 25-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Health Connections then turns its focus from the substance of HHS' risk-adjustment regulations to HHS' rulemaking process. Health Connections states that, \"[i]n response to HHS's December 2, 2015 publication of proposed rulemaking for the 2017 benefit year, NMHC and numerous others submitted voluminous comments attacking the agency's use of the statewide average premium.\" Plaintiff Mem. at 27-28.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Health Connections,\n   HHS refused to respond directly to those comments when it published its final rule on March 8, 2016, because that that final rule states only: \" 'We did not propose changes to the transfer formula, and therefore, are not addressing comments that are outside the scope of this rulemaking.' \" Plaintiff Mem. at 28 (quoting 2017 Final Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 12,230 (A.R. 007774) ). Again according to Health Connections, \"[t]his refusal to respond to detailed, reasoned comments from stakeholders is the very epitome of arbitrary and capricious behavior.\" Plaintiff Mem. at 28. Health Connections observes that, when \"HHS next published its proposed new rulemaking for the 2018 benefit year on September 6, 2016,\" HHS sought comments on removing some administrative expenses from the state average premium when calculating risk-adjustment payments. Plaintiff Mem. at 29. Health Connections also observes that HHS' final rule for the 2018 benefit year reduces the state average premium by 14 percent when calculating risk adjustment payments to reflect the portion of an insurer's administrative costs that do not vary in response to how healthy or sickly the insurer's customers are.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Health Connections maintains, however, that this modification is \"too little and too late,\" because it only applies prospectively and it does not address all of Health Connections' concerns. Plaintiff Mem. at 30. Health Connections contends that HHS' 2018 rule \"admit[s] that it was inflating risk adjustment assessments in 2014 and 2015-and will do so again for 2016 and 2016-by not applying this 14% adjustment,\" but does nothing to address that inflation. Plaintiff Mem. at 30. Health Connections argues that, \"[a]t a minimum, if the agency has determined that its formula was overstating actuarial risk by a calculated percentage, then that correction must be made for all years of the program.\" Plaintiff Mem. at 30. Health Connections also argues that, notwithstanding HHS' modification of the risk adjustment transfer formula to account for administrative costs, the agency \"ignores that there are factors driving premium levels that are not either risk selection or administrative costs\"-such as \"NMHC's innovative medical management\" and its \"success in securing lower prices from hospitals and doctors\"-so \"HHS is therefore still assessing charges based on factors other than actuarial risk.\" Plaintiff Mem. at 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Health Connections next argues that, regardless of HHS' use of state average premiums, HHS inaccurately measures actuarial risk in the first place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 40. According to Health Connections, HHS' risk adjustment formula \"begins by calculating a risk score for each enrollee.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 40. Health Connections argues that the risk score reflects the relative health, and thus, the predicated healthcare costs, of each enrollee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 40. According to Health Connections, to calculate this risk score, an enrollee first receives a coefficient based on age and gender.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 40. It continues that the coefficient is increased if the enrollee has been diagnosed with what HHS calls a HCC, which includes diseases like diabetes or HIV/AIDS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 41. Essentially, according to Health Connections, the HCC number is added to the age/gender number to calculate an enrollee's risk score.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Health Connections believes this risk score calculation system is flawed for several reasons. First, Health Connections argues\n   that this system under-predicts \"the costs of enrollees who do not qualify for an HCC.\" Plaintiff Mem. at 41. For example, it contends that an individual without an HCC could still catch the flu, break a bone, or utilize preventive care services, none of which the HCC coefficient captures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 41. Health Connections therefore concludes that HHS underestimates health care costs for enrollees without an HCC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 41. According to Health Connections, this risk score calculation produces an absurd result, because Health Connections tries to improve its members' health so that they do not develop HCC conditions, but if Health Connections' enrollees do not have HCC conditions, then Health Connections loses money.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 42. Insurance carriers are, therefore, according to Health Connections, given financial incentives not to improve their enrollees' health, which was not what Congress intended.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Health Connections contends that, to fix this problem, it submitted a proposal explaining a solution authored by former Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Chief Actuary Rick Foster.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 44 (citing Richard S. Foster,\n   <em>\n    Method to Address Estimation Bias in the HHS-HCC Risk Adjustment Model\n   </em>\n   , at 1 (dated, July 15, 2016)(NMHC001042)(\"Foster Memorandum\") ). According to Health Connections, HHS did not respond to this proposal at all.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 44 (citing 2018 Final Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 94,082 -83 (dated December 22, 2016)(A.R.009619-20) ). Health Connections contends that ignoring this proposal, submitted as a response to HHS' proposed rules, is arbitrary and capricious,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 44 (citing\n   <em>\n    Allied Local and Regional Mfrs.

Plaintiff Mem. at 45. Health Connections contends that the inaccuracy occurs for two reasons; first HHS does not account for \"partial year enrollees\" and, second, HHS does not use prescription drug data when calculating risk scores. Plaintiff Mem. at 45. Regarding the first criticism, a partial year enrollee is one who is not enrolled in a given carrier's health insurance plan for the full calendar year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 45. According to Health Connections, if a partial year enrollee has an HCC condition but receives his or her diagnosis during the part of the year in which he or she is not on the given carrier's plan, then \"the enrollee's risk score will be understated because the plan cannot report the HCC score.\" Plaintiff Mem. at 45. (citing Hickey Declaration \u00b6\u00b6 94-95, at 22-23 (NMHC000884-85) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Health Connections' contends that its second criticism, HHS' failure to use prescription drug data, is related to the first.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 46. According to Health Connections, because individuals do not always receive an HCC diagnosis during their enrollment periods, using prescription drug data, according to Health Connections, is a good factor to use in calculating an enrollee's risk score.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 46. Health Connections argues that, for example, an enrollee may have been diagnosed with diabetes before enrolling in a given carrier's health insurance plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 46. According to Health Connections, that enrollee, however, regularly fills insulin prescriptions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 46. According\n   to Health Connections, if HHS were to use that information, then it could accurately capture the enrollee's otherwise missed diagnosis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 46. Health Connections asserts that it \"is particularly hard hit by the exclusion of prescription drug data, because NMHC prevents unnecessary hospital and physician encounters by proactively engaging with its members to take their medications.\" Plaintiff Mem. at 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   According to Health Connections, HHS finally addressed the issues of partial year enrollees and prescription drug data in the spring of 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 49. Health Connections argues, however, that HHS did not fix the partial year enrollment problem until 2017 and will not begin to use prescription drug data until 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 49. Health Connections asserts that HHS should apply these changes retroactively.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 50 (citing\n   <em>\n    National Fuel Gas Supply Corp. v. F.E.R.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"179208,5868301\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/59/1281/\">\n    59 F.3d 1281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. 1995) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Finally, Health Connections argues that HHS has de facto banned bronze health insurance plans in violation of the ACA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 50. According to Health Connections, in the ACA exchanges, four types of insurance plans exist.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 50 (citing Hickey Declaration \u00b6 73, at 17 (NMHC000879) ). Health Connections contends that bronze plans require the issuer to cover sixty percent of the insured's health care costs, seventy percent in silver plans, eighty percent in gold plans, and ninety percent in platinum plans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 50 (citing Hickey Declaration \u00b6 74, at 17, (NMHC000879) ). A bronze plan, therefore, has the lowest premium, but the highest deductible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 50 (citing Hickey Declaration \u00b6 74, at 17, (NMHC000879) ). According to Health Connections, consumers who do not have significant health care costs or who have limited financial resources often purchase bronze plans, because bronze plans have the lowest premiums.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 50 (citing Hickey Declaration \u00b6 74, at 17 (NMHC000879) ). Health Connections argues that, \"[b]ecause bronze plans are low-priced and attract a healthier population, the use of the state average premium and the underestimation bias against healthier enrollees particularly hammer these products.\" Plaintiff Mem. at 50. Essentially, Health Connections contends that HHS' risk adjustment formula makes it hard for bronze plans to be profitable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 51. Because the ACA expressly provides for bronze plans to be available,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 51 (citing 42 U.S.C. 18022(d)(1)(A) ), Health Connections concludes that Congress must have intended that insurers be able to issue bronze plans without losing money.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 51-52. Health Connections thus asks the Court to remand this case to the agency so that HHS can \"grapple with the question of how the agency can prevent the risk adjustment program from gutting Congress's intent to have viable bronze product offerings.\" Plaintiff Mem. at 52. In conclusion, Health Connections requests the Court to enter an order vacating HHS' risk adjustment regulations for the years 2014-2018, and order HHS to revise its regulations consistent with the Court's judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The Defendant Mem\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   HHS filed the Defendant Mem. First, HHS argues that all of Health Connections' claims fail, because HHS' methodology is an \"eminently reasonable and well-considered approach [to] an exceptionally complex actuarial challenge,\" and that its methodology \"easily satisfies the APA's standard of review.\" Defendant Mem. at 15. According to HHS, Health Connections \"erroneously combines its challenges to the 2014-2018 Rules in a single, multi-year\n   attack\" even though APA review is based on \"the record before the agency at the time it made its decision.\" Defendant Mem. at 18. HHS contends that the Court should conduct its analysis according to HHS' record at the time of the 2014 benefit year \"and then proceed to consider whether the modifications prosed in subsequent years alter that assessment for those years.\" Defendant Mem. at 18. HHS asserts that its use of the state average premium is consistent with the statutory text and is reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant Mem. at 18. It argues that \u00a7 1343 does not bar the use of state average premiums, because that section's only specific requirement is for the program to assess a charge on program-eligible plans if the enrollees' actuarial risk is less than the state's average actuarial risk and to make a payment to such plans if the actuarial risk of their enrollees is greater than the state's actuarial risk.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant Mem. at 18-19. According to HHS, Congress \"did not impose any requirements as to the methodology for determining the\n   <em>\n    amounts\n   </em>\n   of charges or payments.\" Defendant Mem. at 19. Moreover, HHS asserts, it is not methodologically possible to \"devise a transfer formula that reflects only actuarial risk, as NMHC suggests,\" because, even if HHS could \"perfectly isolate actuarial risk from other confounding variables ..., a formula based solely on actuarial risk would yield only a raw risk score,\" and a raw risk score \"measures the expected\n   <em>\n    relative\n   </em>\n   cost of a particular pool of enrollees compared to the state-wide average, but it does not predict actual expenditures.\" Defendant Mem. at 19. Consequently, HHS asserts, its methodology had to consider cost factors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant Mem. at 19. HHS contends that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   NMHC's proposed alternative to the state average premium (use of a plan's own premium) would suffer the exact same purported flaw as the Department's approach: it would not \"be based solely upon actuarial risk.\" Rather, it would be based on pricing choices made by individual insurance plans reflecting the very same factors that NMHC suggests are improper, such as issuer costs, administrative overhead, efficiency factors, and the like. But under NMHC's approach, risk adjustment transfers would vary based on pricing choices made by individual plans, whereas the Department's approach adopts a weighted average of all such pricing in a state, thereby ensuring that the formula is uniform and stable and minimally distorted by any extreme or inaccurate pricing decisions by individual insurance plans. Because Congress said nothing about how risk adjustment transfers must be calculated, NMHC's statutory argument should be rejected.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Defendant Mem. at 19-20 (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Next, HHS argues that the state average premium is not arbitrary and capricious for three reasons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant Mem. at 20. First, plan premiums contain a risk-selection element, because \" 'healthier' plans can charge less than 'sicker' plans\" given that healthier members consume less health care. Defendant Mem. at 20. HHS contends that \"a risk adjustment transfer based on a healthier plan's lower premium might not fully capture the cost of treating sicker enrollees or adequately compensate sicker plans for their sicker membership.\" Defendant Mem. at 20-21. Second, HHS argues that a risk adjustment charge based on a healthy plan's lower premium \"might not adequately capture the higher cost of treating sicker members\" and would, therefore, not fulfill the program's objective to \"reduce incentives for plans to avoid high risk enrollees.\" Defendant Mem. at 21 (citing 2014 Final Rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%2015%2C410\">\n    78 Fed. Reg. at 15,411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (dated March 11, 2013) (A.R. 0000228) ). HHS argues that the state average premium more\n   accurately measures and distributes the costs of insuring all individuals in a risk pool.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant Mem. at 21. Third, HHS argues that, because the risk adjustment program is \"self-funded and budget neutral,\" payments and charges must balance, but using a plan's own premium for transfer calculations would make that impossible. Defendant Mem. at 22. If healthy plans pay lower charges, and sicker plans receive higher payments, HHS argues,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   [b]ridging the gap between payments and charges therefore would require one of three after-the-fact adjustments: (1) reduce payments to sicker plans, (2) increase charges to healthier plans, or (3) split the difference between sicker and healthier plans. NMHC does not appear to advocate or the latter two options, see Pl.'s Mot. at 24-25, but in any event, each option has drawbacks. Reducing payments to sicker plans would likely result in sicker plans raising their premiums to offset the anticipated expense of their sicker membership. Increasing charges for healthier plans would eliminate the incentives of sicker plans to control costs. And finally, splitting the difference between healthier and sicker plans (by increasing charges and decreasing payments) would be similar to using the state average premium, but it would require an after-the-fact adjustment that would not be known until the program year concluded.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendant Mem. at 22-23 (citations omitted). HHS contends that, given the advantages of using state average premiums, \"[t]he record thus amply demonstrate[s] that the Department considered the relevant policy choices and rationally elected to use a state-wide average.\" Defendant Mem. at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   HHS disputes Health Connections' arguments in opposition to using state average premiums.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant Mem. at 23-26. First, HHS contends that using the state average premium does not encourage gaming by large insurers, because HHS' transfer formula \"does not directly reflect a plan's actual premiums at all; rather, it calculates the difference between the plan's expected costs with risk selection and the plan's expected costs without risk selection, using the state average premium on\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   sides of the equation as an estimation of average cost.\" Defendant Mem. at 23-24 (emphasis in original). HHS contends that its approach \"neither penalizes cost-cutting nor rewards inefficiency,\" but rather \"strikes a middle ground\" by assuming an average level of efficiency. Defendant Mem. at 24. According to HHS, Health Connections' proposed system \"would encourage sicker plans to charge higher premiums to increase their payments and healthier plans to charge lower premiums to reduce their charges\" because \"plans with the same risk score would owe or receive different amounts based on individual pricing decisions.\" Defendant Mem. at 24. Second, HHS asserts that using the state average premium does not penalize cost-cutting plans, because its regulations require providing advance notice of risk adjustment formula so that an issuer can \"price any expected payments or charges into their rates.\" Defendant Mem. at 24. Third, HHS contends that it provided considerable information, data, and research related to its decision, which \"amply demonstrate[s] the Department's rationale for adopting the state average premium.\" Defendant Mem. at 25. Additionally, HHS contends that it must \"only provide a 'rational connection between the facts found and the choice made,' such that the 'path may reasonably be discerned.' \" Defendant Mem. at 26 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Encino Motorcars, LLC v.

HHS asserts that its risk adjustment model is not meant to transfer risk of random events like accidents, but rather is meant to compensate plans for enrollees' predicable medical conditions that could influence enrollment decisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant Mem. at 27. HHS also contends that its model already incorporates costs of treating random events.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant Mem. at 27-28. HHS also argues that its approach to capturing HCCs is reasonable, because, HHS contends, HHS \"considered and reasonably addressed\" whether to adjust its methodology for partial year enrollment and incorporate prescription drug data. Defendant Mem. at 28-29.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant Mem. at 29-34. HHS further contends that the program's approach to its bronze plans is reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant Mem. at 34-37. HHS asserts that it \"grappled with\" the relationship between state exchange actuarial values and its risk adjustment program, ultimately \"adopting different risk score models for each metal level plan and catastrophic plan.\" Defendant Mem. at 35. HHS explains that it\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   also included an adjustment for actuarial value in the transfer formula so that the program does not compensate plans for differences in actuarial value that are already reflected in the premiums charged by such plans. However, the Department reasonably elected not to adopt separate risk pools for the different metal level plans because \"this approach would fail to correct for systematic risk selection across 'metal levels[.'] That is, low risk enrollees would tend to migrate to plans with a lower actuarial value ... which would then gain a premium advantage attributable to risk selection. This result would not address the mandate of the ACA, which requires that transfer payments be made between plans based on the[ ] actuarial risk of their enrollees.\" Thus, to the extent NMHC suggests that the Department has not already exhaustively \"grappled\" with the relationship between metal levels and risk adjustment, it is wrong.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Defendant Mem. at 35 (citations omitted)(quoting State Health Insurance Exchange Risk Adjustment and Plan Metals Level at 6 (dated December 15, 2011)(A.R.000814-15) ). HHS also disputes Health Connections' contention that HHS' methodology is arbitrary and capricious for not relieving bronze plans of the financial consequences of risk adjustment, arguing that: (i) bronze plans typically have healthier enrollees, and \u00a7 1343 requires those enrollees to pay risk adjustment charges; and (ii) \"administrative review is not based on hindsight and it does not appear that Health Connections raised this outcome-oriented critique until the 2018 rulemaking.\" Defendant Mem. at 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   HHS also contends that the 2015-2017 rules are consistent with the statute and are reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant Mem. at 36. According to HHS, it was not arbitrary and capricious to not respond to comments addressing issues beyond the scope of proposed rules, because HHS was \"not obligated to reconsider methodological choices it already had exhaustively considered or to respond anew to comments questioning those choices.\" Defendant Mem. at 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Next, HHS asserts that the 2018 rule is consistent with the statute and is reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant Mem. at 37-40. HHS notes that it has addressed many of Health Connections complaints by adopting a downward adjustment to the state average premium and preventative health costs, including additional partial year enrollment factors, and making limited use of prescription drug data.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant Mem. at 37. As to Health Connections' \"remaining grievances,\" HHS asserts that: (i) the adjustment to the state average premium is reasonable, because \"there is nothing arbitrary and capricious about using a\n   mean to approximate overall health costs in a state nor does section 1343 require risk adjustment transfers\" to certain individuals, Defendant Mem. at 38; (ii) HHS reasonably addressed a particular proposed formula adjustment concerning estimation bias; and (iii) its methodology does not make it impossible for bronze plans to be profitable, and its internal process to improve its models means that \"judicial relief is unnecessary,\" Defendant Mem. at 40-41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   HHS also argues that no basis for Health Connections' requested relief exists.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant Mem. at 41-44. First, HHS asserts that the Court lacks jurisdiction to award primarily monetary relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant Mem. at 41. HHS contends that \"although NMHC nominally seeks an injunction requiring the Department to revise its risk adjustment formula ... the thrust of its suit is for a refund of money already paid to the Department.\" Defendant Mem. at 41. Second, HHS argues that, even if the sought refunds are not considered money damages, \"vacatur should still be denied because vacating the risk adjustment methodology for all prior years would harm plans that enrolled sicker than average enrollees.\" Defendant Mem. at 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     The Plaintiff Reply\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Health Connections replied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Reply and Opposition to Defendant's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment at 1, filed July 13, 2017 (Doc. 40)(\"Plaintiff's Reply\").

HHS contends that: (i) it thoroughly considered whether to incorporate\n   pharmacy data in its model as a measure of HCC status, seeking comments conducting analyses,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Reply at 15-18; and (ii) it reasonably addressed partial year enrollment and Health Connections \"has identified nothing that would have led the Department to believe that [its approach was] insufficient, much less unreasonable, to address partial year enrollment,\" Defendants' Reply at 18-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Fourth, HHS asserts that its approach to bronze plans is reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Reply at 19-20. HHS contends that: (i) Health Connections has not provided evidence that \"risk adjustment is driving bronze plans out of existence,\" Defendants' Reply at 19; (ii) Health Connections \"fails to challenge any specific action or inaction\" of HHS, Defendants' Reply at 19; and (iii) HHS is \"already monitoring the effects of the program on bronze plans, and, therefore, NMHC's requests for the Department to 'grapple' with the issue is moot,\" Defendants' Reply at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Fifth, HHS asserts that Health Connections' remaining arguments fail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Reply at 20-24. HHS argues that: (i) it did not ignore criticisms against the program, but rather analyzed results and sought public comments to improve it,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Reply at 20; (ii) it properly \"declin[ed] to retroactively modify rules that had already been promulgated,\" Defendants' Reply at 20-21; and (iii) Health Connections' suggestions that HHS' risk adjustment program created broader problems in the ACA market are irrelevant and meritless,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Reply at 23-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Sixth, and finally, HHS argues that the Court should deny retroactive relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Reply at 24-25. HHS contends that it has \"already adopted the majority of the reforms that NMHC has requested.\" Defendants' Reply at 24-25. According to HHS, Health Connections seeks in part \"to vacate the program back to its inception,\" which means that it is \"reasonable to infer that NMHC's primary motivation for bringing this case is not to correct the program moving forward, but to obtain money for past years.\" Defendants' Reply at 24. HHS also argues that, even if Health Connections' claim is proper under the APA, \"NMHC has not met its burden to show that the relief it seeks is either equitable or achievable.\" Defendants' Reply at 25.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    5.\n    <em>\n     The Hearing\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Court held a hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Draft Transcript of Motion Proceedings (taken January 22, 2018)(\"Tr.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Health Connections took to the podium first and argued that HHS' use of a statewide premium average in its actuarial risk calculation does not accurately capture actuarial risk, so HHS' use of that premium average violates\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018063\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   's plain language.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 4:17-23 (Bassman, Court);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018063\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018063\">\n    at 5:6-9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bassman). Health Connections continued that the statute is not lengthy, but its command is \"pretty\n   clear\": an issuer makes a payment if the \"actuarial risk is below average in this state.\" Tr. at 11:18-22 (Bassman). Health Connections explained that there are two steps to HHS' actuarial risk calculation: (i) HHS calculates your relative actuarial risk by measuring whether your enrollees' health is above or below the state average; and (ii) HHS multiplies that amount by the statewide average premium.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 5:14-22. Health Connections contends that both steps of that two-step process are arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 5:22-25 (Bassman).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Court challenged Health Connections' characterization of the statute and noted that the statute allows HHS to consider factors beyond actuarial risk.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 13:15-20 (Court). Health Connections rejoined that \"the statutory text ... speaks of actuarial risk\" and not of other factors. Tr. 14:11-13 (Bassman). It also argued that the proper premium against which to measure is the issuer's own premium, because an issuer's own premium captures efficiencies and costs more effectively. Tr. at 15:1-4 (Bassman).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Court asked whether using the issuer's premiums \"undercut[s] your statutory language argument,\" because it signals that HHS' use of the statewide average premium calculation is not arbitrary and capricious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 15:6-18 (Court). Health Connections rejoined that Congress' \"mandate is to get as close to actuarial risk as you can\" and that a healthcare issuer's own premium is a far closer approximation of actuarial risk than the statewide average premium. Tr. at 15:22-16:4 (Bassman). Health Connections added, however, that, even setting the statute aside, HHS was not reasonable in using a statewide average.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   16:9-12 (Bassman)(\"[T]hat's the second part of our attack....\"). The Court rejoined that the analysis for which Health Connections is looking for is \"much more rigorous ... than [ ] courts normally do\" under the APA. Tr. at 16:17-22 (Court). Health Connections argued that, under arbitrary and capricious review, HHS must look at \"appropriate factors in making its rational decisions,\" and Health Connections contended that HHS did not analyze actuarial risk as a factor, the one factor it had to consider under the statute. Tr. at 17:2-14 (Bassman).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Responding to HHS' argument from the briefing that using an issuer's own premium incentivizes manipulating the premium, Health Connections argued that it could not manipulate its rates for beneficial effect, because: (i) issuers cannot unilaterally set their prices; and (ii) the federal and state governments may disapprove premium if they are too high or too low.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 17:21-18:11 (Bassman). Health Connections added that manipulation would not work, because the risk adjustment charge is unpredictable, based on their enrollees' health and their competitor's premiums.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 18:21-19:11 (Bassman).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Court asked whether the predictability issue was a \"flaw in the statute.\" Tr. at 20:20-21 (Court). Health Connections admitted that \"certainly [the] predict[ability] problem is partly baked into the statute.\" Tr. at 20:23-24 (Bassman). The Court responded that if the predictability problem is in the statute, how could HHS have been acting arbitrarily and capriciously. Tr. at 21:2-3 (Court). Health Connections rejoined, somewhat circularly, that HHS could still have acted arbitrarily and capriciously, because there is a better method of calculating actuarial risk: the \"issuers own premium.\" Tr. at 21:4-7 (Bassman).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Health Connections continued that the second reason HHS has acted arbitrarily and capriciously is that, in promulgating their rules, HHS reasons that it should act in a budget neutral way.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 21:17-19\n   (Bassman). Health Connections argued that budget neutrality is not an appropriate factor upon which to rely, because the statute is not budget neutral. Tr. at 22:4 (Bassman). Health Connections argued that several sections in the statute are expressly budget neutral, but the risk adjustment section is not, so Congress could not have intended for the risk adjustment provision to be budget neutral.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 22:12-23:5 (Bassman). The Court responded that \"budget neutrality is at least reasonable. It may not be the best reading of the statute, but [it] seems ... at least reasonable.\" Tr. at 25:4-9. Health Connections rejoined that budget-neutrality could not be reasonable, because Congress appropriated bridge funds, and, in other programs, such as reinsurance, HHS accounted for reductions in some years which extra funds would make up for in later years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 26:23-27:4 (Bassman);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018063\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018063\">\n    at 28:1-6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bassman).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   HHS responded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 35:14-15 (Powers). It argued that the statute gives \"broad discretion to determine the methods and standards ... applicable to the risk adjustment activities.\" Tr. at 39:24-40:1 (Powers). It added that it used the statewide average premium, because \"it reflects the cost of insuring [the] sickest people\" as it reflects all premiums in the calculation. Tr. at 40:9-13 (Powers). It continued that \"[s]tatewide average premium incorporates elements of actuarial risk selection, including administrative expense contained there, and so it is consistent with the status to use statewide average premium[s] as a cost factor in conjunction with the risk score.\" Tr. at 40:19-24 (Powers).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   HHS admitted that the \"statute does not require budget neutrality,\" Tr. at 44:3-5 (Powers), but it contended, however, that requiring budget neutrality is a reasonable interpretation of the statute given that the agency is \"not permitted to obligate the Government in the absence of appropriations,\" Tr. at 44:8-16 (Powers). HHS also argued that it was likely that Congress thought this should be budget neutral, because \"Congress in the first instance assumed that states would appropriate these risk adjustment program[s],\" and it would be \"quite strange to think that Congress was obligating [states] ... to make up the shortfall or difference in payments and transfers.\" Tr. at 45:14-20 (Powers).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   HHS noted Health Connections' argument that taking into account all premiums \"sweeps in other factors more than actuarial risk,\" but contended that \"us[ing] an issuers own premium\" sweeps in the same non-actuarial risk factors\" Tr. at 46:23-47:6 (Powers). HHS contended that Health Connections calculation is not focused on actuarial risk, as the statute commands, but is focused on \"efficiency.\" Tr. at 47:9 (Powers). HHS argued that \"competition and efficiency\" is not present in the risk adjustment portion of the statute. Tr. at 48:8-10 (Powers)(citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018063\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). It acknowledged that the \"statute has a goal of increasing access to quality and affordable health insurance, so that contains elements of both ... increasing competition and therefore bringing down prices, but also assuring that, regardless ... of health status, [people] have [access] to health plans that can satisfy their health needs.\" Tr. at 48:12-18 (Powers). HHS further conceded that there is \"nuance\" in the statute, but that \"[t]he agency is entitled in the first instance to w[eigh] these various policies particularly where the statute just gives the agency broad discretion to spe[cify] standards applicable for the program.\" Tr. at 48:22-49:2 (Powers).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Health Connections took the podium again and argued that HHS' methodology for calculating the enrollees' risk scores is arbitrary and capricious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 61:4-9 (Bassman). It argued that each enrollee's\n   risk score is calculated with three inputs: age, gender, and an HCC code, which is given to an enrollee if he or she has a serious chronic condition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 61:9-15 (Bassman). Health Connections argued that the HCC code is defective, because it misses a lot of people who have serious conditions, but do not qualify for an HCC code, such as people with chronic lower back pain.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 61:16-22 (Bassman). Health Connections continued that people who have chronic diseases who do not have an HCC code cost an issuer just as much as those with an HCC code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 62:2-13 (Bassman). From that analysis, Health Connections argues that HHS' calculation is miscalculating the actuarial risk, because it does not account for all enrollees and \"underestimates the cost of enroll[ees] without an HCC by 31 percent.\" Tr. at 62:19-63:11 (Bassman).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   HHS rejoined that the risk adjustment program is meant to \"deal with systematic risks that [are] predictable.\" Tr. at 72:9-22 (Powers). HHS also noted that it had received many comments \"supportive of the various ... logical choices\" it had made. Tr. at 73:16-18 (Powers).

Tr. at 82:6-8 (Bassman). It argued that there is no evidence in the administrative record demonstrating that issuers pressured doctors into prescribing medications not needed so the issuer could obtain an HCC code and a concomitant financial benefit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 82:9-83:6 (Bassman). It also argued that doctors are pressured from \"making unnecessary prescriptions,\" as they could face sanctions from their state.

HHS responded that several issuers would ask the agency for a refund, but that HHS no longer had that money, because \"it's been paid out to the recipients under the program.\" Tr. at 88:20-25 (Powers). HHS argued that this scenario would cause chaos for many issuers, because issuers might think that HHS would \"try to take the money back from them.\" Tr. at 89:1-6 (Powers).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 89:9-12 (Powers)(\"[I]f your honor was to go back retroactively and vacate prior rules ... that would have some significant and ... bad effects on this market.\").

Obviously, that is not enough, or there would be nothing for\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   to do. In practice,\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference is\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference applied to regulations rather than statutes. The agency's interpretation will be accepted if, though not the fairest reading of the regulation, it is a plausible reading-within the scope of the ambiguity that the regulation contains.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   Our cases have not put forward a persuasive justification for\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference. The first case to apply it,\n   <em>\n    Seminole Rock,\n   </em>\n   offered no justification whatever-just the\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   that \"the administrative interpretation ... becomes of controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\" Our later cases provide two principal explanations, neither of which has much to be said for it. First, some cases say that the agency, as the drafter of the rule, will have some special insight into its intent when enacting it. The implied premise of this argument-that what we are looking for is the agency's intent in adopting the rule-is false. There is true of regulations what is true of statutes. As Justice Holmes put it: \"[w]e do not inquire what the legislature meant; we ask only what the statute means.\" Whether governing rules are made by the national legislature or an administrative agency, we are bound by what they say, not by the unexpressed intention of those who made them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   The other rationale our cases provide is that the agency possesses special expertise in administering its \" 'complex and highly technical regulatory program.' \" That is true enough, and it leads to the conclusion that agencies and not courts should make regulations. But it has nothing to do with who should interpret regulations-unless one believes that the purpose of interpretation is to make the regulatory program work in a fashion that the current leadership of the agency deems effective. Making regulatory programs effective is the purpose of rulemaking, in which the agency uses its \"special expertise\" to formulate the best rule. But the purpose of interpretation is to determine the fair meaning of the rule-to \"say what the law is.\" Not to make policy, but to determine what policy has been made and promulgated by the agency, to which the public owes obedience. Indeed, since the leadership of agencies (and hence the policy preferences of agencies) changes with Presidential administrations, an agency head can only be sure that the application of his \"special expertise\" to the issue addressed by a regulation will be given effect if we adhere to predictable principles of textual interpretation rather than defer to the \"special expertise\" of his successors. If we take agency enactments as written, the Executive has a stable background against which to write its rules and achieve the policy ends it thinks best.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   Another conceivable justification for\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference, though not one that is to be found in our cases, is this: If it is reasonable to defer to agencies regarding the meaning of statutes that Congress enacted, as we do per\n   <em>\n    Chevron,\n   </em>\n   it is a fortiori reasonable to defer to them regarding the meaning of regulations that they themselves crafted. To give an agency less control over the meaning of its own regulations than it has over the meaning of a congressionally enacted statute seems quite odd.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   But it is not odd at all. The theory of\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   (take it or leave it) is that when Congress gives an agency authority to administer a statute, including authority to issue interpretive regulations, it implicitly accords the agency a degree of\n   discretion, which the courts must respect, regarding the meaning of the statute. While the implication of an agency power to clarify the statute is reasonable enough, there is surely no congressional implication that the agency can resolve ambiguities in its own regulations. For that would violate a fundamental principle of separation of powers-that the power to write a law and the power to interpret it cannot rest in the same hands. \"When the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person ... there can be no liberty; because apprehensions may arise, lest the same monarch or senate should enact tyrannical laws, to execute them in a tyrannical manner.\" Montesquieu,\n   <em>\n    Spirit of the Laws\n   </em>\n   bk. XI, at 151-152 (O. Piest ed., T. Nugent transl. 1949). Congress cannot enlarge its own power through\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   -whatever it leaves vague in the statute will be worked out by someone else.\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   represents a presumption about who, as between the Executive and the Judiciary, that someone else will be. (The Executive, by the way-the competing political branch-is the less congenial repository of the power as far as Congress is concerned.) So Congress's incentive is to speak as clearly as possible on the matters it regards as important.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   But when an agency interprets its own rules-that is something else. Then the power to prescribe is augmented by the power to interpret; and the incentive is to speak vaguely and broadly, so as to retain a \"flexibility\" that will enable \"clarification\" with retroactive effect. \"It is perfectly understandable\" for an agency to \"issue vague regulations\" if doing so will \"maximiz[e] agency power.\" Combining the power to prescribe with the power to interpret is not a new evil: Blackstone condemned the practice of resolving doubts about \"the construction of the Roman laws\" by \"stat[ing] the case to the emperor in writing, and tak[ing] his opinion upon it.\" 1 Wm. Blackstone,\n   <em>\n    Commentaries on the Laws of England\n   </em>\n   58 (1765). And our Constitution did not mirror the British practice of using the House of Lords as a court of last resort, due in part to the fear that he who has \"agency in passing bad laws\" might operate in the \"same spirit\" in their interpretation. The Federalist No. 81, at 543-544 (Alexander Hamilton)(J. Cooke ed. 1961).\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference encourages agencies to be \"vague in framing regulations, with the plan of issuing 'interpretations' to create the intended new law without observance of notice and comment procedures.\"\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   is not a logical corollary to\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   but a dangerous permission slip for the arrogation of power.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   It is true enough that\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference has the same beneficial pragmatic effect as\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference: The country need not endure the uncertainty produced by divergent views of numerous district courts and courts of appeals as to what is the fairest reading of the regulation, until a definitive answer is finally provided, years later, by this Court. The agency's view can be relied upon, unless it is, so to speak, beyond the pale. But the duration of the uncertainty produced by a vague regulation need not be as long as the uncertainty produced by a vague statute. For as soon as an interpretation uncongenial to the agency is pronounced by a district court, the agency can begin the process of amending the regulation to make its meaning entirely clear. The circumstances of this case demonstrate the point. While these cases were being briefed before us, EPA issued a rule designed to respond to the Court of Appeals judgment we are reviewing. It did so (by the standards of such things) relatively quickly: The decision below was handed down in May\n   2011, and in December 2012 the EPA published an amended rule setting forth in unmistakable terms the position it argues here. And there is another respect in which a lack of\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   -type deference has less severe pragmatic consequences for rules than for statutes. In many cases, when an agency believes that its rule permits conduct that the text arguably forbids, it can simply exercise its discretion not to prosecute. That is not possible, of course, when, as here, a party harmed by the violation has standing to compel enforcement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   In any case, however great may be the efficiency gains derived from\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference, beneficial effect cannot justify a rule that not only has no principled basis but contravenes one of the great rules of separation of powers: He who writes a law must not adjudge its violation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <em>\n    Decker v.

First, on September 12, 2011, HHS-specifically the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight-published a white paper titled \"Risk Adjustment Implementation Issues.\" Risk Adjustment Implementation Issues at 1 (dated September 12, 2011)(A.R. 004367)(\"White Paper\"). In the White Paper, HHS sets out a basic structure for calculating risk adjustment transfers: \"Payments and charges will be calculated by multiplying plan risk relative to the market by a premium amount or 'baseline premium.' Further, they will be calculated in a zero sum, budget-neutral manner.\" White Paper at 13 (A.R. 004379). HHS' only explanation for its declaration that adjustment payments will be calculated budget neutrally is that, \"in contrast to some current risk adjustment methodologies, the Affordable Care Act's risk adjustment program is designed to be budget neutral.\" White Paper at 4 (A.R. 004370). In short, HHS assumed that the ACA requires budget neutrality, and HHS does not give an independent policy reason for requiring budget neutrality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   HHS continues by identifying two major issues when developing a methodology to calculate risk adjustment transfers: (i) \"how to establish the baseline premium\"; and (ii) \"how to balance payments and charges.\" White Paper at 13-14 (A.R.004379-80). HHS compares two basic approaches to establishing the baseline premium, using an average premium or using a plan's own premium.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   White Paper at 14 (A.R. 004380). HHS reasons that using an average premium will automatically balance payments and charges, because \"the State average is a single dollar amount for all plans, and plan risk scores average to 1.0, [so] the payments and charges are equal in this approach.\" White Paper at 15 (A.R. 004381). HHS determines that using a plan's own premium will not necessarily produce equal payments and charges, so \"[s]ince payment and charge transfers will be budget neutral, a method is needed to balance them if payments are greater than charges or vice versa.\" White Paper at 15 (A.R. 004381). Again, HHS gives no policy reason for requiring budget neutrality.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   White Paper at 15 (A.R. 004381). Finally, HHS also considers balancing risk adjustment payments and charges by increasing charges on a pro-rated basis, decreasing payments on a pro-rated basis, or by doing both.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   White Paper at 15 (A.R. 004381).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   In its 2014 Proposed Rule, HHS decides to use a state's average premium as the baseline premium when calculating risk adjustment charges and payments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2014,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2073%2C118\">\n    77 Fed.

HHS articulates the rationale for its decision to use a state average premium and not a plan's own premium:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-179\">\n   The approaches that used plans' own premiums resulted in unbalanced payment transfers, requiring a balancing adjustment to yield transfers that net to zero. These examples also demonstrated that the balancing adjustments could introduce differences in premiums across plans that were not consistent with features of the plan (for example, AV or differences in costs and utilization patterns across rating areas). A balancing adjustment would likely vary from year to year, and could add uncertainty to the\n   rate development process (that is, plan actuaries would need to factor the uncertainty of the balancing adjustment into their transfer estimates).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   2014 Proposed Rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2073%2C118\">\n    77 Fed.

On the one hand, a Blue Cross and Blue Shield comment warned that overlooking non-HCC enrollees' costs could make HCC enrollees more profitable for insurers,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   BCBSA Detailed Comments on the Interim Final Rule with Comment: \"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Amendments to the HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2014\" [CMS-9964-IFC] at 5 (undated)(A.R. 004330), but on the other hand, a study determined that risk adjusters generally underestimate the costs associated\n   with higher cost individuals,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ross Winkelman, Society of Actuaries, A Comparative Analysis of Claims-Based Tools for Health Risk Assessment at 24 (dated April 20, 2007)(A.R. 001261); Blue Cross and Blue Shield Comments on the Proposed Rule: \"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2014\" [CMS-9964-P] at 52 (dated December 28, 2012)(A.R. 003098). Given the mixed signals HHS received, it was not a clear error of judgment to finalize its proposed risk adjustment formula.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   As for making its 2017 and 2018 rulemaking, HHS responded to criticisms that its risk adjustment formula underestimates costs for healthy enrollees and provided reasoned bases for its decisions. For instance, HHS' 2017 rules incorporated preventative services costs into its risk adjustment formula.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant Reply at 12; 81 Fed.

HHS explained that it\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-191\">\n   attempted to address the range between enrollees without HHCs and those with HCCs by finalizing the incorporation of preventive services into our simulation of plan liability. While overall this is not a very large effect, it does have a noticeable effect on certain demographic subgroups, resulting in more accurate payments for enrollees without HCCs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   81 Fed. Reg. at 12,218 (dated March 8, 2016) (A.R. 007762). HHS also considered modifying its risk adjustment model to more accurately predict costs for healthier enrollees. When proposing its 2018 rules, HHS stated that it was\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-193\">\n   evaluating an approach in which we would directly adjust plan liability risk scores outside of the model for [certain] subpopulations. For example, we could potentially make an adjustment to the plan liability risk scores calculated through the HHS risk adjustment models that would adjust for such an underprediction or overprediction in actuarial risk by directly increasing low plan liability risk scores and directly reducing high plan liability risk scores in order to better match the relative risks of these subpopulations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   81 Fed. Reg. at 61,473 (dated September 6, 2016). HHS did not immediately make such adjustments, however, because it believed that \"there is a risk that such modifications could unintentionally worsen model performance along other dimensions on which the model currently performs well.\" 81 Fed. Reg. at 61,473. Accordingly, HHS decided to \"continu[e] to evaluate the effect of these types of modifications on all aspects of the model's performance before choosing to implement such an approach, and would not implement these types of modifications if we determined that doing so would have material unintended consequences for the model's performance along other dimensions.\" 81 Fed. Reg. at 61,473.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   HHS reported, in its final rule for 2018, that it believed that modifications to its risk adjustment model could improve its accuracy for low-cost enrollees, but added that it was still considering the tradeoffs associated with such modifications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   81 Fed.

Given the disparate recommendations contained in those comments, it was neither arbitrary nor capricious for HHS to exercise caution instead of taking precipitous action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   Health Connections argues, nonetheless, that HHS acted arbitrarily and capriciously by not responding to the Foster Memorandum specifically.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 36 (\"Incredibly, HHS did not respond to Mr. Foster's white paper at all, much less offer any reasoning or data to explain why it was not adopting his detailed proposal.\").

HHS' risk adjustment model calculates a risk score for every enrollee, which quantifies an enrollee's relative healthiness, and, therefore, the estimated costs of providing healthcare to that enrollee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 40. HHS begins by considering an enrollee's age and sex, but if HHS learns that an enrollee qualifies for an HCC-such as diabetes or HIV/AIDS-the enrollee's risk score increases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 40-41. Health Connections argues that HHS does not accurately identify enrollees who have HCCs because of how HHS accounts for partial year enrollees and because HHS only uses diagnoses-and not prescription\n   drug data-when determining whether an enrollee has an HCC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 45. It follows, according to Health Connections, that enrollees' risk scores are inaccurate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 45. A partial-year enrollee is someone who is enrolled in a health insurance plan for part of a year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 45 (citing Hickey Declaration at 22 (NMHC000884) ). If an enrollee has an HCC, but is not diagnosed while enrolled in a particular plan, then that plan will not report the HCC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 45 (citing Hickey Declaration at 22-23 (NMHC000884-85) ). Using prescription drug data would capture an enrollees HCC status even if that enrollee has not been diagnosed with an HCC. For example, a person may have been diagnosed with diabetes before enrolling in their current health insurance plan. That health plan, therefore, might not have a record of their diabetes diagnosis.

HHS understood that \"the main advantage to drug data are its completeness and timely availability ... nearly all prescription activity creates an electronic record that is rapidly available to insurance plans.\" RTI International Memorandum at 2 (A.R. 000836). HHS considered, however, that \"[c]ounterbalancing the advantages of drug data in risk adjustment models are several problems. Chief among these is the incentives that drug-based payments systems would create.\" RTI International Memorandum at 4 (A.R. 000838). Specifically, \"[t]he most salient concern with tying risk adjustment payments to drug usage is the likely distortion\n   of provider decisions toward pharmaceutical therapies.\" RTI International Memorandum at 4 (A.R. 000838). \"This distortion would create real costs: not only the costs ... of the drugs themselves, but also the health outcomes that would be diminished by any deviation from clinical best practices.\" RTI International Memorandum at 4 (A.R. 000838). These costs may include \"the risk of doctors steering patients toward drugs rather than behavioral therapies, but also a bias towards certain types of drugs associated with high cost conditions.\" Defendant Mem. at 40 (citing RTI International Memorandum at 6-7 (A.R.000840-41) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Further, HHS adequately performed its duty to \"consider and respond to significant comments received during the period for public comment.\"\n   <em>\n    Perez v.

HHS' 2014 proposed rule had already balanced, however, the possible accuracy that prescription drug data may provide against other concerns, explaining that, \"[w]hile use of particular prescription drugs may be useful for predicting expenditures, we believe that inclusion of prescription drug information could create adverse incentives to modify discretionary prescribing.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2073%2C118\">\n    77 Fed.

By its plain language, that provision states that a bronze level plan shall have certain features, but it is silent regarding the profitability of those plans. It does not, for example, state that the plan must always be profitable. With its actions, the Court is not convinced that HHS has, as Health Connections insists, \"\n   <em>\n    [d]e [f]acto\n   </em>\n   [b]anned Bronze Plans.\" Plaintiff Mem. at 50. For instance, Health Connections argues that many insurers have stopped offering bronze plans, but it does not argue that bronze have vanished entirely.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Mem. at 51. Meanwhile, HHS asserts that \"New Mexico health insurers proposed more than 20 different Bronze plans for the 2018 benefit year, including several offered by [Health Connections].\" Defendants' Reply at 23. The trend Health Connections identifies raises serious concerns, but those concerns do not mean that HHS has violated the ACA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   Health Connections asks the Court to \"remand to the agency ... [for HHS] to grapple with the question of how the agency can prevent the risk adjustment program from gutting Congress's intent to have viable bronze product offerings,\" Plaintiff Mem. at 44, or to order HHS to respond to Health Connections' comment about how HHS was going to adjust the formula so bronze plans are not unfairly penalized,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 112:9-15 (Bassman). Such relief is neither necessary nor appropriate. HHS has responded to comments that its risk adjustment formula disadvantages bronze level plans.

Reg. at 94,083 (dated December 22, 2016) (A.R. 009620). HHS responded that, although some suggestions may improve its risk adjustment formula's predictive ability, it was \"still evaluating the tradeoffs that would need to be made in model predictive power among subgroups of enrollees,\" and it will \"continue to explore these modeling approaches.\" 81 Fed. Reg. at 94,083 (A.R. 009620).
