R. Evid. 403. \"[B]ecause the district court is in a better position to evaluate the danger of unfair prejudice resulting from particular evidence, a ruling under Fed. R.

In so doing, the Court explained that, in prosecutions for violations of \u00a7 922(g)(1), \"there can be no question that evidence of the name or nature of the prior offense generally carries a risk of unfair prejudice to the defendant. That risk will vary from case to case ... but will be substantial whenever the official record offered by the Government would be arresting enough to lure a juror into a sequence of bad character reasoning.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595223\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/172/#p174\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595223\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/172/#p174\">\n    at 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595223\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/172/#p174\">\n    117 S.Ct. 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, in accordance with Rule 403,\n   <em>\n    Old Chief\n   </em>\n   , and the Second Circuit authority discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , both parties appear to agree that, in light of the stipulation, evidence of Defendant's prior convictions is not admissible as part of the Government's case-in-chief. This Court is in agreement as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   However, the Government also writes to clarify that, as set forth in its first motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 50, should Defendant testify at trial, it intends to impeach Defendant with the statutory name of offense, date of conviction, and sentence imposed for certain of Defendant's prior felony convictions, and also intends to cross-examine Defendant regarding the underlying facts of those prior convictions should he open the door to such inquiry during his testimony. Gov't Resp. at 2. It is well-settled that \"prior-offense evidence may in a proper case be admissible for impeachment, even if for no other purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Old Chief\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595223\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/172/#p174\">\n    519 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   176 n.2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595223\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/172/#p174\">\n    117 S.Ct. 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing Fed.

The Court addresses those issues in a separate decision and order on the Government's first motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Although both parties agree a limiting instruction is appropriate, they disagree as to the specific content of that instruction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mot. at 3; Gov't Resp. at 2. The Court agrees a limiting instruction is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chevere\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9243384\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/368/120/\">\n    368 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   122 n.3 ;\n   <em>\n    Belk\n   </em>\n   , 346 F.3d at 311.

You are not to consider it for any other purpose. You are not to speculate as to what it was for. You may not consider the prior conviction in deciding whether the Government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was in knowing possession of the gun that is charged, which is the disputed element of the offense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Use of the Phrase \"Convicted Felon\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The parties disagree over whether the Government should be permitted to refer to Defendant as a \"convicted felon\" or \"felon.\" Defendant argues the phrase \" 'convicted felon' carries with it a connotation, often invoked in the media, of a bad and dangerous person that could cause the jury to convict Mr. White based on fear and prejudice rather than on the evidence at trial,\" and even seeks to preclude use of the term \"felony.\" Def. Mot. at 3 &amp; n.1. Defendant avers the Second Circuit indicated in\n   <em>\n    Belk\n   </em>\n   that the \"preferred practice\" is to avoid use of the term \"convicted felon\" in this circumstance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4. The Government argues there is no categorical bar on the use of these terms, and they are, in fact, commonly used. Gov't Resp. at 3. The Government argues\n   <em>\n    Belk\n   </em>\n   did not establish a bar to using the phrase \"convicted felon,\" and more recent Second Circuit case law affirms this conclusion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This Court agrees with the Government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    United States v. White\n   </em>\n   , the defendant was also charged with violating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1) and moved\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   for a court order precluding the Government from describing him as a \"convicted felon.\" 08-CR-0682,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%204730234\">\n    2009 WL 4730234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 4, 2009) (Garaufis, J.). The parties in that case made nearly identical arguments to those made here.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%204730234\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court denied the defendant's request, explaining that \"[a]lthough not contained in the statutory text of \u00a7 922(g)(1), the phrase is a convenient shorthand for the prior-conviction element of the statutory offense charged, and it is commonly used when referring to that element of the crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2 (citations omitted). The court also agreed with the Government that\n   <em>\n    Belk\n   </em>\n   \"does not require a contrary result,\" and noted \"the Second Circuit did not\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   district courts to prohibit all use of the phrase 'convicted felon;' instead, the court referenced the measure as one among many that can reduce the risk of prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This Court agrees with the\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   court's analysis and finds it persuasive. As previously stated, this Court will issue a limiting instruction regarding the stipulated fact of Defendant's prior conviction, and the Government is precluded from introducing evidence of Defendant's prior convictions as part of its case-in-chief. Moreover, as in\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   , this Court will closely monitor the Government's use of the terms \"convicted felon,\" \"felon,\" and \"felony\" to ensure the Government does not overuse them or otherwise employ them in a prejudicial manner, and defense counsel is free to object to the extent he believes the Government is doing so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%204730234\">\n    2009 WL 4730234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. The Court views these precautions as sufficient to protect against any potential unfair prejudice. Accordingly, having carefully considered both parties' submissions, the Court declines to adopt a categorical bar on the use of the terms \"convicted felon,\" \"felon,\" and \"felony.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 51, is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. The Government is precluded from introducing evidence of the name, nature, and number\n   of Defendant's prior convictions in its case-in-chief, and the Court will give a limiting instruction regarding the jury's consideration of the fact of Defendant's prior conviction. However, subject to the limitations described herein, the Government is not precluded from using the terms \"convicted felon\" and \"felon\" to describe Defendant, nor is the Government limited in its use of the term \"felony.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    The Government has also submitted two motions\n    <em>\n     in limine\n    </em>\n    .
