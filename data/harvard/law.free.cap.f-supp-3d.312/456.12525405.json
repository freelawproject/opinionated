The Defendant has filed a motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, for summary judgment, based on a release of all employment claims that the Plaintiff signed in exchange for severance benefits. Ultimately, with the benefit of briefing and oral argument, the Court will construe the motion as a motion for summary judgment, and grant it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Candace Warren (\"Warren\") is an African-American woman over forty years of age with a master's degree.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9, ECF No. 4. Warren was employed by Defendant, Mastery Charter Schools (\"Mastery\") from 2011 to 2016 as a social worker.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-13. Each year, Warren would get a one-year employment contract, which would then be renewed for the next year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. During most of her tenure at Mastery, Warren received positive feedback about her job performance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-25. She also received raises and bonuses based on her employee evaluation ratings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. However, Mastery's Regional Director, Debbie Durso, decided not to renew Warren's contract at the end of the 2016 school year, based on allegations of poor performance and communications issues.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. Accordingly, in late April 2016, Mastery informed Warren that it did not intend to renew her contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Then, on June 23, 2016, the day before Warren's last day of employment with Mastery, Mastery sent Warren a proposed severance agreement containing a release of employment claims (hereinafter, \"Agreement and Release\") for her review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Decl. of Theresa Velykis, \u00b6 6, Def's Mot. Ex. 2, ECF No. 7-2. The Agreement and Release explained that, regardless of whether Warren signed it, she would receive every benefit that she was already entitled to, including accrued salary and pay for vacation time. Def's Mot. Ex. 1, ECF No. 7-1. It further provided that, if she did agree and sign the Agreement and Release, she would get severance benefits that she was not otherwise entitled to-including four additional weeks' worth of pay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2.1-2.3. In exchange for these severance benefits, Warren would waive any and all employment-related claims against Mastery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5.1-5.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Warren had twenty-one days to consider this offer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. Also, if she agreed and signed the Agreement and Release, she could revoke her agreement within seven days.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Agreement and Release contained, in three places, the suggestion that Warren consult with an attorney before she agreed and signed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   For example, it contained the following paragraph, in capitalized and bolded text:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT VERY CAREFULLY. THIS AGREEMENT INCLUDES A RELEASE OF ALL KNOWN AND UNKNOWN CLAIMS, INCLUDING THOSE ALLEGING EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION, AND BARS FUTURE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST EMPLOYER BY EMPLOYEE FOR CLAIMS ARISING PRIOR TO THE EXECUTION OF THIS AGREEMENT. YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY BEFORE SIGNING THE AGREEMENT.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 (emphasis in original). Additionally, the Agreement and Release included language stating that, by signing, Warren was acknowledging that she was doing so in a knowing and voluntary manner.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As Warren's relationship with Mastery deteriorated, she experienced significant stress. Warren Aff. \u00b6 15, ECF No. 8-3. This stress caused Warren to suffer from rashes, hair loss, depression, and anxiety. Pl's Br. at 6, 8, ECF No. 8. When Mastery offered her the choice of signing the Agreement and Release in exchange for severance benefits, Warren worried that if\n   she did not sign, Mastery would use its influence to impair her employment opportunities with future potential employers. Warren Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 18-20. With this worry in mind, Warren thought about whether she wished to sign the Agreement and Release for the full twenty-one day consideration period, finally signing it on the twenty-first day. Pl's Br. at 9. Warren explains that, because she was under stress and was worried that Mastery would interfere with her future employment prospects, she felt that she had \"no choice\" but to sign the Agreement and Release.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Warren filed this action against Mastery on October 25, 2017, ECF No. 1, and then filed an Amended Complaint on February 1, 2018, ECF No. 4. The Amended Complaint contains claims for employment discrimination based on age and race, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (\"PHRA\"), 43 Pa.

ECF No. 7. Warren has filed a response in opposition thereto. ECF No. 8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Mastery's motion is ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As Warren correctly points out, Mastery's motion should be construed as a motion for summary judgment, because it is based on the Agreement and Release-a matter outside the pleadings. Warren does, however, agree that the Court may properly rule on Mastery's motion as a motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Pursuant to the OWBPA, an individual cannot waive any ADEA right or claim unless the waiver is \"knowing and voluntary.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20626\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1).

Therefore, in Warren's view, it is not \"knowing or voluntary\" under the OWBPA, and thus does not bar to her ADEA claims. Additionally, Warren argues that the release provision is invalid, as to all of her claims, because she did not enter into the Agreement and Release \"knowingly and willfully\" under\n   <em>\n    Coventry\n   </em>\n   because of the stress that she was under when she signed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court will first address Warren's argument that her decision to enter into the Agreement and Release was not knowing and willful. Subsequently, the Court will address her argument that it is not written in a manner calculated to be understood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Knowing and Willful\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As noted above, Warren argues that her decision to enter into the Agreement and Release was not knowing and willful because of the stress that she was under at the time that she signed it. This stress included her worry that if she did not sign, Mastery would use its influence to impair her employment opportunities with future potential employers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   However, the fact that an employee was experiencing stress and worry at the time she signed a release of employment claims does not mean that her signature was not knowing and willful.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cuchara v.

However, if that distinction is correct, it undermines Warren's position. If Warren was not suffering from a serious physical ailment, she would have been more-and not less-able to knowingly and willfully enter into a release than if she were.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    At oral argument, Warren's counsel raised three additional arguments. First, she argued that, because the Agreement and Release did not provide a list of the claims being waived in bullet point form, it was not written in a manner calculated to be understood.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Transcript at 21:6-16. However, there is no such requirement under the OWBPA. Further, such a requirement would run contrary to the totality of the circumstances test. Second, Warren's counsel, quoting\n    <em>\n     Coventry\n    </em>\n    , stated that \"[c]areful evaluation of the release form itself, and of the complete circumstances in which it was executed, is necessary to assure that the goals of the ADEA are preserved.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20626\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20626\">\n     at 41:5-9\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10529583\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/856/514/#p522\">\n     856 F.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    523 ). The Court notes that it has carefully evaluated the totality of the circumstances in this case. Third, when the Court asked Warren's counsel to point to facts or circumstances supporting her contention that the execution of the Agreement and Release was not knowing and willful, counsel pointed only to facts and circumstances surrounding the claims that were settled by the release.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Transcript at 7:1-3; 9:13-25; 10:1-8; 23-25; 12:21-25; 13:1-13; 24:20-23; 37:23-2; 38:1-25; 39:1-12; 40:11-24; 41:9-16. Even when pressed, counsel did not or could not identify facts or circumstances that would raise a genuine dispute of material fact that Warren's execution of the Agreement and Release was not knowing and willful.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10529583\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/856/514/#p522\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
