McAuliffe, United States District Judge\n   This proposed class action arises out of Harbour Capital's allegedly improper transmission of facsimile advertisements to Menachem Raitport and/or his business, Crown Kosher Meat Market (collectively, \"Raitport\"), in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and FCC regulations promulgated pursuant to that statute. By order dated September 12, 2013, the court stayed this action, pending completion of collateral administrative proceedings before the FCC likely to resolve critical questions of law underlying this litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Imposing Stay (document no. 85).\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Petitions, FCC Proceeding Nos. 02-278 and 05-338.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Those administrative proceedings have been completed and, accordingly, Raitport moves the court to lift the stay. Raitport also seeks leave to file a brief addressing whether, under the Hobbs Act, this court has jurisdiction to follow a decision issued by the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit arising out of the FCC administrative proceedings. He also seeks leave to amend his motion for class certification to add a third subclass of plaintiffs. Also pending before the court is Raitport's motion for class certification, which the parties have fully briefed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons discussed, Raitport's motion to lift the stay (document no. 98) is granted in part, and denied in part. His motion for class certification (document no. 42) is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    The Governing Statute and Regulations\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, as amended by the Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005 (collectively, the \"TCPA\"), prohibits the use of any device to send, to a telephone facsimile machine, an \"unsolicited advertisement.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(C). The statute defines \"unsolicited advertisement\" as \"any material advertising the commercial availability or quality of any property, goods, or services which is transmitted to any person without that person's prior express invitation or permission, in writing or otherwise.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5). The statute does, however, provide an exception to that general prohibition on unsolicited fax advertisements, if: (a) the sender has an established business relationship with the recipient; (b) the sender obtained the recipient's fax number through voluntary communication or a directory; and (c) the unsolicited fax includes an opt-out notice meeting certain statutory requirements.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(C). In short, then, under certain circumstances a business may send an \"unsolicited advertisement\" by fax to a third party, but that fax must include the statutorily-mandated opt-out language.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 227(b)(2)(D) (providing that such opt-out language must be \"clear and conspicuous\" and \"on the first page of the unsolicited advertisement,\" it must state that the recipient may opt out from future unsolicited advertisements, and must include a \"cost free mechanism to send an opt-out request to the sender of the unsolicited advertisement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2006, the FCC issued what has come to be known as the \"Solicited Fax Rule.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2064.1200\">\n    47 C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(iv).

So, says Raitport, this court's job is straightforward: unless and until the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (or the Supreme Court) invalidates the Solicited Fax Rule in a proceeding arising out of a proper administrative challenge to that rule, this court is bound to apply the rule as written. As discussed below, application of the Solicited Fax Rule is critical to Raitport's claims in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' Claims\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   According to the amended complaint (document no. 34), beginning on May 5, 2005, Harbour Capital sent \"well over ten-thousand\" unsolicited fax advertisements that failed to include the opt-out language required by the TCPA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566209\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/680/#p682\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566209\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/680/#p682\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at paras. 15-16. Then, more than a year later, beginning on August 1, 2006, Harbour Capital again sent \"well over 10,000\" unsolicited and/or solicited fax advertisements that failed to bear the required opt-out language.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566209\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/680/#p682\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566209\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/680/#p682\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at paras. 17-18.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The two proposed subclasses of plaintiffs that Raitport seeks to certify do not distinguish between \"solicited\" and \"unsolicited\" faxes. Instead, those subclasses include all recipients of faxes sent by Harbour on or about two dates (October 4, 2006 and November\n   7, 2006).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion for Class Certification (document no. 42) at 2. No distinction is drawn because, according to the Amended Complaint (citing both the TCPA and the Solicited Fax Rule),\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   fax advertisements sent by Harbour Capital-both solicited and unsolicited-were required to contained opt-out language. And, says Raitport, although Harbour Capital's faxes did include opt-out language, that language did not strictly comply with the statutory requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   For anyone who sends a fax advertisement that improperly omits the required opt-out language, the TCPA provides a private right of action and imposes statutory damages of $500 per fax (which can be trebled, if the court concludes the statutory violation was willful or knowing).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3). So, based upon Raitport's allegations and the number of facsimile advertisements Harbour Capital reportedly sent, Harbour Capital faces potential class action damages of between roughly $15 and $45 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Raitport's assertion that all of the faxes sent by Harbour Capital were required to bear the statutorily mandated opt-out language is central to his claims. But, that assertion turns upon the continued enforceability of the FCC's Solicited Fax Rule. If that rule is invalid, there is a substantial problem with certifying either of Raitport's original proposed subclasses, since each would contain both individuals who received unsolicited faxes (which, under the TCPA, must have included the required opt-out language) as well as individuals who received solicited faxes (to which such a requirement would not apply). His proposal to add a third subclass faces obstacles as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    The FCC's \"Solicited Fax Rule\" is Invalid\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Many courts have recognized the Solicited Fax Rule as being beyond the scope of the FCC's regulatory authority. But, by virtue of the Hobbs Act, those such courts were nonetheless required to enforce the rule as written. That, in turn, led to the certification of numerous class action lawsuits in which millions or even tens of millions of dollars (\"bet the company\" damages) were at issue.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Creative Montessori Learning Centers v.

Indeed, the requirements imposed by the TCPA and the Solicited Fax Rule have proved lucrative for class action plaintiffs and their counsel, but posed high financial risk for businesses engaged in direct advertising programs.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Physicians Healthsource, Inc. v. Allscripts Health Solutions, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202391751\">\n    2017 WL 2391751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *1, n.1 (N.D. Ill. June 2, 2017) (\"Teaming up with the Law Firm Anderson &amp; Wanca, representing it here, the plaintiff has, in just the last four years, sued at least eighteen different companies in federal courts in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, California, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Florida. And that includes only those cases in which written opinions were published on Westlaw. Counsel tells us plaintiff has brought more than twenty such cases altogether.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In 2017, however, the legal landscape changed. Significantly. The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit described the historical and procedural background to that change as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Petitioner Anda is a company that sells generic drugs. As part of its business, Anda faxes advertisements to small pharmacies. Anda's fax advertisements convey pricing information and weekly specials to the pharmacies. Many pharmacies have given permission to Anda for Anda to send those faxes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   In 2010, Anda sought a declaratory ruling from the FCC clarifying that the\n   [TCPA] does not require an opt-out notice on solicited fax advertisements-that is, those that are sent with the recipient's prior express permission.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   That issue was of great importance to Anda. In 2008, Anda had been sued in a class action in Missouri state court for alleged violations of the FCC's Solicited Fax Rule. Many of the plaintiff pharmacies in that case admitted that they had expressly given permission to Anda for Anda to send fax advertisements to the plaintiffs. But those plaintiffs nevertheless sought over $150 million in damages from Anda because Anda's fax advertisements allegedly did not include opt-out notices that complied with the Solicited Fax Rule's requirements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Let that soak in for a minute: Anda was potentially on the hook for $150 million for failing to include opt-out notices on faxes that the recipients had given Anda permission to send. If the Act actually provides the FCC with the authority to issue the Solicited Fax Rule, then Anda could be subject to that large class-action damage award. But if the Act does not provide the FCC with the authority to issue the Solicited Fax Rule, then Anda would be off that hook. Several other businesses facing similar class-action lawsuits joined Anda's petition to the FCC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Bais Yaakov\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277859\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/1078/#p1080\">\n    852 F.3d at 1080-81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In response to the petitions filed by Anda and several other business entities, the FCC \"adhered to its interpretation of the Act as providing the FCC with the authority to require opt-out notices on solicited faxes as well as unsolicited faxes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277859\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/1078/#p1080\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277859\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/1078/#p1080\">\n    . at 1081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matter of Rules &amp; Regulations Implementing the Tel.

According to Raitport, because the Hobbs Act vests exclusive jurisdiction to review FCC regulations in the courts of appeals, and because the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has yet to consider the validity of the Solicited Fax Rule, this court lacks jurisdiction to do anything other than ignore the decision in\n   <em>\n    Bais Yaakov\n   </em>\n   and enforce the rule as written.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Memorandum at 4 (\"[U]ntil the First Circuit or the Supreme Court rules on the validity of the opt-out regulation, this Court is bound to apply it.\").

Circuit and, perhaps, those circuits from which appeals were consolidated by the Multidistrict Litigation Panel in the D.C. Circuit). Additionally, Raitport's view is inconsistent with the better-reasoned interpretations of the Hobbs Act and the scope of its jurisdiction-limiting provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   For example, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit recently addressed a similar issue and held that the decision in\n   <em>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bais Yaakov\n   </em>\n   rendered the Solicited Fax Rule invalid nationwide:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Once the Multidistrict Litigation Panel assigned petitions challenging the Solicited Fax Rule to the D.C.

Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Sandusky\n   </em>\n   , individualized questions concerning which of nearly 30,000 potential recipients actually received a particular unsolicited fax from Harbour Capital more than a decade ago render Raitport's proposed class unascertainable and the potential reliance upon individual affidavits unreliable.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   In addition to issues surrounding consent, the district court premised its denial of certification on the inability to identify class members. In its view, this difficulty was a problem for [plaintiff] under both Rule 23(b)(3) predominance and ascertainability. [Plaintiff's] proposed class consisted of \"[a]ll persons who were successfully sent [the Prolia fax].\" But while [defendant] intended the fax to be sent to all 53,502 individuals and entities on the Prolia List, only 40,343 actually received it. Both parties agreed that the 25% who did not receive the Prolia fax are not valid class members.\n   <em>\n    In the absence of fax logs listing the status of each attempted transmission\n   </em>\n   , the district court resolved that each potential class member would have to submit an affidavit certifying receipt of the Prolia fax. Given that the fax was sent in 2010, the recollection of a putative class member that he, she, or it had received a particular unsolicited fax would be somewhat suspect. Thus, it concluded that using affidavits to identify class members was yet a second individual issue that prevented common questions from predominating, and reliance on these 7-year-old, self-serving statements was not an \"administratively feasible\" way to ascertain class membership.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    Sandusky Wellness Ctr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275870\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/460/#p467\">\n    863 F.3d at 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis supplied).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leyse v.

Circuit Court of Appeals, that court became the sole forum for addressing the validity of that rule. It's holding that the Solicited Fax Rule is unlawful is binding upon this court (and, indeed, across the nation, unless and until the Supreme Court holds otherwise-something which, at least in this case, it has declined to do). Raitport's suggestion to the contrary is unavailing and it is undermined by substantial persuasive precedent to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Because the Solicited Fax Rule is inapplicable, Harbour Capital was only required to include opt-out language on fax advertisements that were \"unsolicited.\" Faxes that were sent by Harbour Capital to recipients who gave their permission were not required to bear the opt-out language. The fact that Raitport's original proposed class and two subclasses fail to distinguish between those recipients who gave such permission and those who did not, renders those proposed classes unascertainable. Additionally, that precludes common questions of fact from predominating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Finally, there are similar problems with Raitport's proposal to amend his motion for class certification to add a third subclass. Given the passage of nearly a dozen years since the subject faxes were sent, and in light of the fact that no records exist as to which intended recipients of those faxes actually received them, such a subclass would be unascertainable and would not meet the requirements of Rule 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Raitport's Motion to Lift Stay (document no. 98) is granted in part and denied in part. It is granted to the extent that the stay previously entered by the court is hereby lifted. It is denied to the extent that Raitport seeks leave to submit additional briefing. It is also denied to the extent Raitport seeks leave to amend his motion for class certification to add a third subclass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Finally, Raitport's Motion for Class Certification (document no. 42) is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    The Hobbs Act (also known as the Administrative Orders Review Act),\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202341\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2341\n    </extracted-citation>\n    -2351, vests in the courts of appeals exclusive jurisdiction to review the validity of FCC regulations.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202341\">\n      Id\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202341\">\n     .\n    </extracted-citation>\n    \u00a7 2342(1).

The Solicited Fax Rule was directly and properly challenged under the Hobbs Act and, in\n    <em>\n     Bais Yaakov\n    </em>\n    , the circuit court of appeals with jurisdiction over the matter held that the Rule is unlawful and invalid. And, contrary to Raitport's assertion, the First Circuit's opinion in\n    <em>\n     Brotherhood\n    </em>\n    does not stand for the proposition that this court does \"not have the jurisdiction to follow [the] D.C.
