INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before the court is Defendants HTC Corporation and HTC America, Inc.'s (collectively, \"HTC\") motion to dismiss Plaintiff CyWee Group Ltd.'s (\"CyWee\") claims for induced infringement. (MTD (Dkt. # 35).) The court has considered the motion, the parties' submissions in support of and in opposition to the motion to dismiss, the relevant portions of the record, and the applicable law. No party has requested oral argument. Being fully advised, the court GRANTS HTC's motion to dismiss CyWee's induced infringement claims with leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case concerns allegations of patent infringement. CyWee provides products and services in the areas of \"motion processing, wireless high definition video delivery, and facial tracking technology.\" (Am. Compl. (Dkt. # 20) \u00b6 12.) CyWee owns two patents protecting its technology that detects, measures, and calculates the movements and rotations of machines:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   United States Patent No. 8,441,438 (\"the '438 Patent\") and United States Patent No. 8,552,978 (\"the '978 Patent\") (collectively, \"the Patents-in-suit\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 120.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Patents-in-suit \"disclose devices and methods for tracking the motion of a device in 3D space and compensating for accumulated errors.\" (Gans Decl. (Dkt. # 20-3) \u00b6 8.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, the protected inventions \"teach how to determine a device's current orientation based on motion data detected by its motion sensors.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Specifically, CyWee protected its \"sensor fusion technology,\" which \"incorporate[s] the data from multiple sensors and compensate[s] for [any] errors.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) The '438 Patent\"discloses an enhanced sensor fusion technology and application for calculating orientation ... by using measurements from both a 3-axis accelerometer and a 3-axis gyroscope.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The '978 Patent protects a similar sensor fusion technology but uses a third sensor-a magnetometer-in addition to an accelerometer and a gyroscope. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) This sensor fusion technology is useful for games that incorporate the motion of the device into play, augmented reality applications, and virtual reality applications. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18, 21-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   CyWee initially sued HTC on June 16, 2017, and amended its complaint on July 6, 2017, alleging direct infringement of the Patents-in-suit as well as indirect infringement through inducement. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl. (Dkt. # 1); Am. Compl.) As relevant here, CyWee asserts that HTC indirectly infringes the Patents-in-suit by:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [i]nducing others to infringe on one or more claims of the [Patents-in-suit] through sale and/or use of the [Patents-in-suit] Accused Products. On information and belief, at least as a result of the filing of this action, HTC is aware of the [Patents-in-suit]; is aware that its actions with regards to distributors, resellers, and/or end users of the [Patents-in-suit] Accused Products would induce infringement; and despite such awareness will continue to take active steps-such as, creating and disseminating the [Patents-in-suit] Accused Products, and product manuals, instructions promotional and marketing materials, and/or technical materials to distributors, resellers, and end users-encouraging other's infringement of the [Patents-in-suit] with the specific intent to induce such infringement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (Am. Compl. \u00b6 28.) CyWee also attaches two claim charts to its amended complaint illustrating how the HTC products infringe upon the Patents-in-suit. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '438 Claim Chart (Dkt. # 20-1); '978 Claim Chart (Dkt. # 20-2).) Both claim charts include several screenshots-the majority of which do not derive from HTC-depicting the computing code that presumably is used by the accused products and how that code allows the accused products to perform the protected methods. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , '978 Claim Chart at 4-9.) HTC moves to dismiss only these induced infringement claims for failure to state a claim.

CyWee informed HTC, through its claim charts, how HTC products infringe on specific claims in the Patents-in-suit. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   '438 Claim Chart; '978 Claim Chart.) These claim charts, along with the filing of the suit, inform HTC that several of its products utilize the methods protected by CyWee's Patents-in-Suit and that use of the accused products by its customers infringe upon the Patents-in-Suit as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Intellicheck Mobilisa, Inc. v.

Although CyWee asserts that HTC continued to create and disseminate product manuals, instructions, and marketing materials, it offers no specific details about those promotional and instructional materials. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl.) The court agrees with CyWee that it is not required to identify specific instructions at this stage. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. at 8);\n   <em>\n    Bill of Lading\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3885491\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/681/1323/#p1339\">\n    681 F.3d at 1339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But without any inkling as to what HTC asserted in those materials, the court is unable to discern whether HTC \"touted the benefits of the accused products in ways that track the asserted patents\" or taught \"how to use the [accused products] to infringe [the patents-in-suit],\" rather than \"simply describ[ing] how the [accused products] work.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Memory Integrity II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5914492\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/144/1185/#p1195\">\n    144 F.Supp.3d at 1195-96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As such, the court cannot reasonably infer from CyWee's pleadings that HTC specifically intended for its distributors, resellers, or end-users of its accused products to infringe upon the Patents-in-suit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Memory Integrity I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204251026\">\n    2015 WL 4251026\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   CyWee argues that the attachments to its amended complaint, namely the claim charts and Dr. Gans's declaration, permit the court to reasonably infer HTC's specific intent. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. at 6-7.) The court disagrees. Although the claim charts allow the court to infer that HTC had knowledge regarding its end-users' infringement,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 III.B.1, the claim charts do not demonstrate anything-directly or circumstantially-about HTC's intent. Indeed, the vast majority of the screenshots included in the claim charts do not derive from HTC at all: Only one out of the 22 screenshots originated from HTC. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '438 Claim Chart; '978 Claim Chart.) Nor does Dr. Gans opine on HTC or any of its products. Instead, he describes only his understanding of the technology behind the Patents-in-suit and its advantages over prior art. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Gans. Decl.) None of the attachments include factual assertions that allow the court to draw any reasonable inferences regarding HTC's state of mind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Because CyWee does not plead sufficient factual allegations regarding HTC's continued actions after HTC learned of the alleged infringement, the court cannot reasonably infer that HTC specifically intended its distributors, resellers, or end users to infringe the Patents-in-suit. Accordingly, on this ground, the court grants HTC's motion to dismiss CyWee's induced infringement claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Leave to Amend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As a general rule, when a court grants a motion to dismiss, the court should dismiss the complaint with leave to amend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eminence Capital, LLC v.

In determining whether dismissal without leave to amend is appropriate, courts consider such factors as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, and futility of amendment.\n   <em>\n    Foman v.

The court agrees. There is no evidence of undue delay, bad faith, or dilatory motive on CyWee's part, nor is there any indication that HTC will suffer prejudice if the court permits amendment, especially in light of HTC's lack of opposition to amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Foman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"450547\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/371/178/#p182\">\n    371 U.S. at 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"450547\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/371/178/#p182\">\n    83 S.Ct. 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
