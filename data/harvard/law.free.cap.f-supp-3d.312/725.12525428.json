(\"Illumina\") engaged in predatory and anticompetitive behavior that violated federal antitrust law and Illinois state law. (Am. Compl. (Dkt. No. 21) \u00b6 1.) Presently before us are three pending motions. First, Illumina has filed a motion to dismiss IET's amended complaint in its entirety. (Pl's Mot. (Dkt. No. 23).) Second, IET has filed a motion to strike Illumina's affirmative defenses under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f). (Pl.'s Mot. to Strike (Dkt. No. 27).) Third, Illumina filed a motion requesting we postpone briefing on IET's motion to strike pending our ruling on its\n   motion to dismiss. (Def.'s Mot. to Postpone (Dkt. No. 30).) For the following reasons, we grant Illumina's motion to dismiss in part and deny in part, and dismiss Counts I through V without prejudice. We also deny Illumina's motion to postpone briefing on IET's motion to strike as moot, and order briefing on IET's motion to strike. Illumina may file a response to IET's motion to strike Illumina's affirmative defenses and IET's supporting brief on or before March 16, 2018, and IET may file a reply brief on or before March 30, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the purposes of a motion to dismiss, \"we accept the well-pleaded facts in the complaint as true.\"\n   <em>\n    McCauley v.

IET, an Illinois corporation with its principal place of business in Vernon Hills, Illinois, sells and leases laboratory equipment to laboratories, hospitals, and research institutions across the United States and internationally. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 11.) As part of its business, IET sources various models of used or refurbished genome sequencing unit systems (\"sequencing units\") manufactured by Illumina. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 5.) Illumina manufactures \"integrated systems\" that \"serve the sequencing, genotyping and gene expression markets\" and sells its used sequencing units in competition with IET. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   IET alleges that beginning in or around 2007, once Illumina learns of a possible sale or lease by IET of a refurbished Illumina sequencing unit, Illumina engages in \"scare tactic[s] ... intended to kill the sale or lease between the customer and IET.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) Specifically, IET alleges Illumina informs IET's potential customers that they must pay a significant \"site licensing fee\" for operation and data collection software needed to operate a used Illumina sequencing unit purchased from IET. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.) IET claims Illumina has discretion in charging the fee, sometimes charges the fee for machines exempt from site licensing fees based on a preexisting contract, and only threatens the fee to interfere with sales from \"third party resellers like IET.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-8, 17-18.) IET further alleges Illumina refuses to service sequencing units purchased from IET when the purchasers do not pay Illumina the site licensing fee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 18.) Based on these allegedly anti-competitive tactics, IET alleges Illumina \"has unlawfully attempted to create a monopoly within the secondary sequencing unit market over [Illumina] sequencing units.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) As a result, IET has lost sales, including the sale of a HiSeq 4000 Illumina sequencing unit to the University of Central Florida.

IET additionally includes a claim for intentional interference with a prospective economic advantage (\"intentional interference\") (Count VI), alleging Illumina intentionally\n   and maliciously interfered with customers with whom IET had a \"reasonable expectancy of completing sales and/or leases of refurbished sequencing units.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49-51.)

Illumina argues the Software License Agreement attached to its motion to dismiss as Exhibit A makes incontrovertible that Illumina licensed the operating software on its sequencing units, that the first sale doctrine does not apply, and that Illumina accordingly could charge site licensing fees to customers purchasing Illumina sequencing units from IET. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-6.)

IET argues we should not consider the Software License Agreement filed by Illumina because Illumina has not established that this is the software contract referred to in its amended complaint.

(Mem. Ex. A at 2.) Even assuming arguendo the Agreement governed all Illumina sequencing units IET attempted to sell during the relevant period, we nevertheless find that the Agreement does not conclusively establish that Illumina licensed its software equipment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vernor v.
