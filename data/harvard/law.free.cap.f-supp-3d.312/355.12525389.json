Federal Rule of Evidence 609\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Federal Rule of Evidence 609 controls the impeachment of a witness by evidence of a criminal conviction. In relevant part, it provides: \"for a crime that, in the convicting jurisdiction, was punishable by death or by imprisonment for more than one year, the evidence ... must be admitted in a criminal case in which the witness is a defendant, if the probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect to that defendant.\" Fed R.

Gov't Rule 609 Mot. at 5. While it is true that the March 2015 conviction is within the ten-year period and is therefore subject to the more lenient balancing test of Rule 609(a)(1)(B), it does not follow that this factor automatically tips the scale in favor of admission; convictions within the latter half of the ten-year period have diminishing probative value, even though they are still within the ten-year period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Moreover-and despite the Government's contentions to the contrary-it is not clear whether this 2008 conviction falls within the ten-year time period set forth in Rule 609(b). Trial in this case is scheduled to begin on May 14, 2018, and because the ten-year period is calculated from the time of trial, the February 15, 2008 date of conviction falls beyond the ten-year period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Weichert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1544065,6126497\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/783/23/\">\n    783 F.2d at 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (calculating ten-year period based on date of trial);\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Although the Government states Defendant was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for the 2008 conviction, the Government does not provide the date of Defendant's release from confinement, which could possibly have also been outside of the ten-year time period. Gov't Rule 609 Mot. at 3. Instead, the Government simply states that \"each of the three convictions on which the government seeks to impeach the defendant-or in the case of the 2007 conviction, the date on which the defendant was released from prison-are within the 10 year statutory limit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. As stated\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , pursuant to Rule 609(b), a more stringent standard applies to convictions falling outside of the ten-year period. Even assuming the 2008 conviction falls within the ten-year period, however, the Court still finds that it should be excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Although the 2008 conviction involves violating the same provision of the N.Y. Penal Law as the 2015 conviction, it does not necessarily follow that both convictions should be admitted. \"Once a prior felony has been presented to the jury, the incremental value of additional convictions may be diminished.\"\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%204730234\">\n    2009 WL 4730234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Accordingly, taking into account the remoteness of the 2008 conviction and the increased possibility of unfair prejudice resulting from admission of a second prior conviction for a controlled substance offense, the Government is prohibited from impeaching Defendant with evidence of the 2008 conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Thus, the impeachment value of the 2007 conviction is minimal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The date of the conviction also cuts against admission. According to the Government, Defendant's date of conviction for the 2007 attempted assault is March 21, 2007, and Defendant was released on parole on December 4, 2008. Gov't Rule 609 Mot. at 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although this conviction is within the ten-year period of Rule 609(b) and therefore subject to the more lenient balancing test of Rule 609(a)(1)(B), it is only several months away from falling outside of the ten-year period. Because the usefulness of a prior conviction for impeachment diminishes as the conviction becomes more remote-and because this conviction is nearly ten years old-the second factor weighs against admission.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   , 553 F.2d at 828 ;\n   <em>\n    Vasquez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4221629\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/840/564/#p568\">\n    840 F.Supp.2d at 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The third factor, the similarity between the past crime and the charged crime, is a closer question, but also weighs against admission. The Government argues the prior attempted assault conviction is dissimilar to the crime charged, \"leaving little risk that [its] admission will implicate the defendant's propensity to commit the crime of possessing a firearm as a previously convicted felon with which he is charged.\" Gov't Rule 609 Mot. at 5. To be sure, attempted assault and felon in possession of a firearm are different crimes, and the Government does not contend that the 2007 attempted assault conviction involved a firearm. However, because of the close association between firearms and crimes of violence, there is a significant risk that, if the 2007 conviction is admitted for impeachment, the jury may find that Defendant has a propensity to engage in violent crimes and possess a firearm.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4204478\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/606/306/#p311\">\n    606 F.Supp.2d at 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting similarity between prior violent crime and charged crime involving a firearm could lead a jury to believe that the defendant had a propensity for committing violent acts and possessing weapons);\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%204730234\">\n    2009 WL 4730234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (admitting only one of two prior convictions for impeachment because of concern that the jury \"is more likely to view the testifying Defendant as having a propensity to commit crime (and to carry a gun) than having a propensity to be dishonest\");\n   <em>\n    Lewis v.

However, when considered with the other factors, the Court finds the probative value of the 2007 conviction does not outweigh its prejudicial effect, and the Government may not use it for impeachment under Rule 609(a)(1)(B). Contrary to the Government's assertion, if Defendant testifies, there is no risk he will appear \"pristine\" because the 2015 conviction may be used to impeach Defendant, and the parties have indicated their intent to stipulate to the fact of Defendant's status as a convicted felon, further ameliorating the Government's concern.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vasquez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4221629\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/840/564/#p568\">\n    840 F.Supp.2d at 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    D.
