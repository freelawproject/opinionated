(First Amended Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9, ECF No. 15 (\"Am. Compl.\").) Defendants Vic DiGeronimo, Jr., Stanley I. Roedinger, Jr., Mark Sterling, George Palko, Patrick L. Sink, Richard E. Dalton, Mark Totman, and Thomas P. Byers are current trustees of the Pension Plan (collectively, \"the Trustees\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8.) Four of the Trustees are representatives of the International Union of Operating Engineers (\"the Union\") and the remaining four Trustees are representatives of the employer association.

Baker, is the executor of the estate of her decedent, Earl Wayne Arthur (\"the Estate\"). (Am. Compl. \u00b6 4.) Mr. Arthur is a deceased former participant in the Pension Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, 12.) When he retired on May 1, 2014, Mr. Arthur elected to receive his pension benefit in a payment known as the \"Normal Form\" of payment, which guarantees 60 monthly payments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.) At the time of his death on September 22, 2016, Mr. Arthur had received 29 of the 60 guaranteed payments under the Pension Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14.) Mr. Arthur, who was not married at the time of his death, died without surviving children, surviving parents, or surviving brothers or sisters, or a valid beneficiary designation for the payment of remaining benefits under the Pension Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On or around November 8, 2016, the Estate submitted a claim for death benefits under the Pension Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.) In a letter dated December 2, 2016, the Estate's claim for benefits was denied because \"the Estate is not a designated beneficiary to Mr. Arthur's death benefit[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 17-18 (internal quotation marks omitted).) The Estate appealed the denial of benefits, arguing that it was a permissible\n   beneficiary under the Pension Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 19-30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In a letter dated February 10, 2017, Plaintiff was advised that \"the Trustees of the Pension Fund considered the appeal at their February 6, 2017 [meeting]. After discussion, the Trustees decided to deny the Appeal.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31 (internal quotation marks omitted).) The letter further advised that the Estate was not a \"designated default beneficiary\" to Mr. Arthur's death benefit and, therefore, \"the estate is not entitled to the death benefit under the Pension Plan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32 (internal quotation marks omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff filed this action on April 14, 2017, and later filed the Amended Complaint, asserting three claims.

(Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 38-48.) Her second claim is for breach of fiduciary duty, seeking \"equitable relief of reformation\" under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3).

Recently, the Sixth Circuit, in considering whether the district court erred in denying discovery in an ERISA case where there was a conflict of\n   interest, stated that \"the claimant must put forth a factual foundation to establish that he has done more than merely allege bias.\"\n   <em>\n    Collins v.

The\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   court determined that the claimant had \"not set forth evidence establishing more than a mere allegation of bias based on the inherent conflict of interest\" and concluded that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying additional discovery \"based on [claimant's] mere allegations that Unum was biased against him.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=682%20Fed.%20Appx.%20381\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Here, Plaintiff argues that \"[t]his is a case where an inherent conflict apparently exists. Four of the Trustees, the decision-makers on appeal, are, or are employed by, participating employers responsible for funding the Pension Plan.\" (ECF No. 29 at 7.) The Court is not persuaded that this structure warrants discovery.

Workers' Pension Trust Fund of Local Union # 58, I.B.E.W.,\n   </em>\n   No. 13-cv-10385,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20249330\">\n    2015 WL 249330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2-3 (E.D. Mich. Jan. 20, 2015) ).) Under these circumstances, Plaintiff's argument and the present record do not persuade this Court that the rationale in\n   <em>\n    Klein\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Foltz\n   </em>\n   is unsound.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff also argues that\n   <em>\n    Willard\n   </em>\n   , an unpublished decision, is distinguishable because it did not address the conflict of interest issue in the context of a request for discovery. (ECF No. 33 at 3.) Even if this Court accepted Plaintiff's argument, his request for discovery based on an inherent conflict of interest still fails under\n   <em>\n    Foltz\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Klein\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff nevertheless insists that she has offered more than a mere allegation of bias or inherent conflict of interest because the minutes in the administrative record\n   do not reflect that the Trustees deliberated or weighed in any evidence when denying her claim. (ECF No. 29 at 7; ECF No. 33 at 3-4; A.R. at OOE 000173-OOE 000180 (copy of minutes from Trustees' meeting).) Plaintiff's argument is not well taken. Plaintiff's speculation that some bias or conflict of interest exists rests entirely on the fact that the minutes of the meeting do not detail any information about the Trustees' deliberations. In other words, Plaintiff contends the limited nature of the minutes warrants discovery even though nothing in those minutes suggests that bias or a conflict of interest influenced the Trustees' decision. Permitting discovery under these circumstances would open the door to discovery in many, if not all, ERISA cases, \"transforming the exception into the rule, and decimating case law underscoring the limited nature of ERISA discovery.\"\n   <em>\n    Alekna\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201251767\">\n    2018 WL 1251767\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.

Res.\n   </em>\n   , No. 10-13313,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%20133038\">\n    2011 WL 133038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (E.D.

Ky. Nov. 16, 2006) ).) For the reasons discussed above, Plaintiff's argument is unavailing. Moreover, the cases cited for this proposition are inapposite. In\n   <em>\n    Pediatric Special Care\n   </em>\n   , there were different versions of the administrative record and \"it is impossible\n   to determine what comprises the full administrative record on which the defendants relied when denying the plaintiff's claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Pediatric Special Care, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%20133038\">\n    2011 WL 133038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. In the present case, however, there is no evidence or suggestion that different versions of the administrative record exist such that discovery is needed to clarify the composition of the administrative record. Similarly,\n   <em>\n    Burklow\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable because of a different factual posture. In that case, the plaintiff alleged that administrative decisions were \"obviously skewed because they were based upon only the available and recorded contributions paid, instead of all contributions paid by Plaintiff's employer[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Burklow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%203354480\">\n    2006 WL 3354480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. The\n   <em>\n    Burklow\n   </em>\n   court authorized discovery related to only these issues.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%203354480\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, conversely, there is no evidence or allegation that the administrative decision in this case was distorted because of irregularities related to contributions. In short, the Court is not persuaded that the cases support the proposition for which they are cited. Accordingly, as it relates to her request for discovery based on these arguments, Plaintiff's Motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

(ECF No. 29 at 1, 9; ECF No. 33 at 8.)
