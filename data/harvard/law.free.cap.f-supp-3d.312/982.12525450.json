Crabtree, United States District Judge\n   Plaintiffs Steve Tronsgard and Medbor Chavez are former insurance agents for defendants-a group of entities that plaintiffs call \"the Farm Bureau family of companies.\" Doc. 41 at 12. The four defendants named in plaintiffs' Complaint are: (1) FBL Financial Group, Inc. (\"FBL Financial\"); (2) Farm Bureau Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Co. (\"FBP &amp; C\"); (3) Farm Bureau Life Insurance (\"FB Life\"); and (4) Western Agricultural Insurance Company (\"WAIC\"). Plaintiffs allege that defendants improperly classified them during their employment as independent contractors instead of employees. And plaintiffs, both individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, bring this lawsuit asserting claims arising from defendants' alleged misclassification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendants have responded to the lawsuit by filing a Motion to Dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), asserting that plaintiffs' First Amended Class Action Complaint fails to state a claim for relief. Doc. 31. Plaintiffs filed an Opposition to that motion. Doc. 41. And defendants submitted a Reply. Doc. 54. After the briefing closed, the court granted plaintiffs' motion to file a surreply and also permitted defendant to file a sur-surreply. Doc. 59. On January 23, 2018, plaintiffs filed their Surreply. Doc. 60. And on January 31, 2018, defendants filed their Sur-surreply. Doc. 62. The matter, to say the least, is fully briefed, and the court is prepared to rule. After considering the arguments and authorities presented in the parties' papers,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court grants defendants' Motion to Dismiss in part and denies it in part.

From 2014 to 2016, plaintiff Medbor Chavez worked as a Farm Bureau insurance agent in Kansas. Both plaintiffs signed an Agent Contract that classified them as independent contractors, not employees. But, in reality, defendants retained the right to control the manner, method, and means of virtually every facet of their insurance agents' work. Defendants did so by imposing various regulations, policies, and procedures that governed all its insurance agents. Thus, plaintiffs contend, defendants misclassified plaintiffs and other similarly situated insurance agents as independent contractors. And through this practice of misclassification, plaintiffs allege, defendants shirked their legal obligations to provide health, retirement, and other benefits to its insurance agents while reaping\n   the economic benefits of its captive workforce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs' Complaint asserts that defendants' misclassification gives rise to six causes of action: (1) Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (\"RICO\") violations under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201341\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1343, 1962(c) ; (2) Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\") violations under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B) ; (3) Kansas Wage Payment Act (\"KWPA\") violations under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Kan.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2044-313\">\n    Kan.

But, in the context of alleging mail or wire fraud, the court merely considers the alleged misrepresentations that defendant made-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that plaintiffs were independent contractors. That conclusion is a legal representation. It is not a misrepresentation of\n   <em>\n    fact\n   </em>\n   . Also, the Complaint never alleges that defendants made misrepresentations about any of the underlying factual issues used to determine employment status. Instead, the Complaint simply alleges that defendants made a legal representation to plaintiffs by classifying them as independent contractors and not employees. Such a statement cannot support an actionable fraud claim under the mail and wire fraud statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   For all these reasons, plaintiffs' Complaint fails to allege an actionable predicate act of mail or wire fraud capable of supporting a plausible RICO claim.

Defendants contend that Mr. Tronsgard's claims accrued when he signed his Agent Contract in 2003-more than 14 years before filing this lawsuit. And defendants argue, the statute of limitations expired for each of Mr. Tronsgard's claims before he filed suit. Thus, defendants assert, the court should dismiss Mr. Tronsgard's claims as a matter of law because they are time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In their Response, plaintiffs concede that the statute bars Mr. Tronsgard's KWPA (Count III), quantum meruit (Count IV), and unjust enrichment (Count V) claims. The court thus dismisses these claims from the lawsuit. However, plaintiffs contend that Mr. Tronsgard's RICO (Count I) and ERISA (Count III) claims are timely. But the court already has concluded that plaintiffs' Complaint fails to state a plausible RICO claim. So, the court\n   need not consider whether the statute of limitations bars plaintiff Tronsgard's RICO claim.

Also, plaintiffs contend that the accrual date is a question the court cannot resolve on a motion to dismiss. The court agrees with them. Plaintiffs' Complaint does not make it clear when Mr. Tronsgard discovered defendants' purported ERISA violation. To be sure, Mr. Tronsgard knew that defendants had classified him as an independent contractor and not an employee when he\n   signed his Agent Contract in 2003. But the independent contractor designation was not a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   ERISA violation. Instead, Mr. Tronsgard's ERISA claim arose when he discovered that defendants had\n   <em>\n    misclassified\n   </em>\n   him as an independent contractor. Viewing the Complaint in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, the court cannot conclude, as a matter of law, that Mr. Tronsgard discovered or should have discovered the misclassification before the statute of limitations expired.

City of Liberal, Kan.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20Fed.%20Appx.%20749\">\n    19 Fed.Appx. 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 768-69 (10th Cir. 2001) (affirming district court's dismissal of plaintiff's equal protection claim after it concluded that plaintiff had abandoned the claim because he had not addressed it in his memorandum opposing summary judgment);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    C.T. v.

Kan. 2008) (concluding that plaintiff had abandoned his retaliation claim by not responding to defendant's motion for summary judgment against the claim).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Also, as defendants explain, other courts have rejected requests to rescind employment agreements after execution because it is difficult to restore the parties to their pre-contract positions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baker v.

But it does not dismiss the quantum meruit claim. Plaintiff Chavez has stated a claim for quantum meruit that seeks relief-not in the form of rescission-but in the form of damages for lost business expenses and the quantum meruit value of services.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   For reasons explained above, the court grants defendants' Motion to Dismiss in part and denies it in part. The court dismisses the following claims from the action: plaintiffs' RICO (Count I) and declaratory relief (Count VI) claims, and plaintiff Tronsgard's KWPA, quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The following claims remain in the case: plaintiffs' ERISA claim (Count II), and plaintiff Chavez's KWPA (Count III), quantum meruit (Count IV), and unjust enrichment (Count V) claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED BY THE COURT THAT\n   </strong>\n   defendants' Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 31) is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    Earlier, the court denied plaintiffs' Unopposed Motion for Oral Argument, but without prejudice. Doc. 59. The court noted that it may request oral argument sometime in the future and at its discretion if it determined that it would assist the court's consideration of the issues.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9014371\" index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/361/470/#p485\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    After considering the parties' written submissions, the court finds that they explain the parties' positions quite effectively.

The court disagrees. The argument discussed in the preceding section explains that plaintiffs' RICO claim fails because it does not allege an enterprise distinct from the allegedly culpable persons. The argument discussed in this section explains that plaintiffs' RICO claim fails to state a claim because the Complaint never alleges that the enterprise's members joined together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct.
