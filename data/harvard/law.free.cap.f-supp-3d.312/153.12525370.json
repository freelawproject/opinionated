As a result, the Commission voted unanimously to close the files and \"[s]end the appropriate letters.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030122\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The letters informed the Plaintiffs of their right \"to seek judicial review of the Commission's dismissal.\" R. at 70-71, 73-74, 546-47, 550-51. The Commissioners who voted against an investigation released a Statement of Reasons in April 2016, R. at 75-89, which \"necessarily states the agency's reasons for acting as it did\" because it comes from the Commission's \"controlling group.\"\n   <em>\n    Fed.

R. at 75-76. The Commission also \"kept ... in mind\" (1) that the Commission had previously applied the straw donor ban \"almost exclusively\" in situations involving \"excessive and/or prohibited contributions,\" while the matters under review involved donations to super PACs not subject to such limitations, (2) that \"Commission precedent has treated funds deposited into a corporate account and then used for contributions as the funds of that corporation,\" (3) that the Commission had \"rejected an attribution rule that would deem the individual owners of corporate LLCs as the makers of those LLC's contributions,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (4) that \"the speech rights recognized in\n   <em>\n    Citizens United\n   </em>\n   would be hollow if closely held corporations and corporate LLCs were presumed to be straw donors-thus, triggering investigations and potential punishment-each time they made contributions.\" R. at 76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Commission therefore announced a new standard to evaluate straw donor allegations in this factual context, focused on \"whether the funds used to make a contribution were intentionally funneled through a closely held corporation or corporate LLC for the purpose of making a contribution that evades the Act's reporting requirements, making the individual ... the true source.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Commission declined to proceed with investigations of Plaintiffs' complaints, concluding that \"because past Commission decisions ... may be confusing in light of recent legal developments[;] principles of due process, fair notice, and First Amendment clarity counsel against applying a standard to persons and entities that were not on notice of the governing norm.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The three dissenting Commissioners reasoned that \"current law clearly prohibits contributors from using the names of\n   LLCs to shield their identity from disclosure to the public,\" and that the issue presented was \"not [ ] difficult.\" R. at 91-92. They acknowledged that \"the ability of individuals and corporations to make unlimited contributions to super PACs is a post-\n   <em>\n    Citizens United\n   </em>\n   ... phenomenon,\" but argued that \"the longstanding prohibition against making contributions in the name of another remains unchanged and squarely applies in these cases.\" R. at 92. In a separate Statement, two dissenting Commissioners criticized the controlling Commissioners for delaying their decision, and challenged the purpose-focused standard they had announced. R. at 95-97. The controlling Commissioners defended their conduct and the proposed standard in a Supplemental Statement. R. at 98-101.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

The Plaintiffs rely heavily on the argument that \"[a]pplication of section 30122 to corporate straw donors is ... mandated by the plain language of the statute,\" and \"necessary to effectuate Congress' interest in preventing the laundering of campaign money [to obscure] the true source[ ] of [ ] funds.\" Pls.' Mot. Summ. J. 25. But the Commission did not say otherwise. In fact, the Commission agreed that the plain language of Section 30122 applies to corporations, declaring that \"[u]nder certain circumstances, closely held corporations and corporate LLCS may be considered straw donors under section 30122.\" R. at 86. And the Commission did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   dismiss the complaints because it decided that the announced standard did not apply, but reasoned that \"[r]espondents were not provided adequate notice that their conduct could potentially violation section 30122.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 85.

R. at 81, 75-76. The Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Citizens United\n   </em>\n   held that \"the Government may not suppress political speech on the basis of the speaker's corporate identity,\" and struck down the Act's ban on certain corporate speech, including corporate contributions.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/\">\n    558 U.S. at 337, 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing and striking down 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441b, a provision since moved to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030118\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Corporations' ability to make federal campaign contributions cast the Act's straw donor prohibition in a new light.

R. at 81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In the post-\n   <em>\n    Citizens United\n   </em>\n   context, the Commission's existing regulations and precedent were less than helpful. In the only regulation governing LLCs, the Commission required (and still requires) \"partnership LLCs [and LLCs \"with a single natural person member that does not elect to be treated as a corporation\"] to attribute their contributions to their individual members[,] but provide[d] no similar instruction to corporate LLCs.\" R. at 85;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20110.1\">\n    11 C.F.R. \u00a7 110.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). The Commission in fact \"rejected [in 1998] a proposal to deem contributions by closely held corporate LLCs as contributions from their individual owners.\" R. at 85. And when investigating allegations of illegal corporate giving, the Commission had \"treat[ed] funds deposited in a corporate account as the corporation's funds, even if the corporation's owner could legally convert them into his or her own funds.\" R. at 83. In a case the Commission decided in 1995, an individual \"created a corporation to run a television ad and deposited his personal funds into the corporations account for the purpose of funding the ad,\" facts strikingly similar to some of the complaints at issue today. R. at 84-85. The Commission's General Counsel reasoned that the funds were corporate rather than personal, based on \"well established principle[s] of corporate law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20110.1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (alteration in original). In sum, corporate LLCs were left with little guidance in determining when they might be considered straw donors.

Tasked by Mr. Conard with the question of \"whether he could create an entity for the sole purpose of making a [contribution] ...

And the Commission's General Counsel shifted its\n   standard over the course of the five complaints, originally focusing on who exercised \"dominion or control\" over a corporation's contribution, and later deciding that the Commission must take a holistic view \"of the transaction itself and the arrangement between the parties to determine who in fact 'made' a given contribution.\" R. at 82 (citations omitted). As the Commission pointed out, this is \"presumably because 'direction or control' [are] necessarily present in all closely held corporations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The fact that these attorneys found the law difficult to apply supports the conclusion that the public lacked notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Plaintiffs make several unavailing arguments in support of the proposition that it would be \"illogical, irreconcilable with the [Act's] plain text, and unsupported by any precedent\" for any of the complaint respondents to conclude that they could legally make anonymous contributions using closely held corporations or corporate LLCs.
