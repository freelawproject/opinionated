(\"Plunderbund\"), John Michael Spinelli (\"Spinelli\"), and the Portage County Tea Party, Inc. (\"Tea Party\") (collectively \"plaintiffs\"). (Doc. No. 19 (\"Mot.\").) Plaintiffs opposed the motion (Doc. No. 20 (\"Opp'n\"), and defendants filed a reply (Doc. No. 22 (\"Reply\"). For the reasons that follow, defendants' motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   According to the complaint, plaintiffs publish and engage in \"provocative\" constitutionally protected speech \"online\" regarding local, state, and national politics. (Doc. No. 1 (\"Compl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4, 5, 6.) Plaintiffs allege that Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2917.21(B)(2) violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution because it criminalizes constitutionally protected political expression on the internet. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) Section 2917.21(B)(2) provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   No person shall knowingly post a text or audio statement or an image on an internet web site or web page for the purpose of abusing, threatening, or harassing another person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that defendants are authorized to enforce the statute (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 8, 9), and they are at risk of criminal prosecution if police or prosecutors believe that plaintiffs' online political expression is abusive or harassing\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   because the statutory exemption for mainstream media\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   does not apply to plaintiffs (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-19). Violation of \u00a7 2917.21(B) is a first degree misdemeanor for the first offense, and a fifth degree felony for each subsequent offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2917.21(C)(2) ; Compl. \u00b6 20, citing 2917.21(C)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In count one, plaintiffs allege that the statute restricts the content of speech and seek a declaration that \u00a7 2917.21(B)(2) is unconstitutionally overbroad. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 21-28.) In count two, plaintiffs claim that they have been chilled in the exercise of their right to engage in political speech under the First Amendment because of fear of prosecution and, unless \u00a7 2917.21(B)(2) is declared unconstitutional and its enforcement enjoined, plaintiffs will be irreparably harmed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29-35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2917.21(B)(1) is unconstitutional to the extent that it prohibits abusing and\n   harassing speech about a person, rather than directed to a person (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3), and to the extent that (B)(1) prohibits online expression for the purpose of abuse or harassment (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18). Plaintiffs do not assert any count with respect to \u00a7 2917.21(B)(1) but, in their prayer, seek the same relief as for \u00a7 2917.21(B)(2). (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On the same day that plaintiffs filed their complaint, they also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. (Doc. No. 2.) The Court conducted a telephonic conference to discuss the motion, and the parties agreed that defendants' anticipated motion to dismiss should be resolved before the Court addressed the motion for injunctive relief. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute Order and Order dated June 12, 2017.) The parties briefed defendants' motion to dismiss in accordance with the schedule established by the Court, and the motion is ripe for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

App. 2016) (affirming judgment of telecommunications harassment based upon on Facebook postings).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The owner and editor of plaintiff Plunderbund, Joseph Mismas, also submitted a declaration. He avers that Plunderbund operates a blog critical of the government and elected officials, and cites examples from as far back as 2013. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mismas Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 5, 6, 7.) As discussed above, Ohio courts found that online postings for the purpose of abuse and harassment were prohibited by \u00a7 2017.21(B)\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the statute was amended in 2016. Yet, Mismas does not claim that he (or Plunderbund) was ever warned, threatened, or prosecuted for Plunderbund's political blog postings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Finally, plaintiff Spinelli avers that, since 2006, he has published \"thousands\" of articles on his blog that were highly critical of public officials and the government. (Spinelli Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-6.) As discussed above, Spinelli's blog posts were telecommunications under \u00a7 2917.21(B) even before the 2016 amendment. Yet, Spinelli does not claim that he has ever been warned, threatened or prosecuted under \u00a7 2917.21(B) because the political expression on his blog was considered purposefully abusive or harassing under Ohio's telecommunications harassment statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiffs' declarations belie the claim that they face a credible threat of prosecution under \u00a7 2917.21(B)(2). They have never been warned or prosecuted under the telecommunications statute despite years of self-described sharp political expression online, notwithstanding that Ohio courts found social media and online internet communications to be a telecommunication under \u00a7 2917.21(B) well before the 2016 amendment. Moreover, no matter the nature of the telecommunications device, plaintiffs do not identify any cases where Ohio courts applied the telecommunications harassment statute to political expression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Ohio courts construe \u00a7 2917.21(B) narrowly\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The manner in which Ohio courts have construed and applied Ohio's telecommunications statute before the 2016 amendment further undermines plaintiffs' claim that they face a credible threat of prosecution under \u00a7 2917.21(B)(2). First, the statute has been construed by Ohio courts to prohibit abusive and harassing conduct, not the content of a telecommunication. The purpose of \u00a7 2917.21(B) is to stop \"criminal conduct, not the expression of offensive speech.\"\n   <em>\n    Ellison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=900%20N.E.2d%20228\">\n    900 N.E.2d at 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The statute operates to prohibit people from purposely making abusive, threatening, or harassing telecommunications; it does not restrict protected speech.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
