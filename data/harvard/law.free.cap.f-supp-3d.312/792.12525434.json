Humetewa, United States District Judge\n   This putative class action arises out of Defendant GoDaddy.com LLC's (\"GoDaddy\") alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"TCPA\"), which prohibits the making of any call, including text messages, using an automatic telephone dialing system, to any telephone number assigned to a cellular telephone service, without the called party's consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Pending before the Court are three fully briefed motions: (1) Plaintiff John Herrick's (\"Plaintiff\") Motion to Strike Defendant GoDaddy.com LLC's Fourth Affirmative Defense of Consent as Legally Deficient (Doc. 74); (2) GoDaddy's Motion to Exclude the Expert Report and Opinion of Jeffrey A. Hansen (Doc. 83); and (3) GoDaddy's Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the Alternative, Motion to Stay (Doc. 79).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court finds that undisputed material facts show that GoDaddy did not use an automatic telephone dialing system (\"ATDS\") to send the text in question. As such, Plaintiff cannot establish a claim under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\"TCPA\"). Summary judgment is thus granted in favor of GoDaddy. Because this finding is not predicated on the Federal Communications Commission's (\"FCC\") \"potential capacity\" guidance, GoDaddy's request to stay these proceedings is denied. GoDaddy's Motion to Exclude Plaintiff's expert and Plaintiff's Motion to Strike GoDaddy's affirmative defense are denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   GoDaddy is a provider of web-based products and services, including domain name registration, website hosting, and other online business applications. (Doc. 79 at 1; First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\"), Doc. 27 at \u00b6 25). In 2015, GoDaddy contracted with a web-based software application company called 3Seventy, Inc. (\"3Seventy\") to send a one-text marketing campaign to nearly 100,000 of its customers using its 3Seventy Platform. (GoDaddy's Statement of Undisputed Fact (\"Def. SOF\"), Doc. 80 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2; Plaintiff's Separate Controverting Statement of Undisputed Facts (\"Pl. CSOF\"), Doc. 91 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   To conduct a text campaign using the 3Seventy Platform, a user must provide 3Seventy with a list of customer phone numbers, something GoDaddy did via its file transfer protocol (\"FTP\") site. (Def. SOF \u00b6 7; Pl. CSOF \u00b6 7).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   3Seventy then uploads the list of numbers to its 3Seventy Platform. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A user like GoDaddy navigates to the website, manually logs onto 3Seventy's Platform, and determines which numbers it would like to send a text message. (Def. SOF \u00b6\u00b6 8, 9; Pl. CSOF \u00b6\u00b6 8, 9). The user creates a message by manually typing in the desired content and selecting a time and date that the message will be sent. (Def. SOF \u00b6\u00b6 10, 11; Pl. CSOF \u00b6\u00b6 10, 11). As a final step, the user must type in what is referred to as a \"captcha\"-here, twelve alphanumeric values-to approve and authorize sending the message. (Def. SOF \u00b6 12; Pl. CSOF \u00b6 12). On the date and time specified by the user, the 3Seventy Platform sends the message to a Short\n   Messaging Service (\"SMS\") gateway aggregator that then transmits the message directly to the cell phone carrier. (Pl. Separate Statement of Additional Supporting Facts (\"Pl. SSOF \u00b6 20). Plaintiff received the offending text on December 15, 2015. (FAC, Doc. 27 \u00b6 28). The single text message offered Plaintiff a \"promo code\" to \"save 40% on new products.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff alleges that GoDaddy sent the text to him without his consent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff filed this action on January 28, 2016, asserting a single TCPA violation against GoDaddy. On August 9, 2016, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint. (FAC, Doc. 27). On February 1, 2017, GoDaddy answered the FAC, asserting, among others, the affirmative defense of consent. (Answer, Doc. 68). On March 3, 2017, Plaintiff moved to strike GoDaddy's consent defense as legally deficient. (Doc. 74). Soon thereafter, the parties completed the phased discovery ordered by the Court. (Doc. 38). This limited discovery was ordered in part so that the parties could explore whether the 3Seventy Platform was an ATDS under the TCPA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 31, 2017, GoDaddy filed for summary judgment on the sole grounds that the 3Seventy Platform is not an ATDS. GoDaddy alternatively asked that, if the Court was inclined to deny summary judgment in reliance on the FCC's \"potential capacity\" guidance, the Court stay these proceedings pending the Ninth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Marks v. Crunch San Diego\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-56834 (9th Cir. 2016). On March 31, 2017, GoDaddy also moved to exclude the report and opinions of Plaintiff's expert Jeffrey A. Hansen. (Doc. 83). All of the pending motions are opposed and fully briefed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court will first address GoDaddy's motion for summary judgment and the accompanying motion to stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

One of the issues that has repeatedly been raised is whether a device can qualify as an ATDS even though the device itself does not have the capacity to generate numbers randomly or sequentially. The FCC's guidance on these queries became increasingly muddled after it determined that \"predictive dialers\" should be included in the definition of an ATDS. Commonly used by telemarketers, predictive dialers are devices that, among other things, dial numbers from preprogrammed lists as opposed to numbers that are randomly or sequentially generated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In deciding to include predictive dialers in the definition of an ATDS, the FCC noted that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [T]o exclude from [the restrictions on automated and prerecorded calls] equipment that use [sic] predictive dialing software from the definition of \"automated telephone dialing equipment\" simply because it relies on a given set of numbers would lead to an unintended result.

First, an employee of GoDaddy provided 3Seventy with a list of customer phone numbers via its FTP site, which 3Seventy then uploaded to the Platform. (Def. SOF \u00b6 7; Pl. CSOF \u00b6 7). The employee then navigated to the website, logged onto 3Seventy's Platform, and selected the customer numbers it wished to send the text message. (Def. SOF \u00b6\u00b6 8, 9; Pl. CSOF \u00b6\u00b6 8, 9). The employee then drafted the message and selected a time and date to send the message. (Def. SOF \u00b6\u00b6 10-11; Pl. CSOF \u00b6\u00b6 10-11). Finally, the employee entered a \"captcha\"-a device designed to ensure that a human, not a robot, was authorizing the desired message. (Def. SOF \u00b6 12; Pl. CSOF \u00b6 12). Only after the employee entered the captcha was the 3Seventy Platform able to send the message.

To send texts through that platform, an employee would similarly (1) input the numbers, either by typing them into the website or uploading them from an existing list of numbers; (2) log onto the platform to draft the message content; (3) designate the specific phone numbers to receive the message; and (4) click \"send\" on the website to transmit the message, which could be done either in real time or calendared to send at some future date.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court there found that \"human intervention was involved in several stages of the process prior to Plaintiff's receipt of the text message, and was not limited to the act of uploading the telephone numbers to the [platform's] database, as Plaintiff argues.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 941.
