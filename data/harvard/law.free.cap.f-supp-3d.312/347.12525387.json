The agreed-upon base offense level is 30. USSG 2A3.1(a)(2) ; \u00a7 2G1.3(c)(3). The offense level was enhanced by four points: two because the offense involved a victim between age twelve and sixteen, USSG 2G2.1(b)(1)(B), and an additional two because the offense involved the use of a computer to persuade a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct, USSG 2G2.1(b)(6)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The offense level was decreased by three points: two because defendant has clearly demonstrated acceptance of responsibility, USSG \u00a7 3E1.1(a), and one because the government was notified in a timely manner of Defendant's intention to enter a plea of guilty, USSG \u00a7 3E1.1(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The total offense level is 31. Defendant has no prior convictions, establishing a criminal history category of I. This yields a Guideline imprisonment range of 120 to 135 months.

He lived with his mother and two half-siblings, age 18 and 8. PSR \u00b6\u00b6 83-85. Defendant's parents separated when he was\n   six months old; he has had no contact with his father in 15 years. PSR \u00b6\u00b6 87, 83. He currently has no assets and was financially supported by his mother. PSR \u00b6\u00b6 122-26. He is unable to pay a fine. PSR \u00b6 126.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Defendant was evaluated by a doctor, who concluded that he has significant emotional problems and delays in his maturation caused by his father abandoning him and by school bullying. PSR \u00b6 102. The doctor concluded that Defendant stopped developing emotionally at a young age and shows symptoms of depression and anxiety.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The medical opinion is that Defendant suffers from a Borderline Personality Disorder. PSR \u00b6 104.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Defendant received an Individualized Education Program in school because he was developmentally delayed. PSR \u00b6 96. He was admitted to a hospital in high school after a suicide attempt. PSR \u00b6 97. He has received medical treatment for depression. PSR \u00b6 96. He has attended court-mandated sex offender group therapy sessions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   While awaiting sentencing, Defendant again attempted suicide. He addressed this suicide attempt at sentencing: \"I felt it wasn't worth it, so I took the liberty to try to end myself. I felt it was easier because, you know, $10,000 of funeral funds versus 10 years of commissary and work.\" Hr'g Tr. 21:2-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The court noted at sentencing: \"[A]lthough this is a very serious offense ... and even though his actions created serious harm, the 10 years is excessive. He would be less of a threat and ... would recover more readily with a lower sentence of incarceration, but the court has no capacity to impose a lesser sentence.\" Hr'g Tr. 34:6-12. Early medical treatment outside of prison would help him more and be more protective of the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   It should be noted that prison time will be exceptionally hard for this defendant. He is of slight build. When other prisoners find out about his crime, some will attack him for sexual reasons or to punish him. Protection will probably require long periods in solitary confinement, increasing pressure for suicide. The ten-year minimum is too long for this defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendant is sentenced to ten years imprisonment, five years of supervised release and no fine. All relevant issues under the guidelines have been considered. Special attention was given to factors listed under 18 U.S.C. 3553(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
