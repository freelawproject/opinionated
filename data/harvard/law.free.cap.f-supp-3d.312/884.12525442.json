In their motion for summary judgment, Defendants ask the Court to reconsider Plaintiffs' standing, arguing that, in light of the complete administrative record, Plaintiffs have not established economic or environmental injuries.

According to Defendants, Plaintiffs' declarations in support of their motion for summary judgment suggest that there is an attenuated chain of causation between Argentine lemon imports and competitive injury to domestic growers that rests on \"speculative contingencies.\" The Court disagrees. Its initial conclusion that the Rule caused injury to domestic lemon growers was based primarily on APHIS's\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   conclusions about likely economic harm to domestic lemon growers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 36 at 10 (\"APHIS's own predictions show that the increase in supply will lead to a drop in price relative to what the price would otherwise be, and predicts that domestic lemon growers will suffer millions of dollars of economic loss as a result\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR16-17, 28, 30.

The Pest Risk Assessment conducted by APHIS identified no fewer than seven quarantine pests that would have the potential to be introduced to the United States through exported fruit. AR106-107. Defendants argue that the risk of such pests establishing in the United States is speculative, but that conclusion is contradicted by APHIS's own Pest Risk Assessment. It is undisputed that the unregulated import of Argentine lemons would pose a risk to domestic citrus. The question, therefore, is whether that risk is adequately addressed by the regulation. Whether the systems approach described in the Final Rule is an arbitrary and capricious exercise of APHIS's judgment-or whether it sufficiently mitigates the risks of any quarantine pest establishing on domestic soil-is a question that is bound up in the merits of this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 36 at 15 (\"The 'likelihood and extent of impact' of the alleged environmental harm are questions should be addressed with the merits\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Save Our Heritage, Inc. v.

Defendants dispute the characterization of the report as critical, stating that the purpose of the trip was to assist in the development of the operational work plan, and disputing Plaintiffs' contention that the 2015 site visit was \"among the primary bases for concluding that SENASA can comply with the systems approach[.]\" (ECF No. 35-1 at 15.) Defendants note that the report summarizing the later September 2016 site visit, which was disclosed to the public for comment, was used in assessing SENASA's oversight capabilities and relied on by APHIS in formulating the Final Rule. (ECF No. 39-1 at 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Whether or not the document was \"critical,\" it certainly was not unique, nor did its non-disclosure prevent meaningful comment on SENASA's oversight capabilities. The 2016 Trip Report addresses the same central issue addressed in the 2015 Trip Report-Argentina's progress in implementing the systems approach.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   AR 26207-34\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   AR25905-24. Plaintiff argues that disclosure of the 2016 Trip Report was not sufficient, because the 2016 trip took place after the harvest season, and therefore the delegation was not able to observe Argentine growers' compliance with, and SENASA's oversight of, harvesting and packinghouse procedures. However, this subject was addressed in several documents available for public comment, including the Risk Management Document, the Proposed Rule itself, and the 2016 Trip Report. AR25905-24; AR156-59; AR168-70. Indeed, the 2016 Trip Report discusses pesticides used by Argentine growers (including dosages), the fruit fly trapping requirement, harvest and packing requirements, the number of SENASA inspectors, and more.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR25907-13. The information contained in the 2015 Trip Report was duplicative of other information contained in the September 2016 Trip Report, and identified elsewhere throughout the Proposed Rule. However, the September 2016 trip came later in the process, therefore was arguably more central and relevant to APHIS's determination of whether SENASA could reach compliance than the 2015 trip. Therefore, the failure to disclose this report was not material and does not require the reopening of the public comment period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aina Nui Corp. v.

As Defendants point out, without access to those types of documents, the public is unable to point out errors in methodology, data selection, and sampling. By contrast, the 2015 Trip Report merely provides a summary of the 2015 site visit. Plaintiffs are not disputing the factual accuracy of the report-there is no methodology\n   or data selection to critique-but rather arguing that the agency should have used the report to reach a different conclusion about whether it could rely on SENASA to execute its obligations under the Final Rule.\n   <em>\n    Bear Valley Mut.

Plaintiffs argue that the report evinces SENASA's continued failure to implement procedures in line with APHIS's requirement-an argument that could equally be based on the disclosed 2016 Trip Report or any number of other documents. In other words, Plaintiffs are not arguing that their comments would have made any substantively unique comments if they had an opportunity to comment on the 2015 Trip Report. Rather, Plaintiff objects that the agency should have considered the information in the report to come to a different conclusion. That argument will be addressed with Plaintiffs' other substantive arguments and APHIS's conclusion will be subject to review to determine whether it was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Bear Valley Mut.

Specifically, they argue that the OWP eliminates the requirement that SENASA visit production facilities, eliminates the requirement that discovery of honeydew moths or citrus borers in any stage of development trigger corrective measures, alters the rule regarding how much fruit will be prohibited from export in the event that pests are found, and omits procedures to ensure compliance with other aspects of the Final Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs argue that under the\n   <em>\n    Idaho Farm Bureau\n   </em>\n   standard, the OWP contains critical and unique information regarding the implementation of the systems approach and therefore should have been disclosed during the notice and comment period prior to finalization of the Final Rule. The Final Rule makes frequent reference to the OWP, and the OWP contains specifics about how day to day operations will be overseen and monitored that were not available in any other materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Defendants counter each of these arguments. Defendants argue that the OWP is at most an interpretive rule that merely clarifies and explains, but does not replace, the Final Rule. Second, Defendants counter each of the alleged discrepancies between the OWP and the Final Rule, explaining why the two documents are consistent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lastly, Defendants argue that the scope of the proposed OWP was identified in the Proposed Rule such that Plaintiffs and the public had ample opportunity to comment on it, and that it does not provide essential support for the Final Rule itself under\n   <em>\n    Idaho Farm Bureau\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    a.\n    <em>\n     Legislative Rule v.

The OWP does not fit neatly within either category described in\n   <em>\n    Hemp Industries\n   </em>\n   : the OWP is more than an explanation of the rule, but it also does not create new rights or obligations that go beyond what is spelled out in the final rule. Rather, the rule describes the day to day procedure of the systems approach, which is described in more general terms in the Final Rule. The Court therefore turns to whether the OWP is inconsistent with the Final Rule to assist in determining whether the OWP has the force of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiffs identify several provisions in the OWP that they assert are inconsistent with the Final Rule. Plaintiffs argue that the work plan does not require SENASA to \"visit and inspect registered places of production regularly throughout the exporting season,\" as required by the Final Rule.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20319.56-76\">\n    7 C.F.R. \u00a7 319.56-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5). However, the Court can find no provision in the OWP that relieves SENASA of that obligation. Indeed, the OWP contemplates that SENASA will conduct regular inspections of production facilities. AR28348, \u00a7 2.3.4; AR28362, \u00a7 3.2.10.1; AR28357, \u00a7 5.1. Plaintiffs argue that the OWP requires only \"periodic\" as opposed to \"regular\" inspections, and that it otherwise fails to delineate when and how such inspections are carried out. As an initial matter, it is not apparent to the Court that there is a material difference between \"regular\" and \"periodic\" inspections. The purported failure of the OWP to provide more specificity on these inspections does not evince a procedural violation. To the extent that the OWP does not provide a more specific plan for inspections of production areas, it does not in any way alleviate SENASA of the responsibility to do so under the Final Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue the Final Rule's requirement that \"if a single\n   <em>\n    C. gnidiella\n   </em>\n   [honeydew moth] or\n   <em>\n    G. aurantianum\n   </em>\n   [citrus borer] in any stage of development is found on the lemons, the entire consignment is prohibited from export to the United States,\" AR 00014,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20319.56-76\">\n    7 C.F.R. \u00a7 319.56-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(4)(i), is replaced in the OWP, where the discovery of these pests only in the \"immature stages\" of development would trigger the export prohibition, AR28370. Defendants counter that the mature stages of these pests are moths, and therefore only the immature stages present a risk of being transmitted through imported lemons \"because the adult stages can fly, and do not rely on lemons as host material.\" (ECF No. 39-1 at 22.) In other words, only the immature stages of these pests are found likely to be found \"on the lemon.\" Moreover, nothing in the OWP presupposes that the discovery of pests past the immature stage would not trigger \"corrective measures\"-even if those measures did not necessarily result in a prohibition of the export of all fruit in that consignment. Indeed, the OWP does mandate suspensions and other corrective measures and remedial actions when quarantine pests are discovered. AR28356, \u00a7 4.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Relatedly, Plaintiffs argue that the Final Rule prohibits export of the \"entire consignment\" whenever inspectors discover pests or mites,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2031956-76\">\n    7 C.F.R. \u00a7 31956-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(4)(i), (ii), but that under the OWP, only the\n   <em>\n    \"lot\"\n   </em>\n   will be rejected, AR28370.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20319.56-2\">\n    7 C.F.R. \u00a7 319.56-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defining a \"lot\" as \"forming all or part of a consignment\"). Defendants respond that the inspections referenced in the OWP take place before the lot is designated as part of any larger consignment, and therefore rejection of the lot represents rejection of the largest designated unit in which the pest is discovered. No material conflict exists between the Rule and the OWP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR28355, \u00a7 3.1.4.14 (\"Only lots passing inspection will be eligible for consignment\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Lastly, Plaintiffs argue that the OWP impermissibly allows packinghouses to process fruits destined for the United States and other markets at the same time. Defendants respond that the Final Rule requires all fruits being simultaneously processed in packinghouses exporting fruit to the U.S. to process according to U.S. standards. This is not inconsistent with the Final Rule, which requires only that \"[d]uring the time registered packinghouses are in use for packing lemons for export to the continental United States, the packinghouses may only accept lemons that are from registered places of production and that have been produced in accordance with the requirements of this section.\" Therefore, there is no discrepancy between the Final Rule and the OWP in this regard; packinghouses may simultaneously pack fruit for export to the United States and other markets so long as\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   fruit is processed and packed according to the standards set forth in the Final Rule and required for export to the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In sum, the Court does not believe that a reasonable reading of the Final Rule and the OWP evinces any material discrepancies such that the OWP substantively changes the regulation, thereby rendering it a legislative rule. Therefore, the OWP is correctly categorized as an interpretive rule that offers guidance on the day-to-day implementation of the Final Rule under the\n   <em>\n    Hemp Industries\n   </em>\n   standard.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9113824\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/1082/#p1087\">\n    333 F.3d at 1087\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ultimately, the OWP does not seek to expand or reduce the scope of the Final Rule, nor does it modify it. Rather, the OWP offers a \"crisper and more detailed guidance\" on the Final Rule.\n   <em>\n    Aulenback, Inc. v. Fed. Highway Admin.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1032,3697671\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/103/156/\">\n    103 F.3d 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 168 (D.C.

Accordingly, because the OWP is not a legislative rule, notice and comment were not required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Moreover, as a practical matter, the agency should not be hamstrung by the current form of the OWP. So long as their operational work plan complies with the strictures of the Final Rule, the agency has discretion to make incremental decisions regarding how best to execute the systems approach. Requiring notice and comment on the OWP would serve only to lock the agency into specific methods for executing the systems approach. The agency requires some discretion, always within the bounds of the Final Rule, to execute certain aspects of the Rule, especially taking into account technological advances. For example, as the agency points out, it should have \"the administrative flexibility to decide that different types of fruit fly traps should be used, or a different attractant should be used.\" ECF No. 39-1 at 21. The agency has discretion to give further guidance on a Final Rule without subjecting that additional guidance to notice and comment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1032,3697671\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/103/156/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (noting that the agencies \"do not develop written guidelines to aid their exercise of discretion only at the peril of having a court transmogrify those guidelines into binding norms subject to notice and comment strictures.\" (quotation marks and citations omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n    <em>\n     Critical Or Unique Information\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiffs further contend that the OWP should have been disclosed to the public for notice and comment under the\n   <em>\n    Idaho Farm Bureau\n   </em>\n   standard, discussed above with respect to the non-disclosure of the 2015 Trip Report,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 896-97.

Moreover, the Proposed Rule clearly set forth the intended subject matter and scope of the OWP, which allowed Plaintiffs ample opportunity to comment on it. AR168-70. For example, the Proposed Rule indicated that the OWP would address treatment for Medfly in lemons harvested yellow, specifications for how lemons destined for export to the United States are safeguarded during transport from production places to packinghouses, and the means of identification for tracing each lemon exported through the United States back to its place of production. AR169. Indeed, the OWP was formulated using the same documents that provided the essential support for the Final Rule-such as the Pest Risk Assessment and Risk Management document.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR61-153; AR154-166. Those documents were properly disclosed, and the OWP does not deal with subject matter outside the scope of what was provided for in the Final Rule or the other essential documents disclosed for notice and comment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that \"changes to the Medfly trapping protocol...appear for the first time\" in the OWP. The OWP calls for Medfly trapping 35 days before the estimated date of harvest in the second and subsequent years of exporting (AR28364), where the previously disclosed Risk Management Document had called for a one-year period (AR 169). However, the Proposed Rule clearly indicated that the Medfly trapping protocol would appear in the OWP, AR170, and the disclosed 2016 Trip Report, which was available to the public for notice and comment, noted that APHIS and SENASA might shorten the length of time necessary for trapping, AR25905-06, giving the Plaintiffs ample notice and opportunity to provide comment on the appropriate length of time for Medfly trapping. The OWP did not provide any truly unique information such that its non-disclosure deprived the public of opportunity for notice and comment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In support of their argument that the OWP should have been disclosed under\n   <em>\n    Idaho Farm Bureau\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs cite\n   <em>\n    Center for Biological Diversity v.

In essence, the agency had determined that the management plan of another governmental body, the San Carlos Apache Tribe, was sufficient to address the habitat issues such that further agency action was unnecessary to protect the Mexican spotted owl in San Carlos Apache territory. The court determined that the agency erred in failing to disclose the management plan, which it principally relied on in coming to its decision. Here, by contrast, the OWP is merely a practical extension of the Final Rule itself, which relied on all of the same underlying documents and studies. Unlike\n   <em>\n    Norton\n   </em>\n   , there is no ambiguity regarding the scope and source of the OWP, which was disclosed in the Proposed Rule, and draws in practical effect from numerous other documents disclosed during the administrative proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Plaintiffs also cited\n   <em>\n    Friends of the Earth v.

First, Plaintiffs argue, the agency could not have made this determination in the first instance prior to completing the OWP, because the agency had not defined the rules with which SENASA was required to comply. Second, APHIS did not take the necessary steps to ensure that SENASA was capable of complying with the rule until they visited Argentina during harvest season only\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   issuing the Final Rule.

Lastly, APHIS will set the standards for port-of-entry inspections in the United States conducted by Customs and Border Protection officials. \u00a7 319.56-76(d).

The agency determined that the \"routine reviews and inspections\" outlined in the Final Rule\n   were adequate, and determined that heightened oversight \"tantamount to [a] mandatory preclearance program\" was not necessary under the circumstances. AR8. This assessment was based on APHIS's site visits, during which time it \"looked at SENASA's infrastructure and asked questions to address their capacity to provide oversight\" AR2, and also verified information provided by SENASA regarding pests.

The agency also considered the fact that Argentina is a member of the World Trade Organization, and has \"demonstrated the[ir] ability to comply with U.S. regulations with respect to other export programs.

Since that decision, issued over sixteen years ago, SENASA has taken significant steps to address its errors, as APHIS documented in the administrative record. AR26197-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that the agency erred in relying on Argentina's export program to the European Union as evidence that SENASA was capable of complying with the systems approach, pointing out that the European Union \"repeatedly intercepted citrus shipments from Argentina with the causal agent of Citrus Black Spot.\" ECF No. 35-1 at 25 (citing AR250 &amp; n.20). As Defendants point out, the majority of those interceptions occurred before February 2016, when the EU and SENASA implemented new measure targeted at intercepting Citrus Black Spot (\"CBS\"). AR1501-1533. Prior to that time, the EU did not require specific mitigations for CBS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Although the interception of any quarantine pests is concerning, the record indicates that SENASA worked with the EU\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   following these interceptions to implement an action plan aimed at mitigating the risk of exporting CBS-infected fruit. APHIS also put in place more stringent measures than those required by the EU which will be overseen by APHIS. It was not unreasonable for the agency to conclude that SENASA could be relied on to implement its more stringent procedures in light of the full record. Moreover, this approach is particularly reasonable in light of APHIS's scientific judgment that CBS is unlikely to follow the commercial fruit pathway,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   at 905-07, and therefore unlikely to present a risk to domestic crops even if infected fruit did make its way to the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n    <em>\n     APHIS's Evaluation Of SENASA Prior To Completion Of The OWP\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that it was irrational for APHIS to conclude that it could rely on SENASA prior to completing the final OWP. Plaintiffs reason that until APHIS outlined exactly what SENASA's oversight responsibilities would be, it could not adequately assess whether SENASA was capable of providing that oversight. This position misconstrues the nature of the OWP and the rulemaking process. As an initial matter, and as this Court concluded above, the OWP is an interpretive rule. The Final Rule sets the parameters of the systems approach, and governs SENASA's responsibilities. The OWP merely flushes out that systems approach. Therefore, APHIS's determination that SENASA was capable of carrying out the oversight outlined in the Final Rule, with APHIS's oversight, was sufficient. APHIS did not need to make additional findings of SENASA's capacity for oversight with respect to the OWP. Moreover, it would be illogical to require APHIS to have an OWP, necessarily dependent on the requirements put in place by the Final Rule, in place before the Rule was finalized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    c.\n    <em>\n     APHIS's Evaluation Of SENASA Prior To 2017 Site Visit\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Lastly, Plaintiffs argue that it was irrational for APHIS to conclude that SENASA was capable of compliance with the Final Rule prior to completing a final site visit. Plaintiffs argue that Defendants could not reasonably be assured that SENASA was capable of oversight based on the prior site visits alone, which each indicated that SENASA was not yet in full compliance with the Final Rule. Defendants counter that the regulated party, in this case SENASA, need not be in full compliance with the Rule prior to its enactment, and that imposing such a requirement exceeds what is required under the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Final Rule lifts the ban on Argentine lemon imports and imposes a system for imports going forward. It does not authorize any particular entity to begin exporting lemons. The administrative record indicates that authorization will be given to producers and packinghouses that demonstrate full compliance with the requirements of the Final Rule. AR28378. There is no legal or logical support for the notion that APHIS must wait to lift the ban until it ensures 100% compliance with the terms of the Final Rule. APHIS made several site visits to ensure that SENASA and the Argentine lemon industry were moving towards compliance with the likely terms of the Final Rule prior to its enactment. It was not irrational to rely on its judgment that those entities would continue to move toward compliance in an effort to comply with the Final Rule after it was promulgated, particularly given APHIS's role in overseeing and supervising compliance with the Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Scientific Evidence Regarding Citrus Black Spot\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that APHIS arbitrarily and capriciously dismissed new scientific\n   evidence bearing on the risk of the transmission of CBS, one of the quarantine pests present in Argentine lemons. Specifically Plaintiffs accuse the agency of ignoring a 2014 study from the European Union calling into question the conventional understanding-expressed in the agency's Pest Risk Assessment-that CBS cannot be transmitted on citrus fruit without leaves. In the Final Rule, the agency indicated only that they \"disagree[d] with the EU regarding the transmissibility of CBS via commercially produced fruit.\" AR5. Plaintiffs argue that this summary dismissal of the EU study, without additional explanation, was arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Defendants counter that, having thoroughly reviewed the 2014 EU study, APHIS stands by the conclusion of its own 2010 peer-reviewed study, which found that the risk of CBS is unlikely to be meaningfully increased by the commercial importation of citrus. Defendants further assert that their reasoning for rejecting that study can be properly discerned from the administrative record as a whole, and therefore they need not have provided additional rationale in their response to comments in the Final Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   As an initial matter, Defendants are correct that the rationale for favoring the 2010 study over the EU study need not be apparent from the response to comments in the Final Rule, so long as \"the record as a whole satisfies the APA's requirements[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Epsilon Elecs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   v\n   <em>\n    .

As both parties acknowledge, the presence of such trees, which can serve as host material for pests and diseases, increases the risk that any pest or disease that makes it to the United States will spread in domestic fruit crops. Defendants argue that the systems approach mitigates the risk that any pest or disease will be introduced in the United States in the first instance. If the pests or diseases are never introduced on U.S. soil, they cannot spread in domestic citrus, thus eliminating the need to consider the prevalence of citrus in California at all. Defendants also point out that they did consider the availability of host material in the Pest Risk Assessment. ECF No. 42 at 16 (citing AR3044 (\"While California...could reasonably receive the highest number of infected fruit only a small portion of the state has a climate suitable for CBS development...and the majority of commercial citrus grown in California is not grown in in that area[.]\"); AR103 (Pest Risk Assessment noting that\n   <em>\n    Brevipalpus spp.\n   </em>\n   mites colonize \"more than 900 plant species.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The administrative record indicates that the agency did not abuse its discretion in failing to consider explicitly the presence of residential citrus in California. The agency did not \"entirely fail to consider an important aspect of the problem\" because in its scientific judgment, the systems approach would prevent quarantine pests from ever reaching the United States, thus obviating the need to consider the density of residential citrus in California as potential\n   host material.\n   <em>\n    Ranchers Cattlemen Action Legal Fund v. U.S. Dep't of Agric.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654960\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/499/1108/#p1115\">\n    499 F.3d 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1115 (9th Cir. 2007). The Rule endeavors to ensure in the first instance that quarantine pests never leave Argentine, and in the second instance that if they do somehow make it to United States ports, that they are identified during port inspections, and that remedial measures are put in place. In short, the agency considered the quarantine pests, put in place mitigation measures to address those pests before they could ever reach the United States, and determined that these measures ensured that there would be nothing for domestic citrus crops to \"host.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Moreover, implicitly, the agency did consider the issue of domestic citrus plants overall in designing the systems approach. The Pest Risk Assessment included an \"[a]ssessment of the probability that a plant pest will come into contact with host material\" taking into account \"the availability, in time and space, of its host plants.\" AR121. Those assessments led to a protocol for pest-specific mitigation that started well before imported fruit ever reached the port of entry inspection. Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the agency erred in its assessment of the risks posed by the availability of host material. Whether the agency's planned approach is wise is not for the Court to decide. So long as the requirements of the APA are satisfied, the agency is charged with making such policy decisions within the guidelines set forth by statute and regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Foreign Policy Considerations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that APHIS was impermissibly influenced by foreign policy considerations \"rather than science alone\" in promulgating the Final Rule lifting the ban on Argentine lemon imports. In support of their argument that foreign policy was impermissibly considered, Plaintiffs point to the fact that after years of considering the Argentine lemon industry, the lifting of the ban was announced just six weeks after President Obama visited Argentina. Thereafter, in April 2017, the President Trump met with President Macri of Argentina. President Trump indicated that he intended to use the lifting of the lemon import ban as a bargaining chip in exchange for Argentina's support in the United States' efforts to negotiate with North Korea.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 37-2 \u00b6 33. Four days after the meeting, APHIS announced that the Rule, the implementation of which had previously been delayed due to the intervening change in administration, would go into effect May, 26, 2017. Defendants counter that there is no evidence in the record to suggest that the timing of these meetings alone is meaningful, nor that these meetings had any bearing on the substance of the Final Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   There is simply no support in the record for the proposition that foreign policy considerations overcame the agency's scientific judgment in formulating the rule. Plaintiffs' argument that the timing of President Obama's presidential visit was the impetus for the lifting of the ban is purely speculative and not supported by the record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even if foreign policy was the impetus for the announcement that the ban was being lifted,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   there is no evidence\n   in the record, or outside it, to suggest that the agency disregarded scientific evidence in favor of foreign policy considerations in coming to its decision, nor that foreign policy considerations had any bearing whatsoever on the\n   <em>\n    substance\n   </em>\n   of Rule. Indeed, Plaintiffs argue that President Trump's 2017 meeting with President Macri evinced improper interference with the rulemaking process, but at the time that meeting took place,\n   <em>\n    the Final Rule had already been issued\n   </em>\n   . Therefore, President Trump's negotiations with President Macri could not have had any bearing on the notice and comment rulemaking process or the substance of the Final Rule. There is nothing in the record to indicate that foreign policy concerns had an improper bearing on the agency's rulemaking process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    5.\n    <em>\n     Northeast Port Limitation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   As mentioned, for 2017 and 2018, Argentine lemons will be imported only into the northeastern United States. Plaintiffs argue that the northeast port limitation undermines the substantive rationality of the Rule, because it implies that the systems approach is not sufficient in the short term to protect domestic citrus crops in California from the threat of quarantine pests. (ECF No. 35-1 at 33.) Defendants deny that the northeast port limitation is an implicit concession that the Rule itself is flawed. Rather, Defendants posit that the limitation was a concession, proposed by the Argentine government, to U.S. lemon producers who expressed concerns about the importation of Argentine lemons from both a phytosanitary and an economic perspective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The northeast port limitation is a temporary restriction on importing Argentine lemons to the west coast. It is set to expire after 2018. (ECF No. 36 at 9-10.) The Final Rule itself does not restrict imports to northeast ports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   There is no evidence in the record to support Plaintiffs' theory that the northeast port limitation undermines the scientific basis for the Final Rule. The record contains a letter from an official from the Argentine Ministry of Agriculture, who wrote that he \"read about the concerns of US lemon producers regarding introduction of pests and diseases and of Argentine lemons flooding the US market.\" AR28334. Although the official characterized the concerns as \"unfounded,\" and affirmed that he believed that there was \"thorough scientific support\" for the Final Rule, he proposed restricting lemon imports to the North Atlantic \"during the first few marketing\n   seasons.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654960\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/499/1108/#p1115\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He more or less characterized this offer as a show of good faith to domestic producers, who were concerned that Argentine producers would flood the market with cheap imports. He indicated that he hoped that the northeast port restriction would \"serve to demonstrate the Argentine commitment to supply the US summer lemon market with limited volumes of a high quality product at a time when production and marketing of US lemons is at its lowest.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654960\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/499/1108/#p1115\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In APHIS's response to this request, the agency indicated that it was merely accepting the Argentine government's request, not reconsidering its scientific judgment regarding the wisdom of the Final Rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR28337 (affirming APHIS's \"firm belief that the rule very effectively manages known pest risks\" and expressing concern that imposing a geographic limitation could be interpreted as undermining APHIS's scientific determination).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Contrary to Plaintiffs assertions, there is no \"unexplained inconsistency\" between the agency's words and its actions. (ECF No. 40 (citing\n   <em>\n    Dist. Hosp. Partners v.

The record tells a consistent story about the rationale for the northeast port limitation. It was a discretionary and voluntary concession by Argentina and APHIS to domestic citrus producers, not a reconsideration of the scientific judgment underpinning the Final Rule. The northeast port limitation does not render the Final Rule arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     RFA Claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that they are entitled to summary judgment under the RFA because the agency's assessment of the economic impact of the rule on small businesses was arbitrary and capricious. Plaintiffs also argue that under the APA, the agency failed to consider an important aspect of the problem-namely, the economic impact of the Rule on the domestic citrus industry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Defendants first ask the Court to reassess its conclusion in the October 25 Order that Plaintiffs have standing, as parties who are only indirectly regulated by the Rule, to challenge the Rule under the RFA. Plaintiffs argue that the Court should not address the question, because it was already raised and addressed in the October 25 Order, and therefore Defendant's request to reconsider is untimely ( Fed R.

Notwithstanding APHIS's decision to go beyond the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 603 and 604 by completing a regulatory flexibility analysis for domestic citrus growers, the Court concludes that the agency was not required to do so by the RFA. Therefore, Plaintiffs, who are not directly regulated by the Final Rule, do not have an injury contemplated within the zone of interest of the RFA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Even if Plaintiffs did fall within the zone of interest under the RFA, and the agency was therefore obliged to complete a regulatory flexibility analysis that assessed the effect of the Rule on domestic growers, the agency's regulatory flexibility analysis was not arbitrary and capricious. Plaintiffs principal contention is that the agency irrationally and arbitrarily assumed that the volume of lemons imported would be 15,000 to 20,000 metric tons. Plaintiffs posit that the correct number is higher, based on a public statement made by a representative of the Argentine Citrus Federation (AR275 (speculating that imports would range from 20,000 to 30,000 metric tons), and a report prepared by Plaintiff U.S. Citrus Science's own economist (AR275; AR284). Defendants counter that the volume determined by agency experts was based on historical data and was not arbitrary and capricious. Moreover, they contend that even if the export assumption used was lower than what it should have been, more exports would only increase the overall welfare of consumers and thus would not ultimately change the agency's opinion that the Rule has a net social benefit under the RFA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The agency's assumption was based on sound reasoning, drawn from Argentina's historical export levels during the 2000-2001 period when Argentina did export lemons to the United States.

The court determined that states' allegations that the statute would result in fluctuations of egg prices were insufficient to support Article III standing.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187923\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/847/646/#p653\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187923\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/847/646/#p653\">\n     at 653\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"Plaintiffs filed their complaint before the Shell Egg Laws took effect. As a result, their allegations about the potential economic effects of those laws, after implementation, were necessarily speculative.\"). However, Harris is distinguishable for two principle reasons. First, in that case the states sought to establish\n    <em>\n     parens patriae\n    </em>\n    standing, which could not be sustained by injury to egg farmers alone, since the egg farmers could have sought private relief.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187923\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/847/646/#p653\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187923\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/847/646/#p653\">\n     at 652-53\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Therefore, the analogy to the growers in this case fails. Second, plaintiffs argued that the fluctuations in egg prices would harm consumers. However, the court concluded that egg farms complying with the law would have the choice to, and almost certainly would be able to, pass through the additional cost of compliance to customers. Here, domestic lemon growers are not being subject to additional regulation, increasing their costs across the board, but instead in an increase in\n    <em>\n     competition\n    </em>\n    . Therefore, the Court cannot assume that lemon grower plaintiffs will pass through their economic losses to consumers. Moreover, Plaintiffs seek to establish competitor standing based on the regulating agency's\n    <em>\n     own conclusion\n    </em>\n    that domestic lemon growers would likely suffer economic harm. That economic injury is concrete enough to establish standing, and indeed is compelled by the Ninth Circuit's decision in\n    <em>\n     Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters v.
