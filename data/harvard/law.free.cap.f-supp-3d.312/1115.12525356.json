BROWNING, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   comes before the Court on the Plaintiff's Rule 59 Motion for New Trial and/or to Alter or Amend the Judgment, filed August 23, 2017 (Doc. 107)(\"Motion\"). The primary issues are: (i) whether the Court clearly erred when it relied on a contract that Plaintiff Ismael Lopez submitted in supplemental briefing in granting Stanley Black &amp; Decker Inc.'s Motion and Brief for Summary Judgment, filed December 29, 2015 (Doc. 48)(\"MSJ\"); and (ii) whether the Court abused its discretion in denying Lopez' request to dismiss Defendants Black &amp; Decker (U.S.) Inc. and Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (collectively \"Black &amp; Decker Defendants\")'s MSJ despite Lopez' assertions that he needed further discovery to oppose the MSJ. The Court concludes that it did not err in either granting the MSJ or in denying Lopez additional time for discovery. Under rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court must consider the records that parties cite, and may consider other documents that are in the record. Thus, it did not err when it reviewed and relied upon a contract that is in the record and that the parties cited in supplemental briefing. Moreover, the Court did not err under rule 56(f)(2), because it gave notice to Lopez at the hearing that it would use the contract in its opinion. The contract comports with rules 901 and 106 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, so it is admissible evidence, and the Court's consideration of it on summary judgment is proper. Finally, the Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Lopez a chance for additional discovery, because Lopez does not identify any material that would affect the Court's ruling. Accordingly, the Court denies Lopez' Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court draws its facts from its previous Memorandum Opinion,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203142028\">\n    2017 WL 3142028\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , filed July 24, 2017 (Doc. 105)(\"MOO\") and its Order, filed September 16, 2016 (Doc. 102)(\"Order\") disposing of the MSJ.

The Original Complaint appears to assert two claims: (i) strict products liability,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Original Complaint \u00b6 14, at 7-8; and (ii) negligence, including one or more of sixteen alternative theories,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Original Complaint \u00b6 23, at 9-10.

On December 23, 2015, Lopez moved to file an Amended Complaint asserting claims against only the Black &amp; Decker Defendants,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Motion to Amend at 1, and, on January 8, 2016, the Court granted that motion,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Amendment Order at 1. The Amended Complaint asserts the same two claims as the original Complaint: (i) negligence, including sixteen alternative theories; and (ii) strict products liability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint \u00b6 6, at 2-3.

They argued, in the MSJ, that they are not liable to Lopez, because (i) they did not design, manufacture, market, or sell Lopez the table saw; and (ii) they could not be liable under a successor liability theory, even though The Black &amp; Decker Corp.-Stanley Black &amp; Decker's predecessor-had acquired Delta Intl.-the table saw manufacturer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ at 4-7. They argued that successor liability could not attach, because Black &amp; Decker (U.S.) Inc. has no legally significant corporate relationship with Delta Intl., and because Stanley Black and Decker Inc. did not expressly assume Delta Intl.'s liability with respect to the table saw.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ at 4-7. Lopez responded, in the MSJ Response/Motion, that summary judgment was premature, because he had not yet been able to depose the Black &amp; Decker Defendants' rule 30(b)(6) witnesses nor had he been able to conduct discovery about whether the Black &amp; Decker Defendants had placed the table saw into the stream of commerce.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ Response/Motion \u00b6\u00b6 16, 18, at 4-6. He also argued that the Black &amp; Decker Defendants had incorrectly applied Texas' successor liability law, because New Mexico's choice-of-law rules and public policy dictated a different outcome.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ Response/Motion \u00b6 19, at 6. He added that more discovery could demonstrate that application of Texas successor liability law is\n   contrary to New Mexico public policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ Response/Motion \u00b6\u00b6 25-26, at 12-13. Accordingly, he requested that the Court dismiss the MSJ without prejudice under rule 56(d)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   until discovery could be completed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ Response/Motion \u00b6 35, at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Subsequently, the parties produced the Purchase Agreement, and Lopez argued the Purchase Agreement's \"Transferred Liabilities\" section demonstrates that the Black &amp; Decker Corp. expressly assumed Delta Intl.'s liability when the former acquired the latter's equity interests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppl. Brief \u00b6 19, at 6-7. The Black &amp; Decker Defendants rejoined that Lopez misreads the Transferred Liabilities section, because the Purchase Agreement states that the liabilities stay with the transferred subsidiaries and not that the liabilities are transferred to the acquiring corporation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppl. Brief Response at 3. The Defendants added that Lopez' attempts to pierce the corporate veil, but that there is no evidence that the Black &amp; Decker Defendants dominate Delta Intl.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppl. Brief Response at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court then granted the MSJ.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order at 1-2; MOO at 71, 117,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203142028\">\n    2017 WL 3142028\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *30, *48. It ruled that, under New Mexico choice-of-law rules, Texas law governed Lopez' negligence and strict liability claims, because New Mexico choice-of-law rules follow \"the doctrine of lex loci delicti commissi\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   for tort claims, and the harm occurred in Texas.

The Court also concluded that the successor liability issue, in this case's particular context, was \"predominantly a matter of tort law.\" MOO at 85,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203142028\">\n    2017 WL 3142028\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *36. Accordingly, it concluded that Texas law governs the successor liability issue, so \"the only exception\" to the traditional nonliability rule for successors in interest is the \"express assumption of liability\" exception.

Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3562144\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/495/1217/#p1225\">\n    495 F.3d at 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he doctrine is merely a 'presumption, one whose strength varies with the circumstances.' \")(citation omitted). First, the Court should restrict its review of a motion to reconsider a prior ruling in proportion to how thoroughly the earlier ruling addressed the specific findings or conclusions that the motion to reconsider challenges. How \"thoroughly\" a point was addressed depends both on the amount of time and energy the Court spent on it, and on the amount of time and energy that the parties spent on it-in briefing and orally arguing the issue, but especially if they developed evidence on the issue. A movant for reconsideration thus faces a steeper uphill challenge when the prior ruling was on a criminal suppression motion, class certification motion, or preliminary injunction,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   than when the\n   prior ruling is,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , a short discovery ruling. The Court should also look, not to the prior ruling's overall thoroughness, but to the thoroughness with which the Court addressed the exact point or points that the motion to reconsider challenges. A movant for reconsideration thus faces an easier task when he or she files a targeted, narrow-in-scope motion asking the Court to reconsider a small, discrete portion of its prior ruling than when he or she files a broad motion to reconsider that rehashes the same arguments from the first motion, and essentially asks the Court to grant the movant a mulligan on its earlier failure to present persuasive argument and evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Second, the Court should consider the case's overall progress and posture, the motion for reconsideration's timeliness relative to the ruling it challenges, and any direct evidence that the parties may produce, and use those factors to assess the degree of reasonable reliance which the opposing party has placed in the Court's prior ruling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   18B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, Edward H. Cooper, Vikram David Amar, Richard D. Freer, Helen Hershkoff, Joan E. Steinman &amp; Catherine T. Struve, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 4478.1 (2d ed.) (\"Stability becomes increasingly important as the proceeding nears final disposition.... Reopening should be permitted, however, only on terms that protect against reliance on the earlier ruling.\"). For example, if a defendant (i) spends tens of thousands of dollars removing legacy computer hardware from long-term storage; then (ii) obtains a protective order in which the Court decides that the defendant need not produce the hardware in discovery; then (iii) returns the hardware to long-term storage, sustaining thousands more in expenses; and (iv) several months pass, then the plaintiffs should face a higher burden in moving the Court to reconsider its prior ruling than they faced in fighting the motion for protective order the first time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Third, the Court should consider the factors from\n   <em>\n    Servants of the Paraclete v. Does\n   </em>\n   . The Court should be more inclined to grant motions for reconsideration if the movant presents (i) new controlling authority-especially if the new authority overrules prior law or sets forth an entirely new analytical framework; (ii) new evidence-especially if the movant has a good reason why the evidence was not presented the first time around; or (iii) a clear indication-one that manifests itself without the need for in-depth analysis or review of the facts-that the Court erred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   These three factors should influence the degree to which the Court restricts its review of a prior ruling, but they do not necessarily mean that the Court should always apply a deferential standard of review. The Court should pause before applying a standard of review to its own interlocutory orders that is more deferential than the standard that the Court of Appeals will apply to it, unless the Court concludes that the alleged error in the prior ruling was harmless, or the party moving for reconsideration waived its right to appeal the alleged error by not raising the appropriate argument. Even in circumstances\n   where the Court concludes that it is insulated from reversal on appeal, there are principled reasons for applying a de novo standard. After all, if the Court was wrong in its earlier decision, then, generally speaking, it is unjust to maintain that result-although the Court should weigh this injustice against any injustice that would result from upending the parties' reliance on the earlier ruling, which is the balancing test that the three factors above represent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   What the Court means by \"restricting its review\" is less about applying a deferential standard of review-although that may be appropriate in some circumstances-and more about reducing (i) the depth of the Court's analysis the second time around-thus conserving judicial resources; and (ii) the impositions that relitigation of the prior ruling will impose on the party opposing the motion for reconsideration. The Court should consider the time and expense that the party opposing reconsideration spent in winning the earlier ruling, and should try to prevent that party from having to bear the same impositions again. Basically, even if the Court ultimately analyzes a motion to reconsider under the same standard which it analyzed the motion that produces the earlier ruling, it should analyze the motion in a different way-one focused on reducing the litigation burdens of the party opposing reconsideration. For example, when a party moves the Court for a preliminary injunction, standard practice is that the Court holds an evidentiary hearing as a matter of course, regardless whether it looks as if the party has a good chance of prevailing. If the party loses and the Court denies the injunction, however, and the party moves for reconsideration, the party should not be entitled to the presumption of an evidentiary hearing merely because he or she received that presumption the first time the Court considered the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In light of these statements, it is perhaps better to characterize the increased burden that a movant for reconsideration faces as one of production and not of persuasion. The Court analyzes motions to reconsider by starting where it ended in the prior ruling-not by starting anew. Parties opposing reconsideration can do the same, and they may stand on whatever evidence and argument they used to win the earlier ruling. Movants for reconsideration, on the other hand, carry the full burden of production: they must persuade the Court, using only the evidence and argument they put before it, that it should change its prior ruling; they must do all of the legwork, and not rely on the Court to do any supplemental fact-finding or legal research; and they must convincingly refute both the counterarguments and evidence that the opposing party used to win the prior ruling and any new arguments and evidence that the opposing party produces while opposing the motion to reconsider. Unlike the motion that produced the prior ruling, a motion to reconsider is not-and is not supposed to be-a fair fight procedurally. The deck is stacked against a movant for reconsideration, and if such a movant hopes to prevail, he or she must have not only a winning legal position, but the work ethic and tenacity to single-handedly lead the Court to his or her way of thinking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The Court has recently commented on parties rearguing the same issues on a rule 59(e) motion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   Under rule 59(e)'s framework, the Court is not restricted to rule 50(b)'s remedies and may alter the judgment when there is: \"(1) an intervening change in the controlling law, (2) new evidence previously unavailable, [or] (3) the need to correct clear error or prevent manifest injustice.\"\n   <em>\n    Servants of Paraclete v.

The Tenth Circuit has noted that motions to alter, amend, or\n   reconsider should not rehash old arguments, or advance new arguments or facts that could have been raised earlier.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

It is not appropriate to revisit issues already addressed or advance arguments that could have been raised in prior briefing.\"). As the Court has already noted, the Defendants' Motion raises the same arguments that the Defendants previously argued during their Motion to Alter. The Court, however, also concludes that\n   <em>\n    Servants of Paraclete v. Does\n   </em>\n   does not force the Court to deny a motion to amend or alter, simply because it raises identical issues; rather, it affords the Court the option to deny that motion for reasons of judicial efficiency. A court need not review a motion to alter or amend with the same rigor if the motion raises issues already considered, because it would waste time by forcing a judge to rewrite an opinion already rendered. If, on the other hand, a party raises an identical issue on a motion to alter, and, upon the district judge's reflection, perhaps after passions have cooled, he or she concludes that he or she erred previously,\n   <em>\n    Servants of Paraclete v. Does\n   </em>\n   does not chain that district judge to an erroneous legal conclusion.

Lopez' arguments are unavailing, largely because the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permit the Court to properly consider the Purchase Agreement in deciding the MSJ. To the extent that Lopez attacks the Court's choice-of-law decisions, the Court determines that it did not previously err. Finally, the Court concludes that it properly denied Lopez' rule 56(d) motion, as additional discovery is highly unlikely to alter the case's outcome.

Under rule 56(c), however, the Court \"need consider only the cited materials, but it may consider other materials in the record.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). Both parties cited the Purchase Agreement-albeit at a hearing and in supplemental briefing-so, according to rule 56(c)'s plain text, the Court \"need consider\" that agreement. Fed. R. Civ.

Motion \u00b6\u00b6 23, 26, at 9-11. The Court interprets Lopez' position as an argument that the Purchase Agreement is inadmissible under rule 901 of the Federal Rules of Evidence -the authentication rule-or, alternatively, is admissible, but was incomplete under rule 106, so cannot be considered in an order granting summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

Evid. 106 (\"If a party introduces all or part of a writing ... an adverse party may require the introduction, at that time, of any other part ... that in fairness ought to be considered.\").

The Purchase Agreement's table of contents lists several sections, schedules, and three exhibits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Purchase Agreement at 2-4. The Purchase Agreement and the Schedules include each listed section and schedule, and are consecutively paginated, thus indicating completeness. The admitted evidence does not include the three exhibits, but those three exhibits' titles suggest that they are irrelevant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Purchase Agreement at 4 (listing the exhibits as \"Canadian Assumption Agreement,\" \"Asia Water Lease Contract,\" and \"Asia Enclosure Lease Contract\"). Because the case has nothing to do with Canada or Asia, the Court concludes that the Purchase Agreement is sufficiently complete.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the Court committed no error when it considered the entire Purchase Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Third, Lopez argues that the Court erred, because the Black &amp; Decker Defendants \"provided no evidence ... to explain or interpret the meaning of any provisions in the PA.\" Motion \u00b6 23, at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   This argument misunderstands Delaware law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under Delaware law, the Court is\n   not only allowed to interpret a contract without extrinsic evidence; it is required to interpret a contract without extrinsic evidence, unless the contract terms are ambiguous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    GMG Capital Investments, LLC v.

Here, there is no reason to construe \"transfer\" as having different meanings in these two contexts; Lopez has not identified, for example, any provision explicitly stating that The Black &amp; Decker Corporation agrees to assume the subsidiaries' liabilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   Reading the transferred-liabilities provision together with other provisions in the Purchase Agreement confirms the\n   Court's construction. In a provision entitled \"Indemnification By Parent,\" Pentair, Inc. agrees to indemnify The Black &amp; Decker Corporation for \"Losses ... resulting from ... any Indemnified Liability.\" Purchase Agreement \u00b6 8.1, at 39-40. In its \"Definitions\" section, the Purchase Agreement defines \"Indemnified Liabilities\" to include \"all liabilities and obligations of the Subsidiaries ... other than 'Transferred Liabilities.' \" Purchase Agreement \u00b6 11.17, at 56. Thus, the indemnification provision carves out the liabilities for which Pentair, Inc. retains responsibility; the transferred-liabilities provision simply operates to identify the liabilities over which Pentair, Inc. does not retain responsibility, because they transfer with the subsidiaries. Indeed, it is noteworthy that the term \"Transferred Liabilities\" appears only in the \"Definitions\" section and not in any of the Purchase Agreement's substantive provisions.

The Black &amp; Decker Defendants have had six months since Lopez filed his Reply to request time to file a surreply. They have not responded or requested the time to file such a surreply. The Court thus may consider the Reply's new arguments, although it is not required to consider them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   The Court concludes that it did not violate rule 56(f)(2). Under rule 56(f)(2), a court may grant a summary judgment motion \"on grounds not raised by a party\" so long as it gives the affected party \"notice and a reasonable opportunity time to respond.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f)(2). Lopez contends that the Court relied on the Purchase Agreement in deciding the MSJ without giving Lopez notice or an opportunity to respond.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply \u00b6\u00b6 1-3 at 1-2. The Court disagrees. At the hearing, it received the Purchase Agreement for the first time and, after review and some argument,\n   the Court and Lopez' attorney had the following exchange:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   The Court: Well, you know, it looks like to me that I should grant the motion.

After the Black &amp; Decker Defendants asked for some clarification on expert deadlines, given the Court's inclination, this exchange took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n   The Court: What if I did this: Would this work for you, Mr. Isaac? They don't put any more money into the experts, because that's probably going to have nothing to do with this issue. It's only having to do with the products liability side. So I just slide that. If I get into this case, you find something, you send it to me, and it changes dramatically the landscape that I'm seeing this morning, we'll get back together and set a new deadline for setting experts.

These exchanges were sufficient to put Lopez on notice that the Court would rely upon the Purchase Agreement in an opinion and invited Lopez, at least twice, to send the Court argument on the Purchase Agreement if it chose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 48:16-17 (Court)(\"If you get something, send it to me.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 49:16-17 (\"[Y]ou find something, you send it to me.\"). Indeed, Lopez accepted the Court's invitation and submitted supplemental briefing addressing the Purchase Agreement's applicability to the MSJ.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supp. Brief. \u00b6\u00b6 11-22, at 3-8. The Court also concludes that it gave Lopez a reasonable time to respond about the Purchase Agreement's relevance to the pending MSJ. The Court did not rule on the MSJ until September 16, 2016\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Order at 1, six months after March 15, 2016 hearing, and two months after Lopez had supplied supplemental briefing,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Supp. Brief at 9 (dated July 12, 2016).

Indeed, Lopez argues that his supplemental briefing \"discussed in detail why the PA showed there were issues of fact.\" Motion \u00b6 13, at 6. Because Lopez had an opportunity to \"discuss in detail\" why the Purchase Agreement created a genuine issue, a lack of notice that the Court would consider the\n   Purchase Agreement did not prejudice him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   In addition to Lopez' new arguments, Lopez asserts an old one: that the Court should amend the judgment, because New Mexico or Delaware law-and not Texas law-applies to the successor liability issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion \u00b6\u00b6 22, 27, 36-39 at 9, 11, 19-21. The Court will not, however, amend the Final Judgment, because the Court previously determined that the successor liability doctrine is inapplicable, as the Purchase Agreement embodies a stock acquisition and not an asset acquisition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MOO at 100-02,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"275\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203142028\">\n    2017 WL 3142028\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *41 (\"As the Court noted at the hearing, however, the successor-liability doctrine appears to be inapposite, because that doctrine pertains to asset acquisitions, whereas here, The Black &amp; Decker Corporation acquired Delta Intl.'s stock via the Purchase Agreement.\"). Accordingly, whether the Court erred on the successor liability issue would not change the case's outcome, so the Court need not amend the Final Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Moreover, Lopez overlooks that the Court concluded that, even if New Mexico law applies to the successor liability issue, Lopez' claim would still fail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MOO at 111-12,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"276\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203142028\">\n    2017 WL 3142028\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *45-46.

In the absence of any contrary showing, the rule [set forth by two New Jersey trial courts, but no appellate courts] appears to be the one which would be applied in litigation in the state court, and whether believed to be sound or unsound, it should have been followed by the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-206\">\n    <em>\n     Fid.

If the Court adheres too rigidly to Tenth Circuit case law, ignoring changes that a state's law in the ensuing years have undergone, then parties litigating state law claims will be subject to a different body of substantive law, depending whether they litigate in state court or federal court. This result frustrates the purpose of\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , which held that federal courts must apply state court interpretations of state law, rather than their own, in part so that parties achieve a consistent result regardless of the forum.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10687\" index=\"335\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/304/64/\">\n     304 U.S. at 74-77\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10687\" index=\"336\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/304/64/\">\n     58 S.Ct. 817\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . This consideration pulls the Court in the direction of according Tenth Circuit precedent less weight and according state court decisions issued in the ensuing years more weight. On the other hand, when the state law is unclear, it is desirable for there to at least be uniformity among federal judges as to its proper interpretation. Otherwise, different federal judges within the same circuit-or even the same district, as district courts' decisions are not binding, even upon themselves-would be free to adopt differing interpretations of a state's law. This consideration pulls the Court towards a stronger respect for vertical stare decisis, because a Tenth Circuit decision on point-regardless whether it accurately reflects state law-at least provides consistency at the federal level, so long federal district judges are required to follow it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-208\">\n    The Court must decide how to weigh Tenth Circuit case law against more-recent state court decisions, choosing a point on the spectrum between the two extremes: rigidly adhering to Tenth Circuit precedent unless there is intervening case law directly on point from the state's highest court, on one end; and independently interpreting the state law, regarding the Tenth Circuit precedent as persuasive authority, on the other. In striking this balance, the Court notes that it is generally more concerned about systemic inconsistency between the federal courts and the state courts than it is about inconsistency among federal judges. Judges, even those within a jurisdiction with ostensibly identical governing law, sometimes interpret and apply the law differently from one another; this inconsistency is part and parcel of a common-law judicial system. More importantly, litigants seeking to use forum selection to gain a substantive legal advantage cannot easily manipulate such inconsistency: cases are assigned randomly to district judges in this and many federal districts; and, regardless, litigants cannot know for certain how a given judge will interpret the state law, even if they could determine the identity of the judge pre-filing or pre-removal. All litigants know in advance is that whomever federal district judge they are assigned will look to the entirety of the state's common law in making his or her determination-the same as a state judge would. Systemic inconsistency between the federal courts and state courts, on the other hand, not only threatens the principles of federalism, but litigants may more easily manipulate the inconsistency. When the Tenth Circuit issues an opinion interpreting state law, and the state courts subsequently shift away from that interpretation, litigants-if the district courts strictly adhere to the Tenth Circuit opinion-have a definite substantive advantage in choosing the federal forum over the state forum, or vice versa.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-209\">\n    The Court further notes that district courts may be in a better position than the Tenth Circuit to be responsive to changes in state law. Tenth Circuit decisions interpreting a particular state's law on a specific issue are further apart in time than the collective district courts' decisions are. More importantly, the Tenth Circuit does not typically address such issues with the frequency that the state's courts themselves do. As such, Tenth Circuit precedent can lag behind developments in state law-developments that the district courts may be nimble enough to perceive and adopt. Additionally, much of the benefit of having a consistent Tenth Circuit-wide interpretation of a particular state's law is wasted. Other than Oklahoma, every state encompassed by the Tenth Circuit contains only one federal judicial district, and there is relatively little need for federal judges in Wyoming and Kansas to have a uniform body of New Mexico law to which to look. Last, the Court notes, respectfully, that district courts may be in a better position than the Tenth Circuit to develop expertise on the state law of the state in which they sit. Every federal judicial district in the nation, except the District of Wyoming, covers at most one state.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"337\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20131\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 131\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"Wyoming and those portions of Yellowstone National Park situated in Montana and Idaho constitute one judicial district.\"). It is perhaps a more workable design for each district court to keep track of legal developments in the state law of its own state(s) than it is for the Tenth Circuit to monitor separate legal developments in eight states.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-210\">\n    Having outlined the relevant considerations, the Court thinks the proper stance on vertical stare decisis in the context of federal court interpretations of state law is as follows: the Tenth Circuit's cases are binding as to their precise holding-what the state law was on the day the opinion was published-but lack the positive precedential force that its cases interpreting a federal statute or the Constitution of the United States of America possess. A district court considering a state law issue after the publication of a Tenth Circuit opinion on point may not come to a contrary conclusion based\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    on state court cases available to and considered by the Tenth Circuit, but it may come to such a conclusion based on intervening state court cases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-211\">\n    When interpreting state law, the Tenth Circuit does not and cannot issue a case holding that\n    <em>\n     x\n    </em>\n    is the law in New Mexico; it holds that the\n    <em>\n     proper interpretation\n    </em>\n    of New Mexico law, at the time the opinion is released, is\n    <em>\n     x.\n    </em>\n    Its holdings are descriptive, not prescriptive-interpretive, not normative. Because federal judicial opinions lack independent substantive force on state law issues, but possess such force regarding federal law issues, the Court thinks the following is not an unfair summary of the judicial interpretive process: (i) when interpreting federal law, the federal appellate courts consider the existing body of law, and then issue a holding that both reflects and influences the body of law; that holding subsequently becomes a part of the body of law; but (ii) when interpreting state law, the federal appellate courts consider the existing body of law, and then issue a holding that only reflects the body of law; that holding does not subsequently become a part of the body of law. The federal district courts are bound to conclude that the Tenth Circuit's reflection of the then-existing body of law is accurate. The question is whether they should build a doctrine atop the case and use the existence of the Tenth Circuit's case to avoid any responsibility to independently consider the whole body of state law that exists when the time comes that diversity litigants raise the issue in their courtrooms. Giving such effect to the Tenth Circuit's interpretations of state law is at tension with\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , giving independent substantive effect to federal judicial decisions-\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , applying federal law-in a case brought in diversity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-212\">\n    The purpose of\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    is well-known and simple, and the Court should not complicate it beyond recognition: it is that the same substantive law governs litigants' cases regardless whether they are brought in a federal or state forum. For simplicity's sake, most courts have settled on the formulation that \"the federal court must attempt to predict how the states' highest court would rule if confronted with the issue.\"\n    <em>\n     Moore's\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 124.22[3] (citing\n    <em>\n     Comm'r v.

This formulation may not be the most precise one if the goal is to ensure identical outcomes in state and federal court-the Honorable Milton I. Shadur, United States District Judge, looks to state procedural rules to determine in which state appellate circuit the suit would have been filed were it not in federal court, and then applies the state law as that circuit court interprets it,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Abbott Laboratories v.

This formulation, built out of ease-of-use, does not relieve courts of their Supreme Court-mandated obligation to consider state appellate and trial court decisions. To the contrary, even non-judicial writings by influential authors, statements by state supreme court justices, the closeness of the vote on a prior case addressing the issue, and personnel changes on the court-considerations that would never inform a federal court's analysis of federal law-may validly come into play.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     SFF-TIR, LLC v.

Okla. 2017) (Browning, J.). The question is whether the district courts must abdicate, across-the-board, the \"would decide\" aspect of the\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    analysis to their parent appellate courts when the Court of Appeals has declared an interpretation of state law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-213\">\n    The\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    doctrine results in federal cases that interpret state law withering with time. While cases interpreting federal law become more powerful over time-forming the groundwork for doctrines, growing upward from one application (Congress may create a national bank) to many (Congress may set quotas on wheat-growing for personal consumption), expanding outward from the general (states must grant criminal jury trials) to the specific (the jury need not be twelve people, nor must it be unanimous)-federal cases interpreting state law often become stale. New state court cases-even when not directly rebuking the federal court's statement of law-alter the common-law legal landscape with their dicta, their insinuations, and their tone. The Supreme Court, which picks its cases sparingly and for maximum effect, almost never grants certiorari to resolve issues of state law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-214\">\n    The Court's views on\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , of course, mean little if the Tenth Circuit does not agree. In\n    <em>\n     Wankier v. Crown Equipment Corp.\n    </em>\n    , the Tenth Circuit said that,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-215\">\n    [w]here no controlling state decision exists, the federal court must attempt to predict what the state's highest court would do. In performing this ventriloquial function, however, the federal court is bound by ordinary principles of\n    <em>\n     stare decisis.\n    </em>\n    Thus, when a panel of this Court has rendered a decision interpreting state law, that interpretation is binding on district courts in this circuit, and on subsequent panels of this Court, unless an intervening decision of the state's highest court has resolved the issue.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-216\">\n    <em>\n     Wankier v.

From this passage, it seems clear the Tenth Circuit permits a district court to deviate from the Tenth Circuit's view of state law only on the basis of a subsequent case \"of the state's highest court.\"\n    <em>\n     The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language\n    </em>\n    1402 (William Morris ed., New College ed. 1976)(defining \"unless\" as \"[e]xcept on the condition that; except under the circumstances that\"). A more aggressive reading of the passage-namely the requirement that the intervening case \"resolv[e] the issue\"-might additionally compel the determination that any intervening case law must definitively and directly contradict the Tenth Circuit interpretation to be considered \"intervening.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-217\">\n    It is difficult to know whether Judge McConnell's limitation of \"intervening decision\" to cases from the highest state court was an oversight or intentional. Most of the Tenth Circuit's previous formulations of this rule have defined intervening decisions inclusively as all subsequent decisions of \"that state's courts,\" a term which seems to include trial and intermediate appellate courts.

For example, agents for the corporations could have signed the papers in Delaware or New York. The Court concludes, however, that it is highly unlikely that the place of contracting is New Mexico. New Mexico is not, shall we say, known for abundant corporate commerce. Were this a contract between two green chile distributors, for example, the Court might conclude that New Mexico was likely the state of contracting. The Court knows, however, of no connection between these two corporations and New Mexico, and, given that the Purchase Agreement indicates none, it concludes that the contract did not come into effect in New Mexico.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-236\">\n    The Restatement (First) of Conflict of Laws is silent about the default law to apply if there is no evidence of the contracting location,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Restatement (First) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7\u00a7 311 -331, and the Supreme Court of New Mexico has not considered the issue. The Court, however, has previously determined that, if there is no evidence about the place of contracting, the Supreme Court of New Mexico would look to the choice-of-law provision-if any exists-and public policy concerns, which might indicate that the forum's law is more appropriate.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     City of Raton v.

Here, the contracting parties chose Delaware law.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Purchase Agreement \u00a7 11.4, at 53.

Moreover, the Court can discern no strong policy reason to apply New Mexico contract interpretation rules to an acquisition contract where the contracting parties chose Delaware law, one party is a Maryland corporation, and the other is incorporated in Minnesota.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Purchase Agreement at 5. Accordingly, Delaware law remains the appropriate law to interpret the Purchase Agreement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"21\">\n   <p id=\"p-237\">\n    The Court concludes that the Supreme Court of Delaware would adopt these elements as they are, largely, a summation of the doctrine outlined in\n    <em>\n     Drug Inc. v.

The Court concludes that the Court of Appeals of Maryland-that state's highest court-would also decline to adopt the product-line exception. In rejecting the mere-continuity rule, it noted that it so held, because, \"in order to impose tort liability, there must be fault,\" but \"[t]he continuity of enterprise exception is largely one of public or social policy under which it has been determined that, irrespective of fault, a party should be held to respond for the acts of another.\"\n    <em>\n     Nissen Corporation v.

Similar reasoning would lead the Court of Appeals of Maryland to reject the product-line rule. The product-line rule is not concerned with fault, but is designed to protect consumers who \"may be left without a remedy if the predecessor has dissolved, is defunct, or is otherwise unavailable to respond in damages.\"\n    <em>\n     Garcia v.
