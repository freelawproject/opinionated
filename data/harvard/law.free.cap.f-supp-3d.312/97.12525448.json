BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Since 2012, Plaintiff Kevin Kearns has been the subject of a number of complaints regarding his conduct at the Federal Aviation Administration. Concerned that such allegations would stymie his future career prospects, Kearns sought documents under the Freedom of Information Act relating to his tenure at the FAA. Filing his first FOIA request in July 2015, followed by a FOIA and Privacy Act request in November 2015, and a third under both statutes in 2016, Kearns sought various agency files and reports he asserts may contain false information. In response, the agency provided Plaintiff with an Accountability Board case report and with two Reports of Investigation and related attachments. These documents detail a series of inquiries into Kearns's conduct at the FAA, including allegations that he had discriminated on the basis of gender and sexual orientation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The case reports and investigation files were not, however, provided in full. Instead, the agency redacted certain portions of the reports and withheld pages from the files, claiming that FOIA Exemptions 5, 6, and 7(C) protected such information from disclosure. Plaintiff disagreed with this determination and filed the instant lawsuit to challenge these withholdings and the FAA's decision to not process his July 2015 request under the Privacy Act. Both sides have now moved for summary judgment on Plaintiff's claims. Finding that the disclosure requirements of the Privacy Act do not apply to the documents released in this case and that the agency correctly applied the various FOIA exemptions, the Court will grant Defendant's Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Kevin Kearns has worked in the FAA's Drug Abatement Division since 2003.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., \u00b6 2. The Division falls under the Office of Aerospace Medicine, which overseas compliance with federal law governing drug and alcohol testing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Statement of Undisputed Material Fact, \u00b6 1. Kearns is stationed at the FAA's regional office near Los Angeles. Beginning in 2012, Plaintiff was the subject of several complaints by other FAA employees working in this location.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 2. Believing that these allegations might impede his ability to obtain employment with other federal agencies, Kearns sought to obtain records related to the complaints.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   His quest to unearth records regarding the complaints began on July 4, 2015, when he submitted a FOIA request to the FAA seeking a \"copy of Accountability Board case number 2012-0155.\" SUMF, \u00b6 4. Five days later, the FAA acknowledged receipt of Plaintiff's request and designated it as \"FOIA 2015-007559.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., \u00b6 6. At the end of that month, on July 31, the FAA responded to the request and provided Kearns with a copy of the case report for Accountability Board case number 2012-0155.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 8. Although the agency gave Plaintiff the case report, which addressed claims that he had discriminated on the basis of gender and sexual orientation and had created a hostile work environment, it redacted the names of individuals and facilities associated with the allegations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 20 (FOIA Response). In its response letter accompanying the release of the report, the FAA stated that it had redacted such information in accordance with FOIA's Exemption 6, which permits agencies to withhold information that pertains to an individual \"the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(6). As the agency explained, \"[S]ince the redacted information involves the possible violations of FAA rules and regulations, the individuals referenced have a significant privacy interest in not having their identities disclosed.\" Compl., Exh. 2 (FAA Response Letter, July 31, 2015). The FAA stated that it therefore withheld \"not only their names but also information that would permit identification of their duty location.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 27, 2015, Kearns appealed the FAA's response. He argued that only the names of the associated individuals should have been redacted from the case report and that he had been deprived of additional records in the Accountability Board file.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., Exh. 3 (Appeal of FOIA 2015-007559). On October 30, the FAA denied the appeal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Exh. 4 (Denial Letter). The agency upheld the withholdings under FOIA Exemption 6, stating that \"[t]he redactions consist of information that might identify the individuals and information of a highly personal nature.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The FAA also told Kearns that the redacted information additionally qualified for withholding under Exemption 7(C), which protects against the unwarranted\n   invasion of personal privacy through the disclosure of law-enforcement information.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, the denial letter stated that the \"most reasonable interpretation\" of the FOIA request was that Kearns was \"asking for a copy of the Accountability Board Case Report,\" and that if he wished to receive additional records, he could \"submit a new initial FOIA request.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Not wasting any time, Plaintiff one week later took the FAA up on this suggestion. He submitted a new, follow-up request-this time seeking a \"copy of the entire Accountability Board case file 2012-0155, including any signed statement and other records and reports\" under both FOIA\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the Privacy Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SUMF, \u00b6 12; Compl., Exh. 5 (Privacy Act Request) at 5. On December 23, the FAA responded by stating that the \"complete Accountability Board Case Number 2012-0155 was sent to you under FOIA request number 2015-007559\" and that \"no additional documents\" were available from the Board under that case number.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., Exh. 5 (Letter Denying Privacy Act Request, Dec. 23, 2015). Plaintiff never filed an appeal of this determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SUMF, \u00b6 14; Declaration of Laurie Karnay, \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Nearly a year later, Kearns submitted a new FOIA and Privacy Act request. On September 16, 2016, he asked the FAA for \"a complete copy of internal security investigation file number AHW20140239 and AHW20150097, including all documents and statements gathered as part of each investigation.\" Compl., Exh. 6 (2016 FOIA and Privacy Act Request). On September 21, the FAA acknowledged the request and designated it with the reference number \"FOIA 2016-009336.\" SUMF, \u00b6 23. One month later, the agency issued its substantive response, which consisted of releasing to Plaintiff the Reports of Investigation (ROI) and attachments for both requested security investigations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., Exh. 8 (Oct. 24, 2016, Response). In its letter, the FAA stated that 1,537 pages were found responsive to Kearns's request and that, out of that number, \"333 pages have redactions and 797 pages are being withheld in their entirety under FOIA Exemption 6 because [they] have third-party information not applicable to [Kearns] and the release would be an invasion of [ ] personal privacy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The rest, the agency determined, could be released to Kearns on a compact disc.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 3, 2016, Plaintiff appealed this response, asserting that the agency had inappropriately relied upon FOIA exemptions in redacting the withheld information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., Exh. 9 (Appeal of 2016 Request). According to Kearns, the agency had erred in citing FOIA Exemption 6, as under the Privacy Act that exemption could \"not be invoked to withhold from a requester information pertaining to himself.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Four months after filing his appeal, Kearns initiated this lawsuit. On March 10, 2017, he filed a Complaint alleging that the FAA had not adequately responded to his 2015 and 2016 FOIA and Privacy Act requests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1. With respect to the 2015 one, Kearns alleged that the Agency had erred when it did not consider his request under both FOIA and the Privacy Act and when it determined that he was asking only for the Case Report, rather than the \"entire case file.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    , \u00b6\u00b6 41-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With respect to the 2016 request, he claimed that Defendant had improperly withheld \"documents that pertained to him\" from the investigation files, in violation of the disclosure requirements of the Privacy Act, and that the agency had improperly applied certain FOIA exemptions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    , \u00b6\u00b6 53-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As relief for these alleged statutory violations, Kearns asked the Court to,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"[o]rder [the] FAA to process\" his 2015 request \"under both FOIA and the [Privacy Act],\" order the\n   agency to \"release all non-exempt, responsive records to [the 2016 FOIA request] ... under FOIA or the [Privacy Act], whichever compels the greatest degree of disclosure,\" and to \"[o]rder the FAA to expunge all inaccurate and/or unsubstantiated information relating to Plaintiff from his employment file, and from any system of records which is or may be shared with other agencies or employers in the even that [he] seeks employment elsewhere.\" Compl. at 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Subsequent to the filing of this suit, the FAA undertook a further review of its response to Kearns's 2016 request for the security-investigation files.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SUMF, \u00b6 29. Following this review, the agency released previously redacted information related to file AHW20150091 on June 20, 2017, and related to file AHW20140239 on July 12, 2017.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    , \u00b6\u00b6 30-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

After both sides filed their respective replies,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 18 (Def. Reply), 20 (Pl.

As an initial matter, however, it pauses to note that the adequacy of the FAA's 2015 search for Plaintiff's Accountability Board case records is no longer in dispute. Kearns originally argued that the agency had not conducted a sufficient search for documents relating to the specified Board case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 42-45; ECF No. 11 (Joint Status Report). In its Motion and Reply, the FAA stated that regardless of whether Plaintiff in fact sought the \"entire case file\" or the final case report, he has been provided with all extant relevant documents. In other words, even construing Kearns's request in the broadest possible light, \"there are no other documents to release\" regarding the Accountability Board case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ at 7. In light of such assurances, Plaintiff now rightfully \"concede[s] the adequacy of the FAA's searches.\" Pl.

According to Plaintiff, because he appealed the FAA's determination of his July 2015 request, and his \"November 7, 2015, request should have been unnecessary in light of the FAA's admitted failure to process his July 8, 2015, request under both FOIA and the\n   [Privacy Act], he has in fact exhausted his administrative remedies.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3486337,10542054\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/920/57/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3486337,10542054\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/920/57/\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Put more clearly, Kearns seems to assert that because he undertook the November request as a means of correcting or supplementing his July 2015 inquiry, he was only required to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to the initial request. As this Court has noted before, however, FOIA's exhaustion requirements \"are not mere formalities to be routinely ignored, some unseemly morass of bureaucratic red tape.\"\n   <em>\n    Cable News Network, Inc. v.

Here, Kearns is attempting to leapfrog those administrative checks by claiming exhaustion of his November request on the coattails of his July appeal. Rejecting this maneuver, the Court instead agrees with the FAA that he did not exhaust the available administrative remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Kearns's claims regarding his November 2015 Privacy Act request are similarly barred. Indeed, the caselaw is clear that, just as with FOIA, before a plaintiff may bring a cause of action to compel disclosure of records under the Privacy Act, he must first exhaust administrative remedies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barouch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3877301\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/962/30/#p66\">\n    962 F.Supp.2d at 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"As with FOIA, once a Privacy Act request has been processed, a plaintiff is required to exhaust all administrative remedies before bringing an action to compel disclosure of documents.\");\n   <em>\n    Mulhern v.

Although he argues that he nonetheless \"constructively exhausted\" his Privacy Act claims,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 10-11, the law is clear that such a route to exhaustion is not available under the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barouch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3877301\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/962/30/#p66\">\n    962 F.Supp.2d at 67-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a plaintiff may not constructively exhaust Privacy Act disclosure claims).

He asserts both that such exemptions \"do not apply to material which must be released under the Privacy Act,\" and that, even if the FOIA provisions did apply to the records at issue, Defendants construed the exemptions too broadly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., \u00b6 58. The FAA rejoins, unsurprisingly, that there was nothing amiss with its disclosure and withholding determinations. It believes that it properly withheld exempt documents and information under Exemptions 5, 6, and 7(C).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ at 11-16. The Administration asserts, moreover, that the Privacy Act does not compel any greater level of disclosure with respect to the internal-investigation files.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. The Court begins with the Privacy Act and then looks at the FOIA exemptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Privacy Act\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Court can, in light of its analysis with respect to the 2015 request, easily resolve Kearns's 2016 Privacy Act claims. As with his request for the Accountability Board files, the Reports of Investigation requested and released in 2016 do not constitute records residing in a Privacy Act \"system of records.\" There is no indication that the investigation files were stored under, or retrieved by, Kearns's \"name or some other personal identifier.\" Instead, the FAA affidavits make clear that the investigation files were retrieved via reference to the case numbers provided in Plaintiff's FOIA request-numbers that are associated with the given investigation, not with the individual respondent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Stephanie Carrasquillo, \u00b6\u00b6 4-5. Because the ROIs released by the FAA in response to Kearns's 2016 request do not constitute documents from a \"system of records\" under the Privacy Act, that statute provides no recourse for Plaintiff in seeking greater disclosure of such materials.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Augustus v.

Giving Plaintiff the benefit of the doubt, the most the Court can glean from his filings is that he seems to believe that the Privacy Act trumps the application of FOIA Exemption 5.

The Court, however, has already explained why the Privacy Act is inapplicable here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As to FOIA, the Court concludes that the FAA appropriately applied Exemption 5 to certain materials in the released investigation files.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , MSJ, Exh. 16 (\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index for FOIA 2016-009336), Entries 9, 17.

Or. 2015) (\"Given the significant privacy interests at stake and a weak public interest[,] the names of the subject of the investigation and any witnesses, and any other facts and information in the ROI that could lead to the identity of those names, are properly redacted under Exemption 6.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Having found that the materials in the Reports of Investigation were properly withheld under Exemption 6, the Court need not delve into the FAA's use of Exemption 7(C) nor resolve the parties' dispute over whether the ROIs and related documents are \"records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(7). Instead, finding that the \"something\" of the present privacy interests outweighs the \"nothing\" of the absent public interest, the Court will grant summary judgment for Defendant with respect to the agency's withholdings under Exemption 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Segregable Information\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The final contested issue is Kearns's claim that the FAA violated FOIA when it did not disclose \"reasonably segregable\" non-exempt information included in the Reports of Investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) ;\n   <em>\n    Assassination Archives &amp; Research Ctr. v.

Cir. 2003) (agency must \"disclose all reasonably segregable, nonexempt portions of the requested record\"). According to Plaintiff, the FAA \"has been, at best, overzealous in its application of redactions.\" Reply at 7. Kearns contends that, even if FOIA exemptions apply, the agency has withheld more information than necessary from the ROIs and attachments it released, and that portions of the redacted\n   materials are in fact \"reasonably segregable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In response, the FAA notes that non-exempt portions of records need not be disclosed if they are \"inextricably intertwined with exempt portions.\"\n   <em>\n    Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. Dep't of the Air Force\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3531381,902110\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/566/242/\">\n    566 F.2d 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 260 (D.C. Cir. 1977). Here, the agency argues that any non-exempt information withheld from the ROIs is intertwined with material that falls under one of the claimed FOIA exemptions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ at 19-20. The Court agrees, both because the FAA employees who processed the records for release have averred that they reviewed the responsive records and that all reasonably segregable material was provided to Plaintiff,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Robinson Decl., \u00b6 7; Carrasquillo Decl., \u00b6 11, and because the Court has itself reviewed the withholdings\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   and is satisfied that non-exempt information is in fact inextricably intertwined.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mead Data Cent.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3531381,902110\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/566/242/\">\n    566 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   261 n.55 (holding that court need not require \"agency to commit significant time and resources to the separation of disjointed words, phrases, or even sentences\"). Finding that the agency satisfied its obligation to release all reasonably segregable information, the Court will compel no further disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   For these reasons, the Court will grant the FAA's Motion for Summary Judgment and deny Kearns's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment. A separate Order so stating will issue this day.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
