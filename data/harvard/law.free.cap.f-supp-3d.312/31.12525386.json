Here, Defendant does not satisfy the second requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant is correct in his assertion that he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based upon a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. At the time\n   the Defendant was sentenced, his advisory guideline range was 120-150 months, based on a total offense level of 27, with a criminal history category of V. At sentencing, the Court departed from the advisory guidelines and imposed a sentence of 96 months incarceration and five years of supervised release. Amendment 782 lowers the total offense level for Defendant's drug offense by two points, from 27 to 25.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G., Supplement to Appendix C, Amendment 782 (November 1, 2014); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(d). The amended guideline range would be 100-125 months. In this case, Defendant's current sentence of 96 months is already less than the minimum of the amended guideline range, and therefore, he is not eligible for any reduction in his current sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Government asserts that even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   Defendant satisfied the first prong and was eligible for a sentence reduction, the Court must then move to the second prong, which involves consideration of the factors in Section 3553(a) to determine if such reduction is warranted. The Government emphasizes that: (1) Defendant was convicted of participating in a conspiracy to distribute multiple kilograms of cocaine and possession of a loaded semi-automatic pistol; (2) Defendant had a prior criminal history, including a conviction for vehicular homicide; (3) and Defendant's involvement in drug sales negatively impacted the community. The Government concludes that Defendant would not be entitled to a sentence reduction because his sentence was warranted because of his conduct in this case and his prior criminal conduct, and there is a need to deter the Defendant from engaging in other criminal activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court notes that it need not reach this second prong because the Defendant is not eligible for a reduction of his sentence under the first prong, and accordingly, Mr. Crawford's Motion for Reduction of Sentence is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Motion Requesting Judicial Recommendation on RRC/Halfway House Placement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Pursuant to the Second Chance Act of 2007 (\"SCA\"), Pub.
