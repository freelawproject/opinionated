Defendant Ortiz-Quiles argued that only a serious risk of flight or danger to the community warrants the denial of bail. Lastly, defendant informs the Court that at the time of his arrest he had been working with the Federal Emergency Management Administration, and his brother has expressed his \"willingness to act as third party custodian.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 63, at page 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On January 12, 2018, the United States filed an\n   <em>\n    Opposition to Ortiz-Quiles' Motion for the Novo Detention/Bail Hearing (D.E. 63)\n   </em>\n   , filed at Docket No. 67, and moved for the detention of Ortiz-Quiles without bail on the grounds that the defendant represented a serious risk of flight and danger to the community, as well as a \"serious risk of obstruction, injury or threats to a prospective witness ....\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Government further argued that the defendant failed to timely appeal the\n   <em>\n    Order of Detention\n   </em>\n   of November 21, 2017, as provided by Rule 59(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (\"Fed.R.Crim.P.\"), that is, \"within 14 days after being served with a copy of a written order or after the oral order is stated on the record, or at some other time the court sets.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 67, at page 4. Hence, the defendant had until December 5, 2017 to appeal the\n   <em>\n    Order of Detention\n   </em>\n   of November 21, 2017. The Court held a\n   <em>\n    De Novo\n   </em>\n   hearing on December 17, 2017, that is, 26 days after the entry of the\n   <em>\n    Order of Detention\n   </em>\n   of November 21, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The defendant filed the motion for a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   hearing apparently late, that is, 26 days after the entry of the\n   <em>\n    Order of Detention\n   </em>\n   of November 21, 2017, as to defendant Joel Ortiz-Quiles, Docket No. 51. The normal period would have been 14 days after the entry of the\n   <em>\n    Order of Detention\n   </em>\n   by the U.S. Magistrate Judge McGiverin. The Court understands that the Chief Judge of the District of Puerto Rico entered various orders as to extensions of time triggered by the passing of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, which may have confused counsel as to when the period began for the filing of his motion. The Court understands that the initial period was extended to cover the extra days. If not the Court recognizes that an equitable tolling exists, as to the eight days of lateness (counting the holidays). Hence, because the Chief Judge of the District Court issued various\n   <em>\n    interim\n   </em>\n   orders as to Hurricanes Irma and Maria,\n   this Court will entertain the case on the merits, as counsel may not have been informed as to all the orders. The Court is cognizant that there were professional offices which, as of November 2017, still remained without electricity and/or communication services, up to January 2018. Hence, the Court has divided the first issuance favoring the defendant Ortiz-Quiles. Notwithstanding, the Court held a\n   <em>\n    De Novo\n   </em>\n   hearing on January 26, 2018, and received proffered evidence from both the United States and the defendant Ortiz-Quiles, and the Court will decide the issue on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Applicable Law and Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    The Bail Reform Act-\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203141\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3141\n    </extracted-citation>\n    et seq.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Bail Reform Act of 1986, as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203141\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq. governs the conditions of release and detention of a person following an arrest.

Hence, the Court must examine the determination of the Honorable Magistrate Judge\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   under\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The United States was represented by AUSA Juan Carlos Reyes; the defendant was represented by counsel Victor P. Miranda. At the outset, the United States and the defendant Ortiz-Quiles admitted that the United States has the burden of persuasion, and the defendant has the burden of production, as there are at least two counts charged under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), which entails a sentence of ten years or more each, to wit, wherein defendants aiding and abetting one another, knowingly used, carried and discharged a 9mm caliber firearm during a bank robbery. Moreover, the defendants also brandished a 9mm caliber firearm, as charged in the Superseding Indictment in Counts Three and Four.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 45. Hence, the rebuttable presumption that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the accused as required, the safety of community, and the fact that there is probable cause via the indictment under the law charged, meets the standard in favor of detention prior to trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Defense counsel also informed the Court that defendant's prior criminal history consists of a misdemeanor in local court for illegal appropriation and was fined $100.00 per offense. Another argument made by the defense is the proposition that being the driver of the runaway car does not make the defendant a risk of flight or a danger to the community. The Court again stated that the defendant's participation in the robbery conspiracy was much more than being merely a driver, and further that the defendant knew or should have known that weapons were going to be used at the robbery, and in the gateway car, as Ortiz-Quiles was present at the planning meetings, and specifically participated in the planning of the surveillance plan together with all the defendants, in preparation of the bank robbery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Superseding Indictment, Count One, at Docket No. 84. Furthermore, the fact that there were weapons involved in the bank robbery meets the presumption that the defendant constitutes a danger to the community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The defense insisted that the Ortiz-Quiles was entitled to bail pending trial, as he could be released with proper supervision, drug treatment, the imposition of a curfew, under the custody of defendant's brother who is available and willing to act as a third party custodian. The Court inquired as to certain facts of defendant's brother, such as, whether the brother of Ortiz-Quiles holds a full time job, and, thus could not be an effective custodian. Defense counsel argued that the use of an electronic monitoring device will resolve these issues. But the Court repeated that monitoring devices have not been totally effective and, further, the risk of flight and of dangerousness to the community is insufficient by merely using a monitoring device.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The United States also argued that even if the presumption has been rebutted in terms of the burden of production, \"the presumption does not disappear but rather retains evidentiary weight.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Jessup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"317343\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/757/378/#p387\">\n    757 F.2d 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 387 (1st Cir.1985).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The United States further argued that the defendant Ortiz-Quiles failed to rebut the presumption of dangerousness and risk of flight, inasmuch as the evidence presented to the U.S. Magistrate Judge McGiverin shows that the crime and the facts are serious, dangerous and violent. Averring that the conspiracy constituted a carefully planned crime, and was not actually effectuated until the defendants felt comfortable to proceed with the bank robbery as planned and prepared, as has been alleged in the overt conspiracy acts 1-8.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Superseding Indictment, Count One, at Docket No. 84. Defendant Ortiz-Quiles participated in the following overt acts: (1) planning; (3) surveillance of the target bank; (4) one month later after the surveillance, the defendant participated in setting positions around the target bank to\n   lookout for the potential presence of law enforcement agents immediately prior to, during, and after the bank robbery; and (8) after the robbery to the bank, on June 2, 2017, defendant met with other defendants to divide the money from bank-robbery proceeds amongst themselves.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Superseding Indictment, Count One, at Docket No. 84. The defendants met several times on or about May 2017 to plan the bank robbery, including recruiting other individuals; designing and carrying out a surveillance plan; how to face the law enforcement agents; use of weapons during the bank robbery operation, amongst others, which was finally carried out, on or about June 2, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Superseding Indictment, Counts One and Two, Docket No. 84.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The dangerousness of the conspiracy shows that each defendant had a role in the bank robbery, including the use of weapons to effectively reach the objective of stealing money in a bank. Hence, not all of the defendants were to be assigned inside the bank, as defendants assigned to the surveillance role; others to lookout for law enforcement agents, thus, some of the defendants had to remain outside of the premises of the targeted bank, which was, the Banco Popular Branch located at 301 Avenue De Diego, San Juan, Puerto Rico; others were used to conceal the illegitimate nature of the bank robbery proceeds (cleaning any identification marks on the stolen currency prepared by the bank in cases of robbery); and, others to obtain disguises and the weapons to be used during the bank robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court must review the matter of the appeal\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   form.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Because the parties have accepted, the matters at hand are to be examined under the rebuttable presumption of not granting bail to the defendant under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(3)(B) and (f)(1)(A), (B), as well as under the weapons charge,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).

The Court proceeds in\n   <em>\n    seriatem\n   </em>\n   fashion to examine each criteria:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (1)\n   <strong>\n    The nature and circumstances of an offense\n   </strong>\n   . The Court finds that the crime involves,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   an armed bank robbery conspiracy, well planned and using weapons wherein one shot was fired to draw the attention of the public. The offense constitutes a serious and dangerous crime of violence as a weapon was brandished and fired during the heist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   (2)\n   <strong>\n    The weight of the evidence\n   </strong>\n   . As to this criteria, the weight of the evidence is\n   overwhelming as the defendant apparently has provided statements to the government which proves the operation of the robbery occurred, as well as defendants' participation in the same. Notwithstanding, the defendants' participation, and Ortiz-Quiles' statements under scrutiny of a motion to suppress, is verified by others. However, the Court clarifies that the other circuits have determined that the weight of the evidence is the \"least important criteria.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant Ortiz-Quiles participated in Over Act One, meetings with other defendants to \"plan the bank robbery.\" The defendant also performed on a separate day, surveillance, Overt Act Two; participated in the set-up of lookouts to observe \"the presence of law enforcement personnel immediately prior, during and after the bank robbery,\" Overt Act Three. Finally, the defendant admitted that he was on the getaway car, and that his participation is, therefore, only as the driver of the getaway car. The defendant also participated in the distribution of the \"bank-robbery proceeds amongst themselves.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Overt Act number 8, Count One at Docket No. 84.

(Emphasis ours).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   (3)\n   <strong>\n    The history and history and characteristics of the accused\n   </strong>\n   . The defendant had only one misdemeanor registered. The original accusation finished on a fine of $100.00. Although the misdemeanor was originally filed in the Puerto Rico Superior Court, which only receives criminal filings that constitute a felony, the case ended with two fines of $100.00 each for the illegal appropriations of the defendant. The Court, however, can only consider the defendant's prior case as a misdemeanor. The defendant was not married at the age of twenty-two (22) when he was arrested, but he had an infant named Yashira Joanialis, product of his relationship with his companion co-defendant Yashira Marie Vega-Carrillo. Defendant Ortiz-Quiles has been a lifelong resident of Nemesio Canales Public Housing Building Project in San Juan, Puerto Rico, except for one year when defendant Ortiz-Quiles lived for one year with a maternal aunt in the State of Rhode Island.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Defendant Ortiz-Quiles did not have a good relation with his father after he divorced his mother. He had an excellent relationship with his mother. His father\n   stated to the pretrial officer that the defendant did not know most of his eleven half-brothers. The defendant's father was drug dependent, and now a patient of methadone (information provided in the pretrial report). The defendant knows his two maternal siblings. The defendant has worked hard to obtain his GED at the Public Housing Educational Module. He does not understand the English language. At age 17, the defendant worked one month. Recently, the defendant was employed for a short time with FEMA relating to the aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in the Fall of 2017 and/or also a short time with Expo Caribe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Finally, there is one aspect that is worrisome to the Court for bail purposes, which is that the defendant was in charge of the cleaning of the money and participated in the division of the stolen bank robbery proceeds, in excess of seventeen thousands dollars divided between six defendants, including the former defendant co-living defendant Ortiz-Quiles. None of the parties have addressed the issue of the recovery of the moneys from the bank robbery, as the moneys were divided on the same day of the robbery, that is, June 2, 2017, and the defendant was not arrested until November 16, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint filed on November 16, 2017, and the Superseding Indictment filed on November 20, 2017, at Docket Entries No. 1 and 45. The bank robbery and the division of the bank robbery proceeds occurred on June 2, 2017. The Court then for purposes of the bail must consider that the defendant Ortiz-Quiles received his proceeds at that time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Superseding Indictment, Counts One, Two, Three, Four, at Docket No. 84.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Defendant Ortiz-Quiles is also a habitual drug user, as alleged by the United States and included in the preliminary bail probation report, at the first appearance of the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   (4)\n   <strong>\n    The nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that would be posed by the person's release\n   </strong>\n   . The Court first finds that the defendant was not merely a surveillance person. As stated above, defendant Ortiz-Quiles participated in at least four important events. Furthermore, on or around May 2017, the defendant Ortiz-Quiles participated in at least four of the Overt Acts described in the Second Superseding Indictment at Docket No. 84.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Finally as to the \"risk of flight,\" on June 2, 2017, defendant Ortiz-Quiles participated in the distribution of the proceeds, Overt Acts number 8, Count One of the Second Superseding Indictment, Docket No. 84. As to the \"danger to the community,\" the defendant participated in the surveillance of the target bank, Overt Acts number 3, Count One of the Second Superseding Indictment, Docket No. 84; the planning to set up \"lookouts\" in or around the premises of the target bank, to check for the presence of law enforcement in the bank prior to, during and after the bank robbery, as stated in Overt Act number 4, Count One of the Second Superseding Indictment, Docket No. 84; as well as, defendant's participation as the driver of the gateway car after the bank robbery, as proffered evidence by the United States at the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   hearing held on January 26, 2018. Most critical was that the persons that entered the bank were persons that were armed during the bank robbery. One of the individuals, in order to freeze all clients and employees at the bank, detonated a bullet shot. The above stated facts means that the defendant Ortiz-Quiles participated in at least four overt acts, and knew that there were persons that were armed in the getaway car. Moreover, the defendant also knew that part of the acts, including firing a shot to freeze the customers were known acts under the conspiracy of robbing the bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   All of the above indicates that the defendant knew that a bank was to be a target of a robbery with weapons, including the necessity of a gateway car for the two persons, one of which definitely had a weapon upon exiting the bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The crime having been a crime to rob a bank even though the defendant Ortiz-Quiles remained as a \"look out,\" knowing the dangers of robbing a bank and participating in four critical overt acts, the Court considers that the defendant constitutes a danger to the community, as the defendant participated in a crime of violence. The Court, therefore, finds that Ortiz-Quiles is a danger to the community, under the standard of \"clear and convincing evidence,\" as established in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Salerno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/739/#p750\">\n    481 U.S. 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 750,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/739/#p750\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105,1148012\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/95/697/\">\n    95 L.Ed.2d 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Further, the defendant Ortiz-Quiles also constitutes a \"flight risk.\" The defendant previously did not have a close relationship with his father nor with his eleven half-brothers. He did have a good relationship with two brothers procreated by his father and mother. Mr. Ortiz-Quiles enjoys an excellent relationship with his Mother. He also has a good relation with his common law wife, co-defendant Yashira Marie Vega-Carrillo, as they were living together and have an infant together, of not yet one year old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The defendant has ties with Puerto Rico, as he has lived all his life in the Island. Notwithstanding, Ortiz-Quiles and his common law wife Yashira Marie Vega Carrillo participated together with the remaining four defendants in the distribution of the bank robbery proceeds of over $17,000.00 as described in Overt Act number 8, Count No. 1, of the Second Superseding Indictment at Docket No, 84, p.4. Defendant Ortiz-Quiles and his common law wife, therefore, were distributed two portions of the proceeds. Hence, defendant and his common law wife Yashira Marie Vega definitely have sufficient money to flee Puerto Rico to Continental United States. Defendant is not merely a poor person living in a Public Housing Building. A contrary argument is difficult to believe considering a $17,000.00 bank heist distribution. The fact that the defendant is facing a sentence of more than ten years to life for the weapons charge, plus a consecutive long term for the bank robbery, increases the probability of fleeing to another jurisdiction. Hence, the Court finds that pursuant to\n   <em>\n    United States v. Patriarca\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1859606\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/948/789/\">\n    948 F.2d 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 793, defendant Ortiz-Quiles is a risk of flight by a preponderance of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Court concludes that although the defendant Ortiz-Quiles provided some proffer evidence to rebut the presumption as to \"danger to the community,\" and no danger as to \"flight risk,\" the defendant falls short as to \"rebutting\" the presumption as to both categories of risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Hence, the request to be granted bail at Docket No. 63, is DENIED, as the defendant failed to rebut the presumption of dangerousness to the community and risk of flight,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(3) and (f)(2). Therefore, the\n   <em>\n    Order of Detention Pending Trial\n   </em>\n   issued by U.S. Magistrate Judge McGiverin on November 21, 2018, Docket No. 51, is hereby AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Defendant Ortiz-Quiles shall remain detained without bail until further order of the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Acevedo-Ramos\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"675166\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/755/203/#p208\">\n     755 F.2d at 208\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , the Court held:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n    When enacting the earlier statute, the House Judiciary Committee stated that\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n    as is the present practice under the Bail Reform Act, ... the use of sworn testimony will be the exception and not the rule....
