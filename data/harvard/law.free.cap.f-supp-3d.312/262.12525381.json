(Docket No. 2191.) Pereira joined San Lucas's motion,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 2191 and 2197, and filed an independent motion for change of venue on March 6, 2018. (Docket No. 2193.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In their joint motion, Pereira and San Lucas argue that they \"ha[ve] resided all [their] li[ves] in the state of New Jersey\" and \"ha[ve] had nearly no contact with our [Puerto Rico] jurisdiction before the instant charges were filed.\" (Docket No. 2191 at pp. 1-2.) They maintain that \"the alleged relevant events connected to the charged offense took place outside this jurisdiction\" and that \"[i]f the instant criminal case is permitted to remain in our jurisdiction, [Pereira and San Lucas] will be denied the opportunity to both investigate the instant charges as well as ... interview potential witnesses who ... reside outside our jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 2.

Pereira asserts that \"[a]ll principal allegations and evidence relevant to [ ] Pereira\" and \"[a]ll potential witnesses, and evidence for the defense of [ ] Pereira are located in New Jersey.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 2.
