In any event, the arbitration provision explicitly provides, \"This Arbitration Provision shall survive any termination, payoff or transfer of this contract.\" Thus, by its express terms, even if the Contract was terminated as a result of Plaintiff's bankruptcy discharge, the arbitration provision survives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Nevertheless, relying on the Ninth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    In re Eber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145361,5862630\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/687/1123/\">\n    687 F.3d 1123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2012), Plaintiff argues the Court should deny the motion because arbitration would preclude her from obtaining the \"fresh start\" granted by the Bankruptcy Code, thereby creating an inherent conflict between compelling arbitration and the purpose of the Bankruptcy Code. Courts have \"the discretion to decline to enforce an otherwise applicable arbitration provision only if the arbitration would conflict with the underlying purpose of the Bankruptcy Code.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145361,5862630\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/687/1123/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145361,5862630\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/687/1123/\">\n    at 1130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). The Ninth Circuit has made it clear that there is \"no evidence in the text of the Bankruptcy Code or in the legislative history suggesting that Congress intended to create an exception to the [Federal Arbitration Act] in the Bankruptcy Code.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Eber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145361,5862630\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/687/1123/\">\n    687 F.3d at 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And the Court finds enforcing the arbitration provision does not conflict with the Bankruptcy Code. The arbitration provision is at issue due to Plaintiff's FCRA claim, not because Defendant is attempting to collect a debt\n   that has been discharged. Moreover, \" 'simply enforcing a provision which defines the venue for resolving the instant dispute does not deprive [Plaintiff] of [a] \"fresh start\" granted by the bankruptcy code.' \"\n   <em>\n    Gadomski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12278063\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/281/1015/#p1020\">\n    281 F.Supp.3d at 1019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203814257\">\n    2013 WL 3814257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 ).

Defendant's request for judicial notice is denied because the documents contained therein were not necessary to the resolution of the present motion. The Court stays the litigation to permit an arbitrator to decide the questions of arbitrability, and then, if permissible, to arbitrate the substantive claim.
