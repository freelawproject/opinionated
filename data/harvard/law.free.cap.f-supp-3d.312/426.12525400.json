ECF No. 38. The Probation Office, as here represented by the Government, now charges that the defendant, following the end of his term of incarceration, has twice violated the terms of his supervised release. Specifically, the Government contends that Hightower (1) possessed a loaded firearm, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Penal%20Law%20%C2%A7%20265.03\">\n    N.Y.

Penal Law \u00a7 130.35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2). On October 16, 2017, Hightower denied both specifications. Accordingly, the Court conducted an evidentiary hearing on April 9, 2018 and a supplemental hearing on May 17, 2018, and also received written submissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Government bears the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203583\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(3). Based on the parties' submissions and the evidence presented, including the Court's assessment of the witnesses' credibility, the Court finds the Government has met its burden with regard to the first specification but not the second. The reasons for these rulings follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Transcript dated Apr. 9, 2018 (\"Tr.\") 3-5. Video footage of the arrest shows an unmarked car driving the wrong way on a one-way street and pulling alongside Hightower, who was on foot and looking at his phone. GX-1. Hightower appears to speak to someone in the car, gesturing briefly with his left hand, which had been by his side (perhaps in his pocket). Immediately after his left hand returns to his side, and just four seconds after the car has stopped, three members of the New York Police Department (\"NYPD\"), all in plain clothes, exit the vehicle. Hightower steps back and leans against a parked van as the officers approach. One officer searches Hightower's pocket, after which two others pin Hightower's arms down against the van. The frisking officer then displays a firearm, apparently pulled from Hightower's\n   pocket, which he hands to the fourth officer behind him. GX-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The gun was later determined to be loaded and operable. GX-3. In a recorded interrogation following the arrest, Hightower acknowledged that he was carrying the gun. GX-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Under New York law, \"[a] person is guilty of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree when ... such person possesses any loaded firearm.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Penal%20Law%20%C2%A7%20265.03\">\n    N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 265.03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3). Hightower without question possessed a loaded firearm in violation of this state law and thus in violation of the terms of his supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The only question, then, is whether the evidence confirming this violation is admissible. Hightower argues that the stop was unconstitutional because the officers did not have reasonable suspicion that he was involved in any criminal activity,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Terry v. Ohio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/#p21\">\n    392 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 21-22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/#p21\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/#p21\">\n    20 L.Ed.2d 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1968), and that the search of his pocket was unconstitutional because the officers had no reasonable suspicion that he was armed and dangerous,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arizona v.

Thus, according to Hightower, all the evidence following the stop and the search of his pocket was obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment and must be suppressed pursuant to the so-called \"exclusionary rule.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mapp v.

Scott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182492\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/357/\">\n    524 U.S. 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182492\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/357/\">\n    118 S.Ct. 2014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182492\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/357/\">\n    141 L.Ed.2d 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998) mandates the conclusion that the exclusionary rule does not apply in supervised release proceedings. In\n   <em>\n    Scott\n   </em>\n   , the Court held that the exclusionary rule does not apply in state parole revocation proceedings because the costs of applying this judge-made rule in that context would exceed the benefits: \"The exclusion of evidence establishing a parole violation ... hampers the State's ability to ensure compliance with these conditions by permitting the parolee to avoid the consequences of his noncompliance,\" whereas the \"likelihood that illegally obtained evidence will be excluded from trial provides deterrence against Fourth Amendment violations, and the remote possibility that the subject is a parolee and that the evidence may be admitted at a parole revocation proceeding surely has little, if any, effect on the officer's incentives.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182492\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/357/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182492\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/357/\">\n    at 365, 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182492\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/357/\">\n    118 S.Ct. 2014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Although the Second Circuit has not held that the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Scott\n   </em>\n   applies to federal supervised release revocation proceedings, it has held more generally that \"the constitutional guarantees governing revocation of supervised release are identical to those applicable to revocation of parole or probation.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11448866\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/299/103/#p109\">\n    299 F.3d 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 109 (2d Cir. 2002). Several district courts in this circuit, including this one, have therefore refused to apply the exclusionary rule in violation of supervised release proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Betances\n   </em>\n   , No. 03-cr-134, ECF No. 206 (Apr. 26, 2012);\n   <em>\n    United States v. Medrano\n   </em>\n   , No. 08-cr-60,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203055758\">\n    2012 WL 3055758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (S.D.N.Y.

Nov. 15, 2016). Moreover, Hightower offers no reason to believe that applying the exclusionary rule in federal supervised release proceedings would meaningfully deter more unconstitutional conduct or impose fewer societal costs than in state parole violation proceedings. This Court is thus obliged to hold that the exclusionary rule does not apply here, and need not determine whether\n   either the stop or frisk was unconstitutional.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court therefore finds the defendant guilty of violating the terms of his supervised release by possessing a loaded firearm in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Penal%20Law%20%C2%A7%20265.03\">\n    N.Y.

On the morning of January 1, 2017, Tori Brennan called 9-1-1 and reported that she had been raped in an apartment in the Bronx. GX-6. Detective Reiner Fehrenbach of the NYPD later received a notification from Bronx-Lebanon Hospital that Brennan was there and reported having suffered a sexual assault. Tr. 16:19-24. Fehrenbach testified that he went to the hospital, where the emergency room doctor told him that Brennan had told her that \"she had woken up with a male on top of her engaging in sexual intercourse and that she did not consent to this act.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Penal%20Law%20%C2%A7%20130.35\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Penal%20Law%20%C2%A7%20130.35\">\n    17:1-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Fehrenbach in turn interviewed Brennan later that day, and, as he testified, she told him the following: Around 2:30 A.M. the morning of January 1, Brennan, her brother, and his girlfriend arrived at Monique Belton's apartment in the Bronx for a New Year's Eve party.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Penal%20Law%20%C2%A7%20130.35\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Penal%20Law%20%C2%A7%20130.35\">\n    18:6-18, 30:20-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, the Government is forced to rely only on Brennan's statements on the 9-1-1 call; on her statements to the emergency room doctor, as relayed to Detective Fehrenbach by the doctor; on her statements to Detective Fehrenbach in their various interviews; and on the recorded conversation with Monique Belton. All of these statements are hearsay, and none falls within any recognized\n   exception to the hearsay rule. The Government does not contend otherwise, but relies on the fact that the protections against hearsay statements in the Confrontation Clause and Federal Rule of Evidence 801 do not apply in hearings involving alleged violations of supervised release.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Transcript Fehrenbach relaying what the emergency room doctor told him that Brennan told her is therefore excluded in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Government did, however, introduce evidence supporting its decision not to call Brennan herself. Special Agent Antoinette Guzman testified that she called Brennan in early 2018 in an effort to convince her to testify, but that Brennan said that she was concerned about the safety of her and her family and so did not want to participate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   6:7-19.

Brennan, whom the Government believes to have been a victim of serious sexual assault, made clear to Special Agent Guzman that she was unwilling to testify because of fear for her family's safety. While this fear may or may not have been justified, the Government's decision to rely on hearsay rather than trying to force Brennan to testify is entirely reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As to reliability, Brennan's out of court statements are consistent and were all made within a few days of the alleged assault. Moreover, Brennan's actions in calling the police, going to the hospital, and cooperating with Detective Fehrenbach (albeit for only a few days) are consistent with her statements, and the defense put on no evidence of any motive to lie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Nevertheless, there is no independent evidence in the record corroborating Brennan's account of the criminal act at issue. In the recorded call with Monique Belton, Belton said only that she was asleep the whole time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   GX-7 at 2. The Government produced no hospital records, no sworn statements from Brennan, and no corroborating statements from anyone else (whether in or out of court).\n   <em>\n    Contrast\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jefferies\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=456%20Fed.%20Appx.%206\">\n    456 Fed.Appx. at 6-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (admitting consistent hearsay statements of two unavailable witnesses that were corroborated by medical records).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A criminal defendant always has a substantial interest in cross-examining those whose statements would be used to support his conviction. Here, however, Hightower's interest is at its zenith, as the Government relies exclusively on a single declarant's out-of-court statements to prove its entire case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   To summarize the\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   factors: (1) the Government has shown that it had good reasons for not producing the witness; (2) the hearsay statements, though internally consistent and consistent with the victim's behavior, are not corroborated by any independent evidence; and (3) because the Government's case relies entirely on a single declarant's hearsay, the defendant's interest in cross-examination is at its height.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Under these circumstances, this Court cannot find that there is good cause to admit these hearsay statements. If the Government's inculpatory evidence consists entirely of the unsworn statements of a single declarant, then the defendant has a due process right to put that declarant under oath, subject them to cross-examination, and permit the factfinder to observe their demeanor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    California v.

However, though technically civil, this proceeding bears many of the hallmarks of a criminal trial, including the possibility of imprisonment. As a general matter, the Court is therefore wary to draw a negative inference in supervised release proceedings, and declines to do so here, particularly because a related criminal charge remains open in state court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
