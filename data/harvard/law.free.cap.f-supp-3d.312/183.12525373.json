Gen. Laws ch. 175, \u00a7 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   assures property damage coverage for an innocent named insured when an unnamed co-insured resident of the premises they share intentionally sets those insured premises afire. Plaintiff Susan Shepperson, the named insured of the insurance policy before me, seeks to establish that she is entitled to coverage irrespective of whether the fire which damaged her residence was caused by her son, who I find to be an unnamed co-insured and also a resident of the premises. Concluding that the policy may not exclude coverage for Ms. Shepperson as an innocent co-insured, I will grant her summary judgment establishing the insurer's liability on her contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In reaching my conclusion that the insurer is liable on the contract claim, I have followed a somewhat different path from that pursued by Ms. Shepperson in her motion. I conclude first that by its plain terms, the policy does exclude coverage. I nevertheless also conclude that such an exclusion is barred under Massachusetts law. Once the illegal exclusion is excised from the policy, Ms. Shepperson is entitled to coverage, so long as she was innocent of involvement in the fire which caused the injury for which she seeks damages. I find she is an innocent insured entitled to damages. The amount of damages is not yet ripe for resolution. I will consequently look to the parties to formulate a plan for resolving the issues that remain outstanding following my grant of Ms. Shepperson's motion for partial summary judgment so as to bring this case to final judgment promptly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

She maintained a homeowner's insurance policy (\"the policy\") with Defendant, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Co., identified as policy number 1190421841; the policy coverage was effective July 13, 2015 to July 13, 2016.

Ms. Shepperson made a report of the loss to Metropolitan the next day. Metropolitan sent Ms. Shepperson a letter on March 7, 2016, acknowledging the receipt of her claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On March 9 and again on March 28, Metropolitan sent Ms. Shepperson a letter informing her of \"a potential coverage problem for [her] recent claim.\" Moreover, in accordance with its rights under the policy, Metropolitan requested that Ms. Shepperson cooperate with its investigation into the fire, provide an examination under oath, and produce pertinent documentation and information in support of her claim. Her examination under oath was conducted on April 21, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Metropolitan also scheduled the examination under oath of Scott Shepperson, Ms. Shepperson's eldest son, for April 21, 2016. This scheduled examination was the subject of notice provided in letters dated March 24, 2016 and March 31, 2016, sent to Scott at the premises and at 3 Whipple Street in Danvers, Massachusetts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Scott failed to appear for his scheduled\n   examination under oath, Metropolitan notified Ms. Shepperson's counsel that \"Scott Shepperson qualifie[d] as 'you' under the policy, and as such [wa]s obligated to cooperate with Metropolitan's investigation and provide an examination under oath[,]\" and that until that was done Metropolitan could not \"make a final determination on the coverage available to [Ms. Shepperson].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    3.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ms. Shepperson's Examination Under Oath\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In her examination under oath, Ms. Shepperson testified that she owned the premises and that no one else had an ownership interest in it on the date of the fire. She said that on the day of the fire no one other than she, Scott, and another son Eric Shepperson, were living at the premises. She testified that she was not at home at the time of the fire because she, along with her daughter, Beth DiSessa, and her two granddaughters, traveled to Holyoke, Massachusetts to visit her brother for the night. Ms. Shepperson testified that Scott, who was on a scheduled layoff from work at the time, however, was home when the fire occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Ms. Shepperson learned about the fire around 11:45 PM that evening during a phone call from her neighbor. When she spoke to Scott that night, he told her that he \"accidentally set the house on fire\" and that he was \"so sorry.\" Ms. Shepperson testified that Scott told her he had noticed that the snow blower needed gasoline so he filled the gas can, which was ordinarily kept in the garage, with gasoline and brought it inside the house. She said Scott had described to her that as he was walking through the house, he smelled gas and it appeared that the gas can was leaking. Ms. Shepperson further testified that Scott told her that \"[h]e took a cigarette out of the package, put it in his mouth, walked through the back hall, took a kitchen match, lit the match and was walking out to the deck to light his cigarette ... when he struck the match, ... the place exploded.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   When asked whether Scott had always lived at the house, or whether there was a period of time that he lived somewhere else, Ms. Shepperson responded, \"No. When he was in college, he lived in Newport on campus. But that was many years ago.\" When asked, \"But other than that, he's lived at the house?\" she answered, \"Yes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On July 28, 2016, after the parties had exchanged several communications, Ms. Shepperson's counsel sent a demand letter to Metropolitan's legal counsel, pursuant to the provisions of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, alleging that Metropolitan's acts and failures to act violated the provisions of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 176D and ch. 93A; the demand letter requested an offer of settlement within thirty days. In response, Metropolitan's legal counsel sent a letter to Ms. Shepperson's counsel rejecting the demand. A month later, Metropolitan issued a letter denying Ms. Shepperson's claim in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    4.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scott's Deposition\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Metropolitan conducted Scott's deposition in this case on April 4, 2017. In that deposition, Scott described the premises as his \"permanent address.\" The premises address appeared on his driver's license. He testified that, prior to March 4, 2016, he had never had an apartment or owned a house of his own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Scott testified that he worked for DN Tanks and had been working for the company since 2007. His job required him to travel to job sites all over the country. He testified that he \"basically lived in hotel rooms for the past ten years, nine years.\" Because of the demands of his job, he effectively \"live[d] out of a suitcase.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   When he came back to Massachusetts from time to time he would either stay at\n   the premises, at his sister Beth's house, at a hotel, or with friends. Scott testified that he had his own bedroom at the premises. He acknowledged that he did not exclusively use the bed in his bedroom at the premises, but that his \"[u]ncles, family, cousins\" did also. He reported that the room was used \"as a guestroom when [he was] not around.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Scott testified that \"[s]ome of the clothes in [the dresser in the room] might have been [his].\" He said that he would leave some of the clothes he did not take with him on his work trips in his closet. Scott testified that his mother would \"keep[ ] some of her stuff in the closet if she need[ed] room, if her closet [wa]s full\"; she would sometimes even store extra blankets and pillows in the closet, he said. Scott testified that although he kept some of his clothes at the premises, he did not keep his toiletries in the bathroom of the premises, rather he carried them in a travel bag and took them with him wherever he would go.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Scott further testified that he used the premises for purposes of mail for his official documents. The documents he provided to Metropolitan's legal counsel all included the premises as his address. For example, his motor vehicle's Registry of Motor Vehicles form had the premises as both his mailing address and his residential address. His motor vehicle's registration also had his mailing address as the premises. Notably, his motor vehicle insurance policy with Metropolitan included the premises as his mailing address and he confirmed that he did not have any other residential addresses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Scott's 2014 and 2015 tax returns indicated his home address as the premises. His 2016 W-2 forms also specified the premises as his address. Scott confirmed that he did not have any tax records that indicated that he lived somewhere other than the premises. His credit card statements, Sprint bill, and excise taxes for his motor vehicle all designated his address as the premises. Scott testified, however, that he paid his bills online.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Scott testified that, while he did not own the premises and that his mother did, he was not financially dependent on Ms. Shepperson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Ms. Shepperson originally filed this action against Metropolitan in the Essex County Massachusetts Superior Court on September 26, 2016. She alleged five counts against Metropolitan: (I) declaratory judgment, (II) unlawful invasion of privacy,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (III) breach of contract, (IV) infliction of emotional distress,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (V) unfair or deceptive business practices under M.G.L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3 and M.G.L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2. Metropolitan removed the case to this court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) on the grounds of diversity of citizenship jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). Ms. Shepperson presses a motion for partial summary judgment on the declaratory judgment and breach of contract claims. Metropolitan presses its own cross motion for summary judgment, but does not specify as to which counts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

She also argues that the provisions of Mass. Gen Laws ch. 175, \u00a7 99 preclude a homeowner's insurer from declining coverage to an innocent insured, such as her. For its part, Metropolitan contends that Scott was a \"resident\" of the premises covered by the policy and, under the policy definition of \"you\", was an unnamed insured on the policy. Metropolitan contends that Ms. Shepperson is not entitled to recover for damages caused by the March 4, 2016 fire if it is determined that Scott intentionally set the fire because under the policy no insured-whether named or unnamed-is entitled to coverage for an intentional loss even if they \"did not commit or conspire to commit the act causing the loss.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Interpretation of \"the language of an insurance contract is a question of law for the trial judge[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Cody\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Conn.

Furthermore, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Vaiarella\n   </em>\n   where the mother was not returning to a household where she had long been a member, Scott remained a putative member of his mother's household because he did not have his own household.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Although Scott may not have had an exclusive room at the premises, since other family members would often stay in the room when they were visiting and he was not present, he did have a room that he considered as his own.

Similarly here, Scott testified that he was not financially dependent on Ms. Shepperson. Scott, however, also testified that he did not pay rent at the premises; thus, his mother was financially supporting him (to some degree) by providing housing allowing him to live rent-free at the one location he could, his home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Scott's travel requirements for his job introduce a variable into the equation for calculating whether he is a resident of the same household as Ms. Shepperson. In its opposition, Metropolitan contends that Ms. Shepperson points to no other residence, in the world, that could be considered Scott's \"residence\" at the time of the fire. Metropolitan states that Scott has never owned property in his life, and, other than for less than two years when he was in college, has never had anything approximating a residence other than the insured premises. There is considerable merit to this argument. The cases that Ms. Shepperson has included in her memorandum of law in support of her partial summary judgment motion involve more than one viable premise where the party could be a resident.

Supp. June 12, 2017), the insured argued that if the policy was interpreted to bar coverage for an innocent co-insured, it must be reformed to provide the level of coverage allowed for by M.G.L. c. 175, \u00a7 99, which he claimed allowed recovery by an innocent co-insured. Judge Lang reviewed appellate authority in other states and noted that he was \"satisfied that, although not unanimous, the overwhelming weight of appellate authority in other states addressing the very issue presented ... support[ed] [the insured's] position.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. Consequently, he adopted the reasoning of those other courts and held that the insured was entitled to judgment as a matter of law that the policy covered the loss.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Focusing on the facts before me and considering carefully what the Supreme Judicial Court would be expected to do, I predict that the SJC would conclude that M.G.L. c. 175, \u00a7 99 provides coverage for innocent co-insureds in these circumstances. Needless to say, there has been substantial development in this area of the law since the Supreme Judicial Court's 1981 decision in\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   to refrain from addressing the issue whether a broad reading of\n   <em>\n    Kosior\n   </em>\n   is sound policy.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=416%20N.E.2d%20187\">\n    416 N.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   190 n.9. The clear trend has been in favor of allowing innocent co-insured coverage. I see no reason why the Supreme Judicial Court would not join in the reasoning of its sister jurisdictions, especially when it has expressed an interest \"in giving \u00a7 99 the same treatment that is given to identical language in policies issued in other States.\"\n   <em>\n    Pappas Enters., Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=661%20N.E.2d%2081\">\n    661 N.E.2d at 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this connection, I find both\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   to be persuasive as expressions of current Massachusetts law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The language of the policy here states that \"no one defined as\n   <strong>\n    you\n   </strong>\n   or\n   <strong>\n    your\n   </strong>\n   is entitled to coverage, even people defined as\n   <strong>\n    you\n   </strong>\n   or\n   <strong>\n    your\n   </strong>\n   who did not commit or conspire to commit the act causing the loss.\" This language is clear and unambiguous. The provision suspends coverage for all insured parties-even those who were\n   innocent of any wrongdoing-when any insured party causes an intentional loss. The gravamen of the issue on this branch of the motion, however, is not whether the policy language is clear, but rather whether the policy provision complies with the mandate of M.G.L. c. 175, \u00a7 99. I conclude the exclusion, while clearly expressed, appears prohibited in this circumstance by \u00a7 99. Accordingly, Ms. Shepperson, if found to be innocent of causing the fire to her premises, would presumably be able to recover under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Metropolitan's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   At this point in my analysis, I have agreed with Metropolitan's contention that Scott was an unnamed co-insured on the policy. From this premise, Metropolitan relying on\n   <em>\n    Kosior\n   </em>\n   -which I have observed,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 194, can coexist with \u00a7 99 -argues that if Scott intentionally set the fire, it has no obligation to make insurance benefits payments to or for Ms. Shepperson under the policy for the fire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In essence, Metropolitan contends that Ms. Shepperson cannot be covered under an innocent co-insured theory because her interests and Scott's interests in the policy are necessarily joint and nonseverable. Metropolitan's heavy reliance on\n   <em>\n    Kosior\n   </em>\n   is the foundation for its contention that because \"Scott qualifies as 'you' for purposes of the intentional or criminal acts exclusion, ... his obligation to avoid intentionally damaging the insured premises was joint with [Ms.] Shepperson's.\" I view this contention as a leap too far.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Kosior\n   </em>\n   , both co-insureds were named parties to the policy allowing for their readily apparent joint interests. As my colleague Judge Hillman observed when serving on the Massachusetts Superior Court, \"the determination of the question whether an innocent coinsured may recover on fire insurance after another coinsured has intentionally burned the covered property ordinarily depends upon whether the interests of the coinsured are joint or severable .... In the instant case, the obligation to refrain from intentional loss is a joint obligation, as it applies to loss caused by any\n   <em>\n    named\n   </em>\n   [insured].\"\n   <em>\n    Theriault\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mut. Fire Ins.

Supp. Aug. 27, 1999) (emphasis supplied). Here, Scott was not a named insured. Metropolitan relies upon case law where the policy expressly names both the innocent insured and the putative wrongdoer as insureds. It has not provided authority where the putative wrongdoer has been found to hold a joint interest in the policy as an unnamed insured under the policy, such that it precludes an innocent insured's coverage under the policy. Metropolitan has also failed to adduce any evidence to establish that Ms. Shepperson and Scott have a joint and nonseverable interest in the policy. In fact, the two plainly have separate interests in what they can claim under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The alignment of named insureds, who jointly agree to an insurance policy, may justify holding each named insured responsible for the acts of the other. Such an alignment does not exist between a named insured and an unnamed insured sufficient to find the named insured, without more, jointly and severally responsible for any insurance loss of which she is innocent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Metropolitan contends that M.G.L. c. 175, \u00a7 99 does not define the term \"the insured\" and thus does not restrict how it may be contractually defined. As explained in Section III.A.2. of this memorandum and order, the general trend has been in favor of allowing innocent co-insured coverage, regardless of the standard policy's absence of the definition for \"the insured.\" Accordingly, Ms. Shepperson, if found that she is innocent of causing the loss, would be able to recover under the policy because\n   of the consensus, which I find to have been adopted in Massachusetts, supporting coverage for an innocent co-insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Ms. Shepperson's Established Innocence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Given the legal rulings I have made to this point, I now turn to focus analysis on whether Ms. Shepperson is an innocent co-insured as a matter of law who can recover under the policy, despite the purported exclusion. While not extensively briefed by the parties, the innocent owner issue as to Ms. Shepperson herself has been adequately presented to me.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   I find no evidence in the record-whether offered by Metropolitan, or otherwise-to suggest that Ms. Shepperson herself committed, directed, or conspired in any intentional or criminal act to cause the fire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   To be sure, in opposition to Ms. Shepperson's motion, Metropolitan, in a footnote, observes that when Scott was asked at his deposition whether he told Ms. Shepperson that he was going to set the fire before doing so, Scott asserted his constitutional rights against self-incrimination. Metropolitan states that under Massachusetts law, I may draw a negative inference against Ms. Shepperson under those circumstances.

Ultimately, the\n   <em>\n    Lentz\n   </em>\n   court concluded that the lower court judge's decision was not erroneous because the defendant provided sufficient evidence to establish a joint venture between the plaintiff and the two nonparty witnesses\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Metropolitan has not met the\n   <em>\n    Lentz\n   </em>\n   predicate here. There is no evidence to establish a joint venture between Ms. Shepperson and her son, Scott, sufficient to draw an unfavorable inference against Ms. Shepperson based on Scott's invocation of his privilege against self-incrimination. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Lentz\n   </em>\n   , the record makes clear Ms. Shepperson was entirely unaware of Scott's incendiary activities and did not endorse them directly or by implication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   By contrast to Metropolitan, Ms. Shepperson has actually provided evidence not turning on some strained construct of adverse inference regarding the question of her innocence. The record shows Ms. Shepperson was away from the insured premises at the time of the fire and that\n   she had no involvement in causing the fire. Metropolitan has adduced no evidence to suggest otherwise and did not even bother to ask about her involvement during her examination under oath. In fact, Ms. Shepperson testified during her examination under oath that Scott told her that he accidently caused the fire. Whether Scott's actions that resulted in the fire were accidental or intentional is of no consequence to Ms. Shepperson's claim, given her own lack of involvement in the fire and consequent lack of any intent, actual or constructive, to cause it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The record before me establishes as a matter of law that Ms. Shepperson is an innocent insured. Metropolitan has not contested this issue sufficiently to identify a genuine issue of material fact. Accordingly, I will grant Ms. Shepperson's motion for summary judgment with respect to Metropolitan's liability as to Count Three, her breach of contract claim. The correlative effect is also to grant summary judgment of Count I, Ms. Shepperson's request for a declaratory judgment on the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D.
