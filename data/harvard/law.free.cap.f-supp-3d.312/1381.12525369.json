The court notes that it \"erred in remanding\" the issue of Commerce's treatment of the cost of caps used by the mandatory respondent \"without ascertaining whether [the issue] had a material effect on the less than fair value determinations. As Commerce explains in the\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   , [this issue does not,] and any error was therefore harmless. It was therefore a waste of administrative resources for the court to require a remand in this case.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CC Metals &amp; Alloys, LLC v.
