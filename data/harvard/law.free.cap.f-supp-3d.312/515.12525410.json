The matter is presently before the Court on Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Amended Complaint pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (ECF No. 17). The parties have thoroughly briefed the underlying issues, and the Court heard oral argument on the Motion on March 22, 2018. The matter is accordingly ripe for decision. For the reasons discussed below, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff enrolled at Western Michigan University Cooley Law School in 2012. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 18, ECF No. 12.) During his first semester Plaintiff sought a psychological evaluation, as a result of which Dr. John Braccio diagnosed him with \"ADHD predominately inattentive type (Guarded) and an Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19.) While in law school at Western Michigan, Plaintiff took a reduced course load and received extra time on his exams. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 20, 21.) In January of 2015, Plaintiff transferred to Michigan State University College of Law, where he also received extra time on exams; he received additional accommodations in the form of \"a 30 minute break for any exam that exceed[ed] four (4) hours and a separate exam room or reduced distraction environment if [a] separate room [was] not available.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In anticipation of applying to take the Virginia Bar Examination, in 2016 Plaintiff obtained an updated psychological evaluation, this time from a different clinical psychologist, Dr. Jennifer Thompson. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25.) She diagnosed Plaintiff \"with a Specific Reading Disorder ... and Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Mild.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26.) In his subsequently filed Bar Application, Plaintiff requested testing accommodations, specifically \"additional testing time, use of a reader, separate testing area, and a private testing room.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28.) Plaintiff supplemented his application and request for accommodations with the necessary forms and records of his psychological evaluations, as well as other supporting documentation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 27, 30-32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Bar applications are submitted to and reviewed by the Board, which is a public entity and an agency of the Supreme Court of Virginia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8.) The Board is responsible for administering the Bar Examination and otherwise ascertaining the qualifications of applicants for admission to the Bar of Virginia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It is also responsible for issuing disability-accommodation decisions; petitions for accommodations are reviewed on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the ADA, as amended by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (\"ADAAA\"), and controlling interpretive case law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 83, 84.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 9, 2016, the Board denied Plaintiff's request for accommodations by letter, stating that the Board's expert reviewing Plaintiff's claimed disability found that the clinical documentation did not support the request for additional time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36.) On June 23, 2016, Plaintiff filed a request for reconsideration with the Board; he included a letter from Dr. Thompson outlining why she believed Plaintiff fit the criteria for a Specific Learning Disability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43.) In his request for reconsideration, Plaintiff also increased his requested time-accommodation, \"because he ... learned\n   that there is more reading on the Virginia Bar Examination than he first understood.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 44.) On July 6, 2016, the Board affirmed its denial of Plaintiff's requested accommodations; Plaintiff did not appeal this denial further. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As a result of the Board's decision, Plaintiff took the Virginia Bar Examination without accommodation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 56.) On October 20, 2016, Plaintiff learned that he did not pass the Bar, and that he missed the passing score by three points. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 59, 60.) Plaintiff subsequently took the Michigan Bar Examination, with accommodations, and passed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 65, 66.) He now works as an attorney in Michigan; however, he desires to practice in Virginia, his home state. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 67, 68.) Accordingly, he brings this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In Count One of the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that the Board unlawfully denied him accommodations to which he was entitled pursuant to the ADA (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 102-03). In Count Two, Plaintiff alleges that the Board unlawfully discriminated against him and other individuals with disabilities through its acts and the policies, practices, and guidelines in place at the time of his application to the Virginia Bar, in violation of the anti-discrimination requirements of \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 113-14.) Finally, Plaintiff alleges in Count Three that the Board violated Plaintiff's fundamental right to pursue his chosen profession, and that its policies, practices, and procedures deny him and others like him equal access to the Virginia Bar Examination and to the legal profession. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 120-22.) Plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as compensatory damages in the amount of $100,000.00.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A motion made pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) challenges the court's jurisdiction over the subject matter of a complaint. Such challenges can be facial, asserting that the facts as pled fail to establish jurisdiction, or factual, disputing the pleadings themselves and arguing that other facts demonstrate that no jurisdiction exists. If a defendant raises a factual challenge, \"the district court may then go beyond the allegations of the complaint and resolve the jurisdictional facts in dispute by considering evidence outside the pleadings, such as affidavits.\"\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court notes as an initial matter that, while Catherine Crooks Hill is named as a Defendant in this action, her only mention in the Amended Complaint is in a single paragraph, which introduces her as \"an officer of the [Board], namely Secretary and Treasurer.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 10.) Moreover, none of Plaintiff's allegations are levelled against Defendants, in the plural, but rather against \"Defendant,\" singular, or simply \"the VBBE\" (Plaintiff's label for the Board). Finally, Plaintiff introduces his Amended Complaint by saying that he \"states the following ... against the defendant, the Virginia Board of Bar Examiners (VBBE):....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) As such, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to allege any facts that would put Defendant Hill on notice of any claims asserted against her, personally.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    550 U.S. at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   To the extent Plaintiff endeavors to use Defendant Hill to preserve jurisdiction through the\n   <em>\n    Ex Parte Young\n   </em>\n   doctrine, the attempt fails.\n   <em>\n    Ex Parte Young\n   </em>\n   is a jurisdictional \"fiction\" that enables a plaintiff to enjoin government officials in their official capacities from perpetuating violations of constitutional or federal statutory rights, usually where sovereign immunity bars a suit against the government entity itself.\n   <em>\n    Antrican v. Odom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9432938\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/290/178/#p184\">\n    290 F.3d 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 184 (4th Cir. 2002). In this case, however, Defendants are correct that Plaintiff has failed to allege any actions by Defendant Hill in her individual capacity which, if enjoined, would provide the relief Plaintiff seeks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that\n   <em>\n    Ex Parte Young\n   </em>\n   does not apply, and to the extent that Plaintiff endeavored to state any claims against Defendant Hill, those claims will be dismissed\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   More generally speaking, with respect to Plaintiff's claims against the Board, Defendants argue that the Complaint as a whole should be dismissed because the Court lacks jurisdiction pursuant to the\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine. Alternatively, Defendants argue that Counts One and Two should be dismissed in recognition of the Board's sovereign immunity and that Count Three should be dismissed for failure to state an equal protection claim.

Among Plaintiff's desired relief is that the Court declare that Defendant violated Plaintiff's rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act by not providing Plaintiff the accommodations that he believes he was entitled to, and for the Court to \"require Defendant to accommodate Plaintiff on any future bar examinations.\" (Am. Compl. 20-21.) Plaintiff primarily argues that the Board's decision to deny his requested accommodations was not a judicial function, taking the issue outside the purview of\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   It is undisputed that the Board is an agency of the Supreme Court of Virginia. The critical question for the Court to determine, therefore, is whether or not the Board proceedings underlying this action were \"judicial in nature,\" as opposed to administrative or ministerial processes. If the Court concludes that the proceedings were in fact judicial, it must then consider whether, in the course of those proceedings, the state court actually adjudicated Plaintiff's claims, or whether Plaintiff has waived adjudication by failing to bring his claims before the state court when it was proper to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Just as the D.C. Court of Appeals considered Feldman's and Hickey's requests for waiver from certain qualification requirements, the Board considered Plaintiff's request for \"waiver\" from the time constraints and other standardized test-taking procedures that normally apply to Virginia Bar examinees. The Board was presented with competing expert reports regarding Plaintiff's disability, and it had to determine based on those reports, Plaintiff's medical and academic records, relevant law, and its own experience and precedents whether it should grant the requested accommodations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff attempts to argue that the Board performed a ministerial act because it makes its accommodations determination according to guidelines and definitions set by the ADA. (Br. Opp. Mot. Dismiss, 14-15.) However, this fact actually cuts against Plaintiff's position. Just as in\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   , where the Supreme Court found that the D.C. Court of Appeals \"determine[d] in light of existing law and in light of Feldman's qualifications and arguments whether Feldman's petition should be granted,\" the Board determined in light of existing law (the ADA) and Plaintiff's medical and academic records whether his petition for accommodations should be granted. As the Supreme Court stated in\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   , this sort of adjudication of current \"rights\" \"is the essence of a judicial proceeding.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194952\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/462/\">\n    460 U.S. at 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194952\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/462/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In light of\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   , the Court agrees with Defendants and finds that this undertaking demonstrates an exercise of judicial judgment and therefore constitutes a judicial proceeding.

This case appears to fall into the latter camp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   State professional licensing does not implicate any fundamental rights. Therefore, rational-basis review is appropriate. State practices surrounding licensing are owed deference, given the states' compelling interest in regulating professions operating in their boundaries-especially those like the medical and legal professions, which are imbued with public trust and the power to influence the lives of others. Additionally, Plaintiff has not demonstrated that Congress faced evidence of a widespread pattern of unconstitutional discrimination in professional licensing when Title\n   II was passed. Thus, as applied to the historically \"lesser\" harm of disability discrimination in professional licensing, the strong measures created in Title II to address truly widespread deprivations of fundamental rights appear unwarranted.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915698\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/507/#p520\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Moreover, this Court agrees with the Tenth Circuit that, \"[a]though Title II permits some flexibility by requiring only reasonable efforts at accommodation, the statute's sweep is exceptionally broad. The abrogation of sovereign immunity here would require states to justify a significant range of rational, everyday licensing decisions that would otherwise be constitutional.\"\n   <em>\n    Guttman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723638\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/1101/#p1124\">\n    669 F.3d at 1124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Every time, as here, a disgruntled bar applicant disagrees with the Board's decision to listen to one doctor over another with regard to accommodations, or in other cases disciplinary measures, the door would stand open to litigation in federal court. The potential magnitude of this opening counsels against abrogation, as does the fact that doing so may have Tenth Amendment consequences as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   For all these reasons, the Court finds that the remedial scheme established by Title II is neither congruent nor proportional to the negligible history of disability-based discrimination in state-administered professional licensing, and that \"it cannot be understood as responsive to, or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behavior\" in this context.\n   <em>\n    City of Boerne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915698\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/507/#p520\">\n    521 U.S. at 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915698\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/507/#p520\">\n    117 S.Ct. 2157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, the Court concludes that Title II, as it applies to the class of cases implicating professional licensing by the states, does not constitute a valid exercise of Congress's \u00a7 5 authority.

Despite this, Plaintiff was unable to find any evidence that the Board received federal funding. Counsel for Plaintiff conceded as much at the hearing on the Motion to Dismiss. Plaintiff nevertheless clings to the argument that, because the Virginia Supreme Court receives federal funding for programs, and because the Board is an arm of the Virginia Supreme Court, the Board indirectly benefits from the federal funds. (Br. Opp. Mot. Dismiss 11-12; Pl. Supp. Br. 3.) This position ignores the \"piecemeal\" structure of the RA's waiver provision, as well as the \"knowing and voluntary\" requirement imposed by the Fourth Circuit. The same goes for Plaintiff's unsupported argument that the Board receives federal funds in the form of vouchers supplied by other entities to cover Bar-takers' costs and fees. At the very least, such a scheme would give rise to ambiguity as to the Board's knowing acceptance of federal funds, and, as stated above, ambiguities are construed in favor of the sovereign in this analysis.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1340384\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/527/#p531\">\n    514 U.S. at 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1340384\" index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/527/#p531\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Court accordingly finds that the Board does not accept federal funds and has not waived its Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity with regard to the RA.

Plaintiff Fails State a Claim for an Equal Protection Violation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In Count Three of the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff first claims that the Board's actions violated his fundamental right to pursue his chosen profession or calling, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. For the reasons discussed above,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Part B.1., the right to pursue one's chosen profession is not a fundamental right for Fourteenth Amendment purposes, so this claim fails. Next, Plaintiff claims that the Board's policies, practices, and procedures denied him equal access to the bar examination, and therefore the legal profession, by denying him \"and other [sic] similarly situated\" the accommodations necessary to \"complete the 2016 Virginia Bar Examination on equal footing with other examinees.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 121-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In the Motion to Dismiss, Defendants argue that Plaintiff has failed to satisfactorily plead an Equal Protection Clause violation because he has not provided anything beyond conclusory allegations that he was treated differently from others similarly situated or alleged discriminatory animus. Plaintiff asserts that he has sufficiently pled that he was treated differently from similarly situated bar applicants in that he was not allowed to test on equal footing with them, with his desired accommodations. Plaintiff further argues that, because the Amended Complaint alleges that the Board was aware of the ADA and knowingly violated the statute, he has sufficiently pled discriminatory animus. For the reasons stated below, the Court finds\n   that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment declares that \"[n]o State shall ... deny to any person ... the equal protection of the laws.\" U.S. Const., amend.

The Amended Complaint states simply that the Board \"denied Plaintiff reasonable accommodations,\" yet it goes on to claim that this individual denial \"discriminates against Plaintiff and other learning disabled and others with disabilities examinees [sic].\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 121.) Plaintiff then proceeds to allege that the Board \"is discriminating and violating the equal protection clause against Plaintiff, and other [sic] similarly situated, by denying learning disabled and other with disabilities examinees [sic] equal access to the bar examination and the legal profession.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 122.) These bare allegations are insufficient for the Court to determine, accepting the pleadings as true, that the Board took an affirmative action towards or against Plaintiff that it did not take in the case of a similarly situated individual. The absence of firm comparators renders Plaintiff's claim nebulous at best, leaving the Court to wonder if Plaintiff is similarly situated to a test-taker without disabilities, or to a test-taker who was similarly disabled yet granted accommodations while Plaintiff was not.
