BROWNING, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   comes before the Court on the Plaintiffs' Opening Merits Brief, filed April 28, 2017 (Doc. 112)(\"Din\u00e9 Brief\"). The primary issues are: (i) whether the Plaintiffs have standing to pursue their claims under the National Environmental Policy Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204321\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to 4370m-12 (\"NEPA\") and the National Historic Preservation Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20470\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to 470x-6 (\"NHPA\"); (ii) whether the Plaintiffs are challenging final agency action within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20704\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"APA\"); (iii) whether any of the Plaintiffs' challenges to various Applications for Permit to Drill (\"APDs\") are moot; (iv) whether Defendant United States Bureau of Land Management (\"BLM\") violated NEPA by failing to adequately consider the environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling in developing the Mancos Shale in the San Juan Basin; (v) whether the BLM adequately involved the public in its NEPA process; (vi) whether the BLM violated the NHPA for failing to consider the indirect effects that well pads would have on Chaco Culture National Historic Park, Chacoan Outliers, the Chaco Culture Archaeological Protection Sites, and the Great North Road (collectively \"Chaco Park and its satellites\"); and (vii) if there is a NEPA or NHPA violation, whether the proper remedy is remand without vacatur, remand with vacatur, or a permanent injunction. The Court concludes that: (i) the Plaintiffs have standing to pursue their NEPA and NHPA claims; (ii) the Plaintiffs may challenge most, but not all, of the APDs under the APA; (iii) the Plaintiffs' APD challenges are not moot, except as to permanently abandoned wells; (iv) the BLM complied with NEPA's requirements; (v) the BLM adequately involved the public in its NEPA process, as it gave notice of finalized Environmental Assessments' (\"EAs\") availability through its online NEPA logs, and sent notices of and hosted public meetings at each proposed well's site; (vi) the BLM did not violate the NHPA, because it considered the effects on historical sites within the wells' areas of potential effects; and (vii) if the BLM had violated NEPA or the NHPA, vacatur with remand would be the proper remedy for the NEPA violation, but remand without vacatur would be the proper remedy for the NHPA violation. Accordingly, the Court denies the requests in the Din\u00e9 Brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court divides its factual background into five sections.

He has visited Chaco Park-a historic site in the San Juan Basin-at least annually since 1997.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Eisenfeld Decl. \u00b6 5, at 2. He last visited there in July, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Eisenfeld Decl. \u00b6 5, at 2.

He last visited the \"Nageezi area\" on April 20, 2017, and intends to return in May and June of 2017. Eisenfeld Decl. \u00b6 5, at 2. He contends that the BLM has approved various APDs after conducting EAs that were not available for the public, including himself, to review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Eisenfeld Decl. \u00b6 9, at 4-5. Specifically, Eisenfeld checked the BLM's website and visited its public reading room throughout 2014, and on October 2, 2014, \"no NEPA documentation was available to the public.\" Eisenfeld Decl. \u00b6 11, at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   According to Eisenfeld, the BLM's approval of these APDs \"threatens to irreparably harm [his] personal and professional interest in an intact Chacoan landscape ... by impacting important environmental (air, water, treasured landscapes), historical, and cultural resources.\" Eisenfeld Decl. \u00b6 9, at 5 (alteration added). Eisenfeld states that he has visited hundreds of well sites in the \"greater Chaco area\" and has \"frequented lands where many other Mancos Shale\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   wells are in view.\" Eisenfeld Decl. \u00b6 12, at 6. Eisenfeld alleges that the\n   BLM has allowed \"APD proponents to flare natural gas in the greater Chaco area when drilling for oil.\" Eisenfeld Decl. \u00b6 13, at 6. According to Eisenfeld, this flaring harms the air quality and his health, and \"compromises the night sky\" in the Chaco Park area. Eisenfeld Decl. \u00b6 13, at 6-7. Eisenfeld states that the APD approvals have also \"compromised noted archeological sites.\" Eisenfeld Decl. \u00b6 13, at 7. Eisenfeld states that he is \"harmed by the lack of government agency compliance in evaluating the direct, indirect, cumulative and connected impacts of operations approved by BLM.\" Eisenfeld Decl. \u00b6 16, at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 2010-2012, Eisenfeld visited some Mancos Shale wells amongst the communities of Counselor, Lybrook, and Nageezi.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supplemental Declaration of Mike Eisenfeld \u00b6 3, at 2 (executed July 26, 2017), filed July 28, 2017 (Doc. 117-3)(\"Eisenfeld Supp. Decl.\"). He visited \"over 150 WPX [and] Encana\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   ... wells being drilled and developed in the Mancos Shale.\" Eisenfeld Supp. Decl. \u00b6 3, at 2 (alteration added). Specifically, he has visited well sites called \"Encana Lybrook, Gallo Canyon Unit and Escrito wells, and WPX Chaco unit wells.\" Eisenfeld Supp. Decl. \u00b6 3, at 2. At these well sites, Eisenfeld has seen \"drilling, flaring, hydraulic fracturing, nitrogen treatment, fracking trucks, chemical storage and an endless stream of activity.\" Eisenfeld Supp. Decl. \u00b6 4, at 2. Eisenfeld states that \"the flaring of natural gas from the Mancos Shale oil wells have been visually apparent ... [,] representing waste, pollution and lost revenue/royalties.\" Eisenfeld Supp. Decl. \u00b6 6, at 3. Eisenfeld states that the resulting fumes, reckless truck travel, and even exploding wells have made him feel unsafe when traveling in the Mancos Shale area.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Eisenfeld Supp. Decl. \u00b6 7, at 4. Eisenfeld notes that an explosion occurred on a well pad in Nageezi in 2016, and he states that he fears that additional explosions may follow \"as long as Mancos Shale development is allowed to proceed unimpeded and unanalyzed.\" Eisenfeld Supp. Decl. \u00b6 8, at 4. Eisenfeld also submits to the Court photographs that \"show clustered WPX wells, a producing Mancos Shale oil well, a well site with three active flares, and a five-acre well pad where Mancos Shale oil is being drilled for.\" Eisenfeld Supp. Decl. \u00b6 8, at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Jeremy Nichols is a member of WildEarth Guardians.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Jeremy Nichols \u00b6 2, at 2 (executed April 27, 2017), filed April 28, 2017 (Doc. 112-2)(\"Nichols Decl.\"). Nichols states that he visited \"the Chaco outlier ruin of Pueblo Pintado\" in March, 2017. Nichols Decl. \u00b6 5, at 3. He visited Chaco Park in March, 2008, March, 2012, April, 2013, and May, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nichols Decl. \u00b6 5, at 4-5. Nichols states that he intends to continue visiting \"the Greater Chaco region, including [Chaco Park] and its outliers ... at least once a year for the foreseeable future.\" Nichols Decl. \u00b6 6, at 6. He states that he intends to visit \"this area\" again in June, 2017, when he has a trip planned. Nichols Decl. \u00b6 6, at 6. Nichols states that he does not recall any oil-and-gas development in the area in 2008, but by 2014, \"there were rigs seemingly all over the place, around Nageezi and the road to [Chaco Park].\" Nichols Decl. \u00b6 7, at 6-7. According to Nichols, during his last visit, \"there were extensive oil and gas well facilities and infrastructure in the area, particularly around Nageezi and Lybrook.\" Nichols Decl. \u00b6 7, at 7. Nichols states that this new oil-and-gas development \"has detracted significantly from [his] enjoyment of the Greater Chaco area,\" and has \"significantly eroded the\n   natural and remote nature of the region.\" Nichols Decl. \u00b6 8, at 7 (alteration added). According to Nichols, the oil-and-gas development has also created \"smells, dust, and more industrialization,\" which are \"aesthetically displeasing.\" Nichols Decl. \u00b6 9, at 7. Nichols states that, \"[i]f the BLM were prohibited from approving new drilling permits in this area until it developed a new plan ... [,] it would diminish the harms to [his] recreational enjoyment of the area and likely ensure that [his] future visits with friends and family will be more enjoyable than they currently are.\" Nichols Decl. \u00b6 12, at 9 (alteration added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Deborah Green represents that she is a member of the Natural Resources Defense Council.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Deborah Green \u00b6 3, at 2 (executed April 14, 2017), filed April 28, 2017 (Doc. 112-3)(\"Green Decl.\").

Green states that she has experienced several environmental problems while driving along Highway 550 to Chaco Canyon, including air pollution from gas flares, exhaust from oil-and-gas trucks, noise pollution from heavy truck traffic, and light pollution from nighttime drilling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supplemental Declaration of Deborah Green \u00b6 8, at 3 (executed July 27, 2017), filed July 28, 2017 (Doc. 117-4)(\"Green Supp. Decl.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Hope Miura represents that she lives in the Cochiti Pueblo,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   which is \"about a three hour drive ... to the Chaco Canyon area/region.\" Declaration of Hope Miura \u00b6 1, at 2 (executed April 17, 2017), filed April 28, 2017 (Doc. 112-4)(\"Miura Decl.\").

Din\u00e9 Brief at 12 (emphasis omitted). Specifically, they contend that the 2003 RMP/EIS, which authorized 9,942 wells, did not analyze the effects of drilling in the Mancos Shale, as it was thought not to be an economical option in 2003.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Din\u00e9 Brief at 13.

According to the Plaintiffs, the BLM cannot rely on the 2003 RMP/EIS, because \"[t]he 2003 RMP/EIS does not offer any analysis for the landscape-level impacts from drilling at this new scale, and therefore cannot be used as an underlying basis for analyzing Mancos Shale EAs and approving APDs.\" Din\u00e9 Brief at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Plaintiffs argue that the Court and the Tenth Circuit erred when denying a preliminary injunction on the grounds that a new EIS is needed only \"when the quantum of environmental impact exceeds that which the operative EIS anticipated,\" and that no new statement was needed, because the \"Mancos Shell development had not yet exceeded the foreseeable impacts from 9,942 wells.\" Din\u00e9 Brief at 15. According to the Plaintiffs, the Court and the Tenth Circuit erred, because the relevant regulations require the agency to consider\n   \"the impacts from\n   <em>\n    foreseeable\n   </em>\n   development\" and not just the impacts from past development.

The Plaintiffs argue, therefore, that, because the 2003 EIS did not anticipate horizontal drilling's and fracking technology's effects, and that the foreseeable impact of the Mancos Shale wells exceeds the quantum of environmental impacts anticipated and analyzed in the 2003 EIS, the authorization of the additional wells violates NEPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Din\u00e9 Brief at 16-17 (\"BLM has never analyzed the environmental and human health impacts from the combined total of 13,902 reasonably foreseeable oil and gas wells across the San Juan Basin.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Plaintiffs also contend that the BLM violated NEPA when all of the EAs for the Mancos Shale wells \"tiered\" to the 2003 RMP/EIS.

The BLM argues that the Court has jurisdiction, under the APA, to review only \"final agency actions.\" BLM Response at 14 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20704\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). It follows, according to the BLM, that the Court lacks jurisdiction over the 28 future APD approvals, because those approvals are not final.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLM Response at 14. The BLM also argues that the Plaintiffs' challenges to the completed wells-wells that have already been drilled, fracked, or abandoned-are moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLM Response at 15. According to the BLM, the challenges to the 177 completed wells are moot, because a court cannot enjoin, preclude, or \"undo\" a completed project. BLM Response at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The BLM also argues that it complied with NEPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLM Response at 16-36. First, it contends that the BLM took a hard look at the impacts of the challenged wells.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLM Response at 16. The BLM argues that the Plaintiffs have not presented new evidence since the preliminary injunction stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLM Response at 16. Thus, according to the BLM, \"the Court's original analysis continues to apply.\" BLM Response at 16. It argues that, because the additional Mancos Shale wells will not exceed the impacts accounted for in the 2003 RMP/EIS, the BLM has not violated NEPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLM Response at 16. According to the BLM, the 2003 RMP/EIS accounted for 5,997 wells in the San Juan Basin.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLM Response at 17. The BLM asserts that, from those 5,997 wells projected, it follows that the 3,960 predicted wells either drilled or to be drilled falls within the original prediction, so the 2003 RMP/EIS remains valid and the BLM can rely upon it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLM Response at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The BLM contends that the Plaintiffs' argument, which asserts that the BLM did not consider the foreseeable effect of the 3,960 wells, is incorrect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLM Response at 17. It argues that the record demonstrates that the 2001 RFDS concluded that the Mancos Shale \"may have significant potential as a shale gas candidate,\" and that there may be reservoir zones in the Mancos shale not yet recognized. BLM Response at 17. According to the BLM, the RFDS also recognized the potential for horizontal drilling and fracking in the Mancos Shale.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLM Response at 17-18. The BLM asserts, moreover, that the 2003 RMP/EIS \"noted that the Mancos Shale was a source of both oil and gas.\" BLM Response at 18. The BLM concedes that the 2003 RMP/EIS did not consider developing the Mancos Shale specifically, but the BLM notes that analyzing the Mancos Shale was not the RMP/EIS' goal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLM Response at 18. Rather, according to the BLM, the 2003 RMP/EIS' goal is to analyze the \"impacts of all foreseeable oil and gas development on federal lands in the San Juan Basin, regardless of geological formations targeted or technologies used.\" BLM Response at 18. The BLM also argues that the 2003 RMP/EIS anticipated fracking and \"directional drilling,\" in addition to \"other innovative drilling techniques.\" BLM Response at 18. According to the BLM, \"[t]he RMP/EIS did not exclude horizontal drilling and multistage fracking from its analysis because both were widely used in similar formations elsewhere in the United States by 2003, and foreseeable in the Mancos Shale as soon as the market made them economically feasible.\" BLM Response at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The BLM next contends that tiering to the RMP/EIS is appropriate, because the 2003 EMP/EIS considered fracking and horizontal drilling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLM Response at 21. It adds, however, that, even if the 2003 RMP/EIS did not consider fracking and horizontal drilling, tiering is still appropriate, because the 2003 RMP/EIS' analysis\n   of vertical drilling would not be qualitatively different from horizontal drilling and fracking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLM Response at 21. According to the BLM, because horizontal drilling and fracking \"result in the same types of impacts as other type of oil and gas development,\" including vertical drilling, tiering to the 2003 RMP/EIS, which considered the effects of vertical drilling, remains appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLM Response at 21. The BLM argues that the Plaintiffs present no admissible evidence that horizontal drilling and fracking are so different from vertical drilling that tiering is inappropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLM Response at 22. It also argues that there is no record evidence that horizontal drilling causes so much more harm than vertical drilling that impacts from horizontal drilling exceed the impacts of the 9,942 wells analyzed in the 2003 RMP/EIS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLM Response at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The BLM also argues that that the 2003 RMP/EIS considered the cumulative impacts of the 3,960 Mancos Shale wells, including the region's past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future oil and gas development.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLM Response at 24-25. The BLM adds that its EAs effectively supplement the 2003 RMP/EIS' analysis of fracking and horizontal drilling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLM Response at 25. It also argues that the EAs \"explain that fracking in the Mancos Shale is not anticipated to impact groundwater,\" because the Mancos Shale is separate from the relevant aquifers. BLM Response at 25. The BLM asserts that, contrary to the Plaintiffs' arguments, the 2003 RMP/EIS took a \"hard look\" at the cumulative impact the wells would have on climate change, because the RMP/EIS estimated the wells' greenhouse gas emissions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLM Response at 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Next, the BLM asserts that it complied with NEPA's public involvement requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLM Response at 31. According to the BLM, it satisfied those requirements by: (i) maintaining and updating a NEPA log on its website; (ii) posting notices for proposed wells in a public reading room; and (iii) hosting public meetings at the site of each proposed well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLM Response at 31. The BLM contends that it did not need to solicit additional public comment about the Mancos Shale horizontal drilling and fracking, because fracking and horizontal drilling is \"routine in the San Juan Basin.\" BLM Response at 32. The BLM also argues that it is only required to notify the public of final EA and FONSIs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLM Response at 31. It contends that it satisfied those specific requirements, because, once it issued an APD decision, the BLM marked the APD as approved on the online NEPA log, and it placed final EAs, FONSIs and decision records in its public reading room and on its website.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLM Response at 32-33. The BLM also contends that, while there was \"some delay\" in posting \"certain EAs and FONSIs in the reading room and online,\" NEPA does not have a notice deadline.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLM Response at 33. The BLM adds that, even if it failed to give the requisite notice, such an error is harmless, because there has been no evidence of prejudice to the Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLM Response at 34. According to the BLM, the error is also harmless, because the Plaintiffs and BLM worked to rectify posting process errors together and the BLM provided the Plaintiffs relevant documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLM Response at 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Finally, the BLM argues that it complied with the NHPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLM Response at 36. The BLM argues that it complied with the NHPA \"by defining the APE for each challenged APD based on the location of the proposed well and the types of known and suspected historic properties in the area, and assessing the adverse effects to historic properties both within and without the APE.\" BLM Response at 37. It also argues that the NHPA does not require the BLM to issue a separate APE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   analysis for direct and indirect effects.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLM Response at 38 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20800.4\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 800.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), 800.16(d) ). The BLM contends that it did not violate the NHPA by failing to consult with the State Historic Preservation Office (\"SHPO\") after defining an APE that accounts for direct effects, because a SHPO consultation is required only when defining the APE is complicated or controversial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLM Response at 38-39. BLM also contends that it did not contravene the NHPA, because the \"vast majority of historic properties near the challenged APDs are not landscape level properties\" but are archeological sites. BLM Response at 39. It follows, according to the BLM, that indirect and cumulative effects such as air pollution, noise, and visual disturbances do not affect the archaeological sites' historic characteristics, and thus the BLM did not violate the NHPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLM Response at 39. The BLM also argues that air pollution, noise, and visual disturbances do not adversely affect the historic characteristics of Chaco Park and its satellite locations, so there is no NHPA violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLM Response at 40. The BLM adds that, even if air pollution, noise, and visual disturbances do affect Chaco Park and its satellite locations, it is not foreseeable that those disturbances would affect those sites, especially because they are miles away from the oil wells, so there is no NHPA violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLM Response at 40-41. Finally, the BLM argues that it has considered effects on historic properties, which, according to the BLM, is all that NHPA requires.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BLM Response at 41-42 (\"[T]he NHPA only requires that an agency take procedural steps to identify cultural resources; it does not impose a substantive mandate on the agency to protect the resources.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     The Operators' Response\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Operators also filed a response.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Operators' Response Brief, filed June 23, 2017 (Doc. 114)(\"Operators' Response\"). According to the Operators' the main issue is not whether \"newer and more complex technologies are being used to drill Mancos Shale wells,\" but, instead \"whether the environmental impacts of those methods were adequately considered in the project specific EAs, or the programmatic RMP/EIS to which the EAs were tiered.\" Operators' Response at 9. The Operators contend that the BLM complied with NEPA, because \"the impacts of the approved wells fell within the scope of the 9,942 wells studied in 2003.\" Operators' Response at 8-9. Although the Operators concede that any one horizontal drill may have more impact than a single vertical well, as a horizontal well requires a larger well pad and longer drilling times,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Operators' Response at 6, they argue that horizontal drilling \"\n   <em>\n    decreases\n   </em>\n   \" the overall impact compared to vertical drilling, because \"fewer wells are needed to develop the resource,\" Operators Response at 6-7 (emphasis in original). They also argue that the 2003 RMP/EIS accounted for the impacts of horizontal drilling, so, according to the Operators, there is no NEPA violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Operators Response at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Operators also argue that the tiered 2014 EAs properly updated the 2003 RMP/EIS analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Operators' Response at 11. In support of that contention, they note that the EAs since 2014 incorporate by reference \"detailed cumulative air impact analysis\" from the BLM's 2014 Air Resources Technical Report (\"ARTR\"), which describes \"the air quality impacts of 21,150 existing oil and gas wells in the Basin, ... future oil and gas drilling (including in the Mancos Shale), as well as impacts of other greenhouse gas sources.\" Operators' Response at 11-12. According to the Operators, the 2014 ARTR accounted specifically for the Mancos Shale formation, so the BLM was justified in relying on that report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Operators' Response at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Operators echo the BLM's argument that the BLM does not need to analyze the 3,960 potential Mancos Shale wells as additional wells to the 9,942 wells analyzed in the 2003 RMP/EIS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Operators' Response at 13-14. They also argue that, with regard to cumulative impact studies, NEPA does not require individual APDs to include such an expansive cumulative analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Operators' Response at 14-15. The Operators add that the BLM was not required to halt its decision-making processes once it started the RMP amendment process, because to \"hold otherwise would jeopardize or impair BLM's ability to manage the public lands, since it is often engaged in plan amendment or revision.\" Operators' Response at 17. The Operators also argue that the BLM adequately involved the public in its EA process for the same reasons that the BLM articulated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Operators' Response at 18-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Operators contend that the BLM complied with NHPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Operators' Response at 20. First, they contend that the NHPA does not protect the \"Greater Chaco Landscape\"-a 67,000 square-mile region-as the Plaintiffs assert, because the Greater Chaco landscape is not an historic property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Operators' Response at 20-21. The Operators also argue that, even if the landscape did qualify as a historic property, \"Din\u00e9 fails to demonstrate how the landscape itself would be adversely affected in a way that would disqualify it from listing on the National register.\" Operators' Response at 22. The Operators' argue that the Mancos Shale wells will not contribute to changing the region to such a degree that it loses its historic status, because the Mancos Shale area has already been \"subject to extensive oil and gas development under pre-existing oil and gas leases.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Operators' Brief at 22. They also argue that many of the landscape alterations Din\u00e9 asserts-visual and noise effects associated with drilling and completion-are temporary in nature, so they \"will not permanently alter the character of the landscape.\" Operators' Brief at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Operators contend that there was no NHPA violation, because the BLM properly followed the 2004 and 2014 Protocols.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Operators' Brief at 24. According to the Operators, the State Protocol requires the BLM to consult with the State Historic Preservation Office if and only if the APE is \"not precisely defined by the State Protocol.\" Operators' Brief at 24. The Operators argue that the 2014 Protocol defines the APE as \"the area of direct effect (as precisely defined for specified actions), and known historic properties indirectly affected in the vicinity, if BLM cultural resource specialists determine it is appropriate to the Area of Potential Effect.\" Operators' Brief at 24-25. The Operators argue that each proposed APD \"applied the direct Area of Potential effect,\" and the BLM did not identify known historic properties outside the direct APE zone that might be indirectly affected, so, according to the Operators, the BLM complied with the 2004 and 2014 Protocols. Operators' Brief at 25. The Operators also argue that the BLM properly complied with section 106's requirement that it consult regarding the effects of oil and gas development, because the BLM affirmed seventy-nine specially designated areas, it recognized two sites as Areas of critical environmental concern, and oil and gas leasing was either eliminated in the seventy-nine sites or subjected to strict restrictions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Operators' Brief at 25-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Finally, the Operators argue that, should the Court determine that the Plaintiffs prevail, remand is the appropriate remedy as opposed to an injunction or vacatur.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Operators' Brief at 26. They contend that any deficiencies in the well approvals are not serious enough for vacatur or an injunction, because the BLM has\n   employed \"robust cumulative impact analyses\" in its most recent RFDs, and \"any NEPA errors that may have existed at one time have now been corrected.\" Operators' Brief at 27. Thus, according to the Operators, \"if any NEPA or NHPA error exists, it can be addressed on remand without upsetting the APD approvals.\" Operators' Brief at 27. They add that any BLM error must be weighed against the harm to the Operators if APDs are vacated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Operators' Brief at 28. The Operators argue that the harm they would suffer is dire, because their contractors and employees \"rely on the continued viability of oil and gas development in northwestern New Mexico.\" Operators' Brief at 28. They conclude that remand is \"the only appropriate remedy.\" Operators' Brief at 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     API's Response\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The API responds and asserts many of the same arguments as the BLM and the Operators.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Intervenor-Defendant American Petroleum Institute's Opposition to Plaintiffs' Opening Merits Brief at 1-23, filed June 23, 2017 (Doc. 115)(\"API Response\").

Nevertheless, API considers the Plaintiffs' old NEPA arguments and contends that the Court must defer to the BLM's determinations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   API Response at 9-10. It also asserts that the BLM was not required to issue a new or supplemental EIS, because there was no new information compelling a conclusion that the new wells would have affected the environment in a significant manner which the 2003 RMP/EIS did not already address.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   API Response at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   API also argues, as the Operators did, that the Plaintiffs have not established that the balance of equities favor an injunction or vacatur over remand should the Court determine that the BLM violated NEPA or NHPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   API Response at 13. It contends that the Plaintiffs' purported environmental harms are not that significant, because the Plaintiffs have already experienced a great deal of oil and gas development, as the San Juan Basin has been subject to drilling for more than 60 years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   API Response at 15 (\"Under these circumstances, the incremental environmental impacts of the additional challenged APDs are both relative limited in comparison to the oil and gas rigs seemingly all over the place before Plaintiffs ever filed this lawsuit.\").

The agency's interpretation will be accepted if, though not the fairest reading of the regulation, it is a plausible reading-within the scope of the ambiguity that the regulation contains.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   Our cases have not put forward a persuasive justification for\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   The first case to apply it,\n   <em>\n    Seminole Rock,\n   </em>\n   offered no justification whatever-just the\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   that \"the administrative interpretation ... becomes of controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\" Our later cases provide two principal explanations, neither of which has much to be said for it. First, some cases say that the agency, as the drafter of the rule, will have some special insight into its intent when enacting it. The implied premise of this argument-that what we are looking for is the agency's intent in adopting the rule-is false. There is true of regulations what is true of statutes. As Justice Holmes put it: \"[w]e do not inquire what the legislature meant; we ask only what the statute means.\" Whether governing rules are made by the national legislature or an administrative agency, we are bound by what they say, not by the unexpressed intention of those who made them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   The other rationale our cases provide is that the agency possesses special expertise in administering its \" 'complex and highly technical regulatory program.' \" That is true enough, and it leads to the conclusion that agencies and not courts should make regulations. But it has nothing to do with who should interpret regulations-unless one believes that the purpose of interpretation is to make the regulatory program work in a fashion that the current leadership of the agency deems effective. Making regulatory programs effective is the purpose of rulemaking, in which the agency uses its \"special expertise\" to formulate the best rule. But the purpose of interpretation is to determine the fair meaning of the rule-to \"say what the law is.\" Not to make policy, but to determine what policy has been made and promulgated by the agency, to which the public owes obedience. Indeed, since the leadership of agencies (and hence the policy preferences of agencies) changes with Presidential administrations, an agency head can only be sure that the application of his \"special expertise\" to the issue addressed by a regulation will be given effect if we adhere to predictable principles of textual interpretation rather than defer to the \"special expertise\" of his successors. If we take agency enactments as written, the Executive has a stable background against which to write its rules and achieve the policy ends it thinks best.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   Another conceivable justification for\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference, though not one that is to be found in our cases, is this: If it is reasonable to defer to agencies regarding the meaning of statutes that Congress enacted, as we do per\n   <em>\n    Chevron,\n   </em>\n   it is a fortiori reasonable to defer to them regarding the meaning of regulations that they themselves crafted. To give an agency less control over the meaning of its own regulations than it has over the meaning of a congressionally enacted statute seems quite odd.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   But it is not odd at all. The theory of\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   (take it or leave it) is that when Congress gives an agency authority to administer a statute, including authority to issue interpretive regulations, it implicitly accords the agency a degree of discretion, which the courts must respect, regarding the meaning of the statute. While the implication of an agency power to clarify the statute is reasonable enough, there is surely no congressional implication that the agency can resolve ambiguities in its own regulations. For that would violate a fundamental principle of separation of powers-that the power to write a law and the power to interpret it cannot rest in the same hands. \"When the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person ... there can be no liberty; because apprehensions may arise, lest the same\n   monarch or senate should enact tyrannical laws, to execute them in a tyrannical manner.\" Montesquieu,\n   <em>\n    Spirit of the Laws\n   </em>\n   bk. XI, at 151-152 (O. Piest ed., T. Nugent transl. 1949). Congress cannot enlarge its own power through\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   -whatever it leaves vague in the statute will be worked out by someone else.\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   represents a presumption about who, as between the Executive and the Judiciary, that someone else will be. (The Executive, by the way-the competing political branch-is the less congenial repository of the power as far as Congress is concerned.) So Congress's incentive is to speak as clearly as possible on the matters it regards as important.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   But when an agency interprets its own rules-that is something else. Then the power to prescribe is augmented by the power to interpret; and the incentive is to speak vaguely and broadly, so as to retain a \"flexibility\" that will enable \"clarification\" with retroactive effect. \"It is perfectly understandable\" for an agency to \"issue vague regulations\" if doing so will \"maximiz[e] agency power.\" Combining the power to prescribe with the power to interpret is not a new evil: Blackstone condemned the practice of resolving doubts about \"the construction of the Roman laws\" by \"stat[ing] the case to the emperor in writing, and tak[ing] his opinion upon it.\" 1 Wm. Blackstone,\n   <em>\n    Commentaries on the Laws of England\n   </em>\n   58 (1765). And our Constitution did not mirror the British practice of using the House of Lords as a court of last resort, due in part to the fear that he who has \"agency in passing bad laws\" might operate in the \"same spirit\" in their interpretation. The Federalist No. 81, at 543-544 (Alexander Hamilton)(J. Cooke ed. 1961).\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference encourages agencies to be \"vague in framing regulations, with the plan of issuing 'interpretations' to create the intended new law without observance of notice and comment procedures.\"\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   is not a logical corollary to\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   but a dangerous permission slip for the arrogation of power.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   It is true enough that\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference has the same beneficial pragmatic effect as\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference: The country need not endure the uncertainty produced by divergent views of numerous district courts and courts of appeals as to what is the fairest reading of the regulation, until a definitive answer is finally provided, years later, by this Court. The agency's view can be relied upon, unless it is, so to speak, beyond the pale. But the duration of the uncertainty produced by a vague regulation need not be as long as the uncertainty produced by a vague statute. For as soon as an interpretation uncongenial to the agency is pronounced by a district court, the agency can begin the process of amending the regulation to make its meaning entirely clear. The circumstances of this case demonstrate the point. While these cases were being briefed before us, EPA issued a rule designed to respond to the Court of Appeals judgment we are reviewing. It did so (by the standards of such things) relatively quickly: The decision below was handed down in May 2011, and in December 2012 the EPA published an amended rule setting forth in unmistakable terms the position it argues here. And there is another respect in which a lack of\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   -type deference has less severe pragmatic consequences for rules than for statutes. In many cases, when an agency believes that its rule permits conduct that the text arguably forbids, it can simply exercise its discretion not to prosecute. That is not possible, of course, when, as here, a party harmed by the violation has standing to compel enforcement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   In any case, however great may be the efficiency gains derived from\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference, beneficial effect cannot justify a rule that not only has no principled basis but contravenes one of the great rules of separation of powers: He who writes a law must not adjudge its violation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   <em>\n    Decker v.

The BLM complied with NEPA's public involvement requirements, because it posted information about its proposed wells on its public website and invited the public to meetings about proposed wells. Although there was a delay in furnishing final EAs to the public, such delay did not violate NEPA, as the BLM made those EAs available promptly on request. The BLM also did not violate the NHPA, because it defined an APE for each well, considered the effects on historic sites within that APE, and made determinations of no effect, no adverse effect, and adverse effect, as appropriate. Because Chaco Park and its satellites are outside those wells' APEs, the BLM was not required to consider the indirect effects the wells would have on Chaco Park and its satellites. The APEs drawn for those wells did not violate the NHPA by excluding Chaco Park and its satellites, because the BLM followed the 2004 and 2014 protocols in drawing those APEs. Finally, if the Court were to conclude that the BLM had violated NEPA or the NHPA, vacatur with remand would be the proper remedy for the NEPA violation, but remand without vacatur would be the proper remedy for the NHPA violation. The balance of harms favors vacatur for a potential NEPA violation, but not for the aesthetic NHPA violation. Accordingly, vacatur is proper for a NEPA violation, but not the NHPA violation.

Here, they cure that deficiency and argue that the total impacts of horizontal drilling coupled with the already drilled vertical wells will exceed the total impacts considered in the 2003 EIS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Din\u00e9 Reply at 11-12. Specifically, they argue that the 2003 EIS considered only the surface impacts to 18,577 acres, whereas, with the addition 3,960 Mancos Shale wells, the combined surface impact of the already-drilled vertical wells and the Mancos Shale wells will be 28,482 acres-therefore exceeding the surface impact considered in the 2003 EIS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Din\u00e9 Reply at 11. Their analysis is flawed, however, because they assume that for every one horizontal well, there will be a surface impact of 5.2 acres.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Din\u00e9 Reply at 11. That ignores record evidence demonstrating that several horizontal wells may fit per well pad.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Environmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NM-F010-2016-0036 at 16, (February, 2016)(A.R.0234975)(noting\n   that four wells could be drilled from one well pad that encompassed a 4.57 acre area)(\"2016 EA\"); 2014 EA at 17 (A.R.0140164)(explaining that \"horizontal drilling often allows for 'twinning,' or drilling two or more wells from one shared well pad\"). The Court declines to adopt that bloated acreage number, as the record refutes it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   The Plaintiffs' argument is even more fundamentally flawed, however, because in aggregating the surface impacts, they count impacts of all of the potential 3,960 horizontal wells. But the Plaintiffs do not and cannot challenge all of the 3,960 horizontal wells, because only 382 are at issue, and, as the Court has concluded, only 350 are live in this dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 105, at 30;\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 1088 n.17, 1090 n.19. The narrow question before the Court, therefore, is whether the 350 APDs violate NEPA, because their impacts exceed the 2003 EIS' projection. Using all 3,960 wells-3,578 of which are purely hypothetical-to determine the total impact erroneously swells the Plaintiffs' calculation. Using 350 as a multiplier, the surface impacts fall comfortably within the 2003 EIS projection: (7,890 + (5.2 x 350) ) = 9,710 acres\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   , which is less than the 2003 EIS projection of 18,577 acres.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   The same analysis applies to the water consumption and air pollution numbers. Projected water consumption is: 1,475,407,500 gallons\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   , which is less than the 2,818,557,000 gallon 2003 EIS projection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Din\u00e9 Reply at 11. The air pollution numbers are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Editor's Note:\n   </strong>\n   The preceding image contains the references for footnotes\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   Each combined number is far less than the numbers considered in the 2003 RMP/EIS. Accordingly, the total impacts of drilling in the basin still have not exceeded the total impacts predicted in the 2003 EIS, so there is no NEPA violation on these grounds. Because the differences in technology since the 2003 RMP/EIS are not significant for NEPA's purposes, and the total number of wells remain within the 2003 RMP/EIS estimate, the Court concludes that the Plaintiffs' argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n    <em>\n     THE BLM ADEQUATELY INVOLVED THE PUBLIC IN ITS NEPA PROCESS\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   The BLM did not violate NEPA when it prepared and published EAs for the Mancos Shale wells.

Such language recognizes that it may be difficult to involve the public in every EA, so commonsense policies cutting down the number of unimportant, ordinary, or redundant draft EAs made publicly available for comment, so that more time can be devoted to unique or significant EAs, is consistent with that regulation.

The record cited demonstrates that environmental groups have objected, for many years, to the way that the BLM has conducted its processes, but it does not demonstrate that the BLM arbitrarily labeled some of the wells routine to avoid public involvement. The Court finds no record evidence, for example, that these wells are so different from each other such that the BLM's determination that their EAs would be alike is clearly without basis. Moreover, after studying several EAs in the record, the Court concludes that the EAs' analyses for many, if not all of these wells, are likely to be substantially similar. In two of the EAs that the Court considered the environmental analysis is highly alike.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Environmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NM-F010-2014-0254 at 18-20 (A.R.0120125-27),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Environmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NM-F010-2014-0250 at 18-21 (A.R.0119200-03). For example, in both EA's air quality analysis, the BLM lists harmful pollutants, considers how much the well will increase the amount of those pollutants, and determines the cumulative impact the well will have on the air with the other wells in the San Juan Basin.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Environmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NM-F010-2014-0254 at 18-20 (A.R.0120125-27),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Environmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NM-F010-2014-0250 at 18-21 (A.R.0119200-03).

Unlike the 2004 Protocol, which lets the CHS have considerable discretion to determine the APE, the 2014 Protocol discusses an APE definition for both direct and indirect effects.

The APE for indirect effects, on the other hand, \"shall include known or suspected historic properties and their associated settings where setting is an important aspect of integrity,\" but identification efforts outside of the Direct Effect APE for historic sites are subject to the BLM Field Manager's approval after considering recommendations from the SHPO. 2014 Protocol at 21 (A.R.0169233).

The BLM counters that it has satisfied its NHPA obligations, because it commissioned a cultural investigation, defined an APE, \"considered foreseeable direct and indirect adverse effects to cultural resources,\" and determined whether the wells would have an adverse effect on the sites. BLM Response at 37-38. The Operators\n   also contend that the BLM properly followed the 2004 and 2014 Protocols.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Operators' Response at 24-25. The Court concludes that the BLM complied with the NHPA, because the BLM followed the Protocols it adopted. For each well, it: (i) defined the APE; (ii) determined if there were any historical sites within that APE; and, (iii) if there were historical sites, it signaled the historical site's nature, and documented how effects to that site could or could not be avoided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   The Court conducts an arbitrary-and-capricious review of the BLM's process and the factors it considered when determining if a historical site has been affected.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Concerned Citizens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173530\" index=\"521\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/886/#p905\">\n    843 F.3d at 909\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[The Plaintiffs] also fail to establish that the FTA acted arbitrarily or capriciously in failing to consider these factors.\"). A historical site's nature affects what factors that the BLM should consider, and the BLM concluded similarly when it drafted its protocols. For example, in the 2014 Protocol, the BLM decided that, if a historical site's setting was what made it historical, then whether the historical site could be seen from the undertaking would be a factor-perhaps, a dispositive factor-that the BLM should consider when determining whether a project affects the historical site.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2014 Protocol at 30 (A.R.0169242).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   2014 Protocol at 21 (A.R.0169233)(\"The introduction of physical, visual, audible, or atmospheric elements has the potential to affect the historic setting or use of historic properties.\"). If the historical site is archaeological, however, visibility of the oil well has little effect on what makes the archaeological site have historical value, so the visible effect the oil well has on the archaeological site need not be considered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2014 Protocol at 30 (A.R.0169242). Thus, the historical site's nature dictates the factors that the BLM needs to consider, and the APE, in turn, dictates which historical sites that the BLM must consider.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2004 Protocol at 11-12 (A.R.0169048-49); 2014 Protocol at 21 (A.R.0169233).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   With those concepts in mind, the Court turns to the Plaintiffs' contentions. First, they contend that there is no \"record evidence to indicate that BLM ever defined an area for indirect effects,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   so the BLM acted arbitrarily and capriciously. Din\u00e9 Brief at 38. In making this argument, the Plaintiffs attack the first step an agency must take under the NHPA: defining the APE. Nothing in the protocols, however, requires that the BLM define each well's indirect APE separate from the direct APE. Instead, the 2014 Protocol creates a standard direct APE for oil well pads, which is equal to the area of the well pad and construction zone plus a one-hundred foot buffer zone on each side of the construction zone's edges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2014 Protocol at 21 (A.R.0169233); 2014 Protocol Appendix B at 1 (A.R.0169265). The 2014 Protocol then states that an indirect APE \"shall include known or suspected historic properties and their associated settings where setting is an important aspect of integrity,\" but the indirect APE definition subsequently notes that \"identification efforts\" outside of the direct APE for other historical\n   sites shall occur only with the BLM field manager's approval after the BLM manager has considered recommendations from the BLM cultural resource specialist and the SHPO. 2014 Protocol at 21 (A.R.0169233). In other words, the BLM need only consider historic properties within the direct APE, unless the BLM field manager, after taking into account certain recommendations, decides that the BLM needs to broaden its scope to include other \"known or suspected properties.\" 2014 Protocol at 21 (A.R.0169233). Thus, under the 2014 Protocol, the default APE definition is the direct APE's definition-one-hundred feet within the well pad's construction zone. To be sure, the 2014 Protocol still requires the BLM to consider indirect and cumulative effects that the wells have on those historic sites within the APE,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   2014 Protocol at 21 (A.R.0169233), but there does not need to be a separate indirect APE defined to satisfy the Protocols. Indeed, the 2014 Protocols expect that the direct and indirect APEs, in most cases, will be the same, and will diverge only when the BLM field manager approves of a divergence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2014 Protocol at 21 (A.R.0169233).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-300\">\n   The 2004 Protocol similarly requires no separate indirect APE definition. It provides: \"NM BLM cultural heritage specialists will determine the area of potential effects that will be subject to inventory. This determination will define the geographic area within which the undertaking might directly or indirectly cause changes to the character or use of any historic properties should they exist.\" 2004 Protocol at 11-12 (A.R.0169048). The 2004 Protocol, unlike the 2014 Protocol, does not create a standard direct APE nor does it create a standard indirect APE. The definition turns on what appears to be the CHS' case-by-case determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2004 Protocol at 11 (A.R.0169048). The 2004 Protocol makes no distinction between direct or indirect APE, so, based on its plain language, the indirect APE does not need to be separately defined. Accordingly, it is not arbitrary and capricious that the BLM did not separately define the indirect APE from the direct APE.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-301\">\n   Second, the Plaintiffs cite the 2014 Protocol's language, which states that, \"[i]n defining the APE, the BLM will consider potential direct, indirect, and cumulative effects to historic properties and their associated setting when setting is an important aspect of integrity, as applicable\" to argue that the BLM needed to consider the wells' effects on Chaco Park and its satellites. Din\u00e9 Brief at 37 (quoting 2014 Protocol at 21 (A.R.0169233) ).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Din\u00e9 Brief at 38-39. Their argument pivots on whether that language means that the BLM, in defining the APE, had to consider and document their consideration of the historic sites many miles away from the wells. The Court concludes that the 2014 Protocol has no such requirement. Rather, as already explained, efforts to identify historic sites that could be indirectly affected, and thus need to be considered, are executed at the BLM field manager's discretion with the BLM cultural resource specialist's and the SHPO's recommendations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2014 Protocol at 21 (A.R.0169233). The 2014 Protocol grants the BLM some flexibility in defining the APE, which makes sense, because the indirect APE is bound to be different for different sites. If, for example, a mountain stands between a well and a historic site, considering the well's indirect visual effects on that historic site does not make sense. The NHPA regulations recognize-perhaps for that reason-that the APE needs to be flexible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"522\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20800.16\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 800.16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The area of potential effects is influenced by the\n   scale and nature of an undertaking and may be different for different kinds of effects caused by the undertaking.\"). The 2014 Protocol echoes that sentiment by granting the BLM some discretion to determine, on a case-by-case basis, how far out it must look for historic sites when defining the APE.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2014 Protocol at 21 (A.R.0169233).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Valley Community Preservation Com'n v.

Zinke 15-cv-209 (D.N.M.) Administrative Record Data at 1, filed June 6, 2017 (Doc. 113-1)(\"APD Map Aff.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although some oil wells might be visible from the historic sites, the Court could locate no evidence in the record demonstrating that the wells actually are visible from those sites.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   The wells' distance from Chaco Park and its satellites also suggests that noise and light pollution would have minimal effect on those historic sites. To be sure, noise can travel a distance, but any noise that would carry miles to the historical site would not be so much that it was arbitrary and capricious for the BLM to exclude Chaco Park and its satellites from the APE. There is already ambient noise from traffic into the park and traffic on Highway 550-the area where most of the well pads are located. The same analysis applies for light pollution. Finally, the Court cannot say that the 2014 Protocol is arbitrary and capricious for granting the BLM discretion in determining what sites it needs to consider for indirect effects, because the regulations also suggest that the APE should be defined flexibly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"524\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20800.16\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 800.16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-303\">\n   Third, the Plaintiffs argue that the BLM violated the 2014 Protocol, because the BLM did not consult with the SHPO to define the indirect effects to historic properties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Din\u00e9 Brief at 38. In so arguing, the plaintiffs cite language from the 2014 Protocol's Appendix B, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-304\">\n   In certain circumstances, even though an undertaking may have a standard APE listed below, the Field Manager, at\n   the recommendation of the cultural resource specialist, may have justification to require a larger APE. If an APE larger than the minimums below is being recommended, SHPO consultation is not required. For actions where a field office is suggesting a smaller APE for an undertaking listed below, SHPO consultation will be required pursuant to Section IV.B. For\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   other APEs (i.e. undertakings not listed here, visual effects APE, etc.), the cultural resource specialist will consult with SHPO pursuant to Section IV.B.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-305\">\n   2014 Protocol Appendix B at 1 (A.R.0169265)(emphasis in original). The Plaintiffs read the language-\"[f]or\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   other APEs ... the cultural resource specialist will consult with the SHPO,\" 2014 Protocol Appendix B at 1 (A.R.0169265)(emphasis in original)-to mean that the BLM\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   consult with the SHPO \"to define an APE for indirect effects,\" and, because there is no evidence that the BLM ever consulted with a SHPO, the BLM violated the Protocol.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Din\u00e9 Brief at 37-38. The Court agrees with that analysis to a point. It is true that the 2014 Protocol requires the BLM field manager to consider recommendations from the SHPO when that field manager is determining whether identification efforts for historic properties outside of the direct APE are required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2014 Protocol at 21 (A.R.0169233). The Plaintiffs' assumption is, however, that the BLM Field Manager must conduct that larger APE analysis for every well, but the 2014 Protocol does not require that analysis; rather, it requires such an analysis only at \"the approval of the BLM field manager.\" 2014 Protocol at 21 (A.R.0169233). That language suggests that a larger APE analysis is an exception to the typical rule. A SHPO consultation is thus not mandatory for every well, but only for wells that the BLM Field Manager is considering expanding the APE. Accordingly, the BLM's failure to consult the SHPO for every well does not, by itself, demonstrate that the BLM acted contrary to law or arbitrarily and capriciously.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-306\">\n   Fourth, the Plaintiffs contend that the BLM violated the 2014 Protocol, because a SHPO consultation is required for every \"complicated or controversial\" undertaking. According to the Plaintiffs, all of the wells at issue are controversial and there is no record of a SHPO consultation, so the BLM violated the 2014 Protocol.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Din\u00e9 Brief at 37-38. The Plaintiffs do not explain why the wells are controversial,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Din\u00e9 Brief at 37-38; presumably, they are controversial, because the Plaintiffs have challenged them. The Court concludes that the 2014 Protocol's reference to \"complicated or controversial\" does not apply, merely because a plaintiff group creates a controversy by challenging the wells. Such a definition would suggest that the BLM should consult a SHPO on every well, because any well could be subject to legal challenge. If the 2014 Protocol's intent was to require the BLM to always consult a SHPO, it would have said as much instead of creating a scheme whereby SHPO consultation is the exception instead of the rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2014 Protocol at 21 (A.R.0169233). Because the Plaintiffs have not demonstrated how any of the wells are otherwise controversial, the Court concludes that the wells are not controversial, so the BLM is not required to consult a SHPO for that reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-307\">\n   The Plaintiffs' final contention is that the BLM did not consider the indirect or cumulative effects the wells would have on Chaco Park and its satellites.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Din\u00e9 Brief at 36, 40. The BLM need consider those indirect or cumulative effects only if those historical sites were within the various wells' APE.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2014 Protocol at 27-28 (A.R.0169239-40); 2004 Protocol at 15 (A.R.0169052). After reviewing the records' cultural resource reports, the Court concludes that Chaco Park and its satellites\n   are not within any of the wells' APEs,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , A Cultural Resources Survey of WPX Energy Production LLC's Chaco 2306-18M Number 240H/256H Dual Well Pad, Pipeline, and Access Road at 4 (dated March 21, 2014)(A.R.0168011)(\"Chaco 2306-18M Report\"), so the BLM did not act arbitrarily and capriciously when it did not explicitly consider indirect effects to those properties within its cultural resource reports. The Court also concludes that the records' cultural resources reports meet the 2004 Protocol's and the 2014 Protocol's documentation standards. Each cultural resource report and its accompanying cultural resource record of review describes each historical site within the APE with enough detail that the Court can discern the historical site's nature, as required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2014 Procedures at Appendix 3-7 (A.R.0168975). The sites identified are archaeological in nature.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Chaco 2306-18M Report at 4(A.R.0168011)(identifying the historical site as qualifying for the national registry of historic places under criteria D, which means it is a site that has yielded or is likely to yield information important in history).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   New Mexico Cultural Resource Information System at 24 (A.R.0169118)(defining criteria D under the national registry of historic places as a site that \"has yielded, or is likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history,\" and noting that \"[o]bviously most archaeological sites will fall under criteria 'd.' \"). Those reports then describe why the BLM has determined that the well pad will not affect those sites.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Chaco 2306-18M Report at 4; Cultural Resource Record of Review for Chaco 2306-18M at 1-2 (A.R.0168012-13)(\"Chaco 2306-18M CRROR\"). Most often, the reason is that the site can be avoided during construction, thus eliminating or severely mitigating the risk of physical damage.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Chaco 2306-18M Report at 4; Chaco 2306-18M CRROR at 1-2. As explained in the 2014 Protocol, a project's adverse effect on an archaeological site is limited to whether the project could physically destroy or damage the archaeological site.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2014 Protocol at 30 (A.R.0169242). Such a limitation makes sense, as the archaeological site's historical value stems from the historical data recoverable from the location and not the historical property's setting or feeling associated with it. As the Court mentioned previously, the documentation standard is not a high standard, and the Court concludes that the record documentation for these archaeological sites meets the low bar that the documentation standard erects.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the BLM did not violate the NHPA.\n   <strong>\n    VII.\n    <em>\n     IF THE COURT WERE TO CONCLUDE THAT THERE WERE A NEPA VIOLATION, VACATUR AND REMAND, BUT NOT A PERMANENT INJUNCTION, WOULD BE THE PROPER REMEDY, AND IF THE COURT WERE TO CONCLUDE THAT THERE WERE A NHPA VIOLATION, REMAND WITHOUT VACTUR, IN LIEU OF A PERMANENT INJUNCTION, WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE REMEDY\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-308\">\n   If the Court concluded that there were a NEPA violation, it would conclude that vacatur would be the proper remedy, but a permanent injunction would not be. Vacatur with remand, as opposed to remand without vacatur, of the 350 wells' APDs is proper, because the seriousness of the BLM's violation outweighs the potential harm the operators would suffer. An injunction precluding the BLM from approving more wells would be inappropriate, however, as the presumption is in favor of remand with vacatur. Moreover, on balance, given the harms alleged, vacatur would better serve the public.

Hundreds of wells would be operating without a robust EIS level analysis of horizontal drillings' effects on the environment. First, there would be unconsidered impacts to water consumption-perhaps to the tune of hundreds of millions of gallons of freshwater-which is of particular consequence in a desert.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RMP/EIS at 4-14, 4-15 (A.R.0001024-25);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   2014 RFDS at 23-24 (A.R.0173848-49).\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   There would also be unconsidered impacts to the surface area, equaling about 2,000 acres, and the air quality, equaling around several thousands of tons of emissions per year.

The loss of water from horizontal drilling is the same regardless whether the BLM considered that loss of freshwater. Another very real harm from unconsidered effects is the increased risk that these unconsidered effects could cause some more dire unforeseen harm. For example, the increased use of hundreds of millions of gallons of water could impact New Mexico's desert or the San Juan Basin in some way that is not reversible. Thus, in weighing the rulemaking's deficiency, the Court must also consider the risk of unforeseen harms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Din\u00e9 III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"535\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201593995\">\n    2015 WL 1593995\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (\"[I]t is apparent that these mercury-related indirect effects could have significant impacts on threatened and endangered species in the area.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-312\">\n   These rulemaking's deficiencies must then be balanced against the harms arising from vacating 350 APDs. The harm stemming from vacatur would primarily be economic. The operators would lose profits from the dormant wells. While this harm is not trivial-as the Court analyzed previously,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Din\u00e9\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"536\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204997207\">\n    2015 WL 4997207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *49 -the Court concludes that, had the Plaintiffs prevailed on the merits, the rulemaking's deficiencies would be more serious than lost profits, thus warranting vacatur.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is unclear the amount of lost\n   profits which the Operators would sustain, but it is likely that the amount would be \"serious\"-perhaps hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars.\n   <em>\n    Din\u00e9\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"537\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204997207\">\n    2015 WL 4997207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *49. Although this harm would be serious, it would not stop the Operators from continued operation in the region with their vertical wells, and there is a chance-perhaps even a good chance-that, after the BLM cured its NEPA violation, the wells would be approved, and the wells would produce a profit. The delay in profit certainly imposes a cost, in that the price of oil could drop or another unforeseen factor could affect profits, but this cost is likely less than the upper range of the millions of dollars of loss that the Operators project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-313\">\n   Moreover, as at least one other district court has recognized, in the oil-and-gas industry, the risk of \"lost profits and industrial inconvenience\" is \"the nature of doing business,\" because it is an industry \"fraught with bureaucracy and litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v.

The Court discerns nothing to have happened in the interim to change this determination. Accordingly, this prong counsels in favor of a permanent injunction. Similarly, the second prong also favors an injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Din\u00e9\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"554\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204997207\">\n    2015 WL 4997207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *48 (\"Environmental injury, by its nature, can seldom be adequately remedied by money damages.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-320\">\n   In contrast, the harm alleged under the NHPA-noise, air, and light pollution causing an aesthetic injury to the historic site-is not irreparable. To stop the noise all the operators have to do is strop drilling. Similarly, to stop the light pollution, the riggers need only turn off the lights. Although air pollution is typically conceived of as an irreparable environmental harm, the air pollution here, as explained above, is an aesthetic harm affecting the historic site's setting or feeling associated with it. The Court conceives of this harm in the form of smog or a hazy day. Such\n   air pollution would decrease the aesthetic of a site like Chaco Park. This type of air pollution, however, tends to be localized and can be alleviated if the local machinery causing it is stopped. Accordingly, the Court concludes that there is no irreparable harm vis-\u00e0-vis the NHPA. Monetary damages have also been found-at least at common law-appropriate for aesthetic injuries, depending on their severity. For example, nuisance provides money damages for noxious odors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Safe Streets Alliance v. Hickenlooper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276537\" index=\"555\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/865/#p886\">\n    859 F.3d 865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 886 (10th Cir. 2017). Monetary damages, accordingly, can address the noise, air, and light pollution aesthetic injuries at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-321\">\n   With NEPA, although the first two factors favor a permanent injunction, the balance of hardships do not favor an equitable solution, given the other available remedy-vacatur. The balance of hardships have already been addressed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , and the Court determines that the balance favored the Plaintiffs. Nevertheless, the balance of hardships do not counsel a permanent injunction-\"a drastic and extraordinary remedy,\"\n   <em>\n    Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644345,12455278\" index=\"556\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/139/\">\n    561 U.S. at 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644345,12455278\" index=\"557\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/139/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , because the Court perceives that vacatur will sufficiently redress the respondent's injury. Vacatur, like a permanent injunction, stops the wells from inflicting any more environmental harm. Vacatur is more appropriate, however, because the source of the statutory injury flows from the BLM's failure to consider horizontal drilling's environmental effects. A permanent injunction would preclude the oil wells from ever producing again unless and until the Plaintiffs secured an order modifying the injunction with the Court. In contrast, vacatur stops the wells until the agency reconsiders its previous determination. Given that the harm flows from the agency's failure to consider, a permanent injunction, which stops the agency from correcting its mistake until it comes back to the court is not tailored to the harm alleged. Accordingly, the Court concludes that this factor does not weigh in favor of a permanent injunction for the NEPA violation. This factor, for this case, is dispositive for the Court given the Supreme Court's admonition that, if vacatur is better tailored to the harm, it is the appropriate remedy in lieu of a permanent injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Monsanto Co. v.
