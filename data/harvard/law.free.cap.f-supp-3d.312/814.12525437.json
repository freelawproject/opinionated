Koller (\"Plaintiff\"), a former Presidential Elector, alleges he was forced, coerced and intimidated by California officials to register his 2016 electoral vote for the Democratic candidates for those offices, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Timothy Kaine. He brought this action against Attorney General Xavier Becerra and Secretary of State Alex Padilla in their official capacities (the \"Official Capacity Defendants\"), and against Secretary Padilla and former Attorney General Kamala Harris in their individual capacities (the \"Individual Capacity Defendants\") for a judgment declaring California Elections Code \u00a7\u00a7 6906 and 18002 unconstitutional and for violations of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Presently before the court are three Motions to Dismiss Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\"): one filed by the Official Capacity Defendants, one filed by the Individual Capacity Defendants, and one filed by Intervenor California Republican Party. Dkt. Nos. 87, 88, 94. Though the court previously found there exists \"equally plausible opposing views\" on Elections Code \u00a7 6906 and 18002, and a \"serious question\" on the merits of the constitutional issue raised by Plaintiff (\n   <em>\n    Koller v. Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270804\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/224/871/#p879\">\n    224 F.Supp.3d 871\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 879 (N.D. Cal. 2016) ), these motions raise doctrines not previously addressed. The application of these doctrines prevents this action from proceeding further. Thus, the Motions to Dismiss will be granted and all of Plaintiff's causes of action will be dismissed for the reasons explained below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Presidential Electors, The Constitution, and The Federalist Papers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The FAC begins with reference to the Constitution, and in particular the process it provides for the election of the President. Plaintiff alleges that since the Constitution was signed in 1787, it has never \"called for election to the office of President by popular vote of the citizens of this country.\" FAC, at \u00b6 13. Instead, the Constitution has always \"called for election to the office of President by Presidential Electors selected by the respective states.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 14. These electors meet every four years, vote by ballot for two persons, make a list of all the persons voted for, and the number of votes cast for each person.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 16.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The signed and certified list is then directed to the President of the Senate.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff also alleges what the Constitution does not permit. In Plaintiff's opinion, the Constitution never \"reduced the weighty responsibility\" of choosing the President \"to a media circus on the second Tuesday of November every four years.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 18. Additionally, Plaintiff alleges the Constitution has never allowed \"for foreign influences, threats, or intimidation to restrain or dictate the votes\" of electors.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Aside from the Constitution, Plaintiff also references Federalist No. 68 and its discussion of how the President should be selected and the role of Presidential Electors.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 46. Federalist No. 68 states, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   It was desirable that the sense of the people should operate in the choice of the person to whom so important a trust was to be confided. This end will be answered by committing the right of making it, not to any preestablished body, but to men chosen by the people for the special purpose, and at the particular conjuncture.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   It was equally desirable, that the immediate election should be made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station, and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation, and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice. A small number of persons, selected by their fellow-citizens from the general mass, will be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated investigations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276099\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/1144/#p1153\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276099\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/1144/#p1153\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. California Statutes Regulating Presidential Electors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Two California statutes applicable to electors are placed at issue by the FAC. The first is Elections Code \u00a7 6906, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The electors, when convened, if both candidates are alive, shall vote by ballot for that person for President and that person for Vice President of the United States, who are, respectively, the candidates of the political party which they represent, one of whom, at least, is not an inhabitant of this state.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The second is Elections Code \u00a7 18002, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Every person charged with the performance of any duty under any law of this state relating to elections, who willfully neglects or refuses to perform it, or who, in his or her official capacity, knowingly and fraudulently acts in contravention or violation of any of those laws, is, unless a different punishment is prescribed by this code, punishable by fine not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000) or by imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170 of the Penal Code for 16 months or two or three years, or by both that fine and imprisonment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The 2016 Presidential Election\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Democratic candidates for President and Vice President in 2016 were Hillary Rodham Clinton and Timothy Kaine, respectively.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 28. The Republican candidates for those offices were Donald J. Trump and Michael Pence.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 29. Election day was November 8, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 35. Plaintiff describes the outcome of the election in the FAC as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Though the Democratic nominees for President and Vice-President won the nationwide popular vote by over 3 million votes, and won the California popular vote by a large margin, the various state-by-state popular votes indicated\n   that Donald Trump and Michael Pence (the Republican presidential and vice presidential nominees) would win the majority of electoral college votes on December 19, 2016 if the electors in each state vote consistent with the popular vote in their respective states.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff alleges, however, that subsequent to election day but before the vote of the electors on December 19, 2016, \"U.S. intelligence agencies confirmed that they possessed evidence showing foreign influence in the presidential election with the purpose of favoring Donald J. Trump and undermining Hillary R. Clinton in that election.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 32. Plaintiff considered the possibility of foreign interference to be of \"grave importance\" and sought additional information from the government.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff further alleges that by early January, 2017, \"at least three U.S. intelligence agencies reported a high confidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered actions aimed at undermining public faith in the United States' democratic process and denigrating one candidate (Clinton) and giving preference to the other (Trump).\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 37. And by mid-February, 2017, \"additional reports surfaced indicating that Mr. Trump's campaign may have had numerous contacts with Russian intelligence officers during the campaign, raising further questions about the connection between Mr. Trump and the Russian government.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Despite these post-election revelations, Donald J. Trump was in fact confirmed as President upon the vote of electors and was inaugurated on January 20, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6\u00b6 36, 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Plaintiff's Service as a California Presidential Elector\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff is a resident of Monterey County who served as an elector in prior elections and continues to meet all qualifications to be selected as a Presidential Elector in subsequent elections.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 26. He was chosen as an elector of the Democratic Party for the 2016 Presidential Election.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As to his 2016 service, Plaintiff alleges he and other similar-situated electors should not have been \"constitutionally compelled\" by Elections Code \u00a7\u00a7 6906 and 18002 to vote for Clinton and Kaine, consistent with the popular vote of the state, when \"the best interests of the country warranted a different course of action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 50. To that end, Plaintiff believes he \"should have been allowed to exercise his judgment and free will to vote for whomever he believes to be the most qualified and fit for the offices of President and Vice President within the circumstances and with the knowledge known on December 19, 2016, whether those candidates are Democrats, Republicans, or from a third party.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The Instant Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff filed the complaint initiating this action on December 9, 2016. Dkt. No. 1. Prior to the vote of electors on December 19, 2016, Plaintiff moved for a temporary restraining order precluding enforcement of Elections Code \u00a7\u00a7 6906 and 18002 against Plaintiff. Dkt. Nos. 1, 4. The court ordered expedited briefing on that request, held a hearing on December 16, 2016, and denied Plaintiff's application. Dkt. Nos. 10, 34, 37. Plaintiff appealed from that decision, but voluntary dismissed the appeal four days later. Dkt. Nos. 35, 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The court granted the California Republican Party's motion to intervene on January 3, 2017. Dkt. No. 57. Plaintiff then filed the FAC on February 17, 2017. Dkt. No. 83. He seeks the following relief: (1) a declaratory judgment finding that Elections Code \u00a7\u00a7 6906 and 18002 are unconstitutional,\n   or in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20594\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and/or Elections Code \u00a7 18540 ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) an injunction enjoining Defendants from prosecuting any presidential elector on the basis of their vote; and (3) compensatory damages for violation of \u00a7 1983.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   These motions followed the FAC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) challenges subject matter jurisdiction, and may be either facial or factual.\n   <em>\n    Wolfe v.

A facial Rule 12(b)(1) motion involves an inquiry confined to the allegations in the complaint. Thus, it functions like a limited-issue motion under Rule 12(b)(6) ; all material allegations in the complaint are assumed true, and the court must determine whether lack of federal jurisdiction appears from the face of the complaint itself.\n   <em>\n    Thornhill Publ'g Co. v.

Plaintiff alleges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   This court can provide declaratory relief because an actual and substantial controversy now exists between Plaintiff[ ] and the Defendants with respect to Plaintiff's rights and Defendants' rights and duties under Elections Code \u00a7\u00a7 6906 and 18002, and such controversy is capable of repetition, yet evading review.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Putting aside for the moment the portion of this paragraph that follows the statutory references, it is beyond debate the preceding language does not describe a \"live\" controversy with respect to the 2016 election.

The court cannot provide any effective declaratory relief related to the completed vote of California electors, even if he were to prevail on his claim to declare Elections Code \u00a7\u00a7 6906 and 18002 unconstitutional. Success on any cause of action could not be retroactive, and would not affect Plaintiff's 2016 vote or change the outcome of the election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Thus, absent an exception, the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiff's declaratory relief claim to the extent he seeks relief related to the 2016 election because any such claim is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that \"[w]ith the length of a presidential elector's actual service lasting for a single day, and the designation of someone as being a presidential electo[r] never being made more than six weeks prior to that one day, it is impossible for any court case to be completed in time.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174389\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/983/#p987\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174389\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/983/#p987\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Plaintiff also alleges he is \"reasonably likely to face\" the same situation again because he continues to meet all qualifications for service as a Presidential Elector.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Defendants disagree the declaratory relief claim falls within the exception to mootness.

The Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Wisconsin Right to Life\n   </em>\n   demonstrates that strict factual overlap between past and future events is not required before a controversy is found \"capable of repetition, yet evading review.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180873\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/724/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180873\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/724/\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Moreover, the Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Storer\n   </em>\n   shows that controversies arising during a specific election are not mooted simply because the election has concluded before a judicial decision can be rendered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Storer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180873\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/724/\">\n    415 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   737 n. 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180873\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/724/\">\n    94 S.Ct. 1274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These observations likely account for one inescapable characteristic of democratic elections; they arise within a limited timeframe and evolve with the issues of the moment, such that the details of each election are seldom repeated.

There, the Fourth Circuit easily found \"a reasonable expectation\" that the challenged provisions of North Carolina's judicial campaign finance law \"will be applied against the plaintiffs again during future election cycles.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In contrast, the FAC's allegations do not establish a reasonable likelihood that Plaintiff will face the same or similar dilemma in future elections. In order for Plaintiff to be subjected to an \"illegality\" or \"threat of prosecution\" comparable to the one he experienced in 2016, at least four critical events need to occur. First, Plaintiff would need to be re-elected as an elector for the California Democratic Party. Second, the outcome of the 2020 Presidential Election would have to position the current President, or a Republican candidate like the current President, as the expected winner of the Electoral College. Third, Plaintiff would have to object to the expected winner of the Electoral College in the same way he objected to Trump. Fourth, the Democratic candidate would have to win the popular vote in California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   These contingencies, none of which are within Plaintiff's control, render this case distinguishable from elections cases like\n   <em>\n    Wisconsin Right to Life\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Storer\n   </em>\n   . Unlike the plaintiffs in those actions, Plaintiff is not exposed to potential consequences under Elections Code \u00a7\u00a7 6906 and 18002 simply by declaring candidacy for office or running a political ad. Instead, a cascade of unpredictable developments-each with their own internal sets of possibilities-must align in a particular order before Plaintiff can again be compelled to vote as required by \u00a7 6906 and be exposed to potential criminal penalties under \u00a7 18002. But as noted, it is unknown whether Plaintiff will serve as an elector in 2020, unknown who will be the Republican candidate for President, unknown which candidate will be expected to win the Electoral College, and unknown which party's candidate will win the California popular vote. Therefore, the allegation that Plaintiff will be eligible to serve as a Presidential Elector in 2020 is not enough.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sample v.

As explained above in the context of mootness, a \"speculative chain of possibilities\" needs to occur before Plaintiff can be exposed to potential future injury from Elections Code \u00a7\u00a7 6906 and 18002, even if Plaintiff still qualifies to serve as a Presidential Elector, and even assuming Plaintiff has alleged a personal rather than an official injury. Furthermore, independent actors must make a litany of decisions in a certain way before Plaintiff's standing emerges from being conjectural to becoming real. These actors include the thousands of voters who make up the California electorate, who must ultimately decide to cast a majority of ballots for the future Democratic candidate for President.

Applying the functionality test, the court finds that a decision not to offer immunity from prosecution, or a refusal to disclaim an intent to prosecute, is intimately tied to the judicial process and to the prosecutor's role as an advocate; that is, a decision not to offer immunity under these circumstances is intertwined with the decision whether or not to charge an individual with a crime.

In any event, this court determined the contrary was true. In conjunction with Plaintiff's restraining order request, the court recognized the constitutionality of Elections Code \u00a7\u00a7 6906 and 18002 was not settled, specifically observing that an analogous issue was left undecided by the Supreme Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Ray v.

The text of that statute generally prohibits voter intimidation or coercion. But without case law demonstrating how \u00a7 594's general premise applies in the context of a state's regulation of Presidential Electors, the statute \"is of little help in determining whether the violative nature of particular conduct is clearly established.\"\n   <em>\n    al-Kidd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924024,12459540\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/731/\">\n    563 U.S. at 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924024,12459540\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/731/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Finally, Elections Code \u00a7 18540 does not assist Plaintiff. To the extent he cites it as law prohibiting voter intimidation and coercion, it is subject to the same analysis as \u00a7 594. For anything more than that, \u00a7 18540 cannot sustain a \u00a7 1983 claim as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moreland v. Las Vegas Metro.

The Individual Capacity Defendants are therefore entitled to qualified immunity for their alleged failure to disclaim the intent to prosecute Plaintiff for a violation of those statutes. The damages claim for violation of \u00a7 1983 (the second cause of action) is subject to dismissal on this ground, without leave to amend, because no additional facts can alter the outcome of the legal analysis undertaken for the second prong of qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
