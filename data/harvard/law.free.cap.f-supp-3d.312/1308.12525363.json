The TCPA prohibits, among other things, the use of an \"automatic telephone dialing system\" (\"ATDS\") or an artificial or prerecorded voice to call a person's cellphone absent an emergency or prior express consent.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A)(iii). The TCPA defines an ATDS as equipment with the capacity \"to store or produce telephone numbers to be called, using a random or sequential number generator,\" and then to \"dial such numbers.\" \u00a7 227(a)(1)(A). Each TCPA violation results in damages of no less than $500, which may be trebled for willful or knowing violations. \u00a7 227(b)(3)(B)-(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   BCA Financial collects debts for healthcare companies. To call suspected debtors, it uses a \"predictive dialer\" maintained by a company named Noble Systems. BCA Financial also accompanies some of those calls with an \"interactive voice response\" (\"IVR\"), which is an artificial or prerecorded voice that prompts the person called to indicate whether BCA Financial has called the right number. It goes something like: \"If this is Jane Doe, press 1; 'if this is a wrong number,' press 2.\" [ECF No. 86-1, p. 6].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The phone numbers BCA Financial automatically dials are fed to the Noble system from a separate collection-software system called \"FACS.\" FACS is loaded with phone numbers supplied by BCA Financial's healthcare clients. Those clients, in turn, received the numbers from the patients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The parties agree that BCA Financial uses the Noble predictive dialer to autodial phone numbers without human intervention. But facts suggest that the Noble system is incapable of generating random or\n   sequential phone numbers (and instead dials from a fixed set of numbers supplied by separate debt-collection software).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On six occasions, and twice using an IVR, BCA Financial called Reyes' cellphone using the Noble predictive dialer. It was not an emergency. Nor did BCA Financial have Reyes' prior express consent. It was trying to reach a different person who had written Reyes' cellphone number on a medical consent form. Five calls went unanswered, and on the sixth call, Reyes picked up the phone, heeded the IVR prompts, and pressed two-for wrong number. BCA Financial did not call Reyes again after that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Reyes now moves for summary judgment on her individual TCPA claim. [ECF No. 86]. She seeks $1,500 for each of the eight TCPA violations (i.e., treble damages for six autodialed calls and two IVR uses, the latter constituting separate TCPA violations). BCA Financial filed an opposition response, and Reyes filed a reply. [ECF Nos. 92; 95].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The parties do not dispute the basic facts of this case: BCA Financial used a predictive dialer and a prerecorded or artificial voice to call Reyes' cellphone several times without her prior express consent or an emergency. But the parties vigorously debate the question of whether the Noble predictive dialer is an ATDS. If an IVR prompted\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   question, then Reyes would press one for \"yes\" and BCA Financial would press two for \"no.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   BCA Financial argues that the Noble predictive dialer, although capable of automatically dialing a phone number without human intervention, cannot generate random or sequential phone numbers and is therefore not an ATDS. Reyes, on the other hand, argues that such capability (or lack of capability) is inconsequential. The debate touches on several orders from the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\"), whose final orders interpreting the TCPA are binding on this Court. The debate also concerns a recent D.C. Circuit opinion,\n   <em>\n    ACA International v. Federal Communications Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/#p691\">\n    885 F.3d 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 691 (D.C. Cir. 2018), which struck down the FCC's latest 2015 order interpreting the TCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In addition, the parties raise two more issues. First, they disagree on whether Reyes is entitled to treble damages. And second, BCA Financial challenges Reyes' ability to raise claims for TCPA violations involving an artificial or prerecorded voice, arguing that those claims were not pled in the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As outlined in detail below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    grants in part\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    denies in part\n   </strong>\n   Reyes' summary judgment motion. First, the Court\n   <strong>\n    grants\n   </strong>\n   summary judgment in Reyes' favor on the ATDS issue because the Noble predictive dialer, as BCA Financial uses it,\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   an ATDS under the TCPA. Second, the Court\n   <strong>\n    denies\n   </strong>\n   summary judgment to Reyes on the treble-damages issue because, at least at this stage, the Court cannot determine whether BCA Financial acted willfully or knowingly. Third, the Court\n   <strong>\n    denies\n   </strong>\n   summary judgment to Reyes on the artificial-or-prerecorded-voice issue because her Complaint alleged only that BCA Financial violated the TCPA through the use of an ATDS, not an artificial or prerecorded voice, which is a\n   <em>\n    separate\n   </em>\n   statutory basis for relief that she should have raised in an amended pleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Reyes brings a two-count Complaint against BCA Financial. [ECF No. 1]. The\n   first count is for allegedly violating the TCPA. [ECF No. 1, p. 9]. The second count was for allegedly violating the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, but Reyes later dismissed that claim. [ECF Nos. 1, pp. 9-10; 78]. Thus, the TCPA claim remains, and Reyes brings it on behalf of herself and a proposed class of persons. [ECF No. 1].\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In support of her TCPA claim, Reyes alleged under her general allegations that BCA Financial \"routinely violates\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A)(iii) by using an automatic telephone dialing system to place non-emergency calls to numbers assigned to a cellular telephone service, without prior express consent.\" [ECF No. 1, p. 1 \u00b6 2]. Reyes alleged that BCA Financial placed several calls to her cellphone when trying to collect a debt owed by someone else. [ECF No. 1, pp. 3-5 \u00b6\u00b6 16-22, 26, 28-29].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   She then alleged that \"in light of the frequency, number, nature, and character of the calls, Defendant placed its calls to Plaintiff's cellular telephone number by using an automatic telephone dialing system.\" [ECF No. 1, p. 3 \u00b6 23]. Reyes then makes several more references to BCA Financial using an ATDS to call her and to call others, including proposed class members. [ECF No. 1, pp. 3-7 \u00b6\u00b6 24-25, 33, 37-38, 43, 52].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Reyes includes just one specific paragraph under her TCPA count, which reads: \"Defendant violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A)(iii) by using an automatic telephone dialing system to place non-emergency calls to Plaintiff's cellular telephone number, absent prior express consent.\" [ECF No. 1, p. 9 \u00b6 74].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In neither her general allegations nor her one specific allegation that concerns the TCPA does Reyes allege that BCA Financial called her using an artificial or prerecorded voice. The only reference to artificial or prerecorded voices is within her initial proposed TCPA class action definition, which read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    TCPA class\n   </em>\n   : All persons and entities throughout the United States (1) to whom BCA Financial Services, Inc., placed, or caused to be placed, calls (2) directed to a number assigned to a cellular telephone service, (3) by using an automatic telephone dialing system\n   <em>\n    or an artificial or prerecorded voice\n   </em>\n   , (4) within the four years preceding the date of this complaint, (5) absent prior express consent-in that the called party was not the intended recipient.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [ECF No. 1, p. 6 \u00b6 44 (emphasis added) ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   But in her class certification motion, Reyes edited her class action definition,\n   <strong>\n    removing\n   </strong>\n   any explicit reference to artificial or prerecorded voices:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   All persons and entities throughout the United States (1) to whom BCA Financial Services, Inc. placed more than one call, (2) directed to a number assigned to a cellular telephone service, but not assigned to the intended recipient of BCA Financial Services, Inc.'s calls, (3)\n   <em>\n    by using computer assisted dialing technology manufactured or designed by Noble\n   </em>\n   , (4) from September 23, 2012 through September 23, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [ECF No. 59, p. 1 (emphasis added) ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In the Complaint's wherefore clause, Reyes generally asks, among other things,\n   that the Court declare that BCA Financial violated the TCPA. [ECF No. 1 p. 10].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   BCA Financial answered the Complaint, raising several affirmative defenses. [ECF No. 8]. As its second affirmative defense, BCA Financial raised \"prior express consent\" and alleged that \"Plaintiff's claims under the TCPA are not actionable as Defendant has established the requisite 'prior express consent' to communicate with the Plaintiff at the telephone number provided as authorized by the Federal Communication Commission and the law of this Circuit.\" [ECF No. 8, p. 6]. But BCA Financial later withdrew that defense, explaining in a notice that, \"[b]ased on information learned and developed through the course of discovery in this case, BCA withdraws without prejudice its Second Affirmative Defense as to the individual named ...Reyes only, and not as to any purported class members.\" [ECF No. 74, p. 1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Undisputed Facts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The parties do not dispute the majority of the underlying facts. The undisputed facts pertinent to the summary judgment motion are as follows: BCA Financial is a receivable management company operating in the medical billing industry for the recovery of past due debt. [ECF Nos. 86-1, p. 1; 93, p. 5]. In general, BCA Financial \"receives accounts from its various medical or healthcare provider clients and calls the telephone number provided to the client by the patient.\" [ECF Nos. 93, p. 1; 96, p. 4]. BCA Financial \"utilizes 'computer assisted dialing technology' manufactured and designed by Noble Systems to place telephone calls.\" [ECF Nos. 86-1, p. 4; 93, pp. 3, 6; 96, p. 5].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Noble dialing system is a \"predictive dialer.\" [ECF Nos. 86-1, pp. 4, 5; 93, p. 6]. And the Noble predictive dialer, as BCA Financial uses it, \"automatically dials telephone numbers without human intervention.\" [ECF Nos. 86-1, p. 5; 93, p. 6].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Also, from April 2016 to September 2016, BCA Financial used the IVR capability of its Noble predictive dialer to greet called persons with an automated prompt, asking them to press one key if the correct person had been called and a different key if the wrong number had been reached. [ECF Nos. 86-1, p. 4; 93, p. 6]. When an answering party selects the number indicating a wrong call during an IVR message, the FACS system automatically generates a \"B\" flag. [ECF Nos. 93, pp. 2-3; 96, p. 11]. And if an answering person receives a call from a BCA Financial agent and indicates that the agent has called the wrong number, the agent selects a \"WN\" code within the Noble system to show that this is a wrong number. [ECF Nos. 93, p. 4; 96, p. 6]. At the end of each business day, the Noble system communicates to the FACS system which numbers received a \"WN\" code, and the next day, the Noble system would have no phone numbers with a \"B\" code. [ECF Nos. 93, p. 4; 96, p. 6].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   BCA Financial obtained Reyes' cellphone number from one of its clients, Barnabas Health, to collect a debt. [ECF Nos. 86-1, p. 1; 93, pp. 2, 5; 96, pp. 4, 7]. Barnabas gave BCA Financial the patient's biographical information, including the phone number, as part of the patient's medical consent documentation. [ECF Nos. 93, p. 2; 96, p. 4]. But the name Barnabas associated with the cellphone number was not Reyes'. [ECF Nos. 861; 93, p. 5].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   BCA Financial did not ask Barnabas if the number was accurate. [ECF Nos. 86-1, p. 1; 93, p. 5]. Barnabas did not know that\n   the number belonged to someone other than the patient. [ECF Nos. 93, p. 5; 96, p. 7]. And so Barnabas did not inform BCA Financial that the number belonged to someone else. [ECF Nos. 93, p. 5; 96, p. 7].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Using the Noble predictive dialer, BCA Financial placed six calls to Reyes' cellphone number. [ECF Nos. 86-1, p. 4; 93, pp. 2, 6; 96, p. 4]. Reyes did not answer the first five calls, and BCA Financial stopped calling Reyes after the sixth call. [ECF Nos. 93, p. 2; 96, p. 4]. BCA Financial never spoke to Reyes during any of the attempted communications. [ECF Nos. 93, p. 2; 96, p. 4].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   BCA Financial did not intend to call Reyes but was trying to reach someone else to collect a debt. [ECF Nos. 86-1, p. 1; 93, p. 6]. Moreover, Reyes never had a business relationship with BCA Financial. [ECF Nos. 86-1, p. 2; 93, p. 5]. BCA Financial did not call Reyes' number for emergency purposes. [ECF Nos. 86-1, p. 3; 93, p. 6]. And Reyes did not provide BCA Financial with prior express consent to call her cellphone. [ECF Nos. 86-1, p. 2; 93, p. 5].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   BCA Financial did not manually dial Reyes' number first to confirm the intended caller. [ECF Nos. 86-1, p. 3; 93, p. 6]. And it is not BCA Financial's policy and procedure to manually dial a telephone number before autodialing it to make sure that the person on the other end is the intended recipient. [ECF Nos. 86-1, p. 3; 93, p. 6].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   At least two of BCA Financial's calls to Reyes \"were accompanied by an artificial or prerecorded voice.\" [ECF Nos. 86-1, p. 5; 93, p. 6]. The IVR Reyes received gave a message to the following effect: \"If this is Jane Doe, press 1; 'if this is a wrong number,' press 2.\" [ECF Nos. 86-1, p. 6; 93, p. 6]. Reyes pressed two. [ECF Nos. 86-1, p. 4; 93, p. 6].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   BCA Financial maintains and makes available to all employees a TCPA Participant Guide. [ECF Nos. 86-1, p. 6; 93, p. 7]. It also trains its employees and instructs its representatives on how to notate each account and operate FACS. [ECF Nos. 93, p. 1; 96, p. 4]. And it provides training compliance for various state and federal consumer-protection laws, including the TCPA. [ECF Nos. 93, p. 1; 96, p. 4].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     As used by BCA Financial, the Noble predictive dialer is an ATDS.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The TCPA contains the following prohibition on the use of automated telephone equipment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   It shall be unlawful for any person within the United States...:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (A) to make any call (other than a call made for emergency purposes or made with the prior express consent of the called party) using any automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded voice-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   ......\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (iii) to any telephone number assigned to a paging service, cellular telephone service, specialized mobile radio service, or other radio common carrier service, or any service for which the called party is charged for the call, unless such call is made solely to collect a debt owed to or guaranteed by the United States[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00a7 227(b)(1)(A)(iii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The TCPA defines an \"automatic telephone dialing system\" as \"equipment which has the capacity-(A) to store or\n   produce telephone numbers to be called, using a random or sequential number generator; and (B) to dial such numbers.\" \u00a7 227(a)(1)(A)-(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Besides authorizing injunctive relief, the TCPA grants a private right of action \"to recover for actual monetary loss from...a [TCPA] violation, or to receive $500 in damages for each such violation, whichever is greater[.]\" \u00a7 227(b)(3)(B). But \"[i]f the court finds that the defendant willfully or knowingly violated [the TCPA], the court may, in its discretion, increase the amount of the award to an amount equal to not more than 3 times the amount[.]\" \u00a7 227(b)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The TCPA also mandates that the FCC \"prescribe regulations to implement the requirements\" of the TCPA. \u00a7 227(b)(2). The FCC has done so through a \"series of rulemakings and declaratory rulings addressing the Act's reach.\"\n   <em>\n    ACA Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/#p691\">\n    885 F.3d at 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Pertinent here, in 2003, the FCC issued an order finding, among other things, \"that a predictive dialer falls within the meaning and statutory definition of 'automatic telephone dialing equipment' and the intent of Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Rules &amp; Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20FCC%20Rcd%2014\">\n    18 FCC Rcd. 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,014, 14,093 (2003).

As the FCC explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   The hardware, when paired with certain software, has the capacity to store or produce numbers and dial those numbers at random, in sequential order, or from a database of numbers. As commenters point out, in most cases, telemarketers program the numbers to be called into the equipment, and the dialer calls them at a rate to ensure that when a consumer answers the phone, a sales person is available to take the call. The principal feature of predictive dialing software is a timing function, not number storage or generation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14091 (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The FCC continued that, although \"[i]n the past, telemarketers may have used dialing equipment to create and dial 10-digit telephone numbers arbitrarily,\" since then \"the evolution of the teleservices industry\n   has progressed to the point where using lists of numbers is far more cost effective.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20FCC%20Rcd%2014\">\n    18 FCC Rcd. at 14092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The FCC has consistently held that predictive dialers constitute ATDSs, their basic function being that they can dial persons without human intervention regardless of whether called numbers are generated randomly or sequentially or from a set list. The Eleventh Circuit has held that final\n   FCC orders are binding on this Court, thus barring me from \"refusing to enforce an FCC interpretation.\"\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331964\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/797/1302/#p1307\">\n    797 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1307 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mais\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265389\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/1110/#p1114\">\n    768 F.3d at 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on that binding authority, other judges have found that predictive dialers constitute ATDSs, including the Noble predictive dialer at issue here.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strauss\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345672\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/173/1302/#p1309\">\n    173 F.Supp.3d at 1309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In this case, it is undisputed that the Noble dialing system is a \"predictive dialer.\" [ECF Nos. 86-1, pp. 4, 5; 93, p. 6]. And it is also undisputed that, regardless of how the numbers it dials are teed up, the Noble predictive dialer, as BCA Financial uses it, \"automatically dials telephone numbers without human intervention.\" [ECF Nos. 86-1, p. 5; 93, p. 6]. Thus, binding authority would compel me to find that the Noble predictive dialer is an ATDS. And I would have to reach that conclusion regardless of whether I agree with the FCC interpretation of the TCPA's statutory language.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Nevertheless, the TCPA and Hobbs Act bind me to the FCC's interpretation.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Indeed, BCA Financial's opposition response, filed while\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   was still pending, was, for all practical purposes, resigned to that conclusion. Here is how it put it:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   Since the statute's [the TCPA's] passage in 1991, the FCC has issued regulations\n   <strong>\n    expanding the statutory definition of an ATDS\n   </strong>\n   , and\n   <strong>\n    this Court is bound by those rulings under the Hobbs Act\n   </strong>\n   . In 2003, the FCC was asked to determine whether predictive dialers fell within the scope of the TCPA's definition of automatic dialers and it concluded that\n   <strong>\n    they did because they retained the same basic function-namely, \"the capacity to dial numbers without human intervention.\" The FCC affirmed this decision in 2008\n   </strong>\n   . In 2012, the FCC again revisited the definition of an ATDS and explained that the Commission has emphasized that the term ATDS \"covers any equipment that has the specified capacity to generate numbers and dial them without human intervention\n   <strong>\n    regardless of whether the numbers called are randomly or sequentially generated or come from calling lists\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   [ECF No. 92, pp. 6-7].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   BCA Financial then argued that \"[a]lthough it may be factually undisputed and determined that the Noble Dialer is a 'predictive dialer', the issue of whether a 'predictive dialer' satisfied the TCPA's definition of an ATDS has yet to be conclusively determined by the D.C. Circuit in the\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   case.\" [ECF No. 92, p. 9]. Thus, BCA Financial continued, \"[i]n the absence of demonstrating that, as a matter of law, a predictive dialer is the legal equivalent of an ATDS, Plaintiff's Motion of Summary Judgment should be denied.\" [ECF No. 92, p. 9].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   So the\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   case has given the Court considerable pause. But the Court finds that the prior FCC Orders are still binding. Therefore, the\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   case does not change the Court's conclusion on the ATDS issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   To be sure, the Court does not challenge the notion that\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   is binding authority, even though it comes from the D.C. Circuit and even though there is a\n   split of authority on this issue.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zuluaga v.

May 3, 2017) (noting the split in authority without making a decision). But the Court here adopts the \"binding\" position because, as one Court succinctly put it, \"[w]here several challenges to a final order arise across several jurisdictions, those are consolidated in one circuit, whose decision becomes binding on all circuits.\"\n   <em>\n    Jacobs v.

The Court rejects that argument for several reasons. First, nowhere in the D.C. Circuit's opinion are the prior FCC orders overruled. Indeed, that would have been impossible given that the time to appeal those orders had long passed. And when addressing those prior orders, the D.C. Circuit merely said that it had jurisdiction to address the recent pronouncements and clarifications issued in 2015, not whether the 2003 and 2008 orders remained valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Second, when the D.C. Circuit said that the FCC had provided too expansive an interpretation of the TCPA, the D.C. Circuit was not referring to the prior or recent rulings equating predictive dialers to ATDSs. Rather, the D.C. Circuit was referring to the FCC's interpretation of the TCPA as encompassing devices that have both the present and\n   <em>\n    future\n   </em>\n   capacity to acts as ATDSs. That future- or potential-capacity interpretation was problematic because it had \"the apparent effect of embracing any and all smartphones\" given that \"essentially any smartphone, with the addition of software, can gain the statutorily enumerated features of an autodialer and thus function as an ATDS.\"\n   <em>\n    ACA Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/#p691\">\n    885 F.3d at 696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In this case, however, there is no issue concerning the Noble predictive dialer's present versus future capacity. Although BCA Financial disputes that the Noble predictive dialer is an ATDS, the issue is not whether BCA Financial may\n   <em>\n    later\n   </em>\n   convert it into an ATDS. That is not Reyes' theory of liability. Rather, it is that the Noble predictive dialer\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   an ATDS as\n   <em>\n    currently\n   </em>\n   configured and utilized. Therefore, the 2015 FCC order concerning present versus future capacity would not have had an impact in this case anyway, let alone\n   <em>\n    ACA International's\n   </em>\n   decision concerning that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Third, although\n   <em>\n    ACA International's\n   </em>\n   rulings concerning a device's ability to generate random or sequential numbers and the need for human intervention hit closer to home, they still do not warrant denial of summary judgment in this case. To understand why, one must focus on not just what\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   did but on what it did\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Specifically, what\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   did was to reject the FCC's have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too approach to the questions before it. The FCC was of \"two minds on the issue\" of whether \"a device must be able to generate and dial random or sequential numbers to meet the TCPA's definition of an autodialer,\" or whether \"that equipment can meet the statutory definition even if it lacks that capacity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/#p691\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/#p691\">\n    at 701-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The FCC answered \"yes\" and \"yes,\" i.e., it\n   <em>\n    must have\n   </em>\n   that ability and it\n   <em>\n    may lack\n   </em>\n   that ability, two conflicting answers that the D.C. Circuit could not accept because it provided no meaningful guidance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   But what\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   did\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   do is endorse one interpretation over the other, even implicitly.\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   did not say that a predictive dialer, or any other type of device, must be able to generate and dial random or sequential numbers to meet the TCPA's definition of an autodialer. Nor did it say that a predictive dialer, or any other type of device, may lack that capacity. In fact, the D.C. Circuit said that \"[i]t might be permissible for the Commission to adopt\n   <strong>\n    either interpretation.\n   </strong>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    ACA Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/#p691\">\n    885 F.3d at 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). But what the FCC could not do was \"espouse both competing interpretations in the same order.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/#p691\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In this case, BCA Financial is essentially urging the Court to adopt the first interpretation-i.e., that a predictive dialer must be able to generate and dial random or sequential numbers to be an ATDS-based on\n   <em>\n    ACA International's\n   </em>\n   authority. But\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   does not compel that conclusion because it did not adopt that interpretation. At best,\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   arguably calls into doubt the FCC's previous broad statements that predictive dialers are ATDSs regardless of whether they call randomly or from a sequential list or a set list of numbers. But perhaps not, given that the D.C. Circuit did not adopt one interpretation over the other. In any event, as already explained, absent an express rejection of the prior FCC orders, the Court cannot deviate from them and impose my own interpretation of the TCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Concerning the human-intervention issue, the D.C. Circuit's rulings on that issue are of even lesser consequence.

Fla. Jan. 23, 2014). The Court follows that approach here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   At this point, the evidence does not unequivocally show that BCA willfully or knowingly violated the TCPA as a matter of law. If anything, the evidence shows the opposite-that the calls were\n   <em>\n    unintentional\n   </em>\n   . The parties agree that BCA Financial did not intend to call Reyes but was trying to reach someone else to collect a debt. [ECF Nos. 86-1, p. 1; 93, p. 6]. BCA Financial obtained Reyes' cellphone number from one of its clients, Barnabas, who associated that number with a former patient (based on what the patient wrote on certain medical forms). [ECF Nos. 86-1, pp. 1-2; 93, pp. 2, 5; 96, pp. 4, 7]. And Barnabas did not inform BCA Financial that the number belonged to someone other than the patient. [ECF Nos. 93, p. 5; 96, p. 7].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   It is true that BCA Financial did not ask Barnabas if the number was accurate. [ECF Nos. 86-1, p. 1; 93, p. 5]. But then again, Barnabas did not know that the number belonged to someone else. [ECF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Nos. 93, p. 5; 96, p. 7]. So a jury may deem BCA Financial's lack of follow-up inconsequential because Barnabas would likely not have told BCA Financial that the phone information was incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Moreover, the parties agree on the fact that after the sixth call, when Reyes indicated to an IVR message that BCA Financial had dialed the wrong number, BCA Financial stopped calling. [ECF Nos. 93, p. 2; 96, p. 4]. That would indicate that BCA Financial did not intend to call her cellphone once it\n   <em>\n    knew\n   </em>\n   that it had the wrong number. To be sure, BCA Financial could have manually called Reyes to verify the number, a step that it did not take because it was contrary to their mode of operation. [ECF Nos. 86-1, p. 3; 93, p. 6]. But that is but another omission for the jury to weigh.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Lastly, the parties agree that BCA Financial at least\n   <em>\n    tried\n   </em>\n   to be TCPA compliant: it maintains a TCPA Participant Guide that it makes available to all employees; instructs its representatives on how to notate each account and operate its collection software; and provides compliance training for the TCPA. [ECF Nos. 86-1, pp. 1, 6; 93, pp. 1, 7; 96, p. 4]. A jury might review that evidence and decide that BCA Financial did not knowingly or willingly call an unknown person's cellphone without permission. Or the jury might assess that evidence and conclude that BCA Financial should have known better or that its training and compliance are surely lacking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   In short, based on the record as it stands, the Court\n   <strong>\n    denies\n   </strong>\n   summary judgment in Reyes' favor on the issue of treble damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     BCA Financial's use of the IVR cannot form a basis for summary judgment because it is an unpled claim.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \"Although the Supreme Court has mandated liberal pleading standards for civil complaints, the standard 'does not afford plaintiffs with an opportunity to raise new claims at the summary judgment stage.' \"\n   <em>\n    Newman v. Ormond\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=396%20Fed.%20Appx.%20636\">\n    396 Fed.Appx. 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 639 (11th Cir. 2010). Thus, as opposed to simply raising additional\n   <em>\n    facts\n   </em>\n   in support of an already pled claim, a plaintiff on summary judgment cannot raise \"an additional, separate statutory basis\" for relief.\n   <em>\n    Hurlbert v.

[ECF No. 1, pp. 1, 3-7 \u00b6\u00b6 2, 24-25, 33, 37-38, 43, 52]. In the one specific allegation within her TCPA count, she likewise alleged that BCA Financial violated the TCPA \"by using an\n   <strong>\n    automatic telephone dialing system\n   </strong>\n   to place non-emergency calls to Plaintiff's cellular telephone number, absent prior express consent.\" [ECF No. 1, p. 9 \u00b6 74 (emphasis added) ]. Nowhere does she allege that BCA Financial called her using an artificial or prerecorded voice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Notably, in its briefing, Reyes could point to just two parts in the Complaint in support of her argument that the Complaint encompasses a claim for the use of an artificial or prerecorded voice. First, she points to her\n   <em>\n    original\n   </em>\n   class definition, which broadly includes violations for \"using an automatic telephone dialing system\n   <em>\n    or an artificial or prerecorded voice\n   </em>\n   .\" [ECF No. 1, p. 6 \u00b6 44 (emphasis added) ]. But Reyes has since\n   <em>\n    changed\n   </em>\n   that class definition, removing any reference to artificial or prerecorded voices. [ECF No. 59, p. 1]. So even assuming that the initial, all-encompassing, generic class definition provided sufficient notice of her individual claim-an implicit assumption that the Court does not accept-the definition has since changed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Second, Reyes points to her wherefore clause, which asks for, among other things, that the Court adjudge and declare that BCA Financial violated the TCPA. [ECF No. 1 p. 10]. But that is just a general prayer for relief and not a specific claim. The liberality granted to pleadings does not extend\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   far. If it did, then a plaintiff could generally include a prayer that a defendant violated a statute and then seek summary judgment on any number of unpled theories and additional facts affording relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Moreover, BCA Financial's use of an artificial or prerecorded voice (in the form of an IVR) cannot be deemed to be an additional fact in support of an existing TCPA claim. As Reyes herself recognized, the use of the IVR provides a separate basis for relief with its\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   set of damages. [ECF No. 96, p. 4]. It is thus \"an additional, separate statutory basis\" for relief.\n   <em>\n    Hurlbert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"31263\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/439/1286/#p1297\">\n    439 F.3d at 1297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   It is obvious that the discovery in this case changed the factual understandings held by Reyes and BCA Financial. That being the case, however, Reyes should have amended her Complaint to allege the additional basis for statutory relief-BCA Financial's use of an ATDS\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   its use of an artificial or prerecorded voice. Consequently, \"[h]aving proceeded through discovery without amending (or seeking to amend) [her] Complaint to reflect that fundamental change, [Reyes is] not entitled to raise it in the midst of summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"31263\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/439/1286/#p1297\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   In short, the Court\n   <strong>\n    denies\n   </strong>\n   Reyes' summary judgment motion on the two claims that seek damages for BCA Financial's use of an artificial or prerecorded voice issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    DONE and ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   in Chambers in Miami, Florida, on May 14, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    Reyes has moved for class certification, and the issue is fully briefed. [ECF Nos. 59; 82; 94]. The summary judgment motion, however, deals only with her individual claim. Moreover, it concerns threshold issues that may impact the class, if it is certified. Therefore, the Court deems it prudent to rule on the summary judgment motion first.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
