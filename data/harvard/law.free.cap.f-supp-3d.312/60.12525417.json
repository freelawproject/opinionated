Manafort, Jr. was indicted on a number of charges relating to his lobbying and political consulting activities on behalf of Ukraine, the pro-Russia political party in Ukraine, and the former President of Ukraine who fled to Russia in 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment (Redacted) [Dkt. # 13]; Superseding Indictment [Dkt. # 201].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant Manafort has moved to dismiss the Superseding Indictment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   He contends that when the Acting Attorney General issued the Appointment Order, he exceeded limits imposed on his appointment authority by the Department of Justice Special Counsel Regulations, and that\n   therefore, the Appointment Order, and the acts undertaken by the Special Counsel under its auspices, are invalid. Manafort also argues that even if the appointment was valid, the Special Counsel overstepped the authority he was granted when he investigated and prosecuted the particular charges in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   It is important to note that Manafort does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   challenge the entire Appointment Order; he objects only to paragraph (b)(ii), the grant of authority to pursue \"any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation,\" which he claims is too broad. Thus, as Manafort acknowledges, his motion does not support the dismissal of any charges if they were properly brought under paragraphs (b)(i) or (iii) of the Appointment Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. of Apr. 19, 2018 Mot. Hr'g [Dkt. # 281] (\"Tr.\") at 8-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The motion to dismiss will be denied for a number of reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   First, the indictment falls squarely within that portion of the authority granted to the Special Counsel that Manafort finds unobjectionable: the order to investigate \"any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign.\" Appt. Order \u00b6 (b)(i). Manafort was, at one time, not merely \"associated with,\" but the chairman of, the Presidential campaign, and his work on behalf of the Russia-backed Ukrainian political party and connections to other Russian figures are matters of public record. It was logical and appropriate for investigators tasked with the investigation of \"any links\" between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign to direct their attention to him. Thus, the Departmental regulations that Manafort claims were violated by paragraph (b)(ii) of the Appointment Order are not implicated here, and the motion, which supplies no other basis to dismiss the indictment, should be denied for that reason.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   But even if one posits that the scrutiny of Manafort's alleged activities on behalf of Ukraine did not flow from the investigation of \"links\" to Russia that was assigned to the Special Counsel, and that instead, it was a \"matter that arose\" from that investigation, the indictment should not be dismissed. The second reason Manafort's motion fails is that the Department of Justice promulgated the Special Counsel Regulations for its own internal management, and they do not create any substantive rights for the benefit of individuals under investigation. This means that Manafort cannot predicate a motion to dismiss on the regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Also, even if a judge were to conclude that the regulations could give rise to rights that can be enforced in a courtroom, the Acting Attorney General did not violate those regulations when he exercised his statutory authority to authorize the Special Counsel to investigate not only \"links and/or coordination,\" but also, \"any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.\" The Acting Attorney General had the authority under the applicable statutes and regulations to define the Special Counsel's charter broadly. Therefore, paragraph (b)(ii) of the Appointment Order-which does not appear to bear on this indictment in any event-is not invalid on its face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Finally, the case did not arise in a vacuum, and the Special Counsel did not create his own job description. He was appointed\n   to take over an existing investigation, and it appears from the chronology and the written record that the matters contained in the Superseding Indictment were already a part of the ongoing inquiry that was lawfully transferred to the Special Counsel by the Department of Justice in May of 2017. More important, the Acting Attorney General has confirmed in writing that he assigned the Special Counsel the specific responsibility to investigate the very allegations that comprise the Superseding Indictment. This is exactly what the Department of Justice regulations contemplate: a specific factual statement of the matters to be investigated. So to the extent the regulations bear on this case at all, they were not violated; the management of the investigation into the allegations against Manafort has been consistent with the objectives and requirements of the set of regulations as a whole, as well as the terms of the individual regulation upon which the defendant relies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As the Department explained when it issued the Special Counsel Regulations, the regulations were designed to \"strike a balance between independence and accountability in certain sensitive investigations.\" Final Rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20Fed.%20Reg.%2037%2C038\">\n    64 Fed. Reg. 37,038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (July 9, 1999). The regulations recognize that there will be occasions when the Attorney General or Acting Attorney General may determine that it would be in the public interest to appoint an outside Special Counsel to assume responsibility for a matter. In recognition of the conflict of interest or other extraordinary circumstances that prompted the appointment, the regulations preserve the Special Counsel's day-to-day independence to structure the investigation. They expect and require that he or she will exercise prosecutorial discretion when determining what charges to bring, informed by both the experience and integrity that led to the appointment, as well as the established rules, policies, and procedures of the Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At the same time, the Department's Special Counsel Regulations call for ongoing communication and consultation, because the ultimate responsibility for the matter continues to rest with the Department hierarchy. When it promulgated the regulations, the Department anticipated that a Special Counsel, like any other prosecutor, could become aware of, and could have legitimate reasons to explore, paths that branch out naturally from the original investigation, as well as entirely new and disconnected allegations. The regulations establish a procedure to ensure that it is the Department of Justice, and not the Special Counsel himself or herself, who decides whether it should be the Special Counsel or attorneys within the Department of Justice who will pursue those lines of inquiry. The regulations place no boundaries on who can be investigated or what charges can be brought-what they address is who decides who the\n   <em>\n    prosecutor\n   </em>\n   will be. With respect to the investigation of the defendant that led to this indictment, the Acting Attorney General made that decision and confirmed it in writing, so the defendant has no grounds for complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   It bears emphasizing at this stage that Manafort is presumed to be innocent of these charges, and it will be the prosecution's burden to prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. But the indictment will not be dismissed, and the matter will proceed to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On March 2, 2017, the United States Attorney General recused himself \"from any existing or future investigations of any matters related in any way to the campaigns for President of the United States.\" Press Release, U.S. Dep't of Justice, Attorney General Sessions Statement on Recusal (Mar. 2, 2017), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-sessions-statement-recusal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   There was such an investigation underway, and on March 20, 2017, the Director of the FBI officially confirmed its existence in public testimony before an open session of Congress.

First, he argues that the Appointment Order was an\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   action on the part of the Acting Attorney General because the grant of authority to the Special Counsel to handle \"matters that arose or may arise\" from the investigation is unduly broad and inconsistent with section 600.4 of the Special Counsel Regulations. Def.'s\n   Mot. at 14-31. Second, he argues that even if the order itself is valid, the Special Counsel exceeded the authority granted by the order when he investigated the particular matters alleged in the indictment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20Fed.%20Reg.%2037%2C038\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20Fed.%20Reg.%2037%2C038\">\n    at 31-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   There are multiple flaws in the defendant's position. First, Manafort challenges only paragraph (b)(ii) of the Appointment Order on the ground that it confers more freedom than the Acting Attorney General was authorized to provide. Since the Court finds that the investigation that prompted the indictment fell within the lawful grant of authority to investigate \"links and/or coordination\" set out in paragraph (b)(i), the motion can be denied on that basis alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   But even if the allegations in the Superseding Indictment could be characterized as \"matters that arose\" from that investigation, Manafort's motion fails. Defendant does not argue in his pleadings that the Acting Attorney General violated any statute when he defined the Special Counsel's jurisdiction to include \"any matters that arose;\" his claim is that paragraph (b)(ii) of the Appointment Order is inconsistent with the Department's Special Counsel Regulations. But those internal agency regulations do not create rights that an individual under investigation may enforce in court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Moreover, even if Manafort has the right to ask the Court to monitor the Department's compliance with its regulations, there has been no violation of those regulations here. The Acting Attorney General had the authority under the applicable statutes and regulations to delineate the boundaries of the Special Counsel's \"original jurisdiction\" as he saw fit, and the provisions Manafort relies upon do not impose limits on that authority that were breached in this case. So there is nothing about paragraph (b)(ii) of the Appointment Order on its face that violates the regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   But what if Manafort is correct that his work on behalf of the Ukrainians is not a \"link\" under paragraph (b)(i), and the inquiry is a matter that \"arose\" out of that investigation under paragraph (b)(ii)? And what if he is also correct that the regulations require that matters that arose out of the investigation had to be treated as \"additional jurisdiction\" under section 600.4 of the regulations, and they could not be included within the original grant of jurisdiction from the outset? There still would be no basis to dismiss the case. What the regulations require when additional matters arise is the same as what they require at the start: that the Attorney General or Acting Attorney General, and not the Special Counsel, must be the one to decide whether it will be the Special Counsel or a lawyer within the Department who will pursue those issues. Here, the Acting Attorney General expressly approved the Special Counsel's investigation of the facts alleged in the indictment, so there has been no violation of the regulations, and the Special Counsel did not act without authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The investigation of Manafort was an appropriate exploration of a \"link\" between a person associated with the campaign and the Russian government.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Manafort acknowledges that the Acting Attorney General had the statutory authority to appoint the Special Counsel to investigate \"any links\" and that paragraph (b)(i) of the Appointment Order assigning that investigation to the Special Counsel comports with the Department of Justice Special Counsel Regulations. Since the investigation of Manafort, including his dealings with the pro-Russia faction in Ukraine and the former President of\n   Ukraine who fled to Russia, falls within that category, it was an appropriate exercise of the Special Counsel's authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Manafort complains that the investigation of the allegations contained in the indictment was unauthorized since the charges \"do not focus in the slightest on alleged coordination between the Russian government and the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.\" Def.'s Mot. at 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manafort v.

But the grant of authority that Manafort agrees was lawful was not so narrow. The word \"collusion\" does not even appear in the Appointment Order, and the Special Counsel was tasked with taking over the existing investigation, \"including\" \"any links and/\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     or\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   coordination.\" Appt. Order. This delineation of the scope of the inquiry, which was revealed to Congress by the then-FBI Director and then repeated in the Appointment Order, makes sense; in order to reach the end of the road, and come to a conclusion about whether there was coordination or not, a key place to begin is with the individuals who would have been in a position to coordinate. Who had connections to the Russian government? Who attended meetings on behalf of the campaign? Given the combination of his prominence within the campaign and his ties to Ukrainian officials supported by and operating out of Russia, as well as to Russian oligarchs, Manafort was an obvious person of interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Manafort contends that the description of the Special Counsel's charter in the Appointment Order does not cover these charges because they relate to work in Ukraine, not Russia, that \"long pre-dates\" the presidential campaign.

Second, when Manafort complains that paragraph (b)(ii) of the order lacks the necessary specificity, he mistakenly assumes that the Acting Attorney General purported to include that specificity in the order itself.

The Special Counsel received more precise direction as part of the communication and consultation described in the regulations in their entirety, and it was the Acting Attorney General-as Manafort argues it must be-who made the determination whether to include the particular allegations in the indictment within the Special Counsel's purview or to assign them elsewhere.

The structure of the regulation does indicate that once the original jurisdiction has been conferred, further delegation is necessary to\n   <em>\n    expand\n   </em>\n   that jurisdiction, but it does not require that the original jurisdiction be circumscribed in any particular way in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Manafort rails against what he characterizes as a \"blank check\" issued to the Special Counsel to investigate any matters \"he may stumble across\" in his investigation. Def.'s Mot. at 2, 20. He complains that the Appointment Order \"purports to give the Special Counsel jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute anything else he might discover during the course of the original investigation.\" Def.'s Mot. at 2. But that is not quite what the order says: the second paragraph of the Appointment Order was more tightly drafted to include \"matters that arose or may arise\n   <em>\n    directly\n   </em>\n   from the investigation.\" Appt. Order \u00b6 (b)(ii) (emphasis added). As the Office of Special Counsel pointed out at the hearing, it was within the Acting Attorney General's discretion, particularly given the conflict of interest that prompted the appointment of the Special Counsel in the first place, to accord the Special Counsel flexibility from the start to manage the investigation and pursue matters that arose \"directly\" from the issues within his purview.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20600.1\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The Attorney General, or in cases in which the Attorney General is recused, the Acting Attorney General, will appoint a Special Counsel when he or she determines that criminal investigation of a person or matter is warranted and ... investigation or prosecution ... by a United States Attorney's Office or litigating Division of the Department of Justice would present a conflict of interest for the Department or other extraordinary circumstances\" and \"it would be in the public interest to appoint an outside Special Counsel to assume responsibility for the matter.\"). Thus, the Acting Attorney General was not acting outside of his authority when he drafted the order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Defendant's effort to distill a set of rigid parameters from a few sentences in one regulation is inconsistent not only with the statute, and with the admonition contained within the regulations that they confer no rights that can be enforced in court, but also with the tenor and objectives of the set of regulations as a whole. As the notice published in the Federal Register at the time of the promulgation of the regulations emphasizes, the Department understood from the start that there could be no one-size-fits-all template for the management of these matters; the regulations outline processes to preserve both independence and accountability, \"recognizing that there is no perfect solution to the problem.\" Final Rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20Fed.%20Reg.%2037%2C038\">\n    64 Fed. Reg. at 37,038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Appointment Order is thus consistent with the Department's stated intentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Appointment Order is not invalid under the regulations due to a lack of specificity.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Manafort reads the second sentence of paragraph (a) of the regulation concerning the \"specific factual statement,\" together with paragraph (b) concerning\n   \"additional jurisdiction,\" and he argues that anything that was not included within the \"specific factual statement\" describing the Special Counsel's \"original jurisdiction\" must be considered to be \"additional jurisdiction,\" which requires a separate, express grant of prosecutorial authority. That may be the intention of the regulation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   But Manafort's argument that the statement in paragraph (b)(ii) of the Appointment Order is not consistent with the regulation because it is broader than the \"specific factual statement\" in paragraph (b)(i),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 7, is based on the flawed premise that paragraph (b)(i) of the Appointment Order\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   the \"specific factual statement of the matter to be investigated.\" That assumption is unfounded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The regulation does not require that the \"specific factual statement\" be set forth in the Appointment Order. In fact, counsel for Manafort agreed at the hearing on the motion that providing that level of detail in a public document transferring an open criminal investigation would have been entirely inappropriate. Tr. at 22 (THE COURT: \"[A]bout the provision in the regs that says that a specific factual statement must be provided, the Office of Special Counsel says, given law enforcement concerns and privacy concerns, that militated against doing it publicly. Do you agree with that? MR. DOWNING: I do.\"). What paragraph (b)(i) transferred was a specific, existing inquiry that was already underway at the Department of Justice, which neither the FBI Director nor the Acting Attorney General was free to describe publicly. And if the Manafort allegations fell within that inquiry, they were transferred with the order. The fact that a 22-page affidavit in support of a search warrant related to Manafort was presented to the United States District Court in the Eastern District of Virginia on May 27, 2017, only ten days after the Appointment Order was issued, suggests that Manafort was already under investigation when the Special Counsel took over the reins.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Search and Seizure Warrant [Dkt. # 257-1].\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Manafort maintains, though, that including \"matters that arose or may arise\" from the transferred investigation within the original grant of authority to the Special Counsel was inconsistent with the provision in the regulation that the original assignment will be accompanied by a specific factual statement of what it entails. The Acting Attorney General was certainly in a position to inform the new prosecutor of what had already \"arisen\" in the existing FBI investigation, so there would be no violation of the reference to a \"specific factual statement\" in the regulation if he did so. But Manafort makes the point that the Acting Attorney General could not possibly\n   have provided a \"specific factual statement\" of matters that \"may arise.\" One can hardly argue with that. The Court does not agree, though, that the language in the regulation calling for a specific statement operates as a limit on the Acting Attorney General's authority to tell the Special Counsel what he or she may do, and it finds the Appointment Order to be valid as written. But if Manafort is correct that the requirement of a specific statement in paragraph (a) of the regulation means that as-yet-undefined matters can only be treated as \"additional jurisdiction,\" then the question to be resolved in this case is whether the procedure for additional matters outlined in section 600.4(b) took place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. The Special Counsel received a specific factual statement of the matters assigned to him, and the Acting Attorney General was the one who decided, as the regulations require, that the Special Counsel's jurisdiction includes the matters in the indictment.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   If the defendant is correct that the investigation of his work on behalf of a Ukrainian political party fell outside of the grant of authority to the Special Counsel memorialized in the Appointment Order in paragraph (b)(i), or if a court were to agree that the Acting Attorney General gave the Special Counsel too much leeway in paragraph (b)(ii) to address matters that \"may arise\" at the start, what the regulations require in the face of new allegations is a specific delegation of those matters to the outside prosecutor. In other words, whether the Special Counsel was acting within his \"original jurisdiction,\" because alleged financial and regulatory violations arising out of Manafort's work on behalf of the Ukraine were assigned to him on day one, or he was considering issues that are better characterized as \"additional jurisdiction,\" the sole purpose of the regulation at the heart of this motion is to ensure that the Acting Attorney General was the one who assigned those issues to the Special Counsel. Since that took place in this case with respect to the specific allegations in this indictment, and the Special Counsel did not take them up on his own initiative, the assignment of these issues was consistent with the regulations, and the Special Counsel did not exceed his authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The gravamen of Manafort's motion is his contention that the Special Counsel has embarked on an unfettered and unsupervised investigation, and that the inquiry should have been cabined by a specific factual statement delivered by the Acting Attorney General at the outset. But the Acting Attorney General has stated publicly in sworn testimony that he did discuss the facts under investigation with the Special Counsel at the time of the appointment. Testimony of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, House Committee on the Judiciary, Hearing on Justice Department's Investigation of Russia's Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election (Dec. 13, 2017), Ex. B to Gov't Opp. [Dkt. # 244-2] at 29. The notion that this formal passing of the baton included an investigation into Manafort is borne out by the fact that the FBI was taking significant investigative steps related to Manafort within a very short period of time after the Special Counsel was appointed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Furthermore, the Acting Attorney General has memorialized the fact that the Special Counsel's jurisdiction included the matters in the indictment as of the day of his appointment and thereafter. In an August 2, 2017 memorandum to the Special Counsel, the Acting Attorney General detailed the particular responsibility assigned to the Special Counsel on May 17, 2017. With respect to Manafort, the memorandum stated,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   The May 17, 2017 order was worded categorically in order to permit its public\n   release without confirming specific investigations involving specific individuals.

The unredacted portions of the memorandum state explicitly, though, that the Special Counsel was authorized from the start to investigate the defendant not only for coordinating with the Russian government, but also for violations of law arising out of payments received from the former President of Ukraine. So even in the unlikely event that the Acting Attorney General and the Special Counsel never discussed what the investigation included at the time of the appointment, the singular event that defendant insists would be necessary to make his indictment valid-an explicit referral of the specific matter to the Special Counsel-has taken place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   For all of these reasons, the motion to dismiss [Dkt. # 235] is DENIED.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    Appointment of Special Counsel to Investigate Russian Interference with the 2016 Presidential Election and Related Matters, Ex.
