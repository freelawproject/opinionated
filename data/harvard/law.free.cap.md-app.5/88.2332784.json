He contends on appeal from the judgment that he was denied a speedy trial and that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-15\">\n<em>SPBBDY TRIAL</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b111-16\">The appellant was presented and indicted on 1 April 1966, charged with an offense alleged to have been committed on 8 March 1966. On 17 August he filed a motion for a speedy trial in proper person in which he alleged that he was then con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>fined in the federal prison at Eorton, Virginia serving a 1 year sentence imposed 22 April by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The State answered the motion on 1 September, stating that it was ready and willing to proceed with the arraignment and trial and that it did not consent to a withdrawal of a detainer placed against him. On 8 September a speedy trial was granted by order of court, directing that the State\u2019s Attorney forthwith take the necessary steps to have the appellant brought before it for trial from the place where he was confined. The order appointed counsel for the appellant \u201cwith specific instructions to see that all necessary steps and procedure are complied with in order to produce the defendant before this Court in order to carry out the desire of the Court to grant a speedy trial.\u201d On 12 September the appellant in proper person filed a reply to the State\u2019s answer to his motion for a speedy trial, demanding \u201ca copy of the information used by the State\u2019s Attorney, and presented before the Grand Jury for a true indictment * * \u201ca Copy of Bill of Particulars\u201d; \u201cany other documental material being used to bring about a trial\u201d; and \u201ca copy of Indictment\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The appellant stated that the motion was \u201cbeing submitted pursuant to the provisions of Title 18, U.S.C., Section 3500, and the JENCKS RULE, Fed. R. Crim. Procedure.\u201d On 6 October a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum was issued on petition of the State\u2019s Attorney to the superintendent of the D. C. Reformatory, Lorton, Virginia commanding him to have the appellant before the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County on 20 October 1966. The docket entries under date of 20 October show the case continued to 27 October 1966. On 28 October <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>counsel for the appellant wrote the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney that the \u201carraignment procedure under our Rules is an extremely important facet of the criminal procedure and we feel it would be prejudicial to our client to have him, arraigned the same day of the trial.\u201d He requested that the appellant be presented for arraignment \u201cat the next earliest possible time.\u201d On 28 November the State\u2019s Attorney wrote defense counsel informing him that the case was set for trial on 8 December, giving the name of the assistant to which it had been assigned and requesting that counsel contact the assistant to discuss the trial. A writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum was issued on 30 November to the superintendent of the Reformatory at Norton to deliver the appellant to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County for trial on 8 December. On 19 December the State\u2019s Attorney wrote defense counsel that the case was set for trial on 17 January 1967 and on 12 January that it was set for trial on 9 March. On 1 March a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum was issued for the appearance of the appellant for trial on 9 March. On 23 March the appearance of counsel for the appellant was stricken and another counsel appointed by the court to represent him. On 3 April the State\u2019s Attorney wrote defense counsel that the case was set for trial on 14 April, and a praecipe for witness summons was filed on 5 April, returnable 14 April. On 7 April the appellant, by his attorney, filed a motion to dismiss the indictment for lack of a speedy trial and under date of 14 April the docket shows the case continued. On 21 June the State\u2019s Attorney wrote defense counsel that the case was set for trial on 8 August. On 22 June the appellant was arraigned. On 29 June he wrote the court alleging that his counsel was not present at the arraignment (a plea of not guilty was entered on arraignment by the court in absence of counsel) and requesting that bond be set so he could \u201cseek legal assistance elsewhere, to prepare a defense for pending charges.\u201d On 30 June bond was set in the amount of $5000. The case came on for trial on 8 August. After the jury had been empaneled and sworn the motion to dismiss the indictment, filed 7 April 1967, was argued out of the presence of the jury. No evidence was offered by the appellant on the issue. Defense counsel reviewed the docket entries but did not know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>why the case was not tried as set on 20 October 1966 and 27 October. The trial set for 8 December was not had because the appellant\u2019s counsel at that time filed a motion for a continuance until February 1967. The trial set for 9 March was not had because \u201ca series of events beyond the control of my client took place which took his attorney out of the conduct of the business of law.\u201d Counsel representing the appellant at the trial was appointed 23 March and trial was set for 14 April. According to counsel, at that time the appellant had been released under the District of Columbia Bail Bond Act and the attorney in Washington, representing him on another and unrelated charge, told him not to appear in Prince George\u2019s County until the matter in the District had been determined. Therefore the appellant did not appear for trial. Defense counsel suggested to the court that it would be impossible \u201cfor any of us sitting here in this room today * * * to tell or figure out what we were doing on March 8, 1966,\u201d and that the appellant could not prepare a defense or \u201can alibi defense.\u201d He conceded that he could not say or prove that the delay was purposeful on the part of the State but alleged that it was oppressive and prejudicial. He indicated that the State should be charged with the delay because the court appointed attorney \u201cfor some reason or other couldn\u2019t carry out his job. We don\u2019t know why. That is conjecture on all our parts at this time.\u201d But he offered no evidence in support of his bald allegations, suggestions and conjectures. The court denied the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Considering: (1) the length of the delay (we do not think that the passage of time here between indictment and trial itself demonstrates a violation of the right); (2) the reason for the delay (the State was ready and willing to proceed to trial on and after 20 October 1966, had set a trial date on a number of occasions and took steps to obtain the presence of the appellant. There is no showing that the delay was purposeful or capricious on the part of the State and properly chargeable to it. On the contrary, on at least two occasions the delay was at the instance or caused by the appellant) ; (3) prejudice to the accused (even if it be assumed that the failure to bring the appellant to trial was due to the negligence of the State, which we do not find, some showing by the accused of \u201ca strong possibil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>ity of prejudice\u201d is required. The appellant made no such showing) ; (4) waiver by the accused (the request for continuance to February 1967 and his failure to appear for trial on 14 April 1967 may he deemed a waiver of the right to a speedy trial even though previously demanded by him), we find no deprivation of the appellant\u2019s constitutional right to a speedy trial. See <em>Brown v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 141; <em>Thompson v. State, 4 </em>Md. App. 31; <em>Stevenson and Borum v. State, 4 </em>Md. App. 1; <em>Hall v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 680; <em>Fabian v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 270; <em>Tillery v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 142; <em>Kelly v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 730; <em>Dubs v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 524; <em>Brown v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 388; <em>State v. Long and Nelson, </em>1 Md. App. 326. We hold that there was no error in the denial of the motion to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">\n<em>SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The appellant\u2019s contention that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain the conviction is limited by him to the issue that although the indictment charged that the money taken by the appellant from the victim by robbery with a deadly weapon was the moneys of \u201cBranch, Inc., a body corporate, T/A Sam\u2019s Car Wash\u201d, there was no evidence of the moneys \u201cbelonging to Branch, Inc.\u201d He alleges that, \u201c[i]n fact, the name Branch, Inc. nor anything close to it was ever mentioned.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>transcript of the proceedings at the trial discloses that the victim testified that the money taken was \u201cthe company\u2019s money, Sam\u2019s Car Wash\u201d, that Sam\u2019s Car Wash was a corporation, and that the name of the corporation was \u201cBranch Avenue, Incorporated, trading as Sam\u2019s Car Wash.\u201d The purpose of an indictment is to apprise the accused of the crime charged, <em>Dortch and Garnett v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 173, so he may prepare his defense and be protected from double jeopardy. <em>Jackson v. State, </em>231 Md. 591. We think it clear that the indictment apprised the appellant of the crime charged. And in any event, although an allegation of the ownership of property alleged to have been stolen is a necessary requisite in an indictment charging larceny and proof of ownership as laid in the indictment is an essential factor to justify conviction. <em>Anderson v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 85, ownership of goods taken in a robbery need not be alleged in an indictment charging robbery or robbery with a deadly weapon and proof of ownership is not required; what is required is that the victim be shown to be the owner or that he had a legal interest or special property in the goods taken, as for example, be in lawful possession as bailee, <em>McMillan v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 699. In the instant case the victim was conducting his business when the robbery occurred, the money was locked in the safe and he was forced to open the safe by the robbers. In answer to a direct question at trial, \u201cIn whose possession was the money?\u201d he said, \u201cThe money belonged to the company. The money was in the safe. It was our possession, certainly.\u201d It is clear that the evidence was sufficient to show directly or by inference that the victim was the lawful possessor of the money taken from him and therefore the conviction was proper. <em>Harrison v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b112-5\">. The docket entries show under date of 1 April 1966 that a bench warrant was issued with a copy of the indictment delivered to the Sheriff for service and under date of 14 June 1967: \u201cReturned \u2018cepi\u2019 as to Frazier, filed.\u201d There was endorsed on the warrant under date of 14 June 1967 over the signature of the Sheriff of Prince George\u2019s County: \u201cCepi and copy of indictment given to Samuel Frazier.\u201d On the' docket the entry as to the giving of the cepi and indictment immediately follows an entry dated 1 April 1966 and immediately precedes an entry dated 14 April 1966 which is followed in chronological order by seven other entries made in 1966. \u25a0</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b115-7\">. The appellant states in his brief that the State did not use the form of indictment for robbery with a deadly weapon \u201crequired\u201d by Md. Code (1967 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 487, but used the common law form. It is \u00a7 489 of Art. 27 which sets forth a form of indictment for robbery with a deadly weapon. Section 487 sets forth a form of indictment for robbery. Neither form is \u201crequired\u201d to be used. The sections merely provide that \u201cit shall be sufficient to use a formula substantially to the following effect:\u201d and set forth the formula. He also states that robbery \u201calthough one of the common law felonies, has been made a statutory crime\u201d by Art. 27, \u00a7 486. We have held that robbery is a crime in Maryland under common law; \u00a7 486 does not define it but fixes the penalty for it. <em>Darby v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 407, 413. We held in the same case that \u00a7 488 merely provides a more severe penalty for the existing crime of robbery when it is committed with a dangerous or deadly weapon and does not create a new substantive crime. <em>Jones v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 608, 613.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
