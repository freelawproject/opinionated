North Carolina, </em>386 U. S. 213; <em>State v. Long and Nelson, </em>1 Md. App. 326. Every accused under the jurisdiction of this State is also guaranteed a speedy trial by Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and, in addition to these federal and State constitutional rights, has a statutory right, under certain circumstances, to a trial within a specified time by the provisions of Md. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 616A-616R pertaining to interstate detainers and \u00a7 616S pertaining to intrastate detainers. And by Md. Rule 709 an accused not indicted may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>seek an immediate trial upon petition waiving his right to action by the grand jury, \u00a7 a, whereupon the State\u2019s Attorney shall immediately file an information against him (except in a case originating before a trial magistrate which is to be tried upon warrant) \u00a7 b; when such petition has been filed the accused \u201cshall be tried, without regard to term of court, within such reasonable time as to accord him a speedy trial.\u201d \u00a7 c. We have considered the constitutional rights to a speedy trial and discussed the rules of law relating thereto in a number of cases from <em>Allen v. </em>State, 1 Md. App. 249 to <em>Frazier v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 88. In <em>State v. Long amd Nelson, </em>1 Md. App. 326, we stated that the time within which trial must be had by the provisions of Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 616A-S applied only to prisoners serving a sentence and against whom a detainer had been filed and held that there was no statutory direction, either directly or by implication, that all those accused of a crime must be tried within a specified time. But we have had no occasion to consider fully the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 616A-S or Md. Rule 709. The instant case, however, brings Art. 27, \u00a7 616S before us, as the appellant claims that he was not only denied his constitutional rights to a speedy trial but that a detainer was lodged against him for the crimes which are the subject of this appeal while he was a prisoner serving a sentence in a correctional institution under the jurisdiction of the Department of Correction, that he requested that he be tried and that he was not tried within the time prescribed by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">\n<em>The Intrastate Detainer Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Chapter 628, Acts 1965, effective 1 June 1965, codified as Art. 27, \u00a7 616S,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> applicable at the time of the appellant\u2019s trial on 7 March 1968,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-7\">\u201c(a) <em>Request by prisoner; statement from warden having custody. </em>\u2014 Whenever the Department of Cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>rection receives a detainer against any prisoner serving a sentence in any correctional institution under the jurisdiction of the Department, any such prisoner shall be brought to trial within 120 days after the request of the prisoner for final disposition of the indictment, information, or complaint has been delivered to the State\u2019s attorney of the City of Baltimore or of the county in which the indictment, information, or complaint is pending and to the appropriate court; provided that for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance. The request of the prisoner shall be filed within 30 days of the prisoner\u2019s notification of any untried indictment, information, or complaint and shall be accompanied by a statement from the warden or superintendent having custody, setting forth the term of the commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the date of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the Board of Parole and Probation relating to the prisoner. The written notice and statement provided herein shall be delivered by certified mail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-5\">(b) <em>Duty to inform prisoner. </em>\u2014 The warden or superintendent having custody of the prisoner shall inform the prisoner within 15 days in writing of the source and contents of any untried indictment, information, or complain against said prisoner concerning which the warden or superintendent has knowledge, and of the prisoner\u2019s right to make a request for final disposition thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-6\">(c) <em>Dismissal when action not commenced. </em>\u2014 If action is not commenced on the matter for which request for disposition was made, within the time limitation set forth in subsection (a) above, the court shall no longer have jurisdiction thereof, and the untried indictment shall have no further force or effect; and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>such case the court shall enter an order dismissing the untried indictment with prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Obviously the objective of the Act was to assure a prisoner incarcerated in the designated institutions of this State against whom a detainer was filed on a charge to be prosecuted in this State, a trial on such charge within the time limitation upon delivery to the State\u2019s attorney and court of the prisoner\u2019s request. While the Act may be praised for its objective, it may be more damned for its provisions establishing the procedure to attain the objective. The provisions are vague, obscure and with one exception, lack sanctions to compel compliance with them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In our discussion of the Act hereinafter \u201cindictment\u201d means \u201cany untried indictment, information or complaint against a prisoner\u201d; \u201cwarden\u201d means \u201cwarden, superintendent or county or city law enforcement officer having custody of the prisoner\u201d; \u201cstatement\u201d means the statement from the warden specified in \u00a7 616S (a) ; and \u201crequest\u201d means the request of the prisoner for final disposition of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">The Act first refers to the request of the prisoner in that part of subsection (a) providing that when a detainer has been received by the Department of Correction (and by amendment by any county or city jail) the prisoner shall be brought to trial within the time limitation after the request of the prisoner has been delivered to the appropriate State\u2019s attorney and court. It then provides that the request \u201cshall be filed\u201d within 30 days of the prisoner\u2019s notification of the indictment. It does not say who is to file the request or where it is to be filed. The Attorney General has interpreted the filing provision to mean that the request of the prisoner must be made by him within 30 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>days of his notification of the indictment. 50 <em>Opinions of the Attorney General </em>108. Although the opinion of the Attorney General does not expressly so state, the implication is that the request is to be filed by the prisoner with the warden. But the Act also provides that the request so filed shall be accompanied by a statement from the warden and \u201cshall be delivered by certified mail.\u201d It would seem more logical not to require a time limitation for the making of the request by the prisoner but to require, when the request is made to the warden, that the warden file it within 30 days thereafter, accompanied by the statement, with the appropriate State\u2019s attorney and court. However the Act does not say that the filing should be within 30 days of the receipt of the request by the warden but within 30 days of the prisoner\u2019s notification of the indictment and it would be impossible for the warden to file the request if none had been made. But it would be impractical to require that the request filed with the warden be accompanied, as the Act provides, by a statement which must be made by the warden. On the other hand it would be equally impractical to require that it is the prisoner\u2019s obligation to obtain the statement from the warden and then to file it, within 30 days of his notification, with the State\u2019s attorney and court with delivery to them by certified mail. The prisoner may be without funds for the mailing and it would properly, by normal prison routine, have to pass through the hands of the prison officials in any event. We can only determine the legislative intent to have been that the prisoner file the request (no particular form is necessary) with the warden within 30 days of the prisoner\u2019s notification of the indictment and that it is the warden\u2019s obligation to prepare the statement and to deliver it by certified mail to the appropriate State\u2019s attorney and court. We recognize that by this construction there is no time limitation within which the warden is to so deliver the request and statement<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that the time limi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>tation within which the prisoner must be brought to trial dates from the time his request is delivered to the State\u2019s attorney and court. Thus the prisoner may be precluded from invoking the Act by the failure of the warden to deliver the request as required for no sanction is provided by the statute for such failure. While we may construe statutes within the legislative intent, we cannot enact legislation and we may not presume a sanction when none is provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Subsection (b) requires the warden to inform the prisoner within 15 days in writing of the source and contents of the indictment, concerning which the warden has knowledge, and of the prisoner\u2019s right to make a request for final disposition thereof. It does not specify when the 15 days start to run. We think the 15 day period would commence when the warden received knowledge of the indictment. As the Act contemplates that the detainer would be received by the Department of Correction, it assumes that the proper officials would then notify the warden; the warden would then have knowledge. However, the Act does not provide for such notification. As the time within which the prisoner shall be brought to trial runs from the time his request is delivered to the State\u2019s attorney and court, as he cannot make the request until he is notified of the indictment, as he need not be notified of the indictment until the warden has knowledge of it, as the warden would not have the requisite knowledge of it until he was informed about the detainer, and as there is no requirement that the warden be notified of the detainer, the prisoner would be precluded from invoking the Act or the invoking of the Act by the prisoner could be indefinitely delayed by the mere failure or delay of the proper officials to notify the warden that the detainer had been received. We do not feel that the knowledge of the Department of Correction as to an indictment, obtained by receipt of a detainer, is knowledge of the warden. The Act specifically px\u2019ovides that the infoxunation as to the indictment is that concerning which the warden has knowledge. We can only take this to mean actxxal knowledge, for the warden could not inform the prisoner of that which he had only constructive knowledge. And, in axxy event, even if the warden had actual knowledge of the indictmexxt and failed to give the prisoner the information required, the prisoner would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>not be entitled to relief under the provisions of the statute; again there is no sanction provided for such failure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Subsection (c) of the Act provides that if \u201caction is not commenced\u201d on the matter for which request is made within the time limitation set forth in subsection (a) the court no longer shall have jurisdiction, the indictment shall have no further force or effect and the court shall order its dismissal with prejudice. We interpret \u201caction\u201d to mean trial. The time limitation set forth in subsection (a) specifically refers to the trial of the prisoner. We do not think that any other \u201caction\u201d than the trial was intended by the legislature. The Act does not define \u201caction\u201d and we believe that any other interpretation would render the Act so impotent as to substantially affect the attainment of its objective.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">As we construe Md. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 616S, applicable at the time of the appellant\u2019s trial, it provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">1) a warden having knowledge of an indictment pending in this State against a prisoner in his custody, such knowledge having been obtained by notice to the warden of a detainer received by the Department of Correction, shall inform the prisoner in writing, within 15 days of the obtaining of such knowledge, of the source and contents of the indictment and of the prisoner's right to make a request for final disposition of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>2) the prisoner may, within 30 days of the receipt of such information, make a request, in writing, for final disposition of the indictment and deliver it to the warden.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">3) upon receipt of such request the warden shall prepare a statement as to the matters specified in subsection (a) and deliver a copy of the request and statement to each of the State\u2019s attorneys and the appropriate court in the jurisdiction where the indictment is pending.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">4) the indictment shall be brought to trial within 120 days of the receipt of the request and statement by the State\u2019s attorney and court; except that for good cause shown in open court, in the presence of the prisoner or his counsel, the court may grant any reasonable or necessary continuance; if trial is not commenced within such time limitation the court shall no longer have jurisdiction, the indictment shall have no further force or effect and the court shall order it dismissed with prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">Thus the Act assumes that all parties concerned will do what its provisions call upon them to do but it provides a sanction for failure to do so in only one instance, i.e., when the prisoner is not brought to trial within the time limitation after his request and the warden\u2019s statement have been delivered to the appropriate State\u2019s attorney and court. But the court does not lose jurisdiction and the indictment still has force and effect and shall not he dismissed with prejudice for any other failure to comply with the provisions, not only on the part of the prisoner but also on the part of the State\u2019s authorities. So the Act is not invoked if the warden fails to inform the prisoner as required either because he has not received knowledge of a detainer from the Department of Correction or having received such knowledge he fails to inform the prisoner. Nor is it invoked when the warden, having knowledge of the detainer, informs the prisoner and the prisoner files his request, but the warden fails to deliver the request, accompanied by the statement, to the appropriate State\u2019s attorney and court. In other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>words, the Act is invoked only when there is full compliance with its provisions, short of bringing the prisoner to trial within the time limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">We now turn to the instant case. Prior to trial the appellant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment. At a hearing on the motion preliminary to trial he testified and offered evidence. He said that while he was incarcerated in the Maryland House of Correction he was delivered, in June or July of 1967, a slip of paper by an inmate \u2014 \u201cThey put it in the mail and your mail goes to the jail and your inmate gives out your mail and I was given this piece of paper * * * I have never been officially notified.\u201d The slip said, \u201cYou have a detainer against you by the Maryland State Police.\u201d On 15 September 1967 he was in the Maryland Penitentiary and he wrote \u201cThe Chief Judge for Dorchester County\u201d that he had a detainer filed against him from Dorchester County. He asked that certain evidence be suppressed and for \u201ca speedy trial, before the case and evidence gets too old.\u201d He said he also had detainers against him in Frederick County and Caroline County. On 2 October he wrote the State\u2019s Attorney for Dorchester County that he had been \u201cadvised by the authorities here\u201d that charges of breaking and entering and larceny had been placed against him, that he was serving a 5 year sentence imposed by the Circuit Court of Washington County, that his wife had just given birth to their first child, and asked that the State \u201cconsider the possibility of Nolle Prosse\u201d of the pending charges. On 12 October he received a reply from the State\u2019s Attorney for Dorchester County that his letter was being referred to Judge C. Burnham Mace and \u201cwe are taking into consideration the matters therein contained. You wfill hear from us at a later date.\u201d He said that before he wrote the letter of 2 October he went to the classification officer of the penitentiary and asked about the detainer. The officer told him he had a charge pending in Dorchester County \u201cbut I have got nothing to do with this, it happened while you w^as at the Plouse of Corrections.\u201d The officer suggested he write the State\u2019s Attorney. After further discussion the officer \u201ccarried it to the warden and the warden told him at that time that he was supposed to have filled out some kind of form or something. He said he didn\u2019t \u2014 it wasn\u2019t his responsibility, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>they was supposed to have done it at the House of Corrections. Since they didn\u2019t do it at the House of Corrections it wasn\u2019t his job to do it. We had a big argument about that and everything.\u201d On 26 December he received a letter from the State\u2019s Attorney for Dorchester County. It stated that the detainers were still pending, that he would be tried on the charges of breaking, entering and larceny, that \u201cyour friends Franklin Eugene Safrit and William Crouse Happel have been tried and both pleaded guilty,\u201d that \u201cwe recovered all evidence including the safe in Marshy Hope Creek and you will be tried on these charges.\u201d It asked, \u201cIn view of the information contained above, do you still want a speedy trial? If you do please advise us and we will have a preliminary hearing immediately.\u201d On 3 January 1968 the appellant replied to the letter. He said he was serving a 5 <em>y2 </em>year sentence, that he had been convicted of breaking and entering in Frederick and was awaiting sentencing, that \u201cin view of the time already given and with what I will get from Frederick I was hoping your office would see fit to drop your detainers.\u201d However, if he was to be tried he wanted a speedy trial and an attorney. Copies of the letters were admitted in evidence. He testified that when he first heard about the detainers the warden or superintendent did not inform him of \u201canything.\u201d He had never seen the detainer and specifically had not been told of his \u201cright to a speedy trial and what you had to do.\u201d As to the slip he received, \u201cthe inmates get hold of slips given out the same way, and they have a habit of typing on typewriters and putting different charges, and actually, I didn\u2019t know if this was official or not.\u201d On cross-examination it was elicited that an attorney had been appointed to represent him on 5 January 1968 apparently as a- result of his letter of 3 January 1968 and that the attorney had conferred with him at the penitentiary. On redirect examination he said he was prejudiced by the delay in trial \u201cbecause of the time that was involved.\u201d He wanted certain witnesses and \u201cthese witnesses scattered.\u201d The witnesses could have testified that after the commission of one of the crimes of which the appellant was charged one of the co-defendants told in their presence how he and the other co-defendant went to the back and \u201call the other stuff that is supposed to have happened\u201d and that the appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>laughed and said \u201cthis is one he got that I didn\u2019t get, and all of that stuff.\u201d Another witness would testify that Happel (at the time of the trial Happel had pled guilty to the crime) thought the appellant \u201chad snitched on him * * * and he would get even with me even if he had to come down here and plead guilty and say I was with him and implicate me and everything else.\u201d Two of the witnesses \u2014 the appellant\u2019s mother-in-law and Happel\u2019s girl friend \u2014 had \u201cdisappeared.\u201d He said he was also prejudiced by the detainers because he came up for parole in February 1968 and the Board asked him about the detainers. He felt it \u201chindered\u201d his parole. The State did not offer evidence. With regard to the Intrastate Detainer Act, defense counsel argued that the indictments should be dismissed because the warden had not given the appellant the required information concerning them and that he was prejudiced. The court said it was of the opinion \u201cwhen we consider all of these circumstances * * * that there has been no unreasonable delay which would prejudice the defendant and, that it would appear that the matter proceeded normally.\u201d It denied the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The evidence did not establish that the appellant made request for final disposition of the untried complaints within 30 days of notification of them. The Act was not available to the appellant for that reason. Even on an assumption that the letter of 15 September 1967 was such request, and that it was filed on time, it was not accompanied by a statement from the warden containing the information required by the Act. The Act was not available to the appellant for that reason. And even if the evidence before the court be considered as showing that the appellant was precluded from filing the request as required because the warden, although he had knowledge, did not inform the appellant of the source and contents of the untried complaints and of the appellant\u2019s right to request final disposition thereof,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> no relief was available to the appellant under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>the Act. And even had the evidence proved that the appellant made request as required but that the warden failed to deliver it, accompanied by the statement, to the appropriate State\u2019s attorney and the court, no relief was available to the appellant under the Act. In short, for reasons we have herein before stated, since it was not established that the appellant and the prison officials did all that they were called upon to do by the provisions of the Act, the Act was not invoked, no matter where the fault lay.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">On the issue that the appellant was not brought to trial within the time required by Md. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 616S, we find no error in the denial of the motion to dismiss the indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">\n<em>The Constitutional Aspects of the Delay in Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">The appellant was indicted on 16 January 1968 and went to trial on 7 March 1968. We think it obvious that the period between 16 January 1968 and 7 March 1968 was not a delay in the constitutional sense. See <em>Stevenson v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 1. The offenses alleged were committed on 12 November 1966. The Court of Appeals and this Court have held in cases where the contention of denial of a speedy trial stemmed from delay in indictment that the answer was that until the Grand Jury acted there was no case to be tried. <em>Montgomery v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 473, 479, and cases cited therein; <em>Falcon v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 467. The Grand Jury may act within the applicable period of limitations. <em>Osborne v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 161, 163. We said in <em>Montgomery, </em>at 480, that adhering to the rule that until a grand jury acts there is no case to be tried and thus there could be no denial of a speedy trial prior thereto, does not stand a defendant defenseless against unreasonable, oppressive and capricious delay on the part of the State in obtaining an indictment. We noted that a defendant, in appropriate circumstances, could invoke Md. Rule 709 and that a delay in obtaining an indictment may constitute denial of due process of law. In the circumstances of this case, we see no denial of due process of law by delay in indicting the appellant. Nor do we believe that any delay in the circumstances here was a consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>tutional denial of a speedy trial in any event. The essential ingredient of a speedy trial is not mere speed but orderly expedition. <em>Bryant v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 572; <em>Tillery v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 142; <em>Kelly v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 730. We cannot find from the evidence that the delay was purposeful or oppressive on the part of the State or that the appellant, having made demand for a speedy trial, but the delay being less than substantial, showed such strong possibility of prejudice as to compel dismissal of the indictments. <em>Stevenson v. State, supra. </em>See <em>Frazier v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 88; <em>Johnson v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">On the issue that the appellant was not brought to trial within the constitutional guarantees of a speedy trial, we find no error in the motion to dismiss the indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">\n<em>CORROBORATION OF THE ACCOMPLICE'S TESTIMONY</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">The appellant was convicted of breaking with intent to steal goods of the value of $100 and upwards, from the storehouse of Parker\u2019s Inc., the storehouse of Fleetwood &amp; Wilson Company and the storehouse of Maryland National Bank, each located in Hurlock, Maryland. He was also convicted of grand larceny of goods of the Maryland National Bank. All the offenses were alleged to have been committed on 12 November 1966. On appeal the appellant does not contest the proof of the <em>corpus delicti </em>of the crimes and he concedes that the testimony of the accomplice, William Crause Happel, as to his criminal agency was corroborated as to the breaking of the Maryland National Bank and the larceny of its goods. But he claims that there was no corroboration of Happel\u2019s testimony as to his participation in the other two storehoitse breakings. Happel testified that for several weeks prior to 12 November the appellant rented a room in Happel\u2019s mother\u2019s house in Baltimore. The appellant made two telephone calls to Dorchester County \u201cin an effort to locate Mr. Eugene Safrit,\u201d the last one on 10 or 11 November. Happel and the appellant went to Safrit\u2019s home, arriving about 9:00 or 10:00 P.M. on 11 November. The next night Safrit drove them to the Maryland National Bank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>in Hurlock and Happel and the appellant broke into the bank and stole a small safe which they put in the car driven by Safrit. They drove to \u201csomebody\u2019s chicken house,\u201d broke open the safe, took money out of it, put the money \u201cinto a suitcase like bag,\u201d put the safe back in the car, drove to a bridge, threw the safe over the side and drove back to Safrit\u2019s house. (The safe was subsequently recovered by the police. Over $300 was taken from it.) \u201cWe drove around a couple of times and we went to the oil company and to another company \u2014 some kind of Western Union, and then we went back to Eugene\u2019s house.\u201d He said the appellant went back to Baltimore that night. Asked further about the other places they went, Happel said, \u201cWe went to some sort of a small company. I don\u2019t know what it was. It had a Western Union sign hanging in front of it. I believe it was a hardware. * * * We went into there, and after-wards \u2014 there was nothing in there, it was a disappointment because nothing was gotten there. We went to an oil company and tried to open the safe in the oil company which was unsuccessful also.\u201d The safe in the \u201cother place was open * * * it had a note on there, said the safe was open.\u201d Safrit gave them their share of the loot from the bank at his house \u2014 it was a change safe but Safrit gave them their share in bills \u201cinstead of having us carry the change because of this money was in change.\u201d Happel did not further identify the \u201coil company\u201d or the other company they broke into. The testimony of Safrit\u2019s wife placed the appellant in the company of Happel and her husband immediately before the commission of the crimes and immediately after. Her diary, placed in evidence, showed under date of 10 November 1966 that \u201cNigro King,\u201d identified by her as the appellant, called. Under 11 November the diary read, \u201ccompany here.\u201d She indicated the \u201ccompany\u201d was King and Happel. \u201cThey stayed all day and up until about 4:00 or 5 o\u2019clock the next morning.\u201d She identified as hers a bottle in which Happel said Safrit put the change from the bank safe. She identified a picture of the Safrit car and said that \u201cthe safe they had broke the upholstery on the door.\u201d On cross-examination she said about 3:00 or 4:00 A.M. she heard \u201cthis rumble in the driveway and I looked out the window and I seen Mr. King \u2014 that man there (indicating the appellant) take a weird <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>looking suitcase out of the back of our car and transfer it into his, which he had was an old jalopy which had temporary tags on it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">This testimony of Mrs. Safrit tended to show that the appellant was identified with the perpetrators of the crimes and corroborated the accomplice\u2019s testimony within the meaning of the rule requiring corroboration. <em>Boone v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 11, 19-20. The <em>corpus delicti </em>of each of the crimes was proved and Happel\u2019s corroborated testimony clearly showed the criminal agency of each of Happel, the appellant and Safrit as to the breaking of the Maryland National Bank and the larceny of its safe containing more than $100. The question as to the breaking of Parker\u2019s Inc. and Fleetwood &amp; Wilson Company, however, is not as the appellant presents it. It is not a question of whether Happel\u2019s testimony was corroborated (we think that it was by the testimony of Mrs. Safrit) but a question of whether Happel\u2019s testimony or other evidence proved that the appellant committed the breaking of the storehouse of Parker\u2019s Inc. and Fleetwood &amp; Wilson Company even though there was evidence that those storehouses had been broken on 12 November. Happel testified that after stealing the safe from the bank they went to \u201cthe oil company\u201d and to \u201canother company \u2014 some kind of Western Union * * * we went to some sort of a small company. I don\u2019t know what it was. It had a Western Union sign hanging in front of it. I believe it was a hardware.\u201d He said we \u201ctried to open the safe in the oil company which was unsuccessful.\u201d The safe in \u201cthe other place\u201d was open\u2014 \u201cit had a note on there, said the safe was open.\u201d There is nothing in this testimony to establish that \u201cthe oil company\u201d and the other company was Fleetwood &amp; Wilson and Parker\u2019s. Sergeant Emil Meyers of the Maryland State Police, testifying for the State, gave the substance of an oral statement made by the appellant, which the lower court, after receiving evidence out of the presence of the jury, determined preliminarily to have been freely and voluntarily made. The appellant told the police about the breaking of the Maryland National Bank and the larceny of the safe.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The sergeant then said, \u201cHe also mentioned that they had pulled two other jobs right in the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>town. One of them he knew and, I think it was at my naming of the Pure Oil Company. The other building he didn\u2019t know what it was, but it was a building within the area of Hurlock.\u201d The sergeant further testified that he was \u201cin on the investigation\u201d of the \u201cParker Implement Company\u201d job and \u201cin on the one on Fleetwood and Wilson\u201d job. He said, \u201cThe Parker Implement Company was broken into through a side rear door. The side rear door would be facing the center of Hurlock and this is the method of entry in that establishment.\u201d It was a \u201cforceful entry.\u201d As to Fleetwood &amp; Wilson, \u201centry was made through a front door * * * It was forced and there were markings on the door.\u201d The sheriff of Dorchester County (he was chief deputy sheriff on 12 November 1966) said he knew of the breaking that occurred at \u201cParker Implement Company.\u201d Asked what type of business that company operated, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s International Harvester, farm implements.\u201d He also knew of the breaking in the \u201cFleetwood and Wilson Oil Company in Hurlock.\u201d Eugene Safrit was a witness on behalf of the defense. He testified as to the Maryland National Bank breaking and larceny but did not mention the other two crimes on direct examination and was not asked about them on cross-examination. We think that the lower court erred in denying motions for judgment of acquittal, made at the close of all the evidence, as to the indictments charging the breaking of the storehouse of Parker\u2019s Inc. and the storehouse of Fleetwood &amp; Wilson Company. We feel that the evidence before the court did not show directly nor did it support a rational inference of the fact that it was the storehouse of Parker\u2019s Inc. and the storehouse of Fleetwood and Wilson Company that were broken from which the jury could fairly be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the appellant\u2019s guilt as charged. See <em>Williams v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 450. There was nothing in Happel\u2019s testimony to show that Fleetwood &amp; Wilson was the \u201coil company,\u201d the storehouse of which he said the appellant broke or that the other storehouse was that of Parker\u2019s Inc. Although the appellant told the police sergeant they had pulled two other jobs in addition to the bank, and knew one building, \u201cThe Pure Oil Company,\u201d he did not know the other building. There was no evidence .to show that \u201cThe Pure Oil Company\u201d re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>ferred to \u201cat the naming\u201d hy the sergeant was Fleet-wood &amp; Wilson and even though the sheriff referred to the \u201cFleetwood and Wilson Oil Company\u201d there is no showing that this was the oil company designated by Happel or the appellant. There was no evidence that Parker\u2019s Inc. had a Western Union sign in the front or that it was a hardware store as described by Happel. The sheriff described it as \u201cInternational Harvester \u2014 farm implements\u201d which did not identify it as the building referred to by Happel or the appellant. Neither Happel nor the appellant described how the storehouses they entered were broken and the testimony by the sergeant and the sheriff as to how entry was gained to the storehouses of Fleet-wood &amp; Wilson and Parker\u2019s did not identify them as the buildings referred to by Happel and the appellant. There was no evidence that it was the safe in Fleetwood &amp; Wilson\u2019s storehouse which had been left open with a note therein so stating or that the safe in Parker\u2019s showed that an unsuccessful attempt had been made to force it open so as to identify those establishments as the ones to which the accomplice and the appellant referred. Other than being in Hurlock, the location of the storehouses was not determined. Safrit did not mention the \u201cother jobs\u201d and no official or employer of Fleetwood &amp; Wilson or Parker\u2019s testified. It may well be that the breakings of the storehouses of Fleetwood &amp; Wilson Company and Parker\u2019s Inc. were committed by the appellant, but we do not believe that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to be so fairly convinced beyond a reasonable doubt. We find that the lower court erred in denying the motions for judgment of acquittal as to indictments Nos. 2183 and 2185.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">\n<em>THE STATEMENT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">The appellant contends that the oral statement made by him was improperly admitted in evidence. He does not claim that the statement was obtained by threat, promise or inducement but that there was not complete compliance with the procedural requirements of <em>Miranda v. </em>Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, and in particular that he was not advised that he had a right to have counsel present at all times during the questioning and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>State did not show that he waived his rights. This contention assumes that the challenged statement was obtained by a custodial interrogation within the meaning of <em>Miranda; </em>we do not think that it was so obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Sergeant Meyers testified that shortly before 16 June 1967 he received an order from the Waterloo Barracks of the Maryland State Police to go to the House of Correction. A prisoner named Robert King \u201crequested to talk to a trooper from the eastern shore.\u201d On 16 June he went to the institution and saw the appellant. They were escorted to a private room, the Sergeant identified himself and told the appellant he was there in response to his request to see a trooper. The Sergeant did not know who the appellant was and did not know what the appellant wanted to talk about. The appellant told him \u201che wanted to clear up what cases he was involved in on the eastern shore and that he was willing to tell me all about them.\u201d The Sergeant thought it was his duty to inform the appellant of his constitutional rights at this point and gave him the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The appellant \u201csmiled and indicated he knew all this.\u201d He \u201cthen proceeded in narrative form to tell about the storehouse breakings in Hurlock on 12 November 1966.\u201d The appellant testified that Meyers told him he had received word that the appellant wanted to talk to the Maryland State Police. \u201cAnd when he introduced himself he said he was from down here (the eastern shore), and I went ahead and told him I was talking about the Maryland State Police that could handle all these charges pending in all the counties.\u201d The Sergeant said that he could not help him \u201cabout all the counties.\u201d The \u201cconstitutional rights came up\u201d and the Sergeant said, \u201cYou know all that stuff * * * You know what your constitutional rights are * * * No need of me going into all of that.\u201d The appellant then \u201chad a conversation\u201d with the Sergeant about the charges on the eastern shore. In rebuttal the Sergeant denied the appellant\u2019s version regarding the constitutional rights and said that he \u201cwent over each of these points (the <em>Miranda </em>warnings) precisely\u201d and repeated in detail the warnings given.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The Sergeant, out of an abundance of caution, followed the <em>Miranda </em>procedures, but we do not think it was necessary in the circumstances. Even though the appellant was \u201cin custody\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>by reason of his incarceration for an unrelated offense we do not believe that the challenged statement was obtained under circumstances likely to affect substantially the appellant\u2019s will to resist and compelled him to speak where he would not otherwise have done so freely. See <em>People v. Rodney P., </em>233 N.E.2d 255, 286 N.Y.S.2d 225. The dangers <em>Miranda </em>intended to guard against were here not present. We do not think that the appellant was \u201cswept from familiar surroundings into police custody, surrounded by antagonistic forces, and subjected to * * * techniques of persuasion.\u201d <em>(Miranda </em>at p. 461). Rather the lower court here could have properly found from the evidence that the appellant was confronted by the police at his request, that he talked without being subjected to questioning and that he made the statement willingly and without persuasion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus the statement was not obtained by a \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d within the <em>Miranda </em>concept. See <em>Gaudio and Bucci v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 455. The statement being otherwise free and voluntary, it was admissible. The giving of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings was more than that to which the appellant was entitled, and any defect in them, if there was any defect, was immaterial. We find no error in the admission of the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">\n<em>THE REQUEST TO DISMISS COUNSEL</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AWS\">On the morning of the second day of trial the appellant requested a conference, out of the presence of the jury, with the judge, defense counsel and the State\u2019s Attorney. Those persons conferred in the judge\u2019s chambers in the presence of the sheriff. The appellant wanted his appointed counsel dismissed because \u201cI don\u2019t feel that I am being represented by the rights.\u201d He complained that counsel had not cross-examined Mrs. Safrit \u201cthe way he should\u201d although he also said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to tell the truth about the things \u2014 I\u2019m afraid of getting Mrs. Safrit in trouble.\u201d He suggested that Franklin Eugene Safrit, a co-defendant, already convicted and serving a sentence, and who was to testify for the State, had been represented by his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>counsel,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> but counsel made clear that he had brought this to the appellant\u2019s attention about the middle of January and had asked the appellant \u201cif you were satisfied that I could handle your case even though you knew that I had represented Safrit at his guilty plea\u201d and had received no indication from the appellant that he did not desire counsel to continue to represent him. He said that the motion to dismiss the indictments had not included as a ground that copies had not been given him but the docket entries read, \u201cCopies issued in duplicate, with copy of Indictment and True Bill for the Defendant.\u201d And the court said that it would \u201centertain it now as a separate ground as a motion to dismiss\u201d and overruled it. The appellant raised other matters with regard to the conduct of the proceedings which he alleged denied him a fair trial which the court deemed to be without substance and we agree. It was the opinion of the court that the appellant\u2019s counsel was \u201centirely competent and has represented you adequately so far.\u201d We see nothing in the record\u2019 to indicate otherwise and find no error in the denial of the request to dismiss defense counsel in the middle of the trial. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">\n<em>As to No. 2184 criminal law: judgments affirmed; as to each of No. 2183 and No. 2185 criminal law: judgment reversed and remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b678-9\">.
