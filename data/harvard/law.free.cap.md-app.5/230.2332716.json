Perrott presiding. He was sentenced to a term of 20 years on the assault with intent to rape charge and to a consecutive term of 15 years on the assault with intent to murder charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">There was evidence from which the jury could find: On Sunday, September 18, 1966, at approximately 5 :00 P.M., Harding 'met Mildred Coley, the prosecuting witness, in a bar in Baltimore City. Subsequently, they joined Barbara Miles and Robert Dee Sanders, and all four of them drank and rode around the city in Sanders\u2019 car until approximately 8:30 P.M. when they left to go to Howard County. Mildred Coley was not previously acquainted with any of the other three persons. En route to and in Howard County, they made several stops. Mildred sat in the front seat of the car with Barbara and Sanders, while Harding sat in the back seat alone. Harding became angry and argued with Mildred because of her refusal to sit in the back seat with him and her refusal to have sexual relations with him. Eventually, Harding told Mildred he had a gun and he was going to have sexual relations with her before she left the car. Mildred told Harding that \u201cIf you put your damn hands on me, I\u2019m going to cut you.\u201d After making this statement, Mildred opened her purse to get a face sponge, and when she turned in the direction of Harding, he shot her. She had no weapons. After the shooting Sanders wanted to call the rescue squad or take Mildred to the hospital; however, Harding, with gun in hand, ordered him to drive to Mayfield Avenue, a back road in an isolated area of Howard County. Harding removed Mildred, who was unconscious and presumed dead, and placed her on the side of the road. After returning to the car, Harding directed Sanders to drive to Club Vegas near Fort Meade, and then to Club 1630. At this club, Harding met his brother, Charles B. Harding. Barbara, who lived in Baltimore, left the club with some friends, while Sanders and Harding left together. Sanders drove Harding home and was followed by Harding\u2019s brother in his station wagon. When Sanders left he observed Harding get into his brother\u2019s station wagon.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>On Monday, September 19, 1966, at approximately 7:15 A. M. State Trooper William J. Foxwell, in response to a complaint, found Mildred lying four or five feet off the traveled portion of Meadow Ridge Road in Howard County, which was two or three miles from the spot where she had been placed after being shot. She was in a state of shock, wearing only a black dress, with her undergarments beside her. She was taken to St. Agnes Hospital where an emergency operation was performed on her chest. Further examination disclosed spermatozoa in her vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Initially, Mildred was questioned by Trooper William George who testified as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">\u201cQ. You said that the first time you interviewed the victim she indicated she had been raped by whom ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">\u201cA. She told me three colored males. She had been abducted from Baltimore City at knife point, taken into the County, raped and stabbed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-8\">\u201cQ. Now, the second time you visited her in the hospital you inquired of her again, and what did she tell you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-9\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Essentially \u2014 Well, by this time we knew she hadn\u2019t been stabbed. In fact, she had been shot. During both of these periods she appeared to be in shock or going into shock. Both of these times were before she was operated on and only an Emergency Room type investigation of her wounds had been made. On the second occasion, after receiving the description of the car and knowing this person Robert Lee Sanders, a picture of him was taken and shown to her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-10\">\u201cQ. Then what did you do ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-11\">\u201cA. After she positively identified this picture, then Robert Lee Sanders was' later in the afternoon arrested and taken to the Barracks for investigation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-12\">!|s *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-13\">\u201cQ. You said then you visited the victim a third time and the third time the situation changed again. What happened there ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-14\">\u201cA. At this particular time, which happened to be on 9/21 at two p.m., she was visited in the Intensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Care Unit of St. Agnes Hospital and talked to thoroughly, and it appeared evident that this girl could not remember certain parts of what had happened to her. She would take us all the way up to the point where she had been shot. She would go on to the point where she was put out of the car and then she told me she couldn\u2019t remember anything. Her mind had cleared to the point where she knew who had shot her. She knew who was with her and she knew the complete description of the automobile.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">On October 12, 1966, upon being released from the hospital, Mildred was taken to the Waterloo Police Barracks where she was put under hypnosis by Ralph P. Oropolo, Chief Clinical Psychologist at Clifton T. Perkins State Hospital. While under hypnosis, and without prompting, Mildred was able to recall events that had occurred after she was shot. On the witness stand she testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">\u201cQ. Do you recall anything that was said to you while you were under hypnosis ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Anything was said to me? Yes, when I was yes. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-9\">\u201cQ. When you were hypnotized, you recall what was said to you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-10\"><em>\u201cA. </em>What had really, what had blanked out in my mind all came back to me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-11\">;{C \u00ed|&lt; j}S</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-12\">\u201cQ. Then when you awakened from this sleep they told you what you had said while you were asleep ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-13\">\u201cA. No, I told them what happened after I woke up. I was awake.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-14\">* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-15\">\u201cQ. Did anybody talk to you when you awakened from this trance ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-16\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-17\">\u201cQ. Who?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-18\">\u201cA. Trooper George.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-19\">\u201cQ. What did he say to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-20\"><em>\u201cA. </em>He asked me how was I feeling. He say \u2018How <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>does it feel to be hypnotized?\u2019, and 1 told him it was a nice sleep.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-5\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>What else did he say ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>He asked me questions what happened between Harding and I and I could answer them then, things I couldn\u2019t answer before. It all came back to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">\u201cQ. Were you told what happened and then it came back to you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">\u201cA. No, I wasn\u2019t told what happened and it came back to me. When I was asleep it all came back to me and I told them what happened when I wTas awake.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">In addition, she identified Harding as the person who shot her, and she also testified that while she was lying on the side of the road, she saw a vehicle approaching which looked like a bread truck or station wagon. The vehicle stopped and Harding picked her up and threw her into the back of the vehicle and drove off. On arrival at another location, he threw her on the ground between an old house and a tree. He then unzippered her dress as she passed out. When she regained consciousness, she noticed that all of her clothes had been removed except her dress, that she tried to stand but was too weak, so she dragged her clothes with her and scrambled to the highway. Mildred also testified that when she regained consciousness, she \u201crealized that he had sex with me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">Harding did not testify. His brother admitted that he had a station wagon and was at Club 1630 where he saw Harding on the night in question but denied that Harding used his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">Harding contends that the testimony of Ralph P. Oropolo, the psychologist, and the testimony of Mildred Coley with respect to the assault with intent to rape were not admissible; and the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction for this crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">The objection concerning the testimony of Oropolo was as to his qualifications. The record discloses that he has a Master\u2019s Degree in Psychology and has pursued work on his doctorate. He is Chief Clinical Psychologist at Clifton T. Perkins State Hospital and a lecturer at the Institute of Correctional Administration, American University, Washington, D. C. He was for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>merly staff psychologist at Crownsville State Hospital and has been employed as a consulting psychologist by .several law enforcement agencies and state\u2019s attorneys\u2019 offices in Maryland and other states. In addition, he has qualified to testify in court as an expert in the field of psychology in Baltimore City and several counties in Maryland. In his training and education as a psychologist, he was familiarized with hypnosis or<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> hypnotherapy as a form of treatment. The record further disclosed that hypnosis is used as an analytical tool and technique by psychologists and the medical profession, as a form of therapy, and as a means of assisting patients to recover lost memory. During the past four years, Oropolo has used the technique of hypnosis, and he has also used hypnosis under circumstances similar to those in the case at bar. Harding\u2019s objections to the qualifications are based primarily on the fact that Mr. Oropolo did not graduate from any school of hypnotism. The Court of Appeals in the case of <em>Hewitt v. Maryland State Board of Censors, </em>243 Md. 574, 221 A. 2d 894 held that the admission of expert testimony is primarily a matter for the trial judge to decide. But the opinion makes clear that formal training is unnecessary so long as the record demonstrates that he is possessed \u201cof any knowledge or information which would elevate his opinion above the level of conjecture or personal reaction,\u201d <em>Hewitt, supra </em>at 221 A. 2d 902. The formal training in hypnosis which was provided in Mr. Oropolo\u2019s education as a psychologist and his use of hypnosis for four years indicates to us that the trial judge quite properly admitted his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The admissibility of Mildred Coley\u2019s testimony concerning the assault with intent to rape case causes no difficulty. On the witness stand she recited the facts and stated that she was doing so from her own recollection. The fact that she had told different stories or had achieved her present knowledge after being hypnotized concerns the question of the weight of the evidence which the trier of facts, in this case the jury, must decide. <em>Borman v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 276, 229 A. 2d 440, <em>Carroll v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 50, 237 A. 2d 535, <em>Thompson v. State, 4 </em>Md. App. 31, 240 A. 2d 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The sufficiency of her evidence to support the verdict re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>quires more elaborate discussion. We will begin by quoting extensively from the testimony of the psychologist.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Mr. Oropolo, 1 wonder if I could ask you to step down to this blackboard and illustrate to the Jury exactly what you accomplish by hypnosis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">\u201cA. Hypnosis is really \u2014 takes no great feat. Essentially anyone can do it, despite what appears to be a very mysterious kind of process. All that is involved in inducing a person into hypnosis is a very boring voice and monotonous repetition of words. Any of us can do it. The other thing that is necessary is a certain amount of willingness on the part of the individual, because hypnosis is essentially a very conscious type activity because you are asking the individual to focus on something or asking an individual to listen to something, and if he doesn\u2019t want to, he can look some place else and intentionally distract himself. So, a great amount of willingness is necessary on the part of the individual being hypnotized, so you don\u2019t have somebody under your power, so to speak. This is not quite accurate and you do require a certain amount of conscious participation by the individual. What happens in hypnosis, or what is involved, you are reducing a certain amount of consciousness. For instance, all of you see everything going on in here, but there are different degrees of things you are consciously aware of. Because I am speaking and standing here, you are more conscious of me than other people in the courtroom. There are levels of consciousness with respect to certain things in particular areas. In hypnosis what we try to do is try to reduce the number of things that distract a person and try to get the person to focus on a certain thing. In this way more details can be impressed upon the person. For instance, if T were to direct your attention to the blackboard and you are reducing your consciousness of me even more so and I would ask you to give the details of this blackboard, you could do it fairly well. If I didn\u2019t direct your attention to the blackboard, the amount of details would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>be somewhat reduced. In a sense you might say you are sort of hypnotized there. Because of focusing you are reducing your external or outward stimulations. We get an individual to focus all his stimulus on an object, neutral, that has no consequence as a means of reducing or removing consciousness or awareness of other things. What I usually do, the instrument I use is just a thumbtack pinned into a wall, that is shiny, or I may use a spiral type thing, something like this. This is what the novice uses, but the essential element is that the person is able to focus on a relatively neutral object for the purpose of reducing all outward influences. The reason for this is in recovering memory what happens is \u2014 let\u2019s kind of try to divide the mind something like this: this being the conscious part. What I mean by conscious, this is the part that makes us aware of who we are, of the courtroom of people. These are all various stimulations that come in from without and you are consciously aware of it. There may be other material that will come through, but go down here. Might say this is sort of unconscious, wherein we can\u2019t really deprive the stimulation from coming through. We can refuse to acknowledge it and its presence here because it is rather painful to us, rather traumatic to us, what have you, but we cannot prevent it from coming in but prevent it from acknowledgment. You might be in a social setting with maybe three or four people on a walk. There is somebody you dislike a great deal. You can\u2019t refuse to let him be present but you can refuse to talk to him. You are refusing his physical presence. The same thing happens essentially with respect to certain stimuli or certain things that occur to us. We cannot prevent them from occurring but we can refuse to acknowledge. That goes through this area of consciousness and gets hurried down here in the unconscious. You might regard it as a basement; everything gets thrown down there you don\u2019t want. By hypnosis, by compelling a person to focus on one stimulus what you essen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>tially do is his area of consciousness becomes limited. So, the only thing the person is conscious of is this one stimulus, the thumbtack in the wall, or the spiral or the clinician\u2019s phrase telling him you are getting tired, getting sleepy, all this other stuff is kind of eliminated. With the elimination of all this extraneous material you can help the patient to focus their stimulus on occurrences or events that went right through and as a result of reducing the conscious influence which kind of acts as a distraction, this barrier a little bit, so now you don\u2019t have all this conscious stuff acting as a conscious influence and reinforces the barrier between the conscious and the unconscious. You leave the mind fairly clear to focus on this one subject and as a result quite frequently you can have the subject come back into conscious awareness. Whether you can do this or not depends how far down the material is, how long ago it happened, so forth, by the determination the material the conscious did not want to acknowledge, although it occurred, to come back into acknowledgment, into awareness. This is essentially what happens on hypnosis, theoretically.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">\u201cQ. Mr. Oropollo, [sic] when you bring this information from the subconscious to the conscious level of the mind through hypnosis, is the revelation of that information reliable ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">\u201cA. It depends what the information is. If it is something that again involved a personal or vital interest to the individual, it may not be. What I mean by personal and vital; let me give an example. Let\u2019s say you have an individual who is, has very, very strong homosexual tendencies or let\u2019s say he is a homosexual and consciously denied it. If you put him under hypnosis and try to elicit this kind of admission from him, there is a good possibility, or to have him act it out, there is a good possibility he may say he is not or he doesn\u2019t do it or what have you. Again, depends on what is of vital interest to the individual or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>what emotional or psychological danger it would submit him to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">\u201cQ. Is a person under the hypnotic influence of the clinical subject to suggestion by him of answers or stories to questions that he might ask him ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>In my own experience I seriously doubt suggestibility in the way we think of, in that you have an influence and the person subjects himself to your influence. The person, is suggestible to the extent that the condition or the subject that it allows him to discuss this thing or act out this thing or behave this way, but in a way it is no more suggestible than I ask you to hand me that paper you will willingly do it. To that extent you are suggestible. I ask you to do something and you do it. There is no threat and you give it. Under hypnosis to this extent there is suggestibility and I have tried in working with some individuals and also criminal cases where I would purposely try to assure reliability of the individual by maybe suggesting something and asking them if this is correct and they would still stick to their initial statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>I direct your attention to October 12, 1966, and I ask you on that date did you have occasion to contact one Mildred Hortense Coley ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-9\">\u201cQ. And under what circumstances did you meet Miss Coley and where was it ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-10\"><em>\u201cA. </em>The State Police called me and asked me if I would come over there, or they told me they had an individual who had been the victim of some criminal act and that she was having a difficult time or could not recall events that occurred or circumstances under which these events occurred, and asked me if I would come over there and give any assistance I could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-11\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>And upon your arrival what did you do ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-12\">\u201cA. Upon my arrival I was familiarized with more details of the situation and I met the young lady and explained to her what I was going to do to help her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>get her memory back, whatever memory she may have lost as a result of trauma of the incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-5\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>You say you were filled in on the background by the police and you informed her what you intended to do and the purpose of it. Then what mechanics did you utilize in order to effect what you were about to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I used a thumbtack, the sort that has a shiny head. There is a blank wall and T just pinned the thumbtack in and asked her to concentrate, focus her eyes on the thumbtack and listen to my voice and the voice might make her simply just relax, relax, relax, you are getting very tired; very monotonous and repetitive manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\">\u201cQ. In this manner were you able to put her into some sort of trance state ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>She was under hypnosis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-9\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>What happened as a result of what you did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-10\">\u201cA. Well, she went into a reduced state of consciousness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-11\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>And what did you do ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-12\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Then I recalled the date in question and simply asked her to tell me everything that happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-13\">\u201cQ. Was she able to tell you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-14\">\u201cA. Yes. She was able to relate everything that occurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-15\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-16\">\u201cQ. You put her into this state of reduced consciousness and she told you her story. Then what did you do ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-17\"><em>\u201cA. </em>When she got into the state of reduced consciousness, then I \u2014 then two of the State Troopers came in. I asked two State Troopers to come in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-18\">\u201cQ. Do you know who they were ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-19\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I believe Sergeant Greffen and I believe Trooper George.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-20\">\u201cQ. What participation did they take in what you were doing ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number><em>\u201cA. </em>I just wanted them simply as witnesses since they were interested in it, and I was disinterested. I believe they recorded everything that she said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">\u201cQ. They recorded it, you say ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I believe so. Tape recorder; I\u2019m not sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Then what did you do ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Well, after I was finished I gave her the suggestion that when she would awaken she would relate that which she related under the state of reduced consciousness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-9\">\u201cQ. You say you gave her a suggestion. What do you mean by that ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-10\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I simply told her that when she would awaken she would recount the same thing that she recounted under the state of reduced consciousness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-11\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Was she able to do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-12\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-13\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>And was her ability to recall the result of your suggestion that she would ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-14\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I don\u2019t understand the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-15\">\u201cQ. You say you suggested that she could recall what she had told you while under hypnosis ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-16\">\u201cA. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-17\">\u201cQ. And that after this suggestion she was awakened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-18\">\u201cA. Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-19\">\u201cQ. And then she recalled what she had said while under hypnosis ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-20\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, in its entirety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-21\">\u201cQ. When she recalled this the second time after you awakened her, was she still under hypnosis ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-22\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-23\">\u201cQ. Was this recollection a result of the suggestion you made to her ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-24\">\u201cA. Yes, in that it was in a situation that provided her to want to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-25\">\u201cQ. You said your questioning took the form\u2014 you reminded her, brought her attention to the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>you were discussing. What form did the questioning take thereafter ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">\u201cA. Here is how I started out. I told her I\u2019m going to ask you to tell me everything that happened, or I recall something, I don\u2019t recall, tell me everything that happened on June 26th, whatever it was, and she went on and recounted, and as her \u2014 I would occasionally say, and tell me what else, what else happened, and this is essentially the form of the questioning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">\u201cQ. At any time during your hypnosis of her did you suggest any answers to any questions ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">\u201cA. No, I never do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">\u201cQ. Did you relate any stories that you thought would be likely ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-9\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-10\">\u201cQ. Did the policemen participate in any way by suggesting any answers to her ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-11\">\u201cA. No. I never permit this.

If she wanted to lie, she certainly could have given a statement without any difficulty, which she was unable to do. Secondly, there was some corroborative material within her statement that would indicate some of the things occurred, not occurred, but some of the things she had seen, she could have only seen if she had been there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">\u201cQ.

No witness testified as to what she said during or after the hypnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">The trial judge gave a precautionary instruction to the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-11\">\u201cYou have heard, during this trial, that a portion of the testimony of the prosecuting witness, Mrs. Coley, was recalled by her as a result of her being placed under hypnosis. The phenomenon commonly known as hypnosis has been explained to you during this trial. I advise you to weigh'this testimony carefully. Do not place any greater weight on this portion of Mrs. Coley\u2019s testimony than on any other testimony that you have heard during this trial. Remember, you are the judges of the weight and the believability of all of the evidence in this case.\u201d ' :</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aa3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Although several courts <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the United States have considered the question of hypnosis only one seems to be particularly apropos to our question here.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">In <em>Austin v. </em>Barker, 85 N. Y. S. 465 (Sup. Ct. App. Div. 4th Dept.), a civil action for seduction of the plaintiff\u2019s daughter, the court reversed and remanded the case for a new trial. The sole evidence of the defendant\u2019s involvement was given by the daughter. She stated that she did not remember having had intercourse with anyone until some weeks after she delivered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>a normal healthy child. At this time, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney visited her and so influenced and awakened her mind that she recalled that the defendant on several occasions had placed her under hypnosis and had intercourse with her. These events occurred in a room in her father\u2019s house while one or both of her parents were seated in an adjoining room. The New York court required that on the remand the plaintiff be required to produce evidence of what actually happened to restore the daughter\u2019s memory and evidence tending to establish the probability or possibility of the existence of. the fact that her memory of intercourse could have been blurred by hypnosis and could have been restored by hypnosis. After the case was retried the same court in <em>Austin v. </em>Barker, 96 N. Y. S. 814 (1906) again reversed the conviction because of the failure of the plaintiff to produce evidence as to what actually happened at the time the witness\u2019 memory was restored and because two medical doctors indicated skepticism that she could have been made to forget her acts of intercourse particularly since she stated that the first of them was the first intercourse she had experienced.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">In the present appeal as in <em>Austin v. Barker, supra, </em>the witness testified that at the time she was on the stand she remembered the incident she was describing, but in addition to that we have the testimony of the operator who gave a detailed description of what happened at the time hypnosis was induced which showed that there were no improper suggestions made. Further he gave his opinion as a trained and experienced psychologist that in this particular incident there was no reason to doubt the accuracy of the witness\u2019 recollections. In addition modern medical science has now recognized the possibility that memory of painful events can sometimes be restored by hypnosis, although some authorities warn that fancy can be mingled with fact in some cases. Noyes &amp; Klob, <em>Modern Clinical Psychiatry </em>513 (1963) ; <em>American Handbook of Psychiatry </em>Ch. 73 \u201cHypnotherapy\u201d by Lewis R. Wolberg (Arieti ed. 1959); <em>Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry </em>\u00a7 34.34 \u201cHypnosis: An Adjunct to Psychotherapy\u201d by Herbert Spiegel (Freedman &amp; Caplan eds. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">We hold that on the facts of this case the testimony of Mildred Coley was sufficient to support a jury\u2019s verdict that Hard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>ing was guilty of the crime of attempted rape. In so holding we go no further than is required by those facts. The following evidence was adduced:</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">(1) the hypnosis procedure was fully exposed in the evi-dence; (2) the man who induced the hypnosis was a profes-sional psychologist and gave his opinion that there was no rea-son to doubt the truth of the witness\u2019 statement; (3) there was sufficient corroboration of the witness\u2019 testimony: (a) male sperm was found in the victim\u2019s vagina, (b) the accused was one of two males shown to have known where the victim could have been found when the crime was committed, (c) the ac-cused was seen in a station wagon immediately prior to the time the crime was committed. In addition, a precautionary instruction was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Finally Harding contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction of assault with intent to murder. The record shows that Harding shot the victim in the chest, placed her on an abandoned road in an isolated area and prevented others from assisting her. It is difficult to imagine a stronger case, but may be well noted that specific intent to kill is not a necessary element for a conviction of assault with intent to murder. An intent to commit grievous bodily harm is sufficient, <em>McLadden v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 725, 237 A. 2d 93, <em>Lawrence v. </em>State, 2 Md.
