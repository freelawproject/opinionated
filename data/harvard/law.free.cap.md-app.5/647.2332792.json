He contends on this appeal that the State failed to prove the <em>corpus delicti </em>and that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">The pertinent facts disclosed by the record are these: Beverly James, appellant\u2019s wife and the mother of twenty-two month old Tracey James, the infant victim, was called as a witness on behalf of the State and compelled to testify against her husband.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She testified that she had been married to appellant for seven months and that they had been living together with Tracey and their three other children, ages 3, 4, and 5; that on January 25, 1968, appellant had returned home from work at approximately 4:30 p.m.; that Tracey was playing with their other children when, at about 7:00 p.m., she left the children in her husband\u2019s care so that she could go to the doctor; that when she left home Tracey\u2019s body was free of any bruises; that when she returned at about 11:00 p.m. Tracey \u201cwas standing up like she had been crying\u201d and \u201cshe had wet and she had vomit in the bed\u201d; that she did not examine Tracey that night but the following day she noticed some \u201cfingernail marks\u201d on both Tracey\u2019s arms which she treated with vaseline; and that on the following day, January 27, Tracey would not eat, and when she went to hold her hands in order to feed her, \u201cshe started crying like they [her hands] were hurting, and she had these bruises on her arms,\u201d so she took Tracey to Maryland University Hospital to be examined. Mrs. James further testified that between January 25 and January 27, 1968, all her children had remained at home and that neither she nor any of her children had struck Tracey. On cross-examination <em>she </em>admitted that several months previous to that January her oldest child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>had opened a locked cellar door, and their four-year old child fell down the cellar stairway.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">The University Hospital records were received in evidence and showed that Tracey James was examined on January 27, 1968; that the physicians\u2019 findings, as set forth in the hospital record, indicated that Tracey had \u201cmultiple abrasions and contusions over her entire body\u201d; that she had \u201cobvious gross injuries of physical trauma * * * with multiple abrasions, old and new on forehead * * *, abrasions over lower thorax posterior, and multiple areas of point tenderness of arm and forearm\u201d; that the roentgen examination revealed \u201c[e]vidence of a complete transverse fracture of the distal end of the right radius * * * [and] questionable fracture of the ossified, capitellum of the right elbow,\u201d and \u201c[e]vidence of a complete transverse fracture of the distal end of the left radius * * * and a Greenstick fracture of the distal end of the left radius * * The hospital report noted that \u201cMother has stated that pt. [patient] has been beaten on numerous occasions by her father.\u201d The examining physician, in his diagnosis, characterized Tracey\u2019s injuries as those of a \u201cBattered Child.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Appellant contends that the State failed to prove the <em>corpus delicti </em>\u201cas it is quite conceivable that Tracey James was accidentally injured in her home between January 25, 1968 and January 27, 1968\u201d and that it is \u201calso possible that one of the said child\u2019s brothers or sisters caused her injury, either deliberately or accidentally, or that Tracey accidentally fell down the aforementioned steps, as one of her sisters had previously done.\u201d He also maintains that even if there was sufficient proof of the <em>corpus delicti, </em>there was no evidence that he inflicted the injuries upon Tracey, since there was no proof that he was at home when Tracey was injured; but that even if he had then been at home, his mere presence would not suffice as proof that he was criminally responsible for Tracey\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The State contends, on the other hand, that the evidence showed that Tracey was maliciously beaten to such a degree as to require medical treatment; that the medical report indicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>that Tracey was a. \u201cBattered Child\u201d; that this is a term of art used by the medical profession to describe a specific condition or syndrome relating to a child who has been the victim of malicious assault by parental beating; that in other words the \u201cbattered child\u201d syndrome is a clinical condition in infants who have received serious physical abuse; and that among the indices of suspicion which are designed to aid an examining physician in diagnosing a \u201cbattered child,\u201d and which are pertinent in the present case are (1) age usually under three years; (2) characteristic distribution of fractures; (3) disproportionate amount of soft tissue injury; (4) evidence that injuries occurred at different times and are in different stages of repair; (5) cause of recent trauma doubtful; (6) suspicious family history, and (7) previous similar episodes. The State cites several text authorities in support of its contention that the evidence satisfactorily established the <em>corpus </em>delicti.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The State also contends that the evidence showed that appellant was the person criminally responsible for Tracey\u2019s injuries in that his wife\u2019s testimony established that Tracey was free of injuries when left in his care on January 25 between 7:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m.; that during this time \u201csomething of an abnormal nature occurred to the body of Tracey James\u201d; that appellant was present during this critical period; and that there was evidence that neither the child\u2019s mother or brothers or sisters struck her between January 25 and January 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">While the <em>corpus delicti </em>must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>Sizemore v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 507, it may be established by circumstantial evidence, <em>Gamble v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 271. As the record indicates, there was evidence showing that Tracey was free of bruises on January 25 when placed in appellant\u2019s care. There was evidence showing that she was not struck by either her mother or brothers and sisters between January 25 and January 27, and there was no evidence showing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>that she was involved in any accident between those dates. We think it plain that Tracey\u2019s extensive injuries were neither accidental nor innocent but as indicated by the physicians\u2019 diagnosis of a \u201cBattered Child\u201d had been deliberately and criminally inflicted upon her. In this connection, the mother\u2019s statement as set forth in the hospital record that appellant had beaten Tracey on numerous occasions may have assisted in that diagnosis. In any event, we think the <em>corpus delicti </em>was satisfactorily established, and that there was legally sufficient evidence that, as specified in Section llA(a), some person did \u201cmaliciously\" beat, strike or otherwise mistreat a minor child to such degree as to require medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">And we think it equally clear from the summary of evidence herein related that the facts establishing the <em>corpus delicti </em>also tend to establish that appellant was the criminal agent. Even assuming that the statement in the hospital record to the effect that appellant had beaten Tracey on numerous occasions would not have been properly admissible as part of the hospital record had objection been made to it, there was no objection to such statement so that, although hearsay, it may be afforded the same probative force as if competent, the weight thereof being for the trier of fact. <em>Hyman v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 636, and cases cited at page 642. See also <em>Fabian v. State, </em>235 Md. 306, a case involving assault and battery upon an infant child, where it was held that testimony of a witness who was not present when the crime was committed that the accused beat the infant \u201call the time\u201d was admissible as evidence of other offenses which \u201chas a natural tendency to establish, or offers a reasonable presumption or inference as to, a principal fact at issue or matter in dispute.\u201d It is our opinion that the evidence, in totality, mounts up to more than appellant\u2019s mere presence at the scene of the crime and we cannot, on the record before us, conclude that the judgment of the trial court, in finding appellant guilty, was clearly erroneous under Maryland Rule 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AnC\">.
