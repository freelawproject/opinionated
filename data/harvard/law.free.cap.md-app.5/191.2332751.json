Thereafter he \u201cgot locked up for being drunk,\u201d walked away from the work gang and they gave me two years for escape * * * I got locked up, again, for being drunk \u2014 the same thing happened * * * They gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>me eighteen months for escape that time.\u201d He served thirty-one months in Florida for automobile theft and his most recent arrest was in Delaware \u2014 \u201cI was trying to get home, and they got me for soliciting a ride.\u201d He served ten days.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On 14 July 1967 about 9:00 A.M. he was released from the prison in New Haven, Delaware. He was given a bus token to Wilmington and the address of the Prisoner\u2019s Aid. At the Prisoner\u2019s Aid he was given $15 and he bought a bus ticket to Baltimore for $2.95. \u201cThen I drank a little bit.\u201d He boarded a bus at 6:55 P.M. He got sick on the bus and left it 10 miles outside of Baltimore. \u201cI caught a ride, and that\u2019s all I remember on that particular day.\u201d About three months later while he was at Clifton T. Perkins State Hospital he recalled the events of the day of 14 July.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He remembered that he and another man, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>who had given him a ride, went into a store and bought a bag of potato chips. He then went back into the store to get cigarettes. The counter in the store had a \u201clittle partition\u201d that separated one side of the counter from the other. As the storekeeper \u201cgot the cigarettes, I stepped to the end of that partition, and he grabbed me, and I said, \u2018What\u2019s wrong with you, you going crazy?\u2019 \u201d And he says, \u201cYou ain\u2019t robbing me.\u201d Then the storekeeper pulled out a cap pistol. \u201cThen I threw up my hands and I said, \u2018Friend, if you are going to shoot me, you are going to shoot me in the back.\u2019 Then I walked out of the place.\u201d He denied that he had a knife or that he went in the store with any intention of robbing the storekeeper. He claimed he had a couple of dollars when he went in the store but adriiitted that when he was arrested the police found no money on him. He was right handed \u201ccause I got three fingers missing off my left hand.\u201d His left hand contained only the thumb and index finger.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He said he asked a police officer the morning after his arrest how his right arm became scratched \u2014 \u201cI had three places on there where it looked like somebody dug their fingernails in my arm\u201d about four inches above the wristbone \u2014and the police officer said \u201cthat guy grabbed my arm and scratched me that I tried to rob.\u201d The appellant said that when he went into the store he \u201chad on a shirt, a pair of pants and a pair of boots\u201d; he did not have on a jacket or coat.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Samuel Verstandig, who, the lower court noted for the record, spoke \u201cwith a heavy foreign accent\u201d, operated a grocery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>store at 2146 Aiken Street at the corner of Bonaparte Avenue in Baltimore City. He had been robbed on three prior occasions \u2014\u201cOne time a guy came in, put a gun to my head and he took my money last year, Thanksgiving.\u201d On the afternoon of 14 July the appellant came into his store, took a bottle of soda from a dispensing machine and paid for it with 13 pennies. He drank the soda and left. \u201cHe was to me looking like he was drunk or under the influence of a narcotic * * * He wasn\u2019t moving straight. He was moving like drunk, or like under the influence of a narcotic. He was moving all over the store.\u201d About 10 minutes later he came back at the same time another man came in \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t know they came together.\u201d Each bought a bag of potato chips, taking them from the display rack. Each paid for his purchase with 10 pennies. The appellant asked Verstandig what time he closed the store. \u201cI told him 1 closing nighttime, I didn\u2019t know exactly the time \u2014 I didn\u2019t tell him.\u201d The appellant walked out but in another 5 or 10 minutes returned. \u201cHe walk in, he asked me for a pack of cigarettes, same way he wralk \u2014 turning, going, walking all around (indicating) * * * There was children around who I served. He ask for cigarettes, I saw him, and I, right away, I ask him what he want. He ask me for a pack of cigarettes \u2014 Pall Mall * * * I hand to him the cigarettes and he wTas coming behind the counter * * * the inside from the counter <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> * * * he go behind the counter * * * at the end, on the side from the counter * * * there was some papers he took out, some little papers * * * from the pants pocket (the witness did not know whether it was the right or left pants pocket) * * * He put down the papers, and I asked him, you please give me the money for the cigarettes. He told me to wait on the customers, and I told him I don\u2019t wait on the customers, please give me the thirty-two cents. Then, he, all of a sudden, pulled out a knife * * * from the pocket * * * the left part of the hip.\u201d Verstandig did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>not remember which hand the appellant used. \u201cExactly I can\u2019t \u2014I saw the knife. I saw the knife \u2014 saw like that (it was the right wrist of the appellant that was scratched) \u2014 and I catch him with the hand * * * As soon as I saw the knife like that, I catch him right away. I got no choice \u2014 I catch him from the hand * * * his wrist, and I tried to wrestle with him five minutes, and I yelled to my wife, call the police, till I find out\u2014 till he give me out the knife. And I took my toy gun, and I say, I going to shoot you, pick up the hands. He pick up the hands, and with the hands up, he walk out from the store. And this time came the police, and I go off after him with one hand the knife and one hand with my toy gun, and I go after him, and the police come over here and I point to him, and the police arrested him.\u201d Verstandig said that during the struggle for the knife he did not say anything to the appellant but the appellant said, \u201cI\u2019m a sick man, let me go, I don\u2019t want to rob you.\u201d He said this when Verstandig \u201cwrestled already \u2014 I wrestled the knife from him.\u201d The knife was eight inches long and was admitted in evidence upon identification by Verstandig. When the police arrived the appellant was across the street, walking away from the store. Verstandig did not remember how the appellant was dressed \u2014 \u201cI cannot say exactly he got a winter coat or he didn\u2019t have any.\u201d When the appellant came into the store \u201cI saw he keep his hands like that (indicating), like he got a gun or something.\u201d It was noted for the record that the witness indicated his left hand in the left pocket area of his pants.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Only two witnesses testified at the trial, Verstandig for the State and the appellant in his own behalf. The appellant was found guilty of attempted robbery with a deadly weapon and assault. He was sentenced to 15 years on each conviction, the sentence on the assault conviction to run concurrently with the sentence on the attempted robbery conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">On appeal from the judgments the appellant contends that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain the convictions, urging that the \u201cpulling\u201d of the knife by the appellant did not show an intent to rob or assault Verstandig, that the testimony of Verstandig was \u201cso vague, uncertain and enigmatical to be entitled to any probative force and that the evidence adduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>by the State negated larcenous intent.\u201d We do not agree that the testimony of the State\u2019s witness was not entitled to any probative force. We think it was clear in the essential details. That the witness could not positively assert that the appellant was drunk or under the influence of a narcotic, that he did not recall whether the appellant was wearing a coat and that he could not \u201cexactly\u201d state whether the appellant used his right or left hand to pull the knife (he indicated after extensive cross-examination that it was the left hand but it was clear that he grabbed the hand holding the knife and scratches were on the appellant\u2019s right wrist) do not compel the application of the rule enunciated in <em>Kucharczyk v. State, </em>235 Md. 334. See <em>Eley v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 230; <em>Poff v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 289. These and other matters claimed to show that the testimony of the witness was equivocal, doubtful and enigmatical go at best to the weight of the evidence and do not preclude its consideration with regard to the sufficiency. As the testimony of Yerstandig had probative value the question is whether the evidence before the trial court was sufficient to sustain the convictions. It is firmly established that in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence in a non-jury case, this Court determines whether the trial court had sufficient evidence or rational inferences therefrom from which it could be fairly convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt, <em>Hutchinson v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 362; that the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the -witnesses is for the trial court to determine, <em>Gibson v. State, 4 </em>Md. App. 222; and that the findings of fact of the trial court will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous. <em>Tinglen and Wright v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 389. We cannot say that it wras not a rational inference from the evidence before the lovTer court in the instant case that the appellant attempted to rob Yerstandig and to assault him. That the appellant entered the store on three occasions within a short period of time, that he inquired when the store closed, that the last time he came in he had no money, that he proceeded into the area affording access to the rear of the counter, that at that time Yerstandig was by the cash register at the end of the counter, that when he was asked to pay for the cigarettes he \u201call of a sudden pulled out a knife\u201d eight inches long, that Yerstandig was obliged to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>struggle with him for five minutes before being able to wrest the knife from him, and that he did not attempt to explain why he pulled the knife or why he was carrying it, but merely denied that he had such a weapon, support a finding that he attempted to rob and assault the proprietor. Attempted robbery with a deadly weapon is predicated upon a finding of intent to rob by means of intimidation produced by the use of such weapon, coupled with the apparent ability to execute the implied threat if resistance is offered. See <em>Jackson v. State, </em>231 Md. 591. That the intended victim reacted in such a way as to frustrate the consummation of a robbery did not preclude the trial court, in the circumstances, from being fairly convinced that the appellant attempted a robbery and had the apparent ability to commit it. See <em>Boone v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 80, 114. Nor do we believe that the evidence showed that the appellant was so intoxicated as to be incapable of entertaining the specific mental intent or of possessing the mental state requisite to the crime; he is considered criminally responsible as long as he retains control of his mental faculties sufficiently to appreciate what he is doing. <em>Michael v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 243. We may not usurp the function of the trial court by determining whether we would have come to a different conclusion when there is legally sufficient evidence to warrant its finding. <em>Trout v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 259; <em>Bury v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 674. We think that there was such legally sufficient evidence here; therefore the findings of the trial court were not clearly erroneous and we may not set them aside. Md. Rules, 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The appellant contends that in any event the assault conviction merged into the conviction of attempted robbery with a deadly weapon. Under the facts here existing we agree. See <em>Price v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 155. Compare <em>Davis v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 492; <em>Tender v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\"><em>Judgment as to attempted robbery with a deadly weapon affirmed; judgment as </em>to\u25a0 <em>assault vacated, the conviction thereof merging into the conviction of attempted robbery with a deadly weapon.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b215-5\">. The criminal record of the appellant was not available at the guilt stage of his trial. The imposition of sentence was deferred and at the penalty stage of the proceedings the court had before it the F. B. I. report. It showed the following convictions in Raleigh, N. C.: 3 October 1958, guilty of housebreaking, larceny and receiving stolen goods, sentence, <em>2 </em>years; 2 August 1960, guilty of being drunk on the street, sentence, 30 days; 14 October 1960, guilty of public drunkenness, sentence, 30 days; 21 October 1960, guilty of escape, sentence, 90 days; 13 December 3 960, guilty of escape, sentence, 6 months (apparently he again escaped while serving the 90 day sentence); 12 October 1961, guilty of being drunk, sentence, 30 days; 1 November 3 961, guilty of escape, sentence, 12 months. On 16 October 1963 he was found guilty in Miami, Florida of being a vagabond, and given a suspended sentence of 30 days. Four days later he was found guilty in St. Petersburg, Florida of being a rogue and vagabond and a 10 day sentence was suspended on condition he leave town. On 18 February 1964 in Raiford, Florida he was found guilty of larceny of an automobile and sentenced to 3 years. On 6 January 1967 in Jacksonville, Florida he was found guilty of being drunk on the street and disorderly conduct and sentenced to 10 days. In the same city on 38 March 1967 he was convicted of the same offenses and a fine of $30 was imposed. On 5 July 1967 in Wilmington, Delaware he was found guilty of a motor violation (apparently hitchhiking) and sentenced to 10 days.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b215-6\">. The appellant was indicted on 31 July, arraigned on 8 August and filed a \u201cplea of insanity\u201d on 10 August. On 25 August he was transferred to Clifton T. Perkins State Hospital for examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>and evaluation. On 24 October a report of examination dated 20 October was filed. It expressed the opinion of the medical staff that he was competent to stand trial and that at the time of the alleged offense he \u201cdid not have a mental disease or defect which could have caused him to lack substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.\u201d The evaluation disclosed, however, that he had numerous personality characteristics which enabled him to be classified \u201camong the Sociopathic Personality Disturbances as an Antisocial Reaction with strong schizoid features.\u201d These personality findings did not adversely affect the opinions as to competency and responsibility for criminal conduct. The plea of insanity was withdrawn.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b216-7\">. The appellant said that he lost the fingers while he was in prison in North Carolina. \u201cI let a guy cut them off * * * with a hoe. I laid them down and let him step on the hoe.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b217-5\">. The cash register was four inches from the end of the counter. The appellant said that Verstandig was \u201cup at the cash register, and I was, I would say, about four feet away from him where I stepped in between where the counter was separated * * * I was right there in between the two pieces that was open * * * The cash register was on the other end of the counter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
