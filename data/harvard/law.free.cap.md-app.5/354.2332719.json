Each was convicted of storehouse breaking with intent to commit a felony (1st count) and petit larceny (3rd count). Concurrent sentences of 5 years on the 1st count and 9 months on the 3rd count were imposed on Melia and concurrent sentences of 4 years on the 1st count and 9 months on the 3rd count were imposed on Shelhorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">On appeal from the judgments the contentions of the appellants go to the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">The 1st count of the indictment charged that the appellants did break \u201cthe storehouse, the premises of Carroll-J ames Co., Inc., a corporation, located at 8522 Georgia Avenue, Silver Spring, Montgomery County, Maryland\u201d with intent to commit a certain felony, to wit, to steal goods \u201cin excess of the value of one hundred dollars.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The 3rd count of the indictment charged that the appellants did steal \u201cone reel of 4/0 electrical wire, being of the value of twenty-five dollars, current money; fifteen feet of T-W 12 gauge wire, being of the value of two dollars, current money; three rolls of copper refrigeration tubing, each roll of tubing being of the value of ten dollars, current money * * * of the goods of Carroll-James Co., Inc., a corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">Two witnesses testified in behalf of the State \u2014 Herbert Shields, an eyewitness to the crime and Harry A. Carroll, Jr., an officer of the businesses occupying the storehouse.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>from the testimony of Carroll that there was no corporation by the name of \u201cCarroll-James Co., Inc.\u201d There were two corporations in existence at the time of the crime, \u201cC. &amp; J. Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Company, Inc.\u201d and \u201cCarroll Electric Company, Inc.\u201d He was secretary-treasurer of the former and president of the latter. C. &amp; J. Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Company, Inc. traded under the name \u201cCarroll-James.\u201d The storehouse basement \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s next to the Tastee Diner * * * It\u2019s the 8500 block, I believe * * * of Georgia Avenue * * * in Montgomery County\u201d \u2014 was rented by \u201cC. &amp; J., Carroll-James\u201d and owned by \u201cMr. Warner.\u201d The goods in the storehouse were owned by both corporations and had a value of between $1800 and $2000. He was called by the police about 3 :00 \u2014 4:00 A.M. on 25 March 1967 and went to the storehouse. The police on the scene told him \u201csomebody had busted into the place * * * I looked at the door and there was a roll of cable outside the front of the door and the door had been busted in and the panel, one of the panels had been knocked out * * * where the lock was fastened onto the door was broken away from the door.\u201d He had been at the premises between 1:00 P.M. and 3:00 P.M. on 24 March, unlocked the door when he went in and locked it when he left. The door was not damaged at that time. He had never at any time given Melia or Shelhorse permission to enter the storehouse; he had never seen them before the breaking. The cable he saw \u201cwas approximately one hundred feet of No. 4 TH or RHW insulation wire on a reel.\u201d Its value was \u201cbetween sixty and seventy dollars.\u201d It was the property of Carroll-Electric Company, Inc. An inventory taken later disclosed that the only other goods missing was \u201csome copper tubing.\u201d He did not know its value.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Herbert Shields testified that he worked at the Tastee Diner next door to the storehouse. On 25 March he finished work at 3:40 A.M. and started to wash his car at the rear of the Diner before going home. The area was well lighted and he saw a 'man coming out of the basement door of the storehouse \u2014 \u201cthe electric place weerh they kept the equipment\u201d- \u2014 carrying some electric wires. When the man saw Shields \u201che put wires in the trunk\u201d of a car and slammed the lid. Shields saw another man standing by the car. Both got in the car and drove away. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>car lights were not turned on. Shields called the police. When the police arrived he went to the storehouse with them. The door was open and the lock broken off. He saw some electrical wires on the ground. At the trial Shields identified Melia and Shelhorse as the men lie had seen. He said Melia got in the driver's side of the car and Shelhorse in the passenger side. On cross-examination he said the car was a 1964 or 1965 White Ford four door with Maryland tags. He gave the police some of the tag numbers. He recognized the men because \u201cthey come in the Diner all the time.\u201d He did not know their names except that Shelhorse was called \u201cPeewee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">At the close of the evidence offered by the State, the appellants moved for a judgment of acquittal \u201con each and every count, on the grounds of fatal variance.\u201d After argument by the State and the defense the State moved to amend the indictment and after further argument the court granted the motion to amend, over objection, and denied the motion for judgment of acquittal. The proposed amendment was not clearly articulated <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but we are satisfied from the record that the amendment ultimately made was to substitute the name of each of the two corporations for \u201cCarroll-James Co., Inc.\u201d wherever it appeared in the indictment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>On appeal the appellants do not contend in their brief that the granting of the motion to amend was error, assuming incorrectly that the court did not grant the motion. In oral argument it was conceded that the motion was granted. We find no error in the granting of the motion to amend. Mid. Rules, 714; <em>Corbin v. State, </em>237 Md. 486; <em>Wilkins v. </em>State, 4 Md. App. 334. As amended, therefore, the first count of the indictment charged that the storehouse broken was the premises of C. &amp; J. Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Company, Inc. and Carroll Electric Company, Inc. and the third count charged that the goods stolen were the properties of those two corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">\n<em>THE LARCENY CONVICTION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Simple larceny at common law is the taking and carrying away of the personal goods of another of any value from any place, with a felonious intent to steal such goods. <em>Clark and Marshall, A Treatise on the Law of Crimes </em>(6th Ed.) \u00a7 12.00, p. 706.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Since larceny is a crime against possession, <em>Brown v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number><em>State, </em>236 Md. 505; <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law and Procedure </em>(Anderson) \u00a7 464, an allegation of the ownership of the property alleged to have been stolen is a necessary requisite in a larceny indictment and proof of ownership as laid in the indictment is an essential factor to justify a conviction, <em>Anderson v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 85. It is well settled that ownership may be laid in the real owner \u2014 general interest \u2014 or in the person in whose possession the goods were at the time of theft \u2014 special interest. Pet<em>rey v. State, </em>239 Md. 601, 603. And it is not necessary to state the nature of the interest; the property may be described as the goods of the owner or as the goods of the person having possession. 32 Am. Jur., Larceny, \u00a7 114, p. 1067. So an allegation that a person is the owner may be sustained by proof that he has either a general or a special interest. But, as amended, the larceny count alleged that C. &amp; J. Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Company, Inc. and Carroll Electric Company, Inc. were the owners o\u00ed the goods and the proof showed that only Carroll Electric Company, Inc. was the owner as holding the legal interest.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The question is whether this was a fatal variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>If the count be construed as laying the ownership in the two named corporations jointly (although it did not so state), it was not sustained by the proof that the stolen goods belonged to one of them individually nor would it be sustained by proof that separate articles belonged to one of the owners named and the remainder to the other. 52 C.J.S. \u00a7 99, Larceny, p. 918.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If it was not certain whether the proof would show that the goods were the property of one of the corporations or the other or that one had possession although the other was the owner it would have been proper to allege the ownership in one corporation in one count and in the other corporation in another count of the same indictment, for the purpose of meeting the varying degrees of proof which the testimony might develop. But it was not proper, in one and the same count, to lay the property alleged to have been stolen in more than one corporation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>because each count must contain such allegations as will enable the trier of facts to find the accused guilty on that count. <em>Burgess v. State, </em>161 Md. 162, 166; 32 Am. Jur. \u00a7 113, Larceny, p. 1025. And although it is the rule that the stealing of several articles at the same time belonging to several persons may constitute one offense and be charged in one count, it is necessary that the count allege the ownership of each article, and not just generally that the articles belonged to the several owners. <em>State v. Warren, 77 </em>Md. 121.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The count in the instant case did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">We hold that there was a variance between the <em>allegata </em>and the <em>probata, </em>that the variance was material, and that the judgment as to the larceny count must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">\n<em>THB STOREHO USB BREAKING CONVICTION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">As amended, the first count of the indictment charged that the appellants \u201c* * * the storehouse, the premises of C. &amp; J. Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Company, Inc. and Carroll Electric Company, Inc., located at 8522 Georgia Avenue, Silver Spring, Montgomery County, Maryland there situate, unlawfully did break with intent to commit a certain felony there and therein, to wit, with intent then and there certain goods and chattels in excess of the value of one hundred dollars, current money, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>in the said storehouse then and there being found, then and there unlawfully to steal, take and carry away; * * *.\u201d Evidence adduced was that the premises were rented by \u201cC. &amp; J., Carroll-James,\u201d that \u201cCarroll-James\u201d was the trade name of C. &amp; J. Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Company, Inc., and that goods owned by each of the refrigeration company and the electric company were in the storehouse when it was broken. The question is whether, in these circumstances, there was a material variance between the <em>allegata </em>and the <em>probata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Code, supra, Art. 27, \u00a7 32, proscribing the offense here charged, does not expressly provide that the storehouse broken be that of another.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But the usual holding is that an indictment for burglary, whether at common law or under a statute, must allege ownership of the building broken. 13 Am. Jur. 2d, \u00a7 37, p. 342.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The ownership, however, need not be that of the legal title owner. The Court of Appeals said in <em>Hackley v. </em>State, 237 Md. 566 at 569:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">\u201cMost, but not all, States require that the ownership of the building burglarized be stated in the indictment and proven so as to negative a right of entry by the accused and to establish identity. See Anno. 169 A.L.R. 887. It is generally held that the ownership alleged and shown need not be that of the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>title holder if another, not the accused, is in lawful possession of the building involved under a special property interest. The propositions set forth in this paragraph are supported by 13 Am.Jur.2d <em>Burglary </em>Sec. 37, p. 342 and 4 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law and Procedure </em>(Anderson 1957), Sec. 178-1, p. 604, and the cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">And it has been held that the ownership of the building broken into is not an essential element of the crime and need not be proved precisely as alleged. 3 <em>Underhill, Criminal Evidence </em>(5th Ed. 1957) \u00a7 720, p. 1678 and cases cited in note 83. We think that in the instant case the allegation in the first count of the indictment and the proof were enough to show that the storehouse broken into by the appellants was not theirs, that they had no right to enter it without the permission of the lawful occupier, and enough to identify the building broken into and the personal property therein so as to protect the appellants against a subsequent prosecution for the same offense, which is all that is required. <em>Sparkman v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 527, 531-532. We hold as to the first count that there was no material variance between the <em>allegata </em>and the <em>probata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">\n<em>THE CRIMINAL AGENCY OF THE APPELLANTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">The appellants urge that the testimony of one eyewitness was not legally sufficient \u201cfrom consideration of its character and weight\u201d and therefore the motions for judgment of acquittal at the close of the evidence offered by the State should have been granted. It appears that the motion then made was \u201con the grounds of fatal variance\u201d and so argued. But in any event, the appellants thereafter offered evidence and by so doing withdrew the motions. Md. Rules, 755b. At the close of all the evidence motions for judgment of acquittal were again made and denied and the appellants now contend that \u201cupon examination of all the evidence, it was legally insufficient to sustain\u201d the convictions. The thrust of the appellants\u2019 argument on the point is that the eyewitness, Shields, may have been mistaken in his identification of the appellants, not only in the light of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>circumstances under which he claimed he saw them at the scene of the crime but in consideration of the evidence offered by them. The eyewitness was exhaustively cross-examined by counsel for each appellant as to what he saw, the time he saw what he described, and the conditions under which he saw it. But there was evidence before the court that Shields saw one of the appellants coming out of the broken premises carrying electric wires which he put in the trunk of a car at the scene, that the other appellant was standing beside the car, that when they became aware of Shields\u2019 presence they entered the car and drove away without turning on the car lights, that Shields recognized them because they \u201ccome in the Diner (where he was employed) all the time.\u201d Shields positively identified them at the trial. There was extensive evidence offered by the appellants to attack the credibility of Shields and to show that they were not present at the scene of the crime. It is firmly established that the identification by a single eyewitness is sufficient. <em>Rodgers v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 407; <em>Tillery v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 142; <em>Crosby v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 578; <em>Reed v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 662. The weight to be given a courtroom identification is a matter for the trial court. <em>Cox v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 136 ; <em>Hutchinson v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 362. Alibi evidence is to be weighed by the trial judge who is not required to accept its truthfulness, <em>Logon v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 213, nor is he under any obligation to believe the explanations and denials of the accused, <em>Gunther v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 181; <em>Carwell v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 45. The matters now urged by the appellants go to the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses but they are for the trial judge to determine. <em>Gibson v. State, 4 </em>Md. App. 222; <em>Trout v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 259; <em>Dunlap v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 444. We determine whether the court below had sufficient evidence before it from which it could be fairly convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the defendants\u2019 guilt. <em>Eley v. State, 4 </em>Md. App. 230; <em>Howard v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 379. We think there was such evidence in the instant case from which the trial court could find both the <em>corpus delicti </em>and the criminal agency of the appellants as to the storehouse breaking, which, in view of our holding herein, is the only conviction remaining for consideration. Therefore the judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>the trial court thereon was not clearly erroneous and we may not set it aside. Md. Rules, 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\n<em>As to each appellant: Judgment under the first count of the indictment affirmed; judgment under the third count of the indictment reversed and case remanded for a new trial thereon.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b379-10\">. Md. Code, (1967 Repl. Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 32 proscribes, in part, the breaking of a storehouse with intent to commit a felony or with intent to steal goods of the value of $100 or more. Larceny to the value of $100 or upwards is a felony, Code, supra, Art. 27, \u00a7 340; the stealing of goods under the value of $100 is a misdemeanor, \u00a7 341.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b379-11\">. A police officer called by the State was not permitted to testify over objection for the reason that his name was not listed in an answer to a motion for discovery filed by Shelhorse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b381-6\">. The Srate first moved \u201cto correct by interlineation that the premises were owned by C. &amp; J. Corporation, Incorporated; rather, the property is owned by C. &amp; <em>J. </em>Corporation, Incorporated, and the Carroll Electric Company, Incorporated.\u201d Later the motion was corrected to read, \u201cThe storehouses, the premises of C. &amp; J. Corporation, Incorporated and the Carroll Electric Company, Incorporated,\u201d the State saying that was the motion \u201con all counts.\u201d The correct name of the first corporation as given by Carroll was \u201cC. &amp; J. Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Company, Inc.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b381-7\">. After extensive argument during which both the State and defense referred to the corporations under a variety of names the court said, \u201cThe Court in making its ruling construed the amendment to mean nothing more than a substitution of those two corporate names for Carroll-James Co., Inc., wherever it later appeared in the indictment.\u201d We think it clear that the court intended that the corporate names substituted be those names as given by Carroll during his testimony as the correct corporate names. In any event it is stated in <em>52 </em>C.J.S. \u00a7 99c(l), Larceny, p. 918:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-8\">\u201cIf the ownership is laid in a corporation under what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>purports to be its corporate name and the proof shows the owner to be a corporation of a different name, and there is no evidence connecting them and showing their identity, the variance is fatal. However, if it is established beyond a reasonable doubt that the corporation proved on the trial to be the owner is the same corporation as that in which the ownership is laid in the indictment, the fact that the name stated in the indictment differs from the corporate name proved will not usually be considered a fatal variance, especially where the name stated in the indictment is the one under which it is generally known, or by which accused knows and will recognize it, or, although misspelled, has the same sound as that of the true name.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b382-8\">. Larceny is distinguished as simple \u2014 unaccompanied by any circumstance of aggravation \u2014 or compound \u2014 when committed under circumstances of aggravation. Hochheimer\u2019s <em>Criminal Law </em>(1st Ed.) \u00a7 691, p. 409. The English law, as a result of an early statute, classified simple larceny as either grand larceny or petit larceny (now frequently written petty larceny). Statute of West-minister, 3 Ed. 1 c. 15 (1275). Both grand larceny and petty larceny were felonies but the punishment for petit larceny was less severe. The punishment for grand larceny was death and forfeiture of goods, subject to benefit of clergy. The punishment for petit larceny was forfeiture of goods and whipping, or some corporal pun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>ishment less than death. 1 Hale, Pleas of the Crown 530. Under the statute theft was grand larceny where the value of the property exceeded 13 pence, and petit larceny where the value was 13 pence or less. In Maryland, although larceny is not specifically designated by statute as grand or petit, there is a statutory dividing line between felonious and non-felonious larceny. The theft of goods to the value of $100 or upwards is a felony, Code, <em>supra, </em>Art. 27, \u00a7 341, commonly referred to as grand larceny, and the theft of goods under the value of $J00 is a misdemeanor, \u00a7 342, commonly referred to as petty larceny. Prior to the Acts of 1952, chapter IS, the dividing line was $25.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b383-11\">. Of the goods alleged to have been stolen, the proof as to ownership and identity of the goods was sufficient only with regard to the \u201cone real of 4/0 electrical wire,\u201d valued at $60 or $70. On a charge of petty larceny if it appears that the goods were of some value, a specific allegation of value need not be sustained as not material to the charge. <em>Hochheimer, supra, </em>\u00a7 716, pp. 432-433. (For necessity of proof of value as to grand larceny see <em>Wilkins v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 334 and <em>Lehr v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 776.) We think the evidence properly enabled the court to find that this wire was that found outside the storehouse by the broken door. Appellants do not contend on appeal that it was not the goods so described in the indictment and while it was not physically introduced in evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>there was no objection to the testimony describing it. There was no evidence as to the \u201cfifteen feet of T-W 12 gauge wire\u201d valued at $2. Although there was testimony that an inventory disclosed goods described as \u201csome copper tubing\u201d (with no other specificity) was missing, the value of which was unknown to the witness, there was no evidence of ownership of the tubing other than a general statement that the contents of the storehouse \u201cbelonged to the Carroll-James Company and the Carroll Electric Company,\u201d the contents being described at one point in the witness\u2019 testimony as \u201crefrigeration compressors, copper wires, boxes, some lighting fixtures, some refrigerators.\u201d We do not believe the evidence was sufficient to identify the tubing alleged to have been stolen or its ownership. \u201cIndictments for larceny and the like are sustained by proof of taking any part of the goods or money averred, provided the punishment is the same, whether more or less is taken.\u201d <em>Hochheimer, supra, </em>\u00a7 263, p. 167. See 32 Am. Jur., Larceny, \u00a7 146, p. 1059. Even though there was testimony that the storehouse was rented by C. &amp; J. Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Company, Inc., under its trade name as Carroll-James, there was no direct evidence that it had possession of the goods and we do not think that a rational inference could be drawn, in the circumstances here, that it had exclusive possession.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b384-6\">. For a sufficient statement in an indictment as to ownership or possession of property by partners, joint tenants, parceners, tenants in common or trustees, see Md. Code, <em>supra, </em>Art. 27, \u00a7 605. The statute is not applicable to the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b385-8\">. The Court of Appeals said in <em>Warren </em>at 133, \u201cAnd although it is necessary to set out in the indictment the ownership of the property, this the law requires in order that the prisoner may be informed as to the precise nature of the offense charged against him; and further, to enable him to plead a former conviction or acquittal, in bar of a subsequent prosecution for the same offense.\u201d It reversed a judgment of the lower court sustaining a demurrer and quashing an indictment containing two counts, in each of which the accused was charged with stealing several sums of money at the same time, belonging to several owners, on the ground of duplicity. The Court of Appeals held that the indictment was proper as the stealing was but one offense. Although it is not clear from the opinion, the record of the case, No. 71, Criminals, November Term, 1893, in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, discloses that in both counts of the indictment the ownership of each article was separately stated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b386-8\">.
