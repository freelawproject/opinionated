The policy excluded \u201cwater rights\u201d and \u201cclaims or title to water\u201d from its insuring agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">It was admitted by the defendant, and the court found, that the property was neither in the City of Beaumont nor within the Beaumont Irrigation District.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The trial court concluded from the findings of fact that the words \u201cBeaumont Irrigation District\u201d contained in the policy description gave no vested interest in the water rights of the district to the plaintiffs, and the erroneous inclusion of such words did not violate a covenant in the policy against unmarketability. As a consequence judgment favored defendant title company in plaintiffs\u2019 claim for damages, and from that judgment plaintiffs have appealed, contending as a matter of law on the undisputed facts that they are entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The trial bore out the fact that no representations were made to plaintiffs that the land was in the Beaumont Irrigation District; no such inquiries were made by them before they purchased; and plaintiffs knew that the land was not in the City of Beaumont.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">There is no showing that plaintiffs did not obtain anything other than the exact title which they purchased. The fact that the title insurance policy added a water feature \u201cBeaumont Irrigation District, \u2019 \u2019 not contained in the deed, does not mean that plaintiffs can seek to obtain a \u201cwindfall\u201d from this defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">The defendant specifically protected itself against a claim of this nature by providing in the policy the exclusion respecting \u201c. . . water rights, claims or title to water.\u201d There was no breach by defendant of the insuring provisions contained in the title policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">In <em>Hocking </em>v. <em>Title Ins. &amp; Trust Co., </em>37 Cal.2d 644 [234 P.2d 625, 40 A.L.R.2d 1238], the title description embraced an easement disclosed on a subdivision map; the actual fact was that plaintiff did not have that easement. The plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>in that case was not entitled to damages for breach of contract under the title policy because of an erroneous description ; marketability of the property remained in existence even though erroneously described.  The court stated at page 651, \u201cOne can hold perfect title to land that is valueless; one can have marketable title to land while the land itself is unmarketable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Since the plaintiffs\u2019 contractual rights with defendant specifically excluded \u201cwater rights and claims or title to water\u201d it will not be necessary to answer plaintiffs\u2019 remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Griffin, P. J., and Conley, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">Appellants\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied September 11, 1963. Peters, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b464-18\">Assigned by Chairman of Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
