The amended complaint is word for word like the original complaint with the exception that a new seventh cause of action is added in the place of the original seventh cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The municipal defendants filed a demurrer both general and special to the amended complaint and a motion to strike. It was set forth therein that among other things the amended complaint was uncertain in 17 separate respects. The individual defendants resubmitted their demurrer as previously filed with additional points and authorities in support thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">The court overruled the demurrers but without prejudice to the filing by defendants of an appropriate motion for a declaratory judgment on the pleadings. The motion of defendants to strike certain parts of the amended complaint went off calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">The defendants in April 1962 filed separate notices of motions for a declaratory judgment upon the pleadings which motions were heard and granted on April 26, 1962, and judgment was filed and entered on May 31, 1962. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">The basic questions are whether the Los Angeles Municipal Code provisions which permit the establishment of a housing project in an HI zone are constitutional and whether the allegations of the amended complaint with reference to the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>duct of public hearings were such as to preclude the court from granting respondents\u2019 motions for declaratory judgment under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">The amended complaint sets forth the pertinent provisions of the Los Angeles Municipal Code, sometimes hereinafter referred to as the code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The amended complaint further sets forth in effect that among the uses permitted in an R1 zone are housing projects if the zoning administrator \u201cfinds that the proposed location will be desirable to the public convenience and welfare and will be in harmony with the various elements and objectives of the master plan.\u201d Section 12.03 of the code heretofore set forth in the footnotes defines the term \u201chousing project\u201d as used in the code provisions under discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">In plaintiffs\u2019 first cause of action they in effect allege that section 12.24C-1.5 (e) of the code (plaintiffs incorrectly referred to (b) which has to do with golf courses) is unconstitutional because it provides for rezoning without an amendment to the master plan by ordinance and that the \u201cordinance\u201d authorizing a housing project in the R1 zone will depreciate the value of plaintiffs\u2019 property and constitute an invasion of their constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>The acts of the administrative agencies in approving the location of a conditional use is not a rezoning of the property. The agency in this case simply found that the legislatively imposed standards exist and thereby effectuated the legislative permission to construct a housing project in the B, 1 zone. In <em>Essick </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>34 Cal.2d 614, 624 [213 P.2d 492], the court said: \u201c. .'. it is clear that a resolution performing <em>the administrative act of granting a conditional use permit, </em>as authorized by amended subsection C. of Section 12.24, <em>does not constitute the \u2018changing of a zoning ordinance\u2019 \u201d </em>(Italics added). Also in <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Gregg, </em>90 Cal.App.2d 348, 363 [203 P.2d 37], the court stated: \u201cIt must therefore be held that <em>the power granted by section 12.24 of the ordinance </em>to the planning commission in the first instance, and to the city council on appeal, to grant conditional use permits in the particular instances specified, was not intended to, nor does it confer any power to amend or alter the zoning ordinance itself, nor does it delegate any legislative power. . . . The decision to grant a conditional use permit does not create a new zone. It merely affirms as a fact the existence of the circumstances under which the ordinance by its terms prescribes that such permit shall issue. <em>\u2019 \u2019 </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">With reference to the second part of plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, the courts in California have many times held in effect that a diminution of property values, if any, resulting from the proper exercise of governmental functions is no basis for invalidating such proper governmental activities. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number><em>Clemons </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>36 Cal.2d 95, 99 [222 P.2d 439]; <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>12 Cal.2d 244, 250 [83 P.2d 29], and <em>Otis </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>52 Cal.App.2d 605, 614 [126 P.2d 954], where it is said: \u201cThe mere fact that damage resulted to plaintiffs\u2019 property from the application of the [zoning] ordinance thereto in no way affects the validity of the legislative or administrative board\u2019s action. When the exercise of the police power is proper and reasonable, ensuing damage to one\u2019s property is one of the prices that the individual must pay as a membe'r of society, to the end that the general welfare of the community may be served. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The identical contention was made in <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Gregg, </em>90 Cal.App.2d 348 [203 P.2d 37], and there the court at page 365 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">\u201cThe permit granted respondent Gregg does not restrict appellants in the use of their own property. And they have no vested right in the maintenance of restrictions on respondent Gregg\u2019s property. It may be true that to continue the zoning restrictions upon respondent Gregg\u2019s property might have conferred benefit on neighboring owners and enhanced the value of their property, but the existence of benefits does not generate interests protected by the Constitution against diminution by governmental authorities in the proper exercise of the police power. Zoning regulations are not contracts by the city and may therefore be modified by the latter. Property is always held subject to the valid exercise of police power. The theory of vested rights relates only to such rights as an owner of property may possess not to have his property rezoned after he has started construction thereon or was making a use thereof permitted by law, when such construction or use does not constitute a nuisance. [Citations.] The adoption of Zoning Ordinance No. 90500 gave appellants no vested rights which would prevent defendant city from subsequently amending the ordinance or granting a conditional use permit thereunder. The provisions' of the ordinance restricting the uses to which.respondent Gregg\u2019s property could be put did not result in. a contract with .appellants divesting the city of the right to subsequently change the ordinance or to grant a conditional use pewit adversely affecting the property of appellants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">In the second 'cause of action plaintiffs also attack section 12.24C-1.5 of the' code as being unconstitutional, as being vague and without adequate criteria to guide in the granting of a conditional use and further that the factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>which constitute a \u201chousing project\u201d are inadequately set forth in the code. In appellants \u2019 brief no mention is made of the first assertion other than that which is made in their title with reference to their contention of vagueness and it may be assumed that they have abandoned that particular contention. The appellants themselves allege that ordinance 107884 of the city amended section 12.03 of the code so as to define a \u201chousing project.\u201d (See footnote.) There is no mention in the section of any requirement to the effect that a housing project is limited to slum areas or that it must be financed by \u201cfederal funds,\u201d as is apparently plaintiffs\u2019 argument. We think the definition of a housing project as set forth in the code suffices for the purposes of this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">In the third cause of action plaintiffs contend that section 12.24C-1.5 is unconstitutional because it improperly delegates legislative authority, namely that it provides for delegation of legislative power to the zoning administrator when.it permits him to ascertain (1) what constitutes a \u201chousing project\u201d and (2) when the proposed use of a lot is \u201cproper in relation to adjacent uses and the development of the community. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">It has heretofore been stated that the zoning administrator does not make the determination of what constitutes a housing project. That term is defined in the code. The standard as set forth above in (2) of plaintiffs\u2019 contention is not the standard described in the code in section 12.24C-1.5. The authority to determine whether the standards as set forth in the code have been met and therefore whether a conditional use can be approved has been held not to be an improper delegation of legislative authority. See <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Gregg, </em>90 Cal.App.2d 348, 362 [203 P.2d 37], where it is set forth:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">\u201cIt is next contended that the power vested in the planning commission in the first instance, and in the city council on appeal, to grant a conditional use permit under section 12.24 of Ordinance No. 90500, constitutes an unlawful delegation of legislative power. This claim is without merit. We are persuaded that a finding by the planning commission in the first instance, or, as in the case at bar, by the city council on appeal, of the necessary facts to justify the granting of a conditional use permit under section 12.24 of the ordinance is an exercise of quasi judicial, or perhaps administrative power, and- does not amount to an exercise of legislative power.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>The fourth cause of action asserts that section 12.03 of the code is unconstitutional as being vague and uncertain. The definition contained therein is plain and clear and we hold that the legislatively imposed standards for ascertaining what constitutes a \u201chousing project\u201d are fitting and proper and are not vague and uncertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The fifth cause of action asserts that the city officials \u201cacted under a miscomprehension of their duty\u201d in concluding that they had authority to permit a housing project in other than a \u201cslum area\u201d and without federal aid. There is, as heretofore stated, no requirement under the code that a housing project be located in a \u201cslum area\u201d and be aided by federal funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Plaintiffs further allege in effect that the council in enacting the legislation in question really intended something other than that which they enacted. In <em>Bertolozzi </em>v. <em>Progressive Concrete Co., </em>95 Cal.App.2d 332, 335 [212 P.2d 910], the court said: \u201cDefendants offered to prove by the city attorney who drafted the ordinance that it was not intended to apply to sidewalks. The court properly refused to admit this evidence. . . . Where a statute or ordinance is clear on its face there is no room for extrinsic evidence of its meaning.\u201d See also <em>Caminetti </em>v. <em>Pacific Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>22 Cal.2d 344, 353 [139 P.2d 908]; <em>Shorb </em>v. <em>Barkley, </em>108 Cal.App.2d 873, 877 [240 P.2d 337].</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">In the sixth cause of action appellants assert that they were denied a fair hearing before the various municipal bodies because (1) certain letters were written favoring the applicants \u201cwithout giving details of their contents to the plaintiffs\u201d and were \u201cimproperly considered,\u201d (2) such letters were considered without affording plaintiffs an opportunity to examine the writers of said letters or to adduce evidence in rebuttal and (3) \u201cstatements contained in the letters were accepted as factual evidence without production of the writers as witnesses. \u2019 \u2019 The identical allegations were contained in the original complaint and a special demurrer was interposed wherein it was pointed out that plaintiffs failed to allege wherein the code requires that persons sending letters to an administrative body or that the administrative body receiving such letters must give \u201cdetails of their contents\u201d to some indefinite class of persons; that plaintiffs failed to allege the content, materiality or manner of consideration of any such letters; that plaintiffs failed to allege that the evidence apart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>from the challenged letters was not alone sufficient to support the approval of the conditional use in question; that plaintiffs failed to allege the denial to them of any request by them to introduce evidence, to be heard or to call or cross-examine any witness; and that plaintiffs failed to allege what statements had been \u201caccepted as factual evidence of the matters therein contained. \u2019 \u2019 The individual defendants also demurred asserting that the plaintiffs had failed to allege in what manner the questioned letters had been concealed from or were damaging to plaintiffs and had failed to allege what rebuttal evidence they sought to introduce and how the administrative agencies had improperly considered the letters.  The allegation that the administrative bodies \u201cimproperly\u201d considered the letters is a conclusion. See <em>City Council </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>179 Cal.App.2d 389 [3 Cal.Rptr. 796]; <em>Hancock </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>158 Cal.App.2d 785 [323 P.2d <em>456]; Lincoln </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>168 Cal.App.2d 31 [335 P.2d 161].</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">In <em>Desert Turf Club </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, </em>141 Cal.App.2d 446, 456 [296 P.2d 882], it is held that the fact of whether the writers of letters to an administrative agency are for or against the particular matter under consideration may be considered. For all that appears in this. case it may have been that the letters in question simply .set forth that the writers were for or against the project. \u2022 \u00a1Nowhere is there any assertion that the evidence without the-letters was not sufficient in and of itself to warrant the orders, which were made. In the ease last cited it is further set forth at page 455: \u201cAs it appears to us that the board of supervisors based its action on an erroneous conclusion as to its legal rights and duties, and that upon the record legitimately before it the board acted in abuse of its discretion, a writ of mandate \u00bfshould issue. [Citations.] \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A3s\">Plaintiffs made no allegation of what evidence they desired to offer or how it might have affected the result. See <em>Tudor </em>v. <em>City of Rialto, </em>164 Cal.App.2d 807, 811-812, 814 [331 P.2d 122],</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">In the seventh cause of action appellants allege that the conditional use was void because no standards were set forth to guide the administrative bodies in determining the height of the buildings. First of all the appellants have failed to allege properly the portion of the code which they assert is invalid. See section 459, Code of Civil Procedure; Simpson v. <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>40 Cal.2d 271 [253 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>464]. In any event, however, section 12.24C-2 of the code provides for height and area requirements in that they must be such as to \u201csecure an appropriate development\u201d in harmony with the master plan. The matter is not left to the unbridled discretion of the zoning administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The procedure of the trial court in overruling the demurrers and thereafter upon motion of the defendants granting declaratory relief on the pleadings was approved in <em>Essick </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>34 Cal.2d 614, 624-625 [213 P.2d 492], and in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Board of Retirement, </em>156 Cal.App.2d 195, 201 [319 P.2d 426],</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">We have carefully considered the entire record in this ease and we find no merit to any of the appellants\u2019 contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">Wood, P. J., and Lillie, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">Appellants\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied September 4, 1963.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Los Angeles Municipal Code</p>\n<p id=\"A_7\">12.03 Housing Project (Amended by Ord.

To accomplish this objective, each type of land use is classified by this plan as being permitted in one or more of the various zones established by this plan. However, it is often necessary to permit certain uses in zones other than those in which they are classified, because of their unusual characteristics or the large area required for their operation. These uses require special consideration as to their proper location in relation to adjacent uses or to the development of the community, and to the various elements of the Master Plan. Because of the various types of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>uses and locations requiring this special consideration, the specific conditions under which each use may be permitted, also must be considered.
