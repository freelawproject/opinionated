They separated in 1961 and Mamie thereupon filed this action for divorce, charging extreme cruelty. Francis filed an answer denying the allegations of cruelty and a cross-complaint seeking like relief. The case came to trial in due course and was tried without a court reporter. At the close of the evidence, counsel submitted their arguments to the trial court by written memoranda. After considering the memoranda, the court filed a written opinion, made and filed findings of fact and conclusions of law, and entered an interlocutory decree which awarded each spouse a divorce upon the ground of extreme cruelty, denied plaintiff\u2019s request for alimony and counsel fees and divided the community property of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Upon granting both parties a divorce, since neither spouse was found to be innocent, the court was required to divide the community property equally between them. <em>(De Burgh </em>v. <em>De Burgh, </em>39 Cal.2d 858, 874 [250 P.2d 598].) It is clear from the record before us that the court attempted to make an equal division of the community property, except for certain furniture and furnishings of the family home. As to those items, the court made no determination as to values, but made a division thereof by distributing to plaintiff the articles which she had taken when she left the family home, and the remainder to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Plaintiff appeals from the interlocutory decree, except that portion finding that each party is entitled to a divorce from the other. Her principal attack, however, is upon that part of the decree which divides the community property, and her primary contention is that the trial court, in violation of the <em>De Burgh </em>rule, divided the community property unequally in favor of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">The record on appeal is a partial record, presented under rule 5(d), California Rules of Court,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> and consists of a clerk\u2019s transcript (including the judgment roll), the memorandum opinion of the trial court and certain exhibits received in evidence. In an attempt, however, to enlarge the record and the scope of appellate review by bringing before this court the arguments upon the factual contentions in the trial court, plaintiff has attached as exhibits to her opening brief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>on appeal the trial memoranda lodged with the trial court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">California Rules of Court provide an appellant with a choice of several types of records upon which to take an appeal where, as here, there can be no reporter\u2019s transcript of the oral proceedings in the trial court. The choices are: a settled statement (rule 7)<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>; an agreed statement (rule 6)*; a clerk\u2019s transcript, which may or may not be restricted to the judgment roll (rules 5(d), 5(f)).* The last is the method selected by plaintiff. Whichever method is chosen, it is the duty of an appellant to present a record which affirmatively shows on its face that error has occurred. <em>(Utz </em>v. <em>Aureguy, </em>109 Cal.App.2d 803, 806 [241 P.2d 639].)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Plaintiff has not taken advantage of either rule 6 or rule 7 to bring before this court the oral proceedings, or any part thereof, in the trial court. Her appeal must be disposed of, therefore, as an appeal on the judgment roll and only those facts appearing in the findings may be considered by us. <em>(Estate of Larson, </em>92 Cal.App.2d 267, 269 [206 P.2d 852].)  On such an appeal the question of the sufficiency of the evidence to support the findings is not open; we must conclusively presume that the evidence is sufficient to support the findings, since no record of the oral proceedings is before this court. <em>(Kompf </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>73 Cal.App.2d 284, 286 [166 P.2d 350].)  Unless reversible error appears on the face of the record, we are confined, therefore, to a determination as to whether the complaint states a cause of action, whether the findings are within the issues, and whether the judgment is supported by the findings. <em>(Estate of Larson, supra, </em>p. 268.)  And plaintiff \u201c. . . cannot, by designating for inclusion in the clerk\u2019s transcript documents not properly a part of the judgment roll, or by requesting that the exhibits received in evidence be transmitted to the appellate court, enlarge the scope of the appellate court\u2019s review.\u201d <em>(Hunt </em>v. <em>Plavsa, </em>103 Cal.App.2d 222, 224 [229 P.2d 482].)</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>In the light of the foregoing rules, which we have noted because of plaintiff\u2019s attempts to enlarge the record and the scope of our review and thereupon to argue the sufficiency of the evidence, we turn to plaintiff\u2019s several assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">In support of her contention that the trial court made an unequal division of the community property, plaintiff argues (1) that the trial court erroneously assigned \u201ccash values\u201d to certain lodge and group insurance policies having no cash value, and charged their values so found to her share of the community property; (2) that the court failed to take into account the present value of a life insurance policy upon the life of defendant and a credit union savings balance withdrawn by defendant; and (3) that the household furniture and furnishings of the parties were not valued and equally divided.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">It would be a sufficient answer to each of plaintiff\u2019s contentions to reiterate the elementary and fundamental rule that where, as here, the appeal is taken upon a clerk\u2019s transcript, with no record whatever of the oral proceedings below, the appellate court must conclusively presume that the evidence is ample to support the findings made by the trial court. <em>(Kompf </em>v. <em>Morrison, supra, </em>p. 286.) This is the position taken by defendant, who makes no attempt to answer plaintiff\u2019s separate claims of unequal division of the property, but contents himself with pointing to the inadequacy of the record as a basis for considering plaintiff\u2019s contentions and rests upon the presumption accorded the findings upon such record and appeal. We have reviewed the record in the light of each of plaintiff\u2019s contentions, however, and shall discuss them individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s Insurance Policies</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">Plaintiff asserts that the trial court assigned to three lodge and group insurance policies, in plaintiff\u2019s name, values of $600, $500 and $1,000, and included the total thereof, the sum of $2,100 in plaintiff\u2019s one-half share of the community property, although the policies have, in fact, no cash value.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Whatever speculation might be indulged in the matter falls before the presumption that the evidence is ample to support the findings of the trial court. Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>the presumption is fortified, in this instance, by plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 2 at trial, which she has attached to her opening brief on appeal as Exhibit \u201c C \u201d thereto and urges us to consider. Under the heading, \u201cInsubance, Stocks, Cash, Bonds,\u201d the exhibit contains descriptions of the three policies in question and, opposite each policy description, the exact value (without designation of such values as either \u201cface\u201d or \u201ccash\u201d values) accepted and fixed by the court and of which plaintiff complains.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Upon the basis of this evidence alone the court was entitled to infer and to conclude, as it did, that the insurance policies are of the values assigned to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Defendant\u2019s Life Insubance Policy and Cbedit Union Savings Deposit</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\"> Plaintiff\u2019s next contention is that the trial court failed to take into account a California Western Life Insure anee policy on the life of defendant, in the face amount of $2,500, which it is conceded defendant \u201ccashed\u201d for the sum of $1,900, and a Federal Credit Union savings account, also in defendant\u2019s name, in the amount of $1,000, which it is claimed defendant withdrew and used. The existence of the former was admitted by the pleadings; the latter first appears in plaintiff\u2019s answer to defendant\u2019s cross-complaint, in which plaintiff alleges, for the first time, additional community property in the form of the $1,000 deposit with a credit union affiliated with defendant\u2019s employer. The latter allegation is deemed to have been denied. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 462.)</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The court made no finding with respect to either the life insurance policy or the credit union balance, and plaintiff contends that the court erred in omitting to find as to these items of property. The contention is without merit. \u201c [W]here ... an appeal is based upon the judgment roll alone, the omission of the trial court to make and file findings of fact upon issues raised by the pleadings is not a ground for reversal of the judgment on appeal [citations].\u201d <em>(D\u2019Alessio </em>v. <em>D\u2019Alessio, </em>56 Cal.App.2d 118, 120 [132 P.2d 271]; <em>Garwick </em>v. <em>Gordon </em>121 Cal.App.2d 247, 250 [263 P.2d 125].) Plaintiff\u2019s position'is not aided by the fact that the pleadings contain an admission as to the existence of the insurance policy. In the absence of a record of the oral proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>ings, and in the light of the presumption that the evidence received by the trial court sustains its findings, it is immaterial whether the documents which are a part of the record contained admissions of defendant against his interest. <em>(White </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>136 Cal.App.2d 567, 571 [288 P.2d 913].)</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The court impliedly found that these items of community property did not exist, and this conclusion, too, finds support in the court\u2019s memorandum opinion and the trial memoranda which plaintiff urges upon us. While outside the record, the trial memoranda attached to plaintiff\u2019s brief may be taken as an indication of plaintiff\u2019s position on the facts as well as the law <em>(Browne </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>16 Cal.2d 593, 599 [107 P.2d 1, 131 A.L.R. 276]), and an assertion in a brief may be treated as an admission of a factual or legal point, controlling in the disposition of the issue. <em>(Kohn </em>v. <em>Kohn, </em>95 Cal.App.2d 708, 719 [214 P.2d 71]; 3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, Appeal, \u00a7 150, p. 2334.)  The written opinion of the trial judge, too, although it may not be invoked to contradict the findings or judgment, may be used as an aid in the interpretation of an uncertain decision, or to discover the grounds thereof. <em>(Silvers </em>v. <em>Wesson, </em>122 Cal.App.2d 902, 906 [266 P.2d 169].) And there is authority for the proposition that upon appeal such written opinion may be consulted, in the absence of a finding of fact, to ascertain what the court would have found. (See <em>Crabtree </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>197 Cal.App.2d 821, 824 [17 Cal.Rptr. 763].)</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">An examination of these documents discloses the fact to be that the California Western Life Insurance policy was \u201ccashed\u201d for the sum of $1,900; that the date of the policy conversion was in dispute, defendant contending that it was converted in October 1960 (before filing of the action) and plaintiff contending, inferentially, that the policy was cashed during the pendency of the action,- and that the $1,000 credit union savings balance was \u201cwithdrawn and used.\u201d Upon the filing of its memorandum opinion the trial court expressed the view that both of the parties, during the marriage, were discharging certaip. of their obligations \u201cout of community funds,\u201d and it is clear from said opinion and the memoranda that the trial court had before it evidence that the proceeds of both such items of property were used to some extent in discharging the obligations of one or more of the parties. The question before the court was not the existence of the items, but the time of their liquidation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>a consideration of the uses to which the proceeds had been put; the court concluded, by necessary implication, that neither the insurance policy nor the credit union account existed, at a relevant time, as items of community property, but that the proceeds thereof had been expended, in the manner contended by the parties, upon obligations of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Household Furniture and Fixtures</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s final contention, in the property dispute,is that the trial court failed to determine the value of the household furniture and furnishings which it found to be community property, and that it made an unequal division of them. The court made no finding of dollar value, indicating in its memorandum opinon that the value was \u201cunknown,\u201d but with certain exceptions divided this property by awarding to plaintiff the articles which she had theretofore removed from the home, and distributing the remainder of the items to defendant. The record is silent as to the particular items distributed to the respective parties, but in the absence of a record of the oral proceedings, and in view of the presumption supporting the findings, we are unable to hold that this disposition constituted an unequal division of the furniture and furnishings. <em>(Utz </em>v. <em>Aureguy, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Abuse oe Discretion</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">Lastly, plaintiff argues that the trial court abused its discretion in denying her requests for counsel fees and for appointment of a referee to make an accounting of certain items of community property and expenditures of funds.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayx\">It is fundamental that a motion for allowance of counsel fees is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court; such allowance is never a matter of absolute right.  As stated in <em>Beksinski </em>v. <em>Beksinski, </em>151 Cal.App.2d 674 [312 P.2d 268], at page 677:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-10\">\u201cApplications for attorney\u2019s fees in divorce cases are within the reasonable and fair discretion of the trial judge. In the absence of a clear showing of abuse of discretion, the determination of the trial court as to attorney\u2019s fees will not be disturbed upon appeal. [Citations.] \u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">The record discloses no abuse of discretion in the denial of plaintiff\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-12\">The trial court\u2019s alleged \u201cdenial\u201d of plaintiff\u2019s request for appointment of a referee requires some explanation. Upon filing its written opinion, on March 12, 1962, the court suggested that it would appoint a referee, if requested by either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>party, to check into the matter of community funds and expenditures by each party, during the marriage, for certain bills and obligations. On March 20, 1962, counsel for plaintiff addressed a-letter to the trial judge, requesting that some disinterested person be appointed as referee \u201cto cheek the items and account to the Court for them.\u201d (Exhibit D, plaintiff\u2019s opening brief on appeal.) On April 18, 1962, the court signed and filed findings of fact and conclusions of law. At some undisclosed time the trial judge apparently<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> denied plaintiff\u2019s request by deleting the suggestion from his memorandum opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">It is a fundamental rule, requiring no citation of authority, that the court in dissolving a marriage may determine the status of property and divide the community property between the parties without accounting by a referee.  The written opinion of the trial judge, in any event, is not a decision, and neither its conclusion nor its reasoning furnishes a basis for attacking an otherwise correct finding, order or judgment. <em>(DeCou </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>190 Cal. 741, 751 [214 P. 444].) We find no abuse of discretion in either the circumstances or the record of the trial court\u2019s action in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">No error appearing, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">Pierce, P. J., and Friedman, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b431-9\">Assigned by Chairman of Judicial Council,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"APL\">Formerly Rules on Appeal, rule 5(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b432-11\">Plaintiff\u2019s designation, under rule 5(a),* of the papers and records which she desired incorporated in the record on appeal specified, in addition to the pleadings, memorandum opinion and exhibits \u201call correspondence from respective counsel to the Court and the Court\u2019s reply thereto. \u2019 \u2019 The clerk properly omitted such documents from the record on appeal, but plaintiff has attached them as exhibits <em>\u201cA\u201d </em>and \u201cB\u2019\u2019 to her opening brief, upon \"the <em>theory </em>that since the trial court ordered and received the trial memoranda and stated that it took them into consideration in arriving at its decision, the memoranda are properly a part of the record on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b432-12\">Formerly Rules on Appeal, rules 5(a), 5(d), 5(f), 6, 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b433-10\">The policies are described in the court\u2019s memorandum opinion as: \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Life Insurance: S.P.R.S.I. Lodge, $600.00; U.P.E.C., $500.00; Provident Life &amp; Accident Insurance, $1,000.00,\u201d and similarly in the findings of fact, but without specification of values.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b434-8\">The exhibit includes other similar items of property, such as bank accounts, bonds and stocks, as to some of which the court also accepted and found the exact values shown in apposition to the items on the exhibit, and as to which plaintiff makes no complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b437-9\">The record is incomplete on this point. That portion of the memorandum opinion which contains the trial judge\u2019s suggestion for appointment of a referee is deleted, without authentication, and with no indication as to when, by whom or by whose authority the deletion Was made. For the purpose of considering the point we assume, as contended by plaintiff, that the deletion was by the trial judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
