The minor child is the party and the guardian <em>ad litem </em>merely appears for said minor child. Hence, the action should have been captioned \"Phyllis Weiss and Vivian Aura Weiss, a minor, by Phyllis Weiss, her guardian ad litem. <em>\u2019 \u2019 </em>(2 Witkin, Cal. Proc., Pleading, \u00a7 26, p. 1003; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 372.) However, the failure to so caption the complaint was purely a technical error in no way prejudicial to defendant. <em>(Martin </em>v. <em>Pacific Southwest Royalties, Inc., </em>41 Cal.App.2d 161, 170 [106 P.2d 443].) Defendant did not raise any objection relative to the designation of party plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b65-10\">FOURT, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARl\">This is an appeal by plaintiff (i.e. widow and minor child) from a judgment entered after the jury returned a unanimous verdict in favor of defendant in an action for wrongful death.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">A r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the facts is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-12\">The automobile accident with which we are concerned occurred on December 31, 1959, between 5 and 5:30 p.m. (i.e., it was dark and both automobiles had their headlights on) at the intersection of Rosewood Avenue and Crescent Heights Boulevard in the City of Los Angeles. Crescent Heights Boulevard is an arterial roadway where it intersects with Rosewood Avenue. Traffic in either direction on Rosewood Avenue is controlled by boulevard stop signs. The area is one of restricted visibility due to a combination of hedges, large palm trees and dwellings placed relatively close to the roadway edge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-13\">Plaintiffs\u2019 decedent was traveling eastbound on Rosewood Avenue and defendant was traveling southbound on Crescent Heights Boulevard when the intersection accident occurred. There was no independent eye witness testimony. relative to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>the precollision movements of either decedent or defendant. All of the evidence relating to the collision was obtained from a police officer who investigated at the scene after the collision and at the hospital shortly thereafter; from defendant's testimony at the trial, his signed statement to an investigator, deposition and answers to interrogatories; from neighbors familiar with the intersection and from expert testimony. There was conflict as to whether the streets were wet at the time of the collision. Defendant was familiar with the area and had frequently traveled through the intersection, which was in a residential section. Any other pertinent facts will be set forth in the body of the opinion under appropriate headings.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 first contention is that the trial court erred in permitting defendant to contradict his previous pretrial statements (i.e., defendant\u2019s answers to interrogatories, deposition, statements to investigator and police officer).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Plaintiffs apparently take the position that such pretrial statements are elevated to the status of judicial admissions as distinguished from evidentiary admissions.  A judicial admission is not merely evidence of a fact. It is a conclusive concession of the truth of a matter which has the effect of removing it from the issues. (See Witkin, Cal. Evidence, \u00a7 224, p. 251.)</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">The authorities cited by plaintiffs do not support their position. As an example, the case of <em>International Carbonic Engineering Co. </em>v. <em>Natural Carbonic Products </em>(D.C.S.D. Cal. 1944) 57 F.Supp. 248, 253, affd. 158 F.2d 285, involved admissions made in response to requests for admissions.  It is stated in <em>Cembrook </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>56 Cal.2d 423, 429 [15 Cal.Rptr. 127, 364 P.2d 303], that \u201c [10] Most of the other discovery procedures are aimed primarily at assisting counsel to prepare for trial. Requests for admissions, on the other hand, are primarily aimed at setting at rest a triable issue so that it will not have to be tried.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">A reading of the transcript discloses that plaintiffs\u2019 attorney skillfully exploited defendant\u2019s various contradictions. The jury was properly instructed relative to judging credibility, effect of false testimony, factors to consider in weighing testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>mony and the use of a deposition at the trial (i.e. a modification of a BAJI 31-A (rev.) .<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 next contention is that the trial court erred in permitting defendant to reopen his case after all sides had rested and plaintiffs had begun their argument.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">In support of this contention plaintiffs advance several arguments. <em>First, </em>that the \u201cimpact of Morelli\u2019s entrance unduly influenced the jury, <em>as it probably appeared to them, that Morelli was an expert of the Court.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>In the light of what appears in the reporter\u2019s transcript (see footnote 4) it is difficult to understand how plaintiffs can advance this argument. It is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\"><em>Second, </em>that Morelli\u2019s testimony contradicted defendant\u2019s various pretrial statements. Morelli, as an expert, gave his opinion as to the speed of defendant\u2019s car and of decedent\u2019s ear.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">As was set forth in answer to plaintiffs\u2019 first contention, pretrial statements, whether in the form of statements given to police, or investigators, depositions or answers to interrogatories do not assume the status of judicial admissions. They constitute evidentiary admissions.  A party is not precluded from presenting evidence at the trial which is at variance with pretrial statements. He does, however, by so doing run the risk of being impeached.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\"><em>Third, </em>that \u201cno showing of diligence was made by defense counsel to produce Morelli before the close of the evidence and the beginning of plaintiff\u2019s [sic] counsel\u2019s argument, there was no excuse for [sic] reason for permitting same.\u201d  It is well established that to assign rulings or conduct as error, a timely objection must be made. <em>(Newman </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Transit Lines, </em>120 Cal.App.2d 685, 695 [262 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>95]; <em>Gist </em>v. <em>French, </em>136 Cal.App.2d 247 [288 P.2d 1003].)</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\"> In addition to the above three arguments, plaintiffs also assert that (a) Morelli\u2019s testimony was incredible and (b) that plaintiffs did not have sufficient time adequately to prepare their witnesses to rebut Morelli\u2019s testimony. The answer to the first assertion (a) above mentioned is that the question of credibility is for the trier of fact and not the appellate court and the answer to (b) is that if such was the case plaintiffs should have moved for a continuance and secured time within which adequately to prepare for a proper rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 next contention relates to a purported error with respect to an instruction, namely a failure to instruct on sounding a horn.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">The rules relating to failure to give instructions are set forth in <em>Mau </em>v. <em>Hollywood Commercial Buildings, Inc., </em>194 Cal.App.2d 459, 466 [15 Cal.Rptr. 181], as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-9\">\u201c [1] Bach party is entitled to have his theory or theories of the case submitted to the jury in accordance with the pleadings and proof where there is substantial evidence in the record justifying the giving of the instructions.  [2] The existence or nonexistence of substantial evidence is a question of law.  [3] In ascertaining whether it was error for the trial court to refuse to give appellant\u2019s instructions, this court views the evidence in the light most favorable to appellant. <em>(Sills </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Transit Lines, </em>40 Cal.2d 630 (255 P.2d 795); <em>Dyer </em>v. <em>Knue, </em>186 Cal.App.2d 348 [8 Cal.Rptr. 753]; <em>Edgett </em>v. <em>Fairchild, </em>153 Cal.App.2d 734, 738 [314 P.2d 973].)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-12\">Plaintiffs proffered an instruction predicated upon section 27001, Vehicle Code, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-13\">\u201cYou are hereby instructed that at the time of the accident, Section 27001 of the California Vehicle Code read as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-14\">\u201cThe driver of a motor vehicle when reasonably necessary to insure safe operation shall give audible warning with his horn.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-15\">There was evidence from which the jury could have determined that defendant owed a duty to sound his horn.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-16\">Officer Hamilton testified relative to statements made to him by defendant. According to Officer Hamilton\u2019s testimony defendant stated that he (defendant) was driving 35 to 40 miles per hour and as he approached the intersection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Rosewood he saw lights and knew that there was a car, bnt couldn\u2019t see any; that he was 20 to 40 feet north of the intersection when he first observed decedent\u2019s vehicle eastbound on Rosewood. There was evidence that vision wcfuld be obstructed at the intersection of Crescent Heights Boulevard and Rosewood by tall hedges,' palm trees and parked cars and that defendant was familiar with the intersection. In defendant\u2019s answers to interrogatories he admitted that he had seen decedent\u2019s automobile before it entered the intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">What is stated in <em>Rush </em>v. <em>Lagomarsino, </em>195 Cal. 308, 320, [237 P. 1066], is apposite:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">\u201c. . . [I]t was certainly a matter for the jury to determine whether or not under all the circumstances it was necessary for the defendant to sound his horn as a warning of danger, and the failure to submit that question to the jury as requested was error which doubtless redounded to the prejudice of the plaintiff. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">We believe that the trial court erred. No useful purpose would be served in discussing plaintiffs\u2019 other assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">Wood, P. J., and Lillie, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">Respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied September 4, 1963.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b66-9\">Defendant\u2019s testimony at the trial was at variance with his various pretrial statements relative to whether he saw decedent\u2019s automobile prior to the collision, decedent\u2019s speed, whether defendant applied his brakes before the collision, whether the pavement was wet or dry and the nature of defendant\u2019s injuries (claiming head injuries at the trial).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b67-8\">The modification, of BAJI 31-A (rev.) as given by the trial court provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABY\">\u201cPrior to the trial, the deposition was taken of a party, and portions of it were read into evidence. If, in said deposition (he) made contradictory statements or any statements in conflict with (his) testimony here in court, you may consider such conflicts and any explanations given therefor in testing (his) credibility, in like manner as if all such testimony were given originally at the trial. The deposition, too, was given under oath.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aot\">\u201cIf any statement in a party\u2019s deposition constituted an admission against interest, it may be considered by you in determining the truth, or of the fact to which the admission relates.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"Al91\">The reporter\u2019s transcript discloses the following in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ2\">\u201cMr. Egberts: Defendant will rest, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AgSj\">\u201cThe Court: Defendant rests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Amq\">\u201cLadies and gentlemen of the jury, the Court explains to you that both sides have rested their case. Now is the time that counsel have the right to sum up their ease. It is sometimes called a closing argument. It is sometimes called a summation. Under the parliamentary rules that govern trials, the plaintiff opens and closes, and we say that plaintiff makes the opening summation, and defense makes it summation, and then the plaintiff\u2019s [sic] counsel may reply to anything that is developed by the defendant, so you will hear \u25a0 three separate discourses, arguments, summations, two by the plaintiff [sic] and one by the defendant. Plaintiff [sic] will first speak, and now who is going to make the opening?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEm\">\u201cMr. Feldman: Mr. Janger will make the opening, and I will make the closing, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8ic\">\u201cMr. Egberts: A double-barreled attack.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6p\">\u201cThe Court: Again, the Court cautions the jury that these are the statements of counsel.
