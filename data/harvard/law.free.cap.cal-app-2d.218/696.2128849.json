The applicant herein is the subject of the conservatorship proceedings thus initiated; filed the written objections in question; denied that he is incompetent or that a conservator should be appointed for his estate; filed a timely demand for a jury trial of the issues thus raised; and posted the necessary fees therefor. His request for a jury trial was denied. The instant proceedings followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">The sole issue for determination is whether the subject of a conservatorship proceeding is entitled to a trial by jury of the issues raised by the petition for the appointment of a conservator and his written objections filed in opposition thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">Proceedings to effect a conservatorship are governed by the provisions of the Probate Code which, direct: \u201c. . . the superior court, if satisfied by sufficient' evidence of the need therefor,\u201d to appoint a conservator of the person or property of an adult person, under specifically designated circumstances; authorize the filing of a petition requesting such appointment; require a hearing thereon after notice; and permit the proposed eonservatee, among others, to \u201cappear and oppose the petition.\u201d (Prob. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1751, 1754.) The foregoing provisions, both in content and phraseology; are similar to those governing the appointment of a guardian. (Prob. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1460, 1461.) The two proceedings contemplate the accomplishment of substantially identical purposes, as evidenced by the provisions of section 1703 of the Probate Code that: \u201cA petitioner may elect to apply either for letters of conservatorship or letters of guardianship, or he may apply for such letters in the alternative\u201d and, \u201cNo appointment of both a conservator and a guardian shall be made for the sam\u00e9 person or estate.\u201d The issues raised by objections to a petition for the appointment of a guardian, upon demand, are subject to trial by jury. <em>(Budde </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>97 Cal.App.2d 615 [218 P.2d 103].) The reasons for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>this rule are equally applicable to the trial of similar issues in a conservatorship proceeding. Additionally, section 1755 of the Probate Code expressly provides that the issues raised by a petition to terminate a conservatorship and objections thereto shall be heard and determined by the court \u201cwithout a jury\u201d; thus, impliedly recognizes the right to a jury trial thereof, although not specifically conferred, in the absence of a provision directing the contrary; and supports the conclusion that a jury trial of the issues raised by a petition for appointment of a conservator and objections thereto likewise is a matter of right, although not specifically conferred by the statute. We conclude that the petitioner herein is entitled to a trial by jury of the issues raised by his opposition to the petition seeking the appointment of a conservator of his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Prohibition is a proper remedy to protect the rights of petitioner in the premises. <em>(Tide Water Assoc. Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>43 Cal.2d 815, 820-821 [279 P.2d 35]; <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>176 Cal.App.2d 754, 759 [1 Cal.Rptr. 559]; <em>Budde </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>97 Cal.App.2d 615, 622; <em>Knight </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>95 Cal.App.2d 838, 839 [214 P.2d 21].)</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Let a peremptory writ of prohibition issue as prayed for.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Griffin, P. J., and Brown (Gerald), J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
