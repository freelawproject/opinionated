Appellants are holders of such credit cards of the bank. Their complaint in the district court was \u201con behalf of themselves and all other credit card holders\u201d of appellee for alleged violations of the federal Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1637(a)(1) and (4) and (b)(2), (5) and (6),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and for the relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>provided by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(a)(1) and (2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The merits of the named plaintiffs\u2019 claims were not reached<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as the district court denied their motion<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for determination that the case could be maintained as a class action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellants sought in this court and were granted an interlocutory appeal of such denial upon appropriate indication from the trial court that it was of the opinion that the order of denial involved a controlling question of law as to which there was substantial ground for differ-enees of opinions and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate determination of the litigation. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292. The sole question before us is whether the court below abused its discretion in refusing to permit the suit to be maintained as a' class action pursuant to Rule 23, Fed.R.Civ.P.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Those similarly situated on whose behalf the action purportedly was brought number approximately 180,000 persons. There is no question but that appellee\u2019s business involves an \u201copen end consumer credit plan\u201d covered by the Act<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and that plaintiffs and members of the proposed class are cardholders under said plan.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 second amended complaint, on the basis of which the class action aspect of the ease was proposed and terminated, clearly alleged violations of the Act as against plaintiffs and the members of the proposed class<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and on their behalf sought damages of at least $100.00 for each class member and as to each violation<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> totaling \u201cin excess of One Million Dollars per month\u201d within the one-year period of limitations provided in the Act.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It has been pointed out by appellee that since five separate violations as to each member of the class are alleged, each presumably occurring monthly, its penalty exposure might exceed one billion dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">The basic problem of the amenability of civil suits for violation of the Truth in Lending Act to class action treatment has been before numerous district courts with varying results.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Insofar as we are aware no court of appeals has yet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>squarely decided the issue, although it is known that several appeals presenting it are now pending elsewhere.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">The reasoning of the court below in denying class action status in this case is similar to that by which other district courts'have reached the same conclusion, Judge O\u2019Connor points out in his memorandum decision<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> that in order to maintain their suit as a class action plaintiffs must satisfy the four requirements of Rule 23(a) and any one of the three subdivisions of Rule 23(b).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The requirements of Rule 23(a) were found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>to have been met. The remaining question in the court\u2019s view was whether subdivision (b)(3), \u201cthe only one of the three subdivisions which might apply to plaintiffs\u201d, was satisfied as well. Attention was focused upon whether the class action was \u201csuperior to\u201d other available methods \u201cbecause that issue appears to be dispositive of the case\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">Impressed with Judge Frankel\u2019s reasoning in the leading case of Ratner v. Chemical Bank New York Trust Company, 329 F.Supp. 270 (S.D.N.Y.1971), the trial court found that case, and Rogers v. Coburn Finance Corp. of Dekalb, 53 F.R.D. 182 (N.D.Ga.1971), to be more persuasive than Katz v. Carte Blanche Corporation, 52 F.R.D. 510, 53 F.R.D. 539 (W.D.Pa.1971), another leading case sustaining the propriety of class action proceedings under similar circumstances. Factors the court reemphasized were the special and particular authorization of the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(e), creating a species of \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d to participate prominently in enforcement; the minimum damages of $100 plus costs and attorney\u2019s fees recoverable without proof of any actual damages; the huge potential liability for alleged violations of the Act should the class action be maintained to its conclusion; the lack of any need or justification for class action proceedings in the circumstances of a Truth in Lending case; and the \u201cabsurd and stultifying extreme\u201d the case would assume as a class action in spite of the essentially inconsistent remedy prescribed by Congress as a means of private enforcement. Exercising that \u201cconsiderable discretion of a pragmatic nature\u201d required by the \u201cbroad and open ended terms\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> of Rule 23, Judge O\u2019Connor determined that a class action in this case was not superior to the statutory method of individual recoveries. He, as did Judge Frankel in <em>Ratner, </em>considered the available statutory remedy vis-a-vis the \u201chorrendous, possibly annihilating punishment, unrelated to any damage\u201d, which would be a likely product of cases such as this if permitted to proceed as class actions. He also advanced further reasons to the same effect \u201cinherent in the purposes of a class action\u201d and exemplified by current criticisms of the operation of Rule 23,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> He indicated his view that the application of class action treatment to Truth in Lending cases would be an over-extension of the Rule.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>This latter aspect of the opinion below doubtlessly inspired appellants\u2019 basic thesis that the ruling was a policy decision which cavalierly denied class action status to such actions generally despite their being within, or even required by, the criteria laid down in Rule 23. In variation of this theme appellants say that the decision flies in the face of the established rule that \u201cif there is to be any error made, let it be in favor and not against the maintenance of the class action\u201d;<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> that the trial court failed to consider criteria established by the Rule itself; that it improperly considered the merits of the case in arriving at its de-cisi\u00f3n, and that the Truth in Lending Act has not been exempted expressly or impliedly from the application of Rule 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">Apart from any inherent incongruity between the remedies provided by the Truth in Lending Act and Rule 23, we agree that there is nothing in the Act itself, the Rule, or the notes of the Advisory Committee on Rules of Civil Procedure with respect to it which expressly or impliedly precludes class actions in this type of case. The legislative history of the Act throws scant light on the problem.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> To find any con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>gressional intent to preclude at all events treatment of such cases under Rule 23 would be a work of clairvoyance and not of construction or interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">On the other hand, notwithstanding the likelihood that most if not all of the requirements expressed in the Rule would be present, there is nothing to suggest a congressional intent that Truth in Lending cases should always, or generally, be handled as class actions. Any automatic application of the Rule irrespective of its realistic implications would be just as improbable as a matter of congressional intent as the total preclusion of its use in consumer suits of this nature. If we were to hazard a reconstruction of pertinent congressional intent from the enactment of the Truth in Lending Act, it would be that a mandate for general class action treatment of all of these cases, on the one hand, or for none of these cases as class action, on the other, was not intended in view of a congressional confidence in case by case determinations by qualified and informed trial judges with a wide general discretion and specific leeway under Rule 23 itself to avoid inferior, unfair or senseless applications of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">We cannot agree that Esplin v. Hirschi, <em>supra, </em>dictates a position in this circuit inhospitable to such a discretion as to Truth in Lending cases. That case turned primarily upon whether common questions were predominant in a securities case where class action treatment was not unusual and in which it threatened no far-reaching consequences one way or another. This court was there persuaded that class action treatment, contrary to the views of the trial judge, was called for. Judge Hill\u2019s opinion in <em>Esplin </em>has been widely cited in not only justification but encouragement of class action treatment in appropriate cases and continues to represent the considered views of this court. But its doctrine should not be extended to limit unreasonably the sound discretion of trial courts in eases such as this, where discretion may be the key to a realistic administration of Rule 23, particularly with respect to a determination of the most fair and efficient procedure.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> One of the reasons expressed in that case for a liberal application of the Rule was the retained power of the trial court later to establish sub-classes or even to abrogate the class status should developments indicate; here, developments were not likely to change the situation and the overriding considerations which would justify if not require a changed view had class action treatment been undertaken were before the trial court at the threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-12\">Appellants also say that the trial court failed, contrary to the teachings of <em>Esplin, </em>to weigh the four non-exhaustive factors listed in subdivision (b)(3)(A), (B), (C), and (D), of Rule 23.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The trial judge did in fact refer to these in his memorandum decision and there is nothing to indicate that he did not give proper appraisal to all of the pertinent factors enumerated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Rule. He expressly approved the reasoning of Judge Frankel in <em>Ratner </em>which in turn had specifically quoted the subdivisions referred to as among the premises of his conclusions that the class action device was not shown as a superior one in that Truth in Lending case. The Rule requires the court as the basis for approving a class action to find that common questions of fact predominate and that a class action is superior, and the matters following this requirement are of course to be considered in the latter connection. But as <em>Espl\u00edn </em>points out, they are non-exhaustive. Nothing that we have said requires the inclusion by rote in findings or otherwise of the detailed subject matters of these non-exhaustive considerations in either granting or denying class action treatment so long as they do not on the record negate the basic finding of the trial court, which is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">There is less reason for appellants\u2019 attack upon the sufficiency of the form of the trial court\u2019s findings for not expressly covering the question of whether common questions of fact or law predominated. Appellants say that \u201cthe authorities on federal procedure\u201d hold that the court must make two findings, the first of which is whether questions of law or fact are common and predominate over individual ones, and that \u201c[a]s the district court must rule on both requirements of (b) (3) . the absence of a consideration whether questions of law or fact common to the class predominate over individual ones is clearly a further abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion.\u201d We cannot agree. In denying class action status it was sufficient for the trial court to determine on an adequate record and for good reasons stated that the procedure was not superior to other procedures irrespective of whether the common issues of fact or law were predominant.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\"> Katz v. Carte Blanche Corporation, 52 F.R.D. 510 (W.D.Pa.1971), <em>supra, </em>is relied upon by appellants as primary support for its position that in the circumstances of this ease the trial court was obliged to approve class action proceedings. We agree, as there held, that a plaintiff\u2019s burden of satisfying the prerequisite of the rule for the maintenance of the class action does not involve convincing demonstration of the merits of his underlying cause of action.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> But we cannot agree that the trial court in ruling upon whether a class action should be maintained must close its eyes to possible consequences as they relate to the superiority or inferiority of such procedure in terms of fairness and efficiency.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We are not called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>upon to say that <em>Katz </em>necessarily was in error in determining in the exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion at least for the time being that a class action was maintainable. But even in that case it is obvious that the court justifiably entertained substantial reservations. See 53 F.R.D. 539, 544 n. 11. It is to be hoped that the sequel of that decision will prove both fair and efficient. But at least until better established its pattern should not be indiscriminately thrust upon trial judges who entertain different views for sufficient reasons within their own discretion. Nor do we find convincing another case emphasized by appellants because the opinion was written by an assigned Circuit Judge, LaMar v. H &amp; B Novelty &amp; Loan Company, 55 F.R.D. 22 (D.Ore.1972). Except for citation of <em>Katz </em>on another point the decision does not take notice of the special problems in Truth in Lending cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Appellants have cited Fujishima v. Board of Education, 460 F.2d 1355 (7th Cir. 1972), in support of their contention that the court may not deny class status because there is no \u201cneed\u201d for it if the prerequisites and conditions of the Federal Rules are met. The interpretation of that case, which involved subdivision (b) (2) of the Rule, is an oversimplification as applied to (b)(3) cases such as this. Within the criteria of the Rule, the \u201cneed\u201d for class action treatment in a sense may be considered a vital, if not determinative, consideration as need inevitably relates to the problems of superiority, fairness and efficiency. These latter considerations may not be applied mechanically without a consideration of relative needs or necessities.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Reasons can be assigned but they often light up unexpressed counter reasons. To find the existence of reasons within the Rule is often indeterminate for still the Rule requires the weighing of one reason against another or against consideration of common sense and practicality. Many of the reasons assigned for the granting or denial of class action status are quite ambivalent and hardly sufficient one way or another in and of themselves: Appellants say that the enormity of the class dictates class action treatment; appellee responds that its very size militates against such a treatment. Appellee argues that because of the shocking exposure to annihilating liability the class action device here should not be utilized to seal such a doom; appellants that if there is such grave liability, congressional policy would be impermissibly frustrated if it were not enforced in the most effective and comprehensive fashion. Appellants assert that the lower court considered policy beyond the scope and authorization of the Rule; appellee that the Rule itself has explicit in it the policy of denying class action treatment when it would not be \u201csuperior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy\u201d. And it could be added that while provision in the Act for the award of attorney\u2019s fees as well as costs furnishes encouragement and practicality for individual actions, the cumulative consequence might be more horrendous to a defendant in view of this should all cardholders proceed and succeed individually than if they combined in a class action entailing a single fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">These points and counterpoints serve only to emphasize the perplexity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>our problem; they do not solve it. There may be no wholly satisfactory solution but we believe an acceptable one can be found in the present context by sustaining the authority of the trial court to employ realism and good sense in denying class action status.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">We are of the opinion that it was within the sound discretion of the court below to avoid results thus appearing procedurally unnecessary and overwhelming. The exercise of such discretion related not only to the appellee<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> but to the Rule itself, which bears the seeds of its own destruction through unrealistic applications within its theoretical span.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The fairness to be taken into consideration in arriving at a decision of course is procedural fairness. No one has suggested that with reference to the substantive rights of individual debtors there should not be full recognition. To approve a class action and then to cut down or dilute the right of recovery for the members of the class before the court to avoid their burdensome accumulation would involve substance. To leave debtors to their individual remedies rather than to invoke the class action procedure involves the question of procedural fairness which the Rule entrusts to the sound discretion of the trial judge.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Within that discretion, we believe, is the attaching of determinative weight to the reality that if class action treatment were applied in this case where the complaint contains no indication of any actual damages in substantial or provable amount, this aggregated relief would be oppressive in consequence and difficult to justify. We do not consider it untenable to reject a single and unvarying answer to the problem in favor of this less rigid one. That the present emphasis upon discretion could lead to inconsistent results, and indeed has among the courts, is no insurmountable objection; the practicality of interpretation has furnished helpful testing ground through varying ideas of judges in many other contexts and this same type of testing can most profitably proceed in this area until, if ever, some more acceptable and general solution by amendments to the Rules or clarification by statute emerges. No such preferable solution within the power of a reviewing court occurs to us or has been called to our attention. Class action treatment in the context and under the circumstances now before us is not mandated. A decision one way or another \"is not so decisive of the right of recovery as to make it incumbent upon this court to insist here that those who have not chosen to proceed individually must be given the opportunity to proceed as members of a class.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Yet we cannot agree that under all circumstances the class action device necessarily would be incompatible with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Truth in Lending cases.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Where overriding reasons for preclusion are not present, there see.ms no reason why the use of this procedural device may not be appropriate and desirable within the sound discretion of the trial courts. Creditors disregarding their responsibilities under the Act and causing damages to members of a class however limited or extensive should have no assurance that their accumulated responsibility cannot be enforced through this means. In such event a finding by the trial court to this effect may be entitled to the same respectful consideration we have found the decision of Judge O\u2019Connor warrants. It is conceivable that there may be cases of this nature where <em>thz </em>class action procedure is so manifestly superior or inferior that an appellate court on review would be warranted in reversing the trial court\u2019s determination to the contrary. We have no such problem before us. There may be some who understandably will feel uncomfortable with what might be regarded as excessive power on the part of trial courts to make such decisions with the persuasive effect here recognized.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Indeed it might be comforting to all of us in a way if each decision on review could clatter out of a slot brightly and clearly minted whenever governing symbols seemed to match, without the necessity of pondering over more imponderable but significant indications. Yet our whole system of justice is importantly geared to the balancing of judgment across variant and numerous circumstances by judges who must be entrusted from the very difficulties of remote comparison and the superior perception of firsthand impression to a wide discretion. The discretion of the court below was not abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">The results reached here are consistent both with the provisions of the Truth in Lending Act and Rule 23. Any other view might be inimical to both. Moreover, there seems no reasonable alternative. We cannot accept the alternative of mechanically or generally applying class treatment to these eases. If it were supposed that the only remedy would be submission of the matter to the Advisory Committee on Rules of Civil Procedure in hope of clarification there appears little that could be done by it but to recommend the express exemption of Truth in Lending cases from class action treatment, or class action treatment in all such cases,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> or that trial courts be permitted in the exercise of sound discretion to determine within broad and open-ended guidelines whether that means is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy on a case by case basis. And the latter seemingly most sensible alternative would bring us full circle back to the present rule which, however it may be criticized otherwise, seems most practical in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">Indeed the Rule generally may be at the crossroads, many knowledgeable lawyers and some judges maintaining that it should be completely scrapped; others that it should be substantially revised or reformed; and still others that it should be even more liberally administered to effectuate or promote societal objectives bearing little relationship to economics <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>or practicality. We believe that the solution may well be to continue straight ahead for a time under the present Rule, but to smooth out to a degree the formal obstacles that may be unduly obstructing trial courts on the firing line in realistic and practical applications within their sound discretion and in view of superior opportunity to observe the battle conditions ease by case. It would be worse in the long run to maim or kill the Rule with universal but improvident kindness than to limit on a case by case basis within sound judicial discretion its application to situations offering sensible results.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">Hence we conclude that the action of the trial court in denying the motion for maintenance of the suit as a class action was within its sound discretion and should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b440-13\">. \u201c\u00a7 1637.

But they need not be considered separately or in the abstract and, indeed, should not be, since they imply assumptions not involved necessarily in the action of the lower court, i. e., that it failed to consider criteria established by the Rule or that its decision could be justified only if such actions as this had been expressly or impliedly excluded from the application of Rule 23 under all circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b442-4\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602(i) defines such a plan as one \u201cprescribing the terms of credit transactions which may be made thereunder from time to time and under the terms of which a finance charge may be computed on the outstanding unpaid balance from time to time thereunder.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b442-6\">. \u201cThe term \u2018cardholder\u2019 means any person to whom a credit card is issued or any person who has agreed with the card issuer to pay obligations arising from the issuance of a credit card to another person.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602(in).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b442-7\">.

Insofar as we have been able to determine there is in the legislative history of the Act no allusion to the possibility of class actions in Truth in Lending cases. Administrative enforcement is emphasized. House report No. 1040 of the Committee on Banking and Currency, to which was referred H.R. 11601 containing the disclosure provisions in question, emphasizes administrative enforcement stating: \u201cXour committee believes that administrative enforcement of the credit disclosure features of the bill is fundamental to its legislative purpose . . . For the relatively unsophisticated consumer, particularly those of modest means, administrative enforcement will provide their only protection against unscrupulous merchants or lenders. Such consumers neither will have the means for instituting their own civil suits, nor adequate knowledge or experience to enable them to file a complaint through proper channels to obtain redress through the Attorney General in a criminal action. Administrative enforcement can provide the broad and effective application of the principle of disclosure called for in the bill.\u201d 2 U.S.Code Congressional and Administrative News, 90th Congress, Second Session 1968, p. 1975. The committee report later refers to the civil and criminal penalties to be provided by the bill without any notice being taken of the possibility of class actions and with renewed emphasis upon administrative enforcement: \u201cWhile primary enforcement of the bill would be accomplished under the administrative enforcement section discussed above, further provision is made for the institution of civil action by an aggrieved debtor.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>p. 1976. Appel-lee\u2019s brief, however, cites in support of its position that the Act does not contemplate class actions for its enforcement, a statement of Senator Frank E. Moss (D.-Utah), Chairman of the Consumer Subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee, made while conducting hearings on later legislation, the Consumer Protection Act of 1969. Senator Moss, who was actively involved in the Truth in Lending legislation, remarked to a witness, Assistant Attorney-General Richard McLaren;^\"! do not believe class actions are permissible under Truth-in-Lending.\u201d Mi'. McLaren responded by stating that the civil right of action provided for by the Act was subject to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and therefore amenable to class action. Senator Moss replied, \u201cMy recollection did not bring that up. Perhaps you may want to annotate that for us, if you could, and send it for the record.\u201d Mr. Mc-Laren\u2019s letter of Feb. 26, 1970, printed in the record of the subcommittee hearings, reiterates the opinion he expressed to Senator Moss.

The trial judge will have to face this problem in a realistic way. He should be afforded the greatest latitude in the exercise of his judgment after a careful factual exploration as to how this result can be attained.\u201d City of New York v. International Pipe and Ceramics Corp., 410 F.2d 295, 300 (2d Cir. 1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b446-8\">. \u201cIn arriving at these determinations the court is directed to weigh four non-exhaustive factors: the interest of the class members in individually controlling separate suits, the extent and nature of litigation already pending, the desirability of concentrating litigation in a particular forum, and the difficulties likely to be encountered in managing a class action.\u201d Esplin v. Hirschi, 402 F.2d 94, 98 n. 7 (10th Cir. 1968), <em>supra. </em>See also Eisen v. Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin, 391 F.2d 555 (2d Cir. 1968), cited in <em>Esplin, </em>wherein it is stated that \u201c . . . the dismissal <em>in limine </em>of a particular proceeding as not a proper class action is justified only by a clear showing to that effect and after a proper appraisal of all the factors enumerated on the face of the rule itself.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b447-6\">. Judge O\u2019Connor noted that Rule 23(b) (3) requires findings both on the predominance of common questions of law or fact, and on the superiority of a class action as a method of adjudicating the controversy. However, he elected only to \u201cconsider whether a class action is \u2018superior to\u2019 other available methods, because that issue appears to be dispositive of the case.\u201d Supporting this view that the required finding of superiority or inferiority is dispositive is the case of Dolgow v. Anderson, 43 F.R.D. 472, 488 (E.D.N.Y.1968), wherein Judge Weinstein declared: \u201cOnce the court has decided that a class action is superior to other available procedural devices, the crucial prerequisite for the maintenance of a class action under subdivision (b) (3) is the requirement that there be \u2018questions of law or fact common to the members of the class\u2019 and that such questions must \u2018predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b447-14\">. Of course more than a frivolous or insubstantial claim must be indicated and a motion for summary judgment or to dismiss on the pleadings is available to test the merits of the claim. See Duhart v. Carlson, 469 F.2d 471 (10th Cir. 1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b447-15\">. In agreement with this view Wright reflects that \u201cthe rule does not indicate the weight to be given to each factor or require that the action be dismissed if particular conclusions are reached as to any or all of them. Clearly, no single element is determinative. The enumeration simply provides some guidelines to assist a judge in deciding whether a class action best serves the interests of the litigants and the court. When applying these factors, the judge should reflect on the wisdom of allowing the action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>to be maintained as a class suit.\u201d Citing Philadelphia Elec. Co. v. Anaconda Am. Brass Co., 43 F.R.D. 452, 459 (E.D.Pa. 1968), Prof. Wright includes in his treatise the suggestion that proposed class actions be evaluated in terms of the strain on courts required to process large numbers of claims, the importance of making known in advance those who will be bound by the judgment, avoiding solicitation of claims, avoiding modification of the applicable period of limitation, and advancing, or at least not prejudicing, recognized goals of public policy. 7A Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1780, pp. 64-65.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b449-7\">. \u201cStudents of the Rule have been led generally to recognize that its broad and open-ended terms call for 'the exercise of some considerable discretion of a pragmatic nature. Appealing to that kind of judgment, defendant points out that (1) the incentive of classaction benefits is unnecessary in view of the Act\u2019s provisions for a $100 minimum recovery and payment of costs and a reasonable fee for counsel; and (2) the proposed recovery of $100 each for some 130,000 class members would be a horrendous, possibly annihilating punishment, unrelated to any damage to the purported class or to any benefit to defendant, for what is at most a technical and debatable violation of the Truth in Lending Act. These points are cogent and persuasive.\u201d Ratner v.
