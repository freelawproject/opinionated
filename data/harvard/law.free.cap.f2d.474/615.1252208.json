Upshaw, 448 F.2d 1218, 1220-1221 (5th Cir. 1971)]. Nor does the evidence suggest that the showing of probable cause might have been deficient had the informant been correctly named [compare United States v. Pearce, 275 F.2d 318 (7th Cir. I960)].</p>\n<p id=\"b717-22\">We conclude that the error was not of the kind that would invalidate the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-23\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b717-15\">. As the Supreme Court did in Rugendorf v. United States, 376 U.S. 528, 84 S.Ct. 825, 11 L.Ed.2d 8S7 (1964), we assume that an inquiry into the factual accuracy of allegations in the search warrant affidavit may be made. See also, King v. United States, 282 F.2d 398 (4th Cir. 1960); United States v. Pearce, 275 F.2d 318 (7th Cir. 1960); United States v. Upshaw, 44S F.2d 1218 (5th Cir. 1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
