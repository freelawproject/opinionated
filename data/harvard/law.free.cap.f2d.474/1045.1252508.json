The basis for this conviction was his testimony before a federal grand jury that he had never received any payoff for allowing the Marville Lounge in Con-cordia to conduct prostitution and gambling activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-16\">On appeal Cross makes these contentions :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1148-17\">(1) A new trial should have been granted on the basis of new evidence discovered subsequent to the verdict of guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1148-18\">(2) The court erred in refusing to challenge for cause prospective juror Milford W. Crumpler, who stated that he would give more credibility to an FBI agent than to any other witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1148-19\">(3) There was insufficient evidence \u25a0 from two credible witnesses to deny Cross\u2019 motion for directed verdict of acquittal at the close of the government\u2019s case and motion for new trial at the close of the whole case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1148-20\">(4) The Government knowingly used perjured testimony of J. D. Richardson and Truman E. Sanford in this case. Richardson, one of the operators of the lounge, testified that he had agreed to pay Cross $200 a week for protection. Sanford testified that he was with Richardson on two occasions when Richardson made payoffs to Cross.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1148-21\">(5) The trial court erred in permitting testimony describing the activities of the Marville Lounge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1148-22\">(6) In the circumstances, the trial court improperly questioned a juror regarding an alleged contact by a deputy sheriff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1148-23\">There is no merit to these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-24\">With respect to the fourth contention, we note that this was a <em>perjury </em>case; that Cross was not tried and convicted of violating the anti-racketeering statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962, as was Richardson. The credibility of both Richardson and Sanford was challenged: their testimony before two previous grand juries was different from their testimony at Cross\u2019 trial. Although credibility is a question for the jury to decide, the use of such witnesses in a trial for perjury suggests that the Court scrutinize the record for corroborative evidence. Here there was evidence in the record to corroborate Richardson\u2019s and Sanford\u2019s testimony and this evidence was sufficient to persuade the jury that indeed Cross was guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-25\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
