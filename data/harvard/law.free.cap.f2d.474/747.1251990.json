G. France and the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, Inc. (NASCAR), following an order granting appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AQ9\">The complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> stemming from an enterprise involving the creation of a corporation, Sportscaster, Incorporated, for the operation of a \u201cclosed circuit\u201d radio broadcasting system at sporting events (golf matches, auto races, horse races) and the rental of small receivers to spectators to provide them with comments, interviews and additional information on the events. The chief promoter of the venture was the defendant Oscar Fraley.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-14\">Shortly after the complaint was filed, the deposition of Sally Strong,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the plaintiff, was taken, followed by answers of France, both individually and as president of NASCAR, and the defendants Fraley and H. Earle Barber to interrogatories submitted by plaintiff, and affidavits of plaintiff and France, with numerous exhibits. On the basis of these documents, France and NASCAR moved for dismissal and summary judgment. This motion was denied, \u201cexpressly without prejudice\u201d, following a hearing on January 13, 1969 at which the court stated that he denied the motion with \u201cgreat reluctance\u201d and \u201cunless a very good showing was made\u201d by the plaintiff on further discovery \u201cthe motion to dismiss ought to be granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b850-15\">In March, 1969 the depositions of France, Fraley <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Barber were taken. There was no further discovery, and after a lapse of ten months the motion for summary judgment was renewed. An order was entered July 3, 1970 granting the motion, the court finding that \u201cthe acts attributed to defendants France and NASCAR are so remote from the plaintiff that no genuine issue as to any material fact exists which would support liability as to them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b850-16\">In its order the trial court recognized that while, in ruling on motions for summary judgment, \u201call inferences of fact must be drawn in favor of the party opposing the motion (United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 82 S.Ct. 993, 8 L.Ed.2d 176 (1962) and * * * the moving party has the burden of showing that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, (3 Barron and Holtzoff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>Rules Edition, 149), it is also true that \u2018the opposing party . . . must show that evidence is available which would justify a trial . . . (ibid.). And \u2018courts should not be unduly reluctant to grant summary judgment when a trial would serve no useful purpose and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 (6 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice para. 56.02(1)).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">The motion here was supported by affidavits, answers to interrogatories, and depositions as provided in Rule 56(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Accordingly appellant \u201cmay not rest upon the mere allegations of * * * (her) pleading,\u201d but her response, by affidavits or otherwise, \u201cmust set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">Appellant contends on this appeal that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-9\">\u201c * * * there are four separate but interrelated roles played by Mr. France and NASCAR on which their liability to Mrs. Strong is based. These are: (1) that Mr. France agreed to be a director of the Defendant corporation, Sportscaster, Inc., which issued stock to Mrs. Strong; (2) that France acted as a promoter of the venture and agreed to invest in the D\u00e9fendant corporation; (3) that France and NASCAR were aiders and abettors of Defendants Fraley and Sportscaster, Inc.; and (4) that France and NASCAR were controlling persons of Defendants Fraley and Sportscaster, Inc. In addition, Appellant contends that Appellees\u2019 motion was granted prematurely in that Appellant has not completed discovery.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-20\">\n<em>Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b851-21\">It is clear from appellant\u2019s deposition that she has never met France and has never had any \u201cdirect communication either by letter or telephone\u201d with him or anyone at NASCAR. Strong dep. 5, 24. She did not at any time give any money or check to France or NASCAR.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Strong dep. 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-22\">Appellant first met Fraley in 1962. She became associated with him in \u201cputting out programs for sporting events\u201d, \u201cput up money\u201d for a closed circuit television broadcast of the Liston-Clay fight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>and \u201cadvanced money\u201d for a golf tournament. She also \u201clent him money for himself when he was in between jobs\u201d, mentioning one loan of $8,000.00<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in early 1964 and another of $1,500.00 in 1963. Strong dep. 6-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">Early in 1965 at a golf tournament in Miami, Florida, appellant and Fraley met Tom Burke, who was broadcasting at the tournament. According to appellant, she next met Fraley and Burke at a tournament in Pennsylvania where Fral-ey and Burke were \u201cforming their own company\u201d, and two weeks later in New York, where both discussed the business venture with appellant and solicited an investment from her. Strong dep. 9-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Appellant testified that in this conversation Fraley said \u201che would need anywhere between 50 (sic) and $100,000 for the whole thing to go.\u201d Appellant agreed to \u201cadvance money if he needed it for the company.\u201d She \u201cdidn\u2019t put any limit on it because he said that he was going to get some of his wealthy friends to put up the money and that I would put up- \u2014 he was not going to put up any money himself. But that I would put up as if it was his money and I would have a share in the partnership.\u201d Strong dep. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">At the same meeting Fraley told appellant that he had talked to France and \u201ccould get the contracts for racing.\u201d She also testified that about three weeks later, when appellant was in Beirut, Lebanon, Fraley phoned her that France \u201cthought this was wonderful and that it would go\u201d, and he would use his connections with different people involved, with the Racing Association and \u201cwould put a great deal of money in the company.\u201d Strong dep. 12-13. From time to time thereafter Fraley made a number of written and oral statements to appellant to the effect that France and NASCAR had agreed to support, promote and heavily invest in Sportscaster. There is no evidence that either France or NASCAR were aware of or authorized any of these statements. Other letters from Fraley to appellant cast some doubt on France\u2019s participation in the venture.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-13\">On October 25, 1965 NASCAR and Fraley entered into a written contract whereby \u201cNASCAR subject to the further approval by the respective promoters of NASCAR events, does hereby grant to Oscar Fraley and/or his Corporate Assignee, Racecaster; Inc., an exclusive contract for an on-course gallery communication system for a period of five years, provided only that Fraley shall in fact service such first event by not later than June 30, 1966.\u201d It was understood that the agreement \u201cmay be terminated by NASCAR at any time.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"aqt-dedup-0\">On March 18, 1966 France, as president of NASCAR, wrote a letter addressed \u201cTo Whom it May Concern\u201d reading:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-14\">\u201cThis letter is to serve as confirmation that Mr. Oscar Fraley has a five year agreement with NASCAR for his sportscaster receiving system at the Association\u2019s races, subject to his agreements with the track operators.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-15\">\u201cThis is to further confirm that, to my knowledge, Mr. Fraley is a man of unquestionable character and reliability. He has a vast reputation in the field of sports, having served as syndicated columnist for United Press International and Associated Press, the nation\u2019s two largest wire services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuY\">The certificate of incorporation of Sportscaster, Incorporated was filed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>October 18, 1966 listing Oscar Fraley, H. Earle Barber, an attorney employed by Fraley, and Beatrice S. Smith, Bar-' ber\u2019s secretary, as incorporators and directors. Fraley was named president, Smith, vice-president, and Barber, secretary-treasurer. Subsequently stock certificates were issued to appellant (for an investment of $9,000) and six other persons (for investments totaling $18,000). No stock was issued to France or NASCAR.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">No license was obtained from the Federal Communications Commission for the radio transmission and the enterprise has never been in operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Appellant claims that she invested a total of $72,699.41 in Sportscaster. It appears from her deposition, however, that this includes approximately $25,000 advanced to Fraley prior to learning of the proposed Sportscaster venture. Strong dep. 8-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">With this background we turn to a consideration of the four bases of alleged liability on the part of France and NASCAR.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">\n<em>France as Director</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">France admits that he told Fraley \u201cwhen he got his corporation going, he could use my name, and I would serve as director on the company.\u201d France dep. 87. Fraley, on March 17, 1966 wrote France to \u201cacknowledge receipt from you of $1,000.00 for stock in Sportscaster, Inc., and permission to use y our (sic) name on the Board of Directors.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Plf. Ex. 4, France dep.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">There is no evidence that France was ever appointed a director, or acted as one, or that Fraley ever \u201cgot his corporation going.\u201d There can be no fiduciary liability where there is no duty, express or implied, to act as a fiduciary. Appellant\u2019s reliance on Moerman v. Zipco, Inc., 302 F.Supp. 439, 447 (E.D.N.Y.1969) is misplaced. There the persons held liable had \u201cinsisted on being members of the board\u201d of directors, had sold stock, and had signed board minutes and registration statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-14\">\n<em>France and NASCAR as Promoters</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b853-15\">Appellant argues that France promoted Sportscaster by offering to use his name as director; by signing a letter of personal recommendation for Fraley addressed \u201cTo Whom it May Concern\u201d, attesting to the NASCAR-Sportscaster five year contract; and by providing personal assistance.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-16\">Appellant argues that NASCAR promoted Sportscaster by sending letters to racetrack operators recommending Sportscaster, \u201cenclosing the NASCAR-Sportscaster contract, a summary of the venture, * * * and possibly portions of a brochure which promised a high return to the investor on a fixed schedule of events.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-18\">Appellant concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-19\">\u201cThe clear implications of these materials are that: (1) Sportscaster had an FCC-approved broadcast frequency; and (2) that Sportscaster was prepared to proceed with broadcasting NASCAR\u2019s entire 1966 schedule, which would bring substantial profits to any investor. Both representations were false.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-20\">Appellant has cited no case, and we find none, which predicates liability as a promoter on such limited activity so far removed from the person claiming damage. McCandless v. Furlaud, 296 U.S. 140, 56 S.Ct. 41, 80 L.Ed. 121 (1935) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>cited by appellant for the proposition that \u201ca pre-incorporation promoter is a fiduciary\u201d, involved an elaborate scheme to defraud, engineered by the \u201cpromoter\u201d. There is no evidence of such a scheme here engineered by either France or NASCAR, or of any facts upon which France or NASCAR\u2019s liability to Strong as a \u201cpromoter\u201d of Sportscaster can be predicated.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">\n<em>France and NASCAR as Aiders and Abettors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Appellant relies upon the same facts to establish liability as an aider and abettor.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\"> \u201cAn aider and abettor may be liable for damages even though his assistance of the scheme consists of mere silence or inaction.\u201d Anderson v. Francis I. duPont and Co., 291 F.Supp. 705, 709 (D.Minn.1968). That liability arises, however, only when a duty to disclose has arisen. Securities and Exchange Commission v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., 401 F.2d 833, 848, (2 Cir. 1968) (en banc) cert. denied 394 U.S. 976, 89 S.Ct. 1454, 22 L.Ed.2d 756. The duty to disclose may arise upon the possession of \u201cinside information\u201d as in <em>Securities and Exchange Commission, supra; </em>or upon \u201cknowing assistance of or participation in a fraudulent scheme\u201d as in <em>Anderson, supra; </em>or upon a consent and approval of fraudulent practices by a director, as in Sprayregen v. Livingston Oil Company, 295 F.Supp. 1376, 1378 (S.D.N.Y.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">There are no facts in this case which would impose any duty of disclosure on either France or NASCAR or any activity or inactivity on the part of either which can be made the basis of liability to the appellant as an aider and abettor of Fraley\u2019s misrepresentations to Strong.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">\n<em>France and NASCAR as \u201cControlling Persons\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-12\">\u201c(a) Every person who, directly or indirectly controls any person liable under any provision of this title -x- * -x- or 0f any ruie or regulation thereunder shall also be liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as such controlled person to any person to whom such controlled person is liable, unless the controlling person acted in good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the act or acts constituting the violation or cause of action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-14\">This section has been held to require \u201conly some indirect means of discipline or influence short of actual direction to hold a \u2018controlling person\u2019 liable.\u201d See Myzel v. Fields, 386 F.2d 718, 738 (8 Cir. 1967) cert. denied 390 U.S. 951, 88 S.Ct. 1043, 19 L.Ed.2d 1143 (1968). This circuit has held that the test of liability is that \u201cthe controlling person \u2018 * * * must have acted in bad faith and directly or indirectly induced the conduct constituting a violation or cause of action.\u2019 \u201d Hecht v. Harris, Upham and Co., 430 F.2d 1202, 1210 (9 Cir. 1970) quoting Kamen v. Paul H. Aschkar and Company, 382 F.2d 689, 697 (9 Cir. 1967) cert. denied 393 U.S. 801, 89 S.Ct. 40, 21 L.Ed.2d 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-16\">Appellant relies upon the facts already recited to establish France\u2019s and NASCAR\u2019s liability as controlling persons. Those facts do not support appellant\u2019s conclusion. There is no evidence that either France or NASCAR acted in bad faith or directly or indirectly induced Fraley\u2019s conduct toward the appellant. Finally, it is clear that appellant made substantial payments to Fraley, some of which she seeks to recover in this action, prior to the Sportscaster venture and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>agreed to advance money \u201cas needed\u201d prior to Fraley\u2019s representation that France and NASCAR would also invest heavily in the venture. There is no evidence that France or NASCAR authorized any of the misrepresentations made by Fraley to appellant or that in continuing to provide funds she relied upon any actual conduct of either France or NASCAR.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">From a review of all of the affidavits, answers to interrogatories, depositions and exhibits we conclude that the trial judge was correct in finding that \u201cthe acts attributed\u201d to appellees \u201care so remote from the (appellant) that no genuine issue as to any material fact exists which would support liability as to them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b850-12\">.

We find no merit in appellant\u2019s contention that the motion was granted prematurely. Fraley\u2019s deposition was taken in Miami, Florida on Friday afternoon, March 21, 1969. Appellant\u2019s counsel was not present, presumably through some misunderstanding. The depositions of France and Barber were taken on Monday, March 24. Appellant\u2019s counsel was advised that Fraley would be available for further deposition the following day and was given a transcript of Fraley\u2019s testimony, which he used in examining Barber. He stated that he did not intend to take Fraley\u2019s deposition because of Fraley\u2019s \u201cdefault\u201d. Barber dep. 58-68.
