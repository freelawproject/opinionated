The lower court held that (1) relief was barred by 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7421(a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, and (2) that plaintiff had an adequate remedy at law in view of the fact that it was not threatened with irreparable injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-8\">Since our decision is posited on the first ground, we pretermit a decision on the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-9\">Appellant was incorporated on July 15, 1965, as a non-profit religious educational corporation under the laws of Alabama, including the provisions of Title 10, \u00a7\u00a7 124-132, Code of Alabama, 1940, as amended. It began full operation as the Crenshaw Christian Academy on September 30, 1968, allegedly \u201cfor students and parents who object to the constitutional inhibitions against prayer, Bible reading, religious study, and other activities of the Christian faith in public schools.\u201d, Succinctly stated, the claimed purpose of the Academy is \u201cto provide the children of the area an opportunity to obtain a quality education in a wholesome Christian atmosphere.\u201d Appellant avers that the Academy is nondenominational and is open to all adherents of the Christian faith, that its membership and student admission policy has never included any reference to race or color, and that there does not exist any officially recognized anti-racially discriminatory admission policy. It concedes that it has never received an application from a non-white, and consequently has never denied an application for admission from a non-white.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-18\">On September 17, 1968, appellant applied to the Internal Revenue Service for tax-exempt status under Title 26, \u00a7 501(c)(3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On January 8, 1969, the Service issued its determination letter and letter of advance assurance ruling that appellant was exempt from Federal income tax under that section of the Revenue Code and that donors could deduct contributions to appellant as provided by Section 170, Title 26 U.S.C.A.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-12\">\u201c . . . [N]o suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person, whether or not such person is the person against whom such tax was assessed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1187\">*1187</page-number>However, the letter contained conditions reading;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-4\">\u201cThe conclusions in this ruling are based on the Service\u2019s understanding that the operations of your school do not involve state action constituting a violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States. Further, in the event of legislative developments, or judicial interpretations \u2014 constitutional or otherwise \u2014 respecting the legality or educational qualification of your purposes or manner of operation which affect your elegibility under section 501(c)(3) of the Code, this ruling shall cease to be of effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aio-dedup-0\">Following the three-judge decision in Green v. Kennedy and Thrower, D.C., 309 F.Supp. 1127 (January 12, 1970), the Service issued a news release on July 10, 1970, wherein it was announced it could</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-5\">\u201cno longer legally justify allowing tax-exempt status to private schools which practice racial discrimination nor can it treat gifts to such schools as charitable deductions for income tax purposes . . . where a school fails to establish that it has a racially non-discriminatory admission policy, an outstanding ruling of exemption will be withdrawn. . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1289-7\">On July 19, 1970, the Service amplified the release of July 10, 1970, by stating that its statement of position on racially non-discriminatory policies \u201cwould be applicable to all private schools, whether church related or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-8\">On June 18, 1971, the Internal Revenue Service wrote appellant requesting that it comply by establishing \u201ca policy one way or the other,\u201d and by publicly advertising through the local news media a racially non-discriminatory policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-12\">Following further correspondence and conferences, appellant declined to accede to the request for compliance, and upon the threatened withdrawal of its tax-exempt status and advance assurance of deductibility of contributions, it instituted this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-13\">The Supreme Court has interpreted the provisions of Section 7421(a) to mean that the tax assessment and collection processes are not subject to injunctive interference unless the complainant shows (1) that \u201cit is clear that under no circumstances could the Government ultimately prevail,\u201d and (2) that equity jurisdiction otherwise exists because of the absence of a legal remedy. Enochs v. Williams Packing Co., 370 U.S. 1, 82 S.Ct. 1125, 8 L.Ed.2d 292.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6x_\">\u201c[T]he question of whether the Government has a chance of ultimately prevailing is to be determined on the basis of the information available to it at the time of suit. Only if it is then apparent that, under the most liberal view of the law and the facts, the United States cannot establish its claim, may the suit for an injunction be maintained.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1289-14\">Thus judged, the exceptions are seen to be quite narrow and complainant\u2019s burden a most onerous one indeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-15\">Appellant insists that Section 7421(a) is inapplicable. Its insistence is premised on the position that the suit is not for the forbidden purpose proscribed by the section because (1) the administrative acts which it seeks to enjoin do not constitute an \u201cassessment or collection\u201d of a tax, and (2) because the purpose of the contested tax policy is not to raise revenue, but to compel compliance with the Government\u2019s policy respecting racial integration in the nation\u2019s schools. Initially it grounded its primary reliance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1188\">*1188</page-number>upon the authority of Bob Jones University v. Connally, 341 F.Supp. 277 (D.C. 1971). That decision was reversed by the Fourth Circuit on January 19, 1973, 472 F.2d 903. While still insisting that the lower court was correct it now insists that the decision of the Circuit Court for the District of Columbia in \u201cAmericans United\u201d Inc. v. Walters (1973) 477 F.2d 1169, should control. The court in the latter case, citing as sustaining authority the decision of the lower .court in <em>Bob Jones, </em>reached a conclusion contrary<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to that of the Fourth Circuit on its review of the <em>Bob Jones </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-4\">Appellant to a lesser extent also relies on Green v. Connally, D.C., 330 F.Supp. 1150, aff\u2019d per curiam sub nom. Coit v. Green, 404 U.S. 997, 92 S.Ct. 564, 30 L.Ed.2d 550. That was a class action by Negro federal taxpayers of Mississippi to enjoin U.S. Treasury officials from according tax-exempt status and deductibility of contributions to private schools which discriminated against Negroes. That decision resolves the merits against appellant, but sustains the grant of an injunction without specific reference to Section 7421(a). In <em>Green </em>the court held that in light of the settled federal policy against racial discrimination the Internal Revenue Code must be construed to prohibit exemptions and deductions which extend tax benefits to racially discriminatory private schools. The court further held that the Internal Revenue Service can demand evidence of non-discrimination in admission policies in the nature of the evidence here requested before the institution of this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-10\">We disagree with appellant\u2019s contention that Section 7421(a) is inapplicable because the suit did not seek to enjoin an \u201cassessment or collection\u201d of any tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-11\">The administrative proceedings were directed to a withdrawal of tax-exemption and deductibility-assurance rulings of the Internal Revenue Service. Those proceedings are directly involved with the assessment and collection of taxes from appellant and those making contributions to it. If those rulings are withdrawn, appellant will be liable for taxes on any net income realized by it and contributors to it will not be permitted to deduct from their gross income the amount of their contributions. Either event will result in an increase in taxes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On the contrary, if the injunction issues, any assessment or collection of such increased taxes will be prohibited. Section 7421(a) is directed against that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-12\">We agree with the Fourth Circuit in <em>Bob Jones University </em>that the Government\u2019s policy with respect to racial discrimination is irrelevant to the proper disposition of this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1290-13\">In view of the decisions in Green v. Connally, aff\u2019d sub nom. Coit v. Green, <em>supra, </em>and Green v. Kennedy and Thrower, <em>supra, </em>we cannot conclude that \u201cunder no circumstances\u201d could the In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>ternal Revenue Service prevail in withdrawing its tax-exemption and deducti-bility-assurance rulings. -</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-5\">Considering all the averments presented by the complaint, we do not consider the charge by way of conclusion that the Internal Revenue Service is interfering with appellant\u2019s constitutional guarantee of religious liberty sufficiently substantial to merit an adjudication with respect to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-6\">Congress has barred the side door to actions \u201cwith respect to Federal taxes\u201d' under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2201, and, subject to the noted exceptions, has also barred the front by Section 7421(a). We are of the opinion and so hold that the lower court correctly ruled that Section 7421(a) constitutes a bar to the maintenance of this action. Consequently it did not err in dismissing the action on that ground. Its action is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1288-10\">.

Mathis, 284 F.2d 616 (8 Cir.), where the court affirmed the denial of an injunction against the Director who was proceeding to collect a gaming tax of $250.00 each on pinball machines where it was obvious that the purpose of the tax was not to raise revenue but to control gambling.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
