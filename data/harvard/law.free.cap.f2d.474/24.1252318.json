Because the United States Attorney has not favored this court with a brief in response to the brief- of appellant as required by Fed.R.App.P. 31(a), this appeal has been heard and decided upon the brief of appellant and the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-26\">Appellant is presently serving concurrent sentences in Ohio state prison as a result of a 1968 conviction for armed robbery and shooting with intent to kill. In 1965, appellant pled guilty in federal court to violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5851 (1964), for which he received, and has served, a sentence of three years\u2019 im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>prisonment. After he completed serving his federal sentence, the Supreme Court held that assertion of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination provided a complete defense to prosecutions'under the provisions of the National Firearms Act to the violation of which appellant had pled guilty, Haynes v. United States, 390 U.S. 85, 88 S.Ct. 722, 19 L.Ed.2d 923 (1968), and that this ruling was to be given retroactive application. <em>See </em>United States v. United States Coin &amp; Currency, 401 U.S. 715, 91 S.Ct. 1041, 28 L.Ed.2d 434 (1971); Decker v. United States, 402 U.S. 937, 91 S.Ct. 1604, 29 L.Ed.2d 106 (1971), vacating and remanding 423 F.2d 726 (6th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">On the authority of these decisions, appellant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that he was in custody in violation of the Constitution because his federal conviction had the effect of increasing the time that he must serve in state prison before he will be eligible for parole. The District Court dismissed the petition initially because of the decision of this court in <em>Decker, supra, </em>that Haynes v. United States, <em>supra, </em>was not to be accorded retrospective effect. Following the vacation of <em>Decker </em>by the Supreme Court, appellant moved for reconsideration of the dismissal of his petition. The District Court denied his motion because it regarded appellant\u2019s petition as a motion to vacate sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and, since appellant was not serving his federal sentence when the petition was filed, the attack on his federal conviction was \u201cmoot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Consistent with the teaching of the Supreme Court in United States v. Morgan, 346 U.S. 502, 505, 74 S.Ct. 247, 249, 98 L.Ed. 248 (1954), that \u201cin behalf of the unfortunates, federal courts should act in doing justice if the record makes plain a right to relief,\u201d we determine that the District Court should have treated \u201cthe record as adequately presenting a motion in the nature of a writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>enabling the trial court to properly exercise its jurisdiction.\u201d And the collateral consequences of appellant\u2019s federal conviction demonstrate that his claim is not moot. <em>See </em>Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U.S. 234, 88 S.Ct. 1556, 20 L.Ed.2d 554 (1968); United States v. Morgan, <em>supra, </em>346 U.S. at 512-513, 74 S.Ct. 247, 98 L.Ed. 248; <em>cf. </em>United States v. Tucker, 404 U.S. 443, 92 S.Ct. 589, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Moreover, it is clear from the authorities cited above that appellant\u2019s 1965 federal conviction is constitutionally infirm. Accordingly, we reverse and remand with instructions to vacate the 1965 federal judgment of conviction and the sentence imposed pursuant thereto. <em>See </em>United States v. Morgan, supra, 346 U.S. at 513, 74 S.Ct. 247, 98 L.Ed. 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
