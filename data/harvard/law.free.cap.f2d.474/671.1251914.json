We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-15\">Generally, the wet precipitator includes two concentric cylinders which define an annular space between them. Contaminated air or gas to be cleaned is directed through this annular space. Water is caused to flow on the inside surface of the outer cylinder as well as on the outside surface of the inner cylinder. A discharge electrode structure is disposed within the annular space to establish an electrostatic field between the liquid films which line the annular passage. Contaminated gas is introduced through the bottom end of the passage between the cylinders through annular Venturi slots and is subjected to the electrostatic field which causes the particles in the gaseous stream to become ionized and migrate to the collecting films on the surfaces of the tubes lining the passages. The liquid films then carry the extracted matter away into a drain.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-16\">The significant aspect of this invention is the Venturi inlet which causes the gas flow to spread outwardly against the water films and press them against the walls of the annular passage. Claim 1 reads (emphasis ours):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-17\">1. An electrostatic wet precipitator comprising: (a) concentrically arranged collector tubes defining at least one vertically-disposed annular gas passage,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-19\">(b) means to produce downwardly-flowing films of liquid on the complementary surfaces of adjacent tubes which line said passage thereby to form liquid collectors,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-20\">(c) a discharge-electrode structure disposed within said passage in spaced relation to said liquid collectors;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-21\">(d) inlet means including <em>a Venturi opening to feed a contaminated gaseous stream into the lower end of each passage to produce an expanding gas </em>which flows upwardly through said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>passage in counter-current relationship to said liquid films <em>to force said films against said surfaces to maintain the uniformity thereof,</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-5\">(e) means to apply a high voltage between said discharge-electrode structure and said liquid collectors to ionize the contaminants in the gaseous stream flowing through said passage to cause migration of contaminants toward said liquid collectors and thereby purify the gas; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-6\">(f) outlet means at the upper end of said passage to discharge the purified gas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">Claim 10 is a dependent claim and no separate argument is made as to its pat-entability if claim 1 is not patentable.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">The references principally relied on and the only ones we need consider are:</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">Nesbit 1,357,202 Oct. 26,1920</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">Burns 1,250,088 Dec. 11,1917</p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">de Seversky (A) 3,238,702 Mar. 8,1966</p>\n<p id=\"b775-12\">It is unnecessary to discuss the disclosures of these references because of an admission by appellant made in his reply brief before the board and in substance repeated at oral argument in this court, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-13\">The primary question before the Board is whether there is any prior-art reference of record, whose date is effective against the instant application, which discloses a Venturi inlet for feeding contaminated gas into an electrostatic precipitator tube.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-14\">If such a reference exists, then appellant concedes that this reference, when combined with the other references of record, makes the present invention obvious and unpatentable. However it is appellant\u2019s contention that de Seversky (A), which discloses a Venturi inlet, is not an effective reference whereas those references which are effective do not even remotely disclose a Venturi inlet.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-17\">The solicitor\u2019s brief, in turn, contains the admission that \u201cNesbit and Burns do not disclose venturi inlets in the contaminated gas openings of their precipi-tators.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-18\">The solution of this case, therefore, depends upon the answer to a single question of law: has appellant overcome the date of the de Seversky (A) patent so that it is not available as a reference? There is, of course, no question that de Seversky (A) is a good reference unless its date is overcome because it issued as a patent over two years before the application at bar was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-19\">\u25a0 Appellant argues here, as he' did below, that de Seversky (A) is not available as a reference because he is entitled to the date of a parent application filed in 1960, which antedates the de Seversky (A) patent, in which certain disclosure of a Venturi gas inlet is incorporated by reference from a still earlier grandparent application filed in 1955, referred to as de Seversky (C). The sequence is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-20\">I. de Seversky (C) \u2014 Patent 3,-053,029 \u2014 Sept. 11,1962. Grandparent, filed January 5, 1955.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-21\">II. de Seversky parent, application serial No. 53,255. Filed August 31, 1960, a \u201ccontinuation-in-part\u201d of I.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-22\">III. de Seversky instant application, serial No. 723,810. Filed April 24, 1968, a \u201ccontinuation-in-part\u201d of II.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-24\">It will be seen that so far as antedating de Seversky (A) is concerned, appellant relies for filing date only on serial No. 53,255, II above. That parent application, however, is totally devoid of any reference to a Venturi inlet and by itself is of no help to appellant as support for the appealed claims. Appellant admits to this defect in the parent application, saying in his brief, \u201cparent application Serial No. 53,255 did not directly disclose a Venturi inlet.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> He urges, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>ever, that the defect is cured because the grandparent, de Seversky (C), discloses a Venturi inlet and because the parent application is a \u201ccontinuation-in-part\u201d of the grandparent that disclosure is, ipso facto, \u201cincorporated by reference\u201d in the parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-3\">It should be noted in this connection that the parent application, No. 53,255, contains no \u201cincorporation-by-reference\u201d language whatsoever. Its only relation to de Seversky (C) is indicated by the simple statement that it is a \u201ccontinuation-in-part\u201d thereof. That language is insufficient to incorporate any part of de Seversky (C) into the parent case. All it means is that insofar as the disclosure <em>of the parent </em>finds corresponding disclosure in the grandparent, the parent is entitled to the filing date of the grandparent. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">Appellant is confusing two distinctly different things: (1) the right to have the benefit of the filing date of an earlier application under \u00a7 120 for subject matter claimed in a later application because that subject matter is <em>disclosed in an earlier application </em>to which \u201ca specific reference\u201d is made \u2014 i. e., a reference to the earlier application per se, and (2) the incorporation <em>by reference </em>in an application of matter elsewhere written down (not necessarily in a patent application), for economy, amplification, or clarity of .exposition, by means of an incorporating statement clearly identifying the subject matter which is incorporated and where it is to be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Appellant\u2019s parent application, serial No. 53,255 is not, however, in either category (1) or (2) above. The Venturi inlet is not disclosed therein and the application contains no statement which incorporates anything by reference. There is nothing but the statement that the parent is a \u201ccontinuation-in-part\u201d of the grandparent application, now the issued de Seversky patent (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">An argument similar to that appellant is making here was made in In re Lund, 54 CCPA 1361, 376 F.2d 982, (1967), where the Patent Office contended that disclosure in an abandoned application was \u201cincorporated by reference\u201d into the disclosure of a patent used as a reference by virtue of the statement that the application for the patent was a \u201ccontinuation-in-part\u201d of the abandoned application. We there held that such a statement does not operate to incorporate in an application any part of the disclosure of the parent application so referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">To be sure, the statement that an application is a continuation-in-part, or a continuation, or a division, or in part a continuation of another application is in a broad sense a \u201creference\u201d to the earlier application, but a mere <em>reference </em>to another application, or patent, or publication is not an <em>incorporation </em>of anything therein into the application containing such reference for the purposes of the disclosure required by 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112. Likewise it does not serve to bring a disclosure within the requirements of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120 so as to give a later application the benefit of the filing date of an earlier application. The later application must itself contain the necessary disclosure. As we said in <em>Lund,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"axa-dedup-1\">As the expression itself implies, the purpose of \u201cincorporation by reference\u201d is to make one document become a part of another document by referring to the former in the latter <em>in such a manner </em>that it is apparent that the cited document is part of the referencing document as if it were fully set out therein. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">We held in <em>Lund </em>that the mere statement that an application is a \u201ccontinuation-in-part\u201d does not do that. Appellant relies on language in <em>Lund </em>but that case decided the legal question appellant presents here flatly contrary to his contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">Since there is admittedly no disclosure of the crucial Venturi inlet in appellant\u2019s parent application, No. 53,255, and that parent application contains no incorporation by reference of any of the disclosure of the de Seversky (C) grandparent case, appellant is entitled to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>filing date of neither for the subject matter of the appealed claims and the de Seversky (A) reference has not been antedated or overcome. In view of the admission made, the appealed claims are not patentable. The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b775-15\"> See the opinion of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in de Seversky v. Brenner, 137 U.S.App.D.C. 369, 424 F.2d 857 (1970), in an action under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145 on claim 20 of serial No. 53,255, the rejection of which was affirmed, bearing on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
