The facts are not in dispute and have been agreed upon by the parties in a stipulation filed in this Court on November 30, 1972:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-13\">\u201cAppellant was charged in the Circuit Court of Pulaski County, Arkansas, under information, filed by the Prosecuting Attorney with the crime of assault with intent to kill one Gene Ray Cannon. The information alleged that appellant did unlawfully, feloniously, wilfully and with malice aforethought make an assault upon Gene Ray Cannon with a deadly weapon, to-wit: a knife, then and there cutting him, the said Gene Ray Cannon with said knife then and there held in the hands of him, the said James Hugh Ridge-way.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-14\">\u201cIn the trial of the case the prosecuting witness, Cannon, testified, and there was no other proof to the contrary on the part of the State, that appellant Ridgeway shot him with a gun, and did not cut him with a knife; that another person, Butch Vaughn, cut him with a knife. The three were on the river bank when the assault occurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-15\">The appellant\u2019s conviction was affirmed by the Arkansas Supreme Court in Ridgeway v. State, 472 S.W.2d 108 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-16\">The appellant\u2019s sole contention on this appeal is that his right to be \u201cinformed of the nature and the cause of the accusation\u201d as guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments was violated at trial due to a fatal variance between the allegations in the information and the proof at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-17\">We believe the appellant waived any objection he might otherwise have had because he failed to object to the variance at trial. It is clear that the appellant did not object at trial to the introduction of the variant evidence. See, Jackson v. United States, 123 U.S.App.D.C. 276, 359 F.2d 260, 264 &amp; n.3, cert. denied, 385 U.S. 877, 87 S.Ct. 157, 17 L.Ed.2d 104 (1966). Furthermore, even though the appellant did move for a directed verdict at the close of the state\u2019s case and at the close of all the evidence, there is no indication that these motions were based on the variant proof submitted by the state so as to preserve this question for appeal. 2 Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure, \u00a7 516 at 378-379 (1969); <em>cf., </em>McIntyre v. United States, 380 F.2d 822, 826 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 992, 88 S.Ct. 493, 19 L.Ed.2d 487 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-18\">In any event, a careful examination of the record reveals that the appellant was not prejudiced by the fact that the proof varied from the allegations in the information. The appellant\u2019s theory at trial was that although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>he was in the immediate vicinity of the crime, another person committed both the shooting and knifing. Thus, the variant proof did not prejudice the defendant\u2019s defense. See, United States v. Covington, 411 F.2d 1087, 1089 (4th Cir. 1969). In addition, there is no indication that the appellant was surprised by the variant proof and no motion was made to the court for a continuance for the purpose of preparing a new defense. See, United States v. Covington, <em>supra; </em>United States v. Costello, 381 F.2d 698, 701 (2nd Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
