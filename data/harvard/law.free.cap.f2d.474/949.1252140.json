The trial court, 325 F.Supp. 1089, failed to determine whether the actions could be maintained as class actions as required by Rule 23(c), and the judgments from which these appeals are taken do not \u201cinclude and describe those whom the court finds to be members of the class.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-22\">It is, therefore, ordered that the judg-. ments of the trial court are reversed and the cases remanded for further proceedings pursuant to Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and for consideration in the light of this Court\u2019s opinion in Manning v. International Union and General Motors Corp., 466 F.2d 812, decided September 11, 1972.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
