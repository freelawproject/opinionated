This case bears out the difficulties with respect to the definition of classes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1223-21\">HEANEY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1223-22\">The defendant was convicted on two counts of violating the Gun Control Act of 1968. Count I charged that, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(a)(6) and 924 (a), he had falsely certified that he had not been adjudicated a mental defective or committed to a mental institution. Count II charged that, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(h) and 924(a), the defendant had received a firearm after having been adjudicated a mental defective or committed to a mental institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-23\">The evidence clearly showed that the defendant had purchased a firearm on April 25, 1971, and had stated on the \u201cFirearms Transaction Record\u201d that he had not been adjudicated mentally defective or committed to a mental institution. The principal question before the trial court and before this Court is whether the defendant had in fact been \u201cadjudicated as a mental defective\u201d and \u201ccommitted to any mental institution\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 922(h) of the Gun Control Act of 1968.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>According to the evidence produced by the government, the Board of Mental Health of Lancaster County, Nebraska, found the defendant to be mentally ill and in need of hospitalization and ordered him hospitalized pursuant to 5 Neb.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 83-328 (1971). It was the position of the government that the finding of the mental illness constituted an adjudication of mental defectiveness, and that the order of hospitalization constituted a commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-4\">During the government\u2019s case, the doctor who had examined the \u25a0 defendant upon his admission to Lincoln State Hospital testified. He stated that the defendant was found not to have a serious mental disorder, and that he was not in need of hospitalization. He also stated that the defendant was not a mental defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">The evidence showed that the defendant was released from the hospital on \u201cconvalescent leave\u201d after two weeks, and was shortly thereafter formally discharged. Subsequent to his release, the defendant had no further contacts with the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-6\">At the close of the government\u2019s case, the defendant moved for a directed verdict on the grounds that there was no evidence to show that he had either been adjudicated a mental defective or committed to a mental institution. This motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-11\">The defendant then presented his case. The defendant testified that he did not believe that his entry into the Lincoln State Hospital constituted a \u201ccommitment.\u201d He stated that he had been told that it was solely for a brief period of observation. This testimony was corroborated in part by the defendant\u2019s wife.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1224-12\">At the close of the case, the court instructed the jury that they could find the defendant guilty if he had either been adjudicated a mental defective <em>or </em>if he had been committed to a mental institution. The court then defined a mental defective as a \u201cperson who has any abnormal condition of the mind which substantially affects mental or emotional processes and substantially impairs behavior controls.\u201d The court did not further define the term \u201ccommitment.\u201d The defendant objected, stating that he did not believe the question of whether the defendant was a mental defective should go to the jury because no evidence had been introduced in that regard. The judge overruled this objection.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1224-13\">The first question is whether the defendant\u2019s hospitalization, pursuant to the County Mental Health Board\u2019s order, was a \u201ccommitment.\u201d The government conceded on appeal that the defendant was not committed because there was no compliance with 5 Neb.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 83-328.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This concession is well taken. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>The Nebraska statutory scheme establishes a two-step procedure for determining that an individual is a mentally ill person in need of hospitalization. First, the individual may be temporarily hospitalized for psychiatric observation if the County Mental Health Board makes a determination that he is a mentally ill person in need of hospitalization. Second, an individual may be <em>committed </em>to a hospital if, on the basis of this observation, the superintendent of the state mental hospital determines that the individual is mentally ill and then certifies this determination to the County Board of Mental Health.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-5\">In the present case, no evidence was introduced to establish that the superintendent of the mental hospital had determined the defendant was mentally ill or had conveyed any certification to the Mental Health Board. The record rather indicates that the defendant was found by the superintendent to have no serious mental illness, and was found not in need of hospitalization. Thus, the scope of the Mental Health Board\u2019s order hospitalizing the defendant was limited to \u201cauthorizing the superintendent of the hospital to receive and keep the person as a patient for a period of <em>observation, </em>not to exceed sixty days * * (Emphasis added.). 5 Neb.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 83-328. There is nothing in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(h) which indicates an intent to prohibit the possession of firearms by persons who had been hospitalized for observation and examination, where they were found not to be mentally ill. The statute makes it clear that a commitment is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-6\">The second question is whether the finding by the Mental Health Board, that the defendant was mentally ill, was an adjudication of mental defectiveness within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922 (h). We hold that it was not. We do not reach the question of whether the \u201cfinding\u201d was an \u201cadjudication\u201d because we believe that the term \u201cmental defective\u201d as used in the Gun Control Act does not include mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-9\">The Gun Control Act itself does not define the term \u201cmental defective.\u201d The parties have not suggested any legislative history which would illuminate this point, and we have found nothing in the committee reports or debates which is helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-10\">Thus, we are left to ourselves to determine the meaning of the term \u201cmental defective,\u201d \u201c * * * without any revealing guides as to the intent of Congress. In these circumstances we should follow the familiar rule that criminal statutes are to be strictly construed and give to \u2018[mental defective]\u2019 its narrow meaning * * Yates v. United States, 354 U.S. 298, 310, 77 S.Ct. 1064, 1072, 1 L.Ed.2d 1356 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-12\">At trial, the following colloquy took place between the defendant\u2019s counsel and the doctor who had examined the defendant at the state mental hospital:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-13\">\u201cQ. Dr. Richardson, are you familiar with the term mentally defective, or mental defective?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-14\">\u201cA. I think that I would know what is generally meant by mental defective, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-15\">\u201cQ. What is your understanding of the term mental defective?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-16\">\u201cA. My understanding of the term would be an impairment of intellectual abilities so it would be synonymous with mental retardation. This would be my understanding of the term.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-17\">\u201cQ. Dr. Richardson, based upon your training and based upon your examinations of Larry Hansel do you have an opinion as to whether or not Mr. Hansel would be classified as a mental defective ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>\u201cA. No, he would not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-4\">\u201cQ. He would not be classified as a mental defective?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-5\">\u201cA. In my opinion he would not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1226-6\">No testimony to the contrary was introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-7\">In law, a distinction has usually been made between those persons who are mentally defective or deficient on the one hand, and those who are mentally diseased or ill on the other. See, People v. Thayer, 121 Misc. 745, 202 N.Y.S. 633 (Ulster County Ct. 1923); Interstate Compact on Mental Health, 5A Ark.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 59-801; Herzog, Medical Jurisprudence, \u00a7\u00a7 561-585 (1931); 1 Wharton and Stille, Medical Jurisprudence, \u00a7\u00a7 1073-1093 (5th ed. 1905). In its plain meaning, the term \u201cmental defective,\u201d as Dr. Richardson testified, normally designates an individual of marked subnormal intelligence. People v. Hoffmann, 255 App.Div. 404, 8 N.Y.S.2d 83, 85 (App.Div.1938). In that case, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-8\">\u201c * * * The statutes do not define \u2018mental defect,\u2019 \u2018mental defective,\u2019 nor \u2018mental deficiency;\u2019 but Webster\u2019s Dictionary (1935 edition) denominates these as \u2018marked subnormal intelligence,\u2019 \u2018lack of intelligence,\u2019 and that in varying degrees of the descending scale of moronity, imbecility and idiOCy^ * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1226-11\">Similarly, a psychiatric dictionary defines \u201cmental defective\u201d as \u201cone who is subnormal intellectually, feebleminded.\u201d L. Hinsie &amp; R. Campbell, Psychiatric Dictionary (1960). The Encyclopedia Britanniea states that mental defectiveness, mental deficiency and feeblemind-edness are synonyms which denote limitations of development of the personality, usually including intellectual retardation. 15 Encyclopedia Britanniea 167 (1972). The Royal Commission on Capital Punishment (1953) has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-12\">\u201c336. \u2018Mental deficiency\u2019 is generally understood as meaning intellectual defect, or defect of understanding, existing from birth or from an early age. In England \u2018mental defectiveness\u2019 is defined by statute as \u2018a condition of arrested or incomplete development of mind existing before the age of eighteen years, whether arising from inherent causes or induced by disease or injury\u2019.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-15\">A mental defective, therefore, as has often been said, is a person who has never possessed a normal degree of intellectual capacity, whereas in an insane person faculties which were originally normal have been impaired by mental disease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-16\">\u201c337. In England mental defectives are divided into four classes, which are defined as follows:- \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-17\">\u201c \u2018(a) Idiots, that is to say, persons in whose case there exists mental defectiveness of such a degree that they are unable to guard themselves against common physical dangers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-18\">\u201c\u2018(b) Imbeciles, that is to say, persons in whose case there exists mental defectiveness which, though not</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-19\">amounting to idiocy, is yet so pronounced that they are incapable of managing themselves or their affairs or, in the case of children, of being taught to do so;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-20\">\u201c\u2018(c) Feeble-minded persons, that is to say, persons in whose case there exists mental defectiveness which, though not amounting to imbecility, is yet so pronounced that they require care, supervision and control for their own protection or for the protection of others or, in the case of children, that they appear to be permanently incapable by reason of such defectiveness of receiving proper benefit from the instruction in ordinary schools;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-22\">\u201c \u2018(d) Moral defectives, that is to say, persons in whose case there exists mental defectiveness coupled with strongly vicious or criminal propensities and who require care, supervision and control for the protection of others.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1125\">*1125</page-number>We recognize that the term \u201cmental defective\u201d has on occasion, been given a more expansive meaning by courts and legislatures. See, United States v. Flores-Rodriguez, 237 F.2d 405, 411 (2nd Cir. 1956). But as we have said, we must construe the statute narrowly and give to \u201cmental defective\u201d its. general meaning. If it is the desire of Congress to prohibit persons who have any history of mental illness from possessing guns, it can pass legislation to that effect, but we cannot read into this criminal statute an intent to do so. We can speculate that Congress desired to keep guns from all who had a history of mental illness and we might agree that such a policy would be desirable; but we can find no support for such a holding on our part.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We, therefore, hold that the defendant\u2019s convictions must be set aside and a judgment of acquittal entered on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1223-13\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(h) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1223-14\">\u201c(h) It shall be unlawful for any person\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1223-15\">\u201c(1) who is under indictment for, or who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1223-16\">\u201c (2) who is a fugitive from justice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax7\">\u201c(3) who is an unlawful user of or addicted to marihuana or any depressant or stimulant drug (as defined in section 201 (v) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act) or narcotic drug (as defined in section 4731(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954) ; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae1\">\u201c(4) who has been adjudicated as a mental defective or who has been committed to any mental institution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1223-25\">\u201cto receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1224-7\">.

The jury returned a general verdict of guilty on both counts. It made no special finding that the defendant nad been \u201ccommitted to any mental institution\u201d or \u201cadjudicated a mental defective.\u201d Under such circumstances, we must examine the record to determine whether there is evidence to support both. For the reasons set forth in the opinion, we feel that there is not sufficient evidence to support either.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1224-9\">. 5 Xeb.ltev.\u00edStat. \u00a7 83-32S (1971) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARqf\"><em>\u201c83-328.
