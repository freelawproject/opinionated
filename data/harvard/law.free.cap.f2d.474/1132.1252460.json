He makes three contentions. We find them unmeritorious and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-25\">Stow contends that the local board should have reopened his classification when he requested a conscientious objector form <em>after </em>his local board mailed his order to report for induction. On November 17, 1970, the local board mailed an order to report to the address last reported to it by Stow. The order was returned marked: \u201cMoved, left no address.\u201d In spite of reasonable efforts, the board was unable to contact Stow. On December 4, 1970, Stow notified the board of his whereabouts. It was on this date, for the first time, that Stow requested a form to apply for conscientious objector status.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-27\">The request for a change of classification was not timely because it was requested after the induction order had been mailed. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2 provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1235-28\">The classification of a registrant shall not be reopened after the local board has mailed to such registrant an Or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>der to Report for Induction . unless the local board first specifically finds there has been a change in the registrant\u2019s status resulting from circumstances over which the registrant had no control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1236-4\">Lack of timeliness can be obviated only by a showing that the tardiness was due to circumstances over which Stow had no control. This he has not done. On April 7, 1971, the local board, pursuant to an order from the State Director of Selective Service, reviewed Stow\u2019s claim of conscientious objection pursuant to 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2. The board specifically found that there had not been a change resulting from circumstances over which Stow had no control. That finding is supported by the record.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1236-5\">In Ehlert v. United States, 402 U.S. 99, 91 S.Ct. 1319, 28 L.Ed.2d 625 (1971), the Supreme Court was confronted with the question of whether crystallization of conscientious objector beliefs after the mailing of a notice to report for induction constituted a \u201ccircumstance over which the registrant had no control.\u201d Without deciding \u201c . . . the nature of \u2018control\u2019 over one\u2019s own conscience . . . \u201d the Supreme Court stated that \u201c . since the meaning of the language is not free from doubt, we are obligated to regard as controlling a reasonable, consistently applied administrative interpretation if the Government\u2019s be such.\u201d 402 U.S. at 105, 91 S.Ct. at 1323. In accepting the government\u2019s contention that his crystallization did not constitute a eir-cumstance over which Ehlert had no control the Court went on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1236-14\">The Government\u2019s interpretation is a plausible construction of the language of the actual regulation, though admittedly not the only possible one. Given the ambiguity of the language, it is wholly rational to confine it to those \u201cobjectively identifiable\u201d and \u201cextraneous\u201d circumstances that are most likely to prove manageable without putting undue burdens on the administration of the Selective Service System. 402 U.S. at 105, 91 S.Ct. at 1323.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1236-15\">As a result of <em>Ehlert, </em>it becomes clear that for purposes of 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2, the crystallization of conscientious objector beliefs after a notice of induction is not a change in the registrant\u2019s status resulting from circumstances over which he had no control. The Court explained the rationale behind its holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1236-16\">A regulation barring post-induction notice presentation of conscientious objector claims, with the proviso mentioned, would be entirely reasonable as a timeliness rule. . . . Allocation of the burden of handling claims that first arise in the brief period between notice and induction seems well within the discretion of those concerned with choosing the most feasible means for operating the Selective Service and military systems.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 102, 91 S.Ct. at 1322.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1236-18\">Furthermore, Stow cannot rely on the fact that he requested his conscientious objector form before he received his induction order for three reasons. First, he did not receive his order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number>promptly because of his own failure to supply the board with a current mailing address. Second, the mere request of a conscientious objector form with nothing more does not present \u00e1 prima facie claim. United States v. Lloyd, 431 F.2d 160 (9th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 403 U.S. 911, 91 S.Ct. 2210, 29 L.Ed.2d 688 (1971); United States v. Enslow, 426 F.2d 544 (9th Cir. 1970). Third, the cutting point of timeliness is the date of mailing, not the date of receipt. 32 C. F.R. \u00a7 1625.2; <em>cf. </em>Ehlert v. United States, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1237-5\">Stow next contends that the local board improperly denied him a hearing. He had made two requests for a personal appearance, both of which were made after the board mailed his induction order. The purpose of his requests was to support his conscientious objector claim. As that claim could not be heard on the merits because it was untimely, Stow cannot claim any procedural rights\u2019 violation. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2; <em>cf. </em>United States v. Stupke, 451 F.2d 997, 998 (9th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-6\">Finally, Stow contends that the original induction order lapsed. This argument is based on 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1632.2, which allows a maximum postponement of induction of 120 days. A similar factual situation arose in United States v. Foster, 439 F.2d 29, 31 (9th Cir. 1971) where we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1237-7\">Since, however, every postponement, including those occurring after the 120 day period had run, was granted at appellant\u2019s specific request or was due to his actions and all were for his benefit, we feel we would be taking an unnecessarily rigid approach by saying, in effect, that the local board does not have the discretion to aid the registrant by allowing him more time than the regulations specify.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1237-8\">The vast majority of delays in the instant case can be attributed directly to Stow\u2019s own actions, or were the actions of the Selective Service Board for his benefit. Stow\u2019s claim that the order lapsed and that a new order should have been issued, thereby allowing him an opportunity to prosecute his conscientious objector claim, is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1236-10\">. After his induction order had been mailed, Stow wrote to the local board requesting a conscientious objector form. He specifically offered late crystallization as his reason for the request. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1236-11\"><em>Very recently my beliefs have become to </em>(sic) <em>strong </em>(I think the expression \u201cfixed\u201d would be the word) that I again ask for the form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1236-12\">I will fill it out and send it back promptly. I have thought about this matter a great deal and <em>have finally made up my mind, I mean that my conscience has now made it up for me. </em>(Etaphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1236-20\">. The proviso referred to is that the military provide adequate means of due process so \u201cthat no inductee could be ordered to combatant training or service before a prompt, fair, and proper in-service determination of his claim.\u201d 402 U.S. at 101, 91 S.Ct. at 1322.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
