Edward Weinfeld, United States District Judge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Orr was found guilty of unlawfully failing to report for induction<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> into the Armed Forces (50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462(a)) and was sentenced to a prison term of six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-7\">The evidence shows that appellant registered with Local Board 12 in New York City in September 1969. He also submitted his classification questionnaire (SSS Form 100) in which he asserted a claim for conscientious objector status. On July 2, 1970, the Board mailed to appellant the Special Form for Conscientious Objectors (SSS Form 150). He, however, did not return the form and the Board, on October 27, 1970, classified him I-A, noting on his file \u201cdoubt sincere C.O.\u201d He was duly notified of his classification and of his right to a personal appearance and an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-8\">On November 18, 1970, appellant made a personal appearance before Board Chairman David Edwards, who prepared a written summary of the interview:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Apkq\">Registrant appeared and was sworn. States he failed to return Form 150 because it was lost or destroyed in a fire. States he is a member of the Muslim religion and has been so for the past 8 or 9 months. He participates regularly in their activities and works in one of their health food stores. Produced membership card.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1469-9\">He claims conscientious objector exemption by reason of his religious beliefs and membership in the Muslim religion that he should not take part in wars which take human lives. However, he states he is not opposed to participation in all wars; that he would participate in a war in self defense which he thought was a threat to him, his family, his mosque, his loved ones or intimate community. Board believes he is sincere in his beliefs. Registrant informed to complete &amp; return form 150 and consideration to be given upon receipt of same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1469-13\">Appellant returned SSS Form 150 in which he made the following statement in describing the nature of his belief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ark-dedup-0\">We believe that we who declared ourselves to be rightous [sic] Muslims, should not participate in wars which take the lives of humans. We do not believe this nation should force us to take part in such wars, for we have nothing to gain from it, unless America agrees to give us the necessary territory wherein we may have something to fight for.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1469-14\">On December 16, 1970, the Local Board noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1469-15\">Unable to determine sincerity without personal interview. Call in for interview.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1469-16\">Thus, the appellant made a second personal appearance on February 16, 1971. The Board summarized the interview as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1469-17\">Registrant appeared and affirmed to tell the truth. He is a member of Muslim religion. He cannot participate in armed services as his present work is more meaningful. Present wars and conflicts have no value to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1469-18\">However, he could participate in a war that has value or meaningful benefit to him. Not eligible for C.O. classification. Reopening not warranted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1469-19\">Appellant\u2019s conscientious objector claim was rejected by the Local Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1368\">*1368</page-number>by a vote of 4-0, and on March 25, 1971 the Appeal Board unanimously (5-0) classified him I-A. Appellant was then ordered to report for induction on May 11, 1971. Upon his failure to report, this prosecution was commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-5\">The issue before a district court reviewing a Selective Service Board\u2019s decision to deny a registrant conscientious objector status, is indeed the narrow one of whether or not the Board had a \u201cbasis in fact\u201d for that decision. United States v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163, 185, 85 S.Ct. 850, 13 L.Ed.2d 733 (1965); Lovallo v. Resor, 443 F.2d 1262 (2d Cir. 1971). It would also seem clear that it was not the intent of Congress that the district judge permit a trial de novo as to whether or not he would classify the registrant as a conscientious objector; rather, Congress intended that the judge decide only whether there was a \u201cbasis in fact\u201d for the classification in the Selective Service file. United States v. Lloyd, 431 F.2d 160, 166 (9th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 403 U.S. 911, 91 S. Ct. 2210, 29 L.Ed.2d 688 (1971). Finally, in applying the tests for conscientious objector status \u201cthe Selective Service System must be concerned with the registrant as an individual, not with its own interpretation of the dogma of the religious sect, if any, to which he may belong.\u201d Clay v. United States, 403 U.S. 698, 700, 91 S.Ct. 2068, 2070, 29 L.Ed.2d 810 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-6\">In light of these principles we affirm the decision below. The major attack of the appellant here is that the district court erred in failing to recognize the applicability of Sicurella v. United States, 348 U.S. 385, 75 S.Ct. 403, 99 L.Ed. 436 (1955). There the Supreme Court held that the willingness of a Jehovah\u2019s Witness to participate in a \u201ctheocratic war,\u201d in the \u201cArmageddon\u201d where the forces of good would clash with the forces of evil but without \u201ccarnal weapons,\u201d did not prevent his classification as a conscientious objector. Appellant\u2019s scholarly brief and argument on appeal are in effect an attempt to equate the Black Muslim tenets with those of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in the area of conscientious objection to war. In view of the holdings of the Supreme Court we have referred to, the question is not the tenets of the church but the beliefs of the registrant as expressed to the Board which had the responsibility of classifying him. Judge Weinfeld carefully considered <em>Sicurella </em>in his opinion and there is little we need add to his scholarly analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-8\"> Orr\u2019s statement to the Board on his SSS Form 150 provided it with an ample basis in fact to determine that his objection to war, was selective and conditional. He was not opposed to all wars. His willingness to fight in a war was conditioned on America\u2019s giving the Black Muslims \u201cthe necessary territory wherein [he would] have something to fight for.\u201d The appellant now urges that the territory was really theocratic like the Kingdom of Jehovah and the fighting would be without \u201ccarnal weapons\u201d but by means of the power of Allah operating through the bodies of his followers. The Board, on the basis of Orr\u2019s statement, had the right to consider that the territorial acquisition suggested would be material, not spiritual, and that the \u201cwar\u201d to defend it would be conventional. Appellant is relying not on evidence before the Board but on extrapolations of his own testimony before Judge Weinfeld who, although trying the case without a jury, had to caution Orr\u2019s counsel on several occasions not to lead the defendant. Orr admittedly did not simply repeat the testimony he had given before the Board but stated that when he had appeared he had just come into the temple and did not have a full understanding of what he said or \u201cshould have said.\u201d We do not believe that Orr\u2019s evolving understanding of what he believes is an appropriate criterion for judging whether or not the Board had a basis in fact for the determination it was required to make from the record before it. Nevertheless, if any error was committed by Judge Weinfeld in permitting the examination of Orr to continue as to his present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1369\">*1369</page-number>views which were not held or articulated at the time of his appearance before the Board, it was not prejudicial to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-5\">Appellant contends that the failure of the Appeal Board to provide a \u201cstatement of reasons\u201d precludes a meaningful judicial review and the conclusion of Judge Weinfeld that the Appeal Board was not required to state reasons was \u201cplainly erroneous.\u201d This contention has no merit. The emerging doctrine in the Selective Service cases, that the Board must furnish reasons, is based on general administrative law principles. SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 94, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943). We know of no authority which precludes an appellate administrative tribunal from affirming the findings of a subordinate board without restatement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Local Board\u2019s stated reason was in effect that Orr was not \u201cconscientiously opposed to participation to war in any form.\u201d Gillette v. United States, 401 U.S. 437, 91 S.Ct. 828, 28 L.Ed.2d 168 (1971). Had the Local Board proceeded on more than one ground and if one of them was in fact invalid, a simple affirmance would make it impossible for a court to determine the basis of the decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> No such problem exists here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-6\"> Appellant argues further that the Local Board erred by finding that Orr\u2019s willingness to use force to defend himself, his mosque, his loved ones or intimate community \u201cforeclosed him from the C.O. exemption.\u201d While the use of force to repel an assailant or an attack on one\u2019s family or friends would not be inconsistent with conscientious objector status, United States v. Purvis, 403 F.2d 555, 563 (2d Cir. 1968), there is nothing in the record to suggest that the Board based its decision on this position. As Judge Weinfeld pointed out in his opinion below the only mention made by Orr of his willingness to fight in a war in self defense, was in his November 18, 1970 appearance before the Board. It was after this appearance that the Board provided him with a C.O. form (SSS Form 150) advising him to fill it out and that consideration would be given upon its receipt. The Board did not deny him C.O. status on the basis of this view. It was only after he returned the form and the Board called him back for a second personal interview on February 16, 1971 that he was denied C.O. status. The Board then clearly indicated that its reason was that Orr was willing to participate in a war which had \u201cvalue or meaningful benefit to him\u201d, <em>i.e., </em>to defend territory given by America to the Black Muslims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-13\">Appellant\u2019s argument that the Board based its decision on the erroneous \u201cself defense\u201d position, is based not on the record but on Chairman Edwards\u2019 testimony before the Court regarding the Local Board\u2019s policy and practice. This is testimony which the appellant curiously urges was erroneously admitted citing Lenhard v. United States, 405 U.S. 1013, 92 S.Ct. 1296, 31 L.Ed.2d 477 (1972), which vacated our affirmance of Lenhard\u2019s conviction, 455 F.2d 1406 (2d Cir. 1971),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and remanded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1370\">*1370</page-number>the case for our consideration of points raised in the memorandum of the Solicitor General; those points have no application here. In <em>Lenhard </em>the local board had dismissed a claim of conscientious objection without stating reasons. Thus there was no opportunity to rebut the local board\u2019s position on appeal \u2014 there was no opportunity for a meaningful administrative review. Here there is no question of the reasons for the Board\u2019s decision. Whether or not Edwards\u2019 testimony was properly admissible, no prejudice is established by the defendant. In fact, Edwards had no independent recollection of Orr\u2019s case and could only testify as to general procedures of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-4\">Having considered all of the arguments made on this appeal, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1469-10\">. The District Court opinion, filed on May 11, 1972, is reported at 343 F.Supp. 178 (S.D.N.Y.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1469-11\">. Orr did not dispute the fact that he intentionally and willfully failed to report for induction. Rather, he claimed that he had erroneously been denied conscientious objector status under 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456(j) which provides that any registrant who \u201cby reason of religious training and belief, is conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form,\u201d is entitled to exemption from military service.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1471-7\">. Congress in the 1971 amendments to the Selective Service Act of 1967 (Act of Sept. 28, 1971, Pub.L.No.92-129, 85 Stat. 348) provided that \u201c[i]n the event of a decision adverse to the claim of a registrant, the local or appeal board making such decision shall, upon request, furnish to such registrant a brief written statement of the reasons for its decision.\u201d (50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 471a (b)(4)). This section however, does not by its terms, purport to be retroactive. As we noted in United States ex rel. Checkman v. Laird, 2 Cir., 469 F.2d 773 (1972), \u201cit is arguable\u201d that a local board\u2019s statement of reasons was required prior to the 1971 amendments, see also Fein v. Selective Serv. Sys., 405 U.S. 365, 380-381, 92 S.Ct. 1062, 31 L.Ed.2d 298 (1972); but we did not indicate that the argument would have equal force with regard to an appeal board, when the local board has given reasons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1471-15\">. See generally, Clay v. United States, 403 U.S. 698, 704-705, 91 S.Ct. 2068, 29 L.Ed.2d 810 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1471-17\">. This Court first considered the <em>Lenhard </em>ease in 437 F.2d 936 (1970). There, noting that neither the Local Board nor the State Appeal Board had given any explanation for their denial of the C.O. clas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1370\">*1370</page-number>sification, we remanded the case to the district court to allow the government to show the reasons upon which the Board had acted. In view of new testimony by Local Board members that they had found Lenhard\u2019s claim insincere, the district court reinstated the conviction and sentence, and we affirmed without opinion (455 F.2d 1406 (1971)). On remand from the Supreme Court\u2019s vaeature of judgment (405 U.S. 1013, 92 S.Ct. 1296, 31 L.Ed.2d 477 (1972)) we reversed Len-hard\u2019s conviction. 461 F.2d 1268 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
