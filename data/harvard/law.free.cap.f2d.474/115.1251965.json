We find that \u00a7 3604(e) falls within the constitutional authority of Congress to enact legislation to enforce the Thirteenth Amendment and that \u00a7 3604(e) does not violate the First Amendment. The District Court enjoined appellant from violating \u00a7 3604(e). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-23\">This action was brought by the Department of Justice pursuant to Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3601 et seq., alleging that appellant, Bobby L. Lawrence, President of Bob Lawrence Realty, Inc., and four other Atlanta, Georgia real estate brokers had undertaken \u201cblockbusting\u201d activities prohibited by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(e).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The government\u2019s complaint seeking injunc-tive relief arose out of all the defendants\u2019 solicitation activities in racially transitional areas in southeast Atlanta. It alleged (1) that the defendants participated, individually and collectively, in a pattern or practice of resistance to the enjoyment of rights granted by the Act, and (2) that a group of persons had been denied rights secured by the Act, raising an issue of general public importance. See, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-24\">The District Court denied several motions filed by appellant and various other defendants, including motions to dismiss, for a more definite statement, for a jury trial, and for a severance. United States v. Bob Lawrence Realty, Inc., N.D.Ga.1970, 313 F.Supp. 870 <em>(Lawrence I).</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Following the denial of these motions, appellant and two other defendants filed separate motions_for summary judgment, which the District Court denied. The District Court held, however, that the government\u2019s affidavits and documentary evidence were insufficient to make out an \u201cindividual pattern or practice\u201d of violations by appellant, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>granted summary judgment as to that issue. The District Court also held that triable issues of fact existed as to whether appellant had participated in a \u201cgroup pattern or practice\u201d of unlawful conduct and as to whether there had been a denial of rights secured by the Act to a group of persons raising an issue of general public importance. United States v. Bob Lawrence Realty, Inc., N.D.Ga.1971, 327 F.Supp. 487 <em>(Lawrence II).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Shortly before the trial, consent decrees were entered against two of the five original defendants, and the action against a third was dismissed. The case as it pertained to appellant and the other remaining defendant then proceeded to trial. The District Court 'made the following findings of fact, which are more fully set out in its opinion. United States v. Mitchell, N.D.Ga.1971, 335 F.Supp. 1004.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">Appellant is a real estate broker licensed by the State of Georgia to engage in the listing and selling of real estate,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and employs twenty seven sales personnel who act as his agents.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> During the period with which this action is concerned, appellant did business in the Candler Road \u2014 McAfee area in southeast Atlanta. Appellant was aware that this area has been a racially transitional area since 1968, approximately two years before the action was filed. Prior to 1968 the racial composition of the area was all white, \u25a0 but as blacks began moving into the area in 1968, whites began moving out. Two of appellant\u2019s sales personnel made representations prohibited by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(e) to four different individuals. Although these representations did not constitute an \u201cindividual pattern or practice\u201d of violating the Act, they were made as part of a \u201cgroup pattern or practice\u201d of violating the Act by all agents in the area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">The District Court did not consider the evidence sufficient to raise an issue of general public importance as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613 and made no finding as to whether a group of persons had been denied rights under the Act. The District Court also made no finding concerning appellant\u2019s counterclaim and cross-action to recover attorney\u2019s fees and for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-13\">On December 27, 1971, the District Court issued its opinion and order enjoining appellant from further unlawful conduct, from which ruling only appellant appeals.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>On appeal to this Court, appellant launches a scatter gun attack on the District Court\u2019s order. As we perceive appellant\u2019s brief, he presents four arguments: (1) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(e) is unconstitutional; (2) the Attorney General lacks standing to maintain this action; (3) the injunctive relief is improper; and (4) appellant is entitled to recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">I.

F &amp; F Investment, N.D.Ill.1969, 300 F.Supp. 210, 214. <em>See generally, Note, </em>Blockbusting, 59 Geo.L.J. 170 (1970); Note, Blockbusting: A Novel Statutory Approach to an Increasingly Serious Problem, 7 Colum. J. of Law &amp; Soc. Sci. 538 (1971). Blockbusting practices \u201c . . . constitute a fundamental element in the perpetuation of segregated neighborhoods, racial ghettos and the concomitant evils which have been universally recognized to emanate therefrom.\u201d Brown v. State Realty Co., N.D.Ga.1969, 304 F.Supp. 1236, 1240. In order to attack this pernicious example of a <em>\\ </em>capitalistic ethic gone astray, Congress enacted 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(e), the anti-blockbusting provision of the Fair Housing Act of 1968.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Congress was aware that as laudable and necessary as the profit motive might be for our socio-economic system, it must on occasion yield to more humane and compassionate mores which are inherent in the, system itself, and necessary for its survival.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Appellant argues that \u00a7 3604(e) is unconstitutional on two grounds: (A) Congress does not have authority to enact the statute. (B) The statute violates the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\n<em>A. Congressional authority</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ami\">In evaluating appellant\u2019s first contention that Congress has no authority to enact \u00a7 3604(e), we are given much guidance by the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Jones v. Mayer Co., 1968, 392 U.S. 409, 88 S.Ct. 2186, 20 L.Ed.2d 1189. In upholding the constitutionality of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1982, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">\u201cOur starting point is the Thirteenth Amendment, for it was pursuant to that constitutional provision that Congress originally enacted what is now \u00a7 1982. The Amendment consists of two parts. Section 1 states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">\u2018Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereby the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\u2019 Section 2 provides :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">\u2018Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-9\">\u201cAs its text reveals, the Thirteenth Amendment \u2018is not a mere prohibition of State laws' establishing or upholding slavery, but an absolute declaration that slavery or involuntary servitude shall not exist in any part of the United States.\u2019 It has never been doubted, therefore, \u2018that the power vested in Congress to enforce the article by appropriate legislation,\u2019 ibid., includes the power to enact laws \u2018direct and primary, operating upon .the acts of individuals, whether sanctioned by state legislation or not.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-10\">\u201cThus, the fact that \u00a7 1982 operates upon the unofficial acts of private individuals, whether or not sanctioned by state law, presents no constitutional problem. If Congress has power under the Thirteenth Amendment to eradicate conditions that prevent Ne-groes from buying and renting property because of their race or color, then no federal statute calculated to achieve that objective can be thought to exceed the constitutional power of Congress simply because it reaches beyond state action to regulate the conduct of private individuals. The constitutional question in this case, therefore, comes to this: Does the authority of Congress to enforce the Thirteenth Amendment \u2018by appropriate legislation\u2019 include the power to eliminate all racial barriers to the acquisition of real and personal property? We think the answer to that question is plainly yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-13\">\u201c \u2018By its own unaided force and effect,\u2019 the Thirteenth Amendment \u2018abolished slavery, and established universal freedom\u2019. Whether or not the Amendment <em>itself </em>did any more than that \u2014 a question not involved in this case \u2014 it is at least clear that the Enabling Clause of that Amendment empowered Congress to do much more. For that clause clothed \u2018Congress with power to pass <em>all laws necessary and proper for abolishing all badges and incidents of slavery in the United States\u2019. </em>(Emphasis added.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-14\">392 U.S. at 437-439, 88 S.Ct. at 2202-2203, 20 L.Ed.2d at 1206-1207. (Citations and footnotes omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b222-15\">We think that the mandate of <em>Jones </em>is clear. This Court will give great deference, as indeed it must, to the congressional determination that \u00a7 3604(e) will effectuate the purpose of the Thirteenth Amendment by aiding in the elimination of the \u201cbadges and incidents of slavery in the United States.\u201d Jones v. Mayer Co., <em>supra, </em>392 U.S. at 439, 88 S.Ct. at 2203, 20 L.Ed.2d at 1207; Brown v. State Realty, <em>supra, </em>304 F.Supp. at 1240.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellants have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>failed to present any argument that impugns the reasonableness of the congressional determination. Indeed, no such argument can be made in light of the role that blockbusting plays in creating and in perpetuating segregated housing patterns and thus in preventing \u201c . . . a dollar in the hands of a Negro . . . [from purchasing] the same thing as a dollar in the hands of a white man.\u201d Jones v. Mayer Co., <em>supra, </em>392 U.S. at 443, 88 S.Ct. at 2205, 20 L.Ed.2d at 1209; <em>see also, </em>Note, Discriminatory Housing Markets, Racial Unconscionability, and Section 1988: The \u2018Contract Buyers League\u2019 Case, 80 Yale L.J. 516 (1971). We find that the Thirteenth Amendment empowers Congress to enact \u00a7 3604(e).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">\n<em>B. Blockbusting and the First Amendment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">Appellant contends that \u00a7 3604(e) constitutes an unconstitutional prior restraint by Congress on the right to free speech. In rejecting this contention, the court below stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-10\">\u201cIt is evident that the statute did not make mere speech unlawful. What it does make unlawful is economic exploitation of racial bias and panic selling. We conclude that the statute is one regulating conduct, and that any inhibiting effect it may have upon speech is justified by the Government\u2019s interest in protecting its citizens from discriminatory housing practices and is not violative of the First Amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-11\"><em>Lawrence I, supra, </em>313 F.Supp. at 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">We agree with the District Court. As Judge Sobeloff said in United States v. Hunter, 4 Cir. 1972, 459 F.2d 205, cert. denied, 1972, 409 U.S. 934, 93 S.Ct. 235, 34 L.Ed.2d 189, a case that held that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(c) does not violate the First Amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-21\">\u201cIt is now well settled that, while \u2018freedom of communicating information and disseminating opinion\u2019 enjoys the fullest protection of the First Amendment, \u2018the Constitution imposes no such restraint on government as respects purely commercial advertising.\u2019 Valentine v. Chrestensen, 316 U.S. 52, 54, 62 S.Ct. 920, 921, 86 L.Ed. 1262 (1942). See Breard v. City of Alexandria, 341 U.S. 622, 641-645, 71 S.Ct. 920, 95 L.Ed. 1233 (1951); New York State Broadcasters Ass\u2019n Inc. v. United States, 414 F.2d 990, 998-999 (2nd Cir. 1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>396 U.S. 1061, 90 S.Ct. 752, 24 L.Ed.2d 755 (1970); Banzhaf v. F C C, 132 U.S.App.D.C. 14, 405 F.2d 1082, 1099-1103 (1968), <em>cert. denied, sub nom. </em>Tobacco Institute, Inc. v. F C C, 396 U.S. 842, 90 S.Ct. 50, 24 L.Ed.2d 93 (1969); Capital Broadcasting Co. v. Mitchell, 333 F.Supp. 582 (D.D.C.1971), (three-judge court), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom. </em>Capital Broadcasting Co. v. Klein-dienst, Acting Attorney General, 405 U.S. 1000, 92 S.Ct. 1289, 31 L.Ed.2d 472 (1972).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-23\">United States v. Hunter, <em>supra, </em>459 F.2d at 211-212.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-24\">Section 3604(e) regulates commercial activity, not speech. The statute is aimed at the commercial activities of those who would profiteer off the ills of society, conduct that the Thirteenth Amendment empowers Congress to regulate. We think the court in United States v. Mintzes, D.Md.1969, 304 F.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Supp. 1305, correctly analyzed the statute when it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-4\">\u201cThe words \u2018for profit,\u2019 as used in section 3604(e) include the purchase of property by prohibited means with the hope of selling it for a larger price, but the words are not limited to such a transaction. They were evidently included in \u00a7 3604(e) to distinguish and eliminate from the operation of that subsection statements made in social, political or other contexts, as distinguished from a commercial context, where the person making the representations hopes to obtain some financial gain as a result of the representations. See Halsted v. S. E. C., 86 U.S.App.D.C. 352, 182 F.2d 660, 668 (1950).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">304 F.Supp. at 1312.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Appellant argues that an individual cannot properly be enjoined from making racial representations to obtain the business of a potential seller when the racial statement presents the truth. But it is clear that just as \u201c[t]he state can prohibit the use of the street for the distribution of purely commercial leaflets, even though such leaflets may have \u2018a civic appeal, or a moral platitude\u2019 appended,\u201d Jamison v. Texas, 1943, 318 U.S. 413, 417, 63 S.Ct. 669, 672, 87 L.Ed. 869, 873, the federal government may in some circumstances prohibit <em>purely commercial </em>speech made in connection with conduct which Congress can permissibly regulate or prohibit. Any informational value in a statement violative of \u00a7 3604(e) is clearly outweighed by the government\u2019s overriding interest in preventing blockbusting. <em>See, </em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, 1968, 391 U.S. 367, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">The only \u201cspeech\u201d proscribed by \u00a7 3604(e) is commercial speech made to gain profit from racial representations. If \u00a7 3604(e) were to reach a non-commercial statement, a political statement, or a purely informational statement, it would naturally be subject to First Amendment attack. <em>See, </em>United States v. Hunter, <em>supra, </em>459 F.2d at 212 n. 9. However, it doesn\u2019t, and so \u00a7 3604(e) does not violate the First Amendment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">II. STANDING OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-11\">\u201cWhenever the Attorney General has reasonable cause to believe that any person or group of persons is engaged in a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of any of the rights granted by this subchap-ter, or that any group of persons has been denied any of the rights granted by this subchapter and such denial raises an. issue of general public importance, he may bring a civil action in any appropriate United States district court by filing with it a complaint setting forth the facts and requesting such preventive relief, including an application for a permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order, or other order against the person or persons responsible for such pattern or practice or denial of rights, as he deems necessary to insure the full enjoyment of the rights granted by this subchapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-12\">The Attorney General thus has standing to sue whenever (1) there is an \u201cindividual\u201d or a \u201cgroup\u201d pattern or practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>violative of the Fair Housing Act<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or (2) whenever a group of persons has been denied rights granted by the Act and that denial raises an issue of general public importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The District Court found that appellant had not participated in an \u201cindividual pattern or practice,\u201d but that the evidence established:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">\u201c . . . by overwhelming preponderance ... a \u2018group\u2019 pattern or practice by all agents in the area, both defendants and non-defendants, and that some agent or agents of each of the defendants did knowingly participate in such pattern or practice, at least in some measure or to some degree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">United States v. Mitchell, <em>supra, </em>335 F.Supp. at 1006 (footnotes omitted). The District Court found that appellant participated in the \u201cgroup pattern or practice\u201d when two of his agents made forbidden representations to four individuals. <em>Id. </em>The District Court made no finding as to whether or not a group of persons had been denied rights granted by the Fair Housing Act.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">As we interpret appellant\u2019s brief, he argues that the Attorney General did not have standing to sue him once the District Court found that appellant had not participated in an \u201cindividual pattern or practice.\u201d Appellant bases this argument on two grounds. He urges: (1) that the Attorney General must prove that appellant participated in an \u201cindividual pattern or practice\u201d to have standing to obtain relief for a \u201cgroup pattern or practice\u201d; and (2) that the Attorney General must allege and prove a conspiracy or concerted action in order to have standing to obtain injunctive relief against a \u201cgroup pattern or practice\u201d of violating the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">The clear meaning of \u00a7 3613 directly refutes appellant\u2019s first contention. Section 3613 authorizes the Attorney General to bring an action in District Court whenever he \u201chas reasonable cause to believe that any person or group of persons is engaged in a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of any of the rights granted by this subchapter. . . .\u201d Unless we are to construe the phrase \u201cgroup of persons\u201d as totally superfluous, there is no need for each member of the \u201cgroup of persons\u201d to be engaged in an \u201cindividual pattern or practice\u201d of violating the Act before the Attorney General has standing to sue. The statute was thus intended to reach the illegal activities of a group of persons even if the individual members of the group of persons were not engaged in an \u201cindividual pattern or practice.\u201d We decline to contradict the clear inference of \u00a7 3604(e) by adopting appellant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-16\">Appellant\u2019s second contention that the \u201cgroup of persons engaged in a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of [\u00a7 3604(e)] . . . \u201d must have engaged in a conspiracy or concerted action before the Attorney General has standing to sue is also erroneous. In considering the meaning of the \u201cpattern or practice\u201d requirement, this Court has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-18\">\u201cWe turn now to the question whether the 1969 [violations] . . . were isolated incidents or part of a pattern or practice of discrimination under the Fair Housing Act of 1968. The Act does not define \u2018pattern or practice\u2019, and the phrase is not explained by the legislative history. Relevant, however, are judicial and legislative interpretations of the phrase under earlier civil rights acts, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1960, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1971(e). The words \u2018pattern or practice\u2019 were not intended to be esoteric words of art. There is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>nothing magic in their meaning. United States v. Mayton, 5 Cir. 1964, 335 F.2d 153, 158-159. To be sure, they were intended to encompass more than an \u2018isolated or accidental or peculiar event.\u2019 <em>See </em>Hearings on H.R. 10327 Before the House Committee on the Judiciary, 86th Cong., 2d Sess. 13; United States v. Mayton, <em>supra, </em>at 158-159.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-4\">\u201cThe number of [violations] . . . is not determinative. United States v. Ramsey, 5 Cir. 1964, 331 F.2d 824, 837 (concurring opinion). Nevertheless, we do note that in a case brought under the Act involving \u2018blockbusting,\u2019 three \u00a7 3604 violations were sufficient to establish a pattern or practice. United States v. Mintzes, D.Md. 1969, 304 F.Supp. 1305, 1314-1315. In any event, no mathematical formula is workable, nor was any intended. Each case must turn on its own facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">United States v. West Peachtree Tenth Corp., 5 Cir. 1971, 437 F.2d 221, 227. Guided by this standard, we must now interpret the terms \u201cpattern or practice\u201d in the context of a group of persons alleged to be violating \u00a7 3604(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Blockbusting by its very nature does not require concerted action or a conspiracy to wreak its pernicious damage. There is, for example, no need for XYZ Realty to conspire with ABC Homes to set off a pattern or practice of activities violating the act. The sociological phenomenon of a transitional area<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> is enough to attract blockbusters intent upon culling all the profits that can be derived from the area. The very essence of the phenomenon is that a large number of competitors individually besiege an area seeking to gain a share of the market.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">\u201cIf there be any doubt as to the meaning of the statute it is our function to construe the language of the statute so as to give effect to the intent of Congress . . . .\u201d Saxon v. Georgia Ass\u2019n of Ind. Ins. Agents, Inc., 5 Cir. 1968, 399 F.2d 1010, 1015. To interpret \u00a7 3613 as requiring proof of a conspiracy before the Attorney General has standing to seek to enjoin a group pattern or practice of blockbusting would be to seriously restrict the congressional intent to stop blockbusting practices and to unjustifiably restrict the power which Congress gave to the Attorney General to proceed against group patterns or practices. We decline to do so. Even though there may be no \u201cindividual pattern or practice\u201d of blockbusting, a \u201cgroup pattern or practice\u201d of blockbusting is established when a number of individuals utilize methods which violate \u00a7 3604(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">The District Court finding that a group of persons was engaged in a pattern or practice of violating \u00a7 3604(e) demonstrates the efficacy of the Attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>ney General\u2019s decision that he had \u201creasonable cause to believe that any person or group of persons [was] engaged in a pattern or practice of resistance to [\u00a7 3604(e)] . . . \u201d <em>See, </em>United States v.

PROPRIETY OF INJUNCTIVE RELIEF</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Appellant argues in his brief that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">\u201cThe evidence conclusively shows that Bob Lawrence had done everything humanly possible to eliminate any possible violation of <em>any </em>act, particularly the 1968 Civil Rights Act. On <em>one </em>isolated afternoon in April of 1969 three calls were made on homeowners which did not result in any illegal representation being made. Before that time \u2014 no complaint. After that time \u2014 no complaint. Without the imminent danger of repetition, there is no equity jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-15\">He asks this Court to make the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-16\">\u201cA finding that injunctive relief is inappropriate to Bob Lawrence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-17\">A finding that Bob Lawrence has committed no prohibited act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-18\">A finding that Bob Lawrence has not engaged in any \u2018pattern or practice\u2019 designed to deny to any person his civil rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-19\">Appellant\u2019s argument that injunctive relief is improper in this action is apparently based on his belief that since he is totally innocent of any violation of the Act, he is being enjoined solely on the basis of activities of other real estate agents in the area, and furthermore, that equity should not intervene because there is no danger that he will violate the Act in the future. The District Court, however, explicitly found: (1) that appellant had violated \u00a7 3604(e); (2) that there was a group pattern of violating the Act by all the agents in the area; and (3) that appellant participated in that pattern or prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>tice. United States v. Mitchell, <em>supra, </em>335 F.Supp. at 1006.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Appellant failed to order a transcript of the trial below. As a result, we do not have an adequate record which will permit this Court to find the District Court\u2019s fact findings clearly erroneous. In Green v. Aetna Ins. Co., 5 Cir. 1968, 397 F.2d 614, 619, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"As2\">\u201cIt is the burden of the appellant under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 75(b) to \u2018include in the record a transcript of all evidence relevant to such finding * * *.\u2019 \u2018if [he] intends to urge on appeal that a finding * * * is unsupported by the evidence or contrary to the evidence * * *\u2019. See also, Smith v. United States, 287 F.2d 299 (5 Cir. 1961); Horton v. United States Steel, 286 F.2d 710-713 (5 Cir. 1961) and Rea Const. Co. v. B. B. McCormick and Sons, 255 F.2d 257 (5 Cir. 1958).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">The District Court finding that appellant violated the Act does not support appellant\u2019s inexplicable contention that \u201che has done nothing wrong,\u201d that he is \u201cperfectly innocent himself,\u201d and that the trial court recognized \u201cthe complete lack of any evidence of any illegal activities on behalf of Bob Lawrence.\u201d Appellant\u2019s failure to provide this Court with an adequate record precludes us from finding otherwise. Green v. Aetna Ins. Co., <em>supra; </em>Watson v. Button, 9 Cir. 1956, 235 F.2d 235; Jensen v. United States, 9 Cir. 1964, 326 F.2d 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">Similarly, appellant\u2019s argument that an injunction should not have issued because there is no danger that he will violate the Act in the future is misguided. United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 1953, 345 U.S. 629, 73 S.Ct. 894, 97 L.Ed. 1303, stated the rule of law that governs this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-11\">\u201cThe case may nevertheless be moot if the defendant can demonstrate that \u2018there is no reasonable expectation that the wrong will be repeated.\u2019 The burden is a heavy one. Here the defendants told the court that the interlocks no longer existed and disclaimed any intention to revive them. Such a profession does not suffice to make a case moot although it is one of the factors to be considered in determining the appropriateness of granting an injunction against the now-discontinued acts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-13\">Along with its power to hear the case, the court\u2019s power to grant in-junctive relief survives discontinuance of the illegal conduct. Hecht Co. v. Bowles, [321 U.S. 321, 64 S.Ct. 587, 88 L.Ed. 754], supra; Goshen Mfg. Co. v. Hubert A. Myers Mfg. Co., 242 U.S. 202, 37 S.Ct. 105, 61 L.Ed. 248 (1916). The purpose of an injunction is to prevent future violations, Swift &amp; Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 311, 326, 48 S.Ct. 311, [314], 72 L.Ed. 587, [597] (1928) and, of course, it can be utilized even without a showing of past wrongs. But the moving party must satisfy the court that relief is needed. The necessary determination is that there exists some cognizable danger of recurrent violation, something more than the mere possibility which serves to keep the case alive.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-14\">The chancellor\u2019s decision is based on all the circumstances; his discretion is necessarily broad and a strong showing of abuse must be made to reverse it. To be considered are the bona fides of the expressed intent to comply, the effectiveness of the discontinuance and, in some cases, the character of the past violations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-15\">United States v. W. T. Grant Co., <em>supra, </em>345 U.S. at 633, 73 S.Ct. at 897, 97 L.Ed. at 1309-1310 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-16\">The District Court found that injunctive relief was appropriate. Appellant has not shown that the District Court abused its discretion. It does not appear that there was no danger of recurrent violation. In fact, before this Court appellant not only denies any unlawful conduct, in the face of the District Court\u2019s explicit finding, but even inexplicably denies to this Court that the District Court made such a finding. He persists in claiming that his agents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>have the right to do in the future what they did in the past. The District Court\u2019s broad discretion in granting injunctions in these instances is not easily upset, and in the face of appellant\u2019s own inability to recognize his transgressions of the Act, we decline to assume that he will not violate the Act in the future. The District Court correctly exercised its discretion to issue an injunction properly tailored so as to keep interference with appellant\u2019s business at a minimum compatible with full compliance with the law. <em>See, </em>United States v. West Peachtree Tenth Corp., <em>supra, </em>437 F.2d at 228-229.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">IV. ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Appellant\u2019s contention that equitable principles require that the government pay its attorney\u2019s fees is utterly frivolous. The government\u2019s suit was neither harassing nor unmeritorious. Equity does not require that the District Court grant attorney\u2019s fees to a party found to have violated a federal statute by blockbusting in a racially transitional area.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Y. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"Ai-\">The anti-blockbusting statute, \u00a7 3604(e), is an attempt by Congress to disprove the belief, held by many, that the Thirteenth Amendment made a promise the Nation cannot keep. Integrated housing is deemed by many to be an <em>a priori </em>requirement before our schools can be realistically integrated. <em>See generally </em>Fiss, Racial Imbalance in the Public Schools: The Constitutional Concepts, 78 Harv.L.Rev. 564, 585-588 (1965); Report of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, Racial Isolation in the Public Schools (1967). Brushing these polemics aside, it is indisputable that white flight is a blight upon the democratized society we envision and this Congressional Act is in the mainstream of that vision. We hold that \u00a7 3604(e) is a constitutional exercise of congressional authority to enact legislation to effectuate the Thirteenth Amendment. Any informational value that may be found in speech uttered in furtherance of blockbusting is clearly outweighed by the power of Congress to regulate the purely commercial activity of blockbusting. In an attempt to avoid responsibility for violating \u00a7 3604(e), appellant has proposed that this Court engraft unnecessary, extraneous requirements upon \u00a7 3613, requirements which would hinder the Attorney General\u2019s ability to enforce the Fair Housing Act, and which are inconsistent with the language and purpose of \u00a7 3613. We refuse to misinterpret \u00a7 3613 by reading in requirements not harmonious with the clear intent of the statute. Finding that the District Court properly enjoined appellant from further violation of the Act, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b219-16\">. 42 U.S.C. 3604(e) (Section 804(e), Civil Rights Act of 1968)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-18\">SEC. 804.

A real estate broker acts as a middle man in the housing market. Willing sellers list their homes with an individual real estate broker and the real estate broker, through agents, then shows listed homes to potential _ buyers, presenting the potential buyers\u2019 offers to the listing seller. The real estate broker earns a commission from the listing seller only when sales are consummated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b220-8\">.

The cases relied on by appellant, such as New York Times v. Sullivan, 1964, 376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686, and New York Times Co. v. United States, 1971, 403 U.S. 713, 91 S.Ct. 2140, 29 L.Ed.2d 822, reaffirm the constitutional principle that speech made in a political or informational context deserves the highest degree of protection from governmental restraint. Those cases do not, however, stand for the principle that the government cannot regulate speech made incidental to a purely commercial activity. The motivation for words employed in blockbusting is the profit to be made by the speaker or writer. If the words used to induce selling, with concomitant profits for the broker, had any other motivation, our judicial conscience would be twinged by our devotion to the First Amendment. <em>See </em>United States v.

For example, if these cases are typical \u2014 \u2022 and the court believes they are \u2014 the following consequences can be predicted as inevitable, and beyond dispute: First, a sense of panic and urgency immediately grips the neighborhood and rumors circulate and recirculate about the extent of the intrusion (real or fancied), the effect on property values and the quality of education. Second, there are sales and rumors of sales, some true, some false. Third, the frenzied listing and sale of houses attracts real estate agents like flies to a leaking jug of honey. Fourth, even those owners who do not sell are sorely tempted as their neighbors move away, and hence those who remain are peculiarly vulnerable. Fifth, the names of successful agents are exchanged and recommended between homeowners and frequently the agents are called by the owners themselves, if not to make a listing then at least to get an up-to-date appraisal. Constant solicitation of listings goes on by all agents either by house-to-house calls and/or by mail and/or by telephone, to the point where owners and residents are driven almost to distraction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-14\">United States v.

In addition, we find that the Attorney General had standing under the second alternative of \u00a7 3613. The District Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-9\">In view of the foregoing injunction no ruling is made on the government\u2019s further contention that a group of persons has been denied rights under the Act, first because the evidence here, in the view of the court, is not sufficient to raise an issue of general public importance as required by 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3613, and second, because the individuals affected are each assured of a remedy under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3612 in any event.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">United States v. Mitchell, <em>supra, </em>335 F.Supp. at 1008. This ruling was error. The District Court\u2019s specific finding that appellant had violated \u00a7 3604(e) shows the denial of the rights of a group of persons, both white and black, to be free from racial inducements to sell and from the results of such racial' inducements.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-13\">The District Court erred in requiring evidence that an issue of general public importance was presented. It is not for the District Court to determine when an issue of public importance justifying the intervention of the Attorney General is tised. <em>See </em>United States v. Greenwood Municipal Separate School Dist., 5 Cir. 1969, 406 F.2d 1086, 1090. Just as the Attorney General has discretion when to exercise the prosecutorial function in criminal cases, United States v. Cox, 5 Cir. 1965, 342 F.2d 167; Smith v. United States, 5 Cir. 1967, 375 F.2d 243; <em>contra, </em>K. Davis, Discretionary Justice (1969), so too the Attorney General must have a wide discretion to determine when an issue of public importance justifying his intervention under \u00a7 3613 is raised. <em>See </em>Boyd v. United States, E.D.N.Y.1972, 345 F.Supp. 790, 794. Once the Attorney General alleged that he had reasonable cause to believe that a violation of \u00a7 3604(e) denied rights to a group of persons and that this denial raised an issue of general public importance, he had standing to commence an action in District Court and to obtain injunctive relief upon a finding of a violation of the Act. <em>See </em>United States v.
