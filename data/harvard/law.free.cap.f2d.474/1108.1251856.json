The United States District Court granted the Railroad\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment as to the request for declaratory relief, certified that there was no just reason for delay in the entry of a final judgment regarding the partial summary judgment, <em>see </em>Rule 54(b), F.R.Civ.P., and issued a preliminary injunction against the Parish Officials pursuing their state court suit while the federal action continued. The only issues presently before us are (1) whether the granting of the partial summary judgment was proper, and (2) whether in-junctive relief was appropriate in light of the Anti-Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2283. For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the trial court\u2019s holding on both points.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-4\">Although the procedural history of this controversy is unusually lengthy and complex, the importance of that history to our holding justifies our setting out the operative occurrences in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-5\"><em>August U, 1970: </em>The Jefferson Parish Council was concerned about the fact ..that two train derailments had occurred within the parish in the space of thirty days. The Council met and passed a resolution to initiate legal action to correct the allegedly dangerous conditions of railroad tracks, roadbeds, and other facilities in the parish.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-6\"><em>October 16, 1970: </em>The Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970, 45 U.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 421-441, became effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-7\"><em>October 27, 1970: </em>The Parish Officials filed suit in Louisiana state court seeking injunctive relief requiring \u201cproper repair and maintenance\u201d of the New Orleans Terminal Company's tracks and roadbeds and enjoining all use of the tracks until repaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-8\"><em>November 19, 1970: </em>The New Orleans Terminal Company removed the action to federal court pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1441.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-10\"><em>January U, 1971: </em>The federal court remanded the action to the state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-11\"><em>January 15, 1971: </em>The Railroad petitioned the Secretary of Transportation to conduct an inquiry into the condition of the Railroad\u2019s trackage, roadbed, and other facilities in Jefferson Parish and to declare them to be in safe and proper condition. The Railroad alleged in its petition that the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970, particularly \u00a7 203 thereof, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 432, conferred authority on the Secretary of Transportation to conduct such an inquiry and to issue the requested report. The Parish Officials filed exceptions with the Secretary of Transportation objecting to any investigation being held at the Railroad\u2019s request and urging that the petition be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-12\"><em>January 21, 1971: </em>The Federal Railroad Administration of the Department of Transportation assumed jurisdiction of the controversy and conducted an inspection of the Railroad\u2019s facilities in Jefferson Parish.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-13\"><em>February 19, 1971: </em>The Railroad filed jurisdictional exceptions to the state court proceedings, alleging that federal jurisdiction was exclusive and that even under Louisiana law the Parish Officials were improper parties to bring such a suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-15\"><em>March 16, 1971: </em>The Fed\u00e9ral Railroad Administration issued a report, F. R.A. Pet. No. 25 [hereinafter the Report], declaring that \u201cthis matter properly comes within the scope of the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970,\u201d setting forth detailed findings regarding the conditions of the Railroad\u2019s facilities in Jefferson Parish, and concluding that the trackage was properly maintained and was in a safe and suitable condition for daily operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-16\"><em>April 2, 1971: </em>The Parish Officials filed the instant suit in federal court. The petition was captioned \u201cPetition for Review of an Order of an Administrative Agency of the United States,\" but it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>named as defendants both the Federal Railroad Administration and the Railroad. The suit basically sought a determination that the Federal Railroad Administration had no jurisdiction to act as it did, that the Administration denied the Parish Officials due process of law by refusing to grant them an adversary hearing before issuing the Report, and that the Report was null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-4\"><em>May 19, 1971: </em>The Railroad answered the federal petition and counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment that (1) the Parish Officials had no jurisdiction to prescribe or enforce rules and regulations relating to the safety of operations of a railroad operating in interstate commerce, and (2) the Report was valid and binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-5\"><em>October 16, 1971: </em>Pursuant to the statutory mandate of \u00a7 202(e) of the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 431(e), the Federal Railroad Administration adopted comprehensive federal \u201cTrack Safety Standards,\u201d 36 Fed.Reg. 20336-343, 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 213.1-213.241.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-7\"><em>November 5, 1971: </em>The Railroad filed a motion in the federal action for partial summary judgment. In essence, the Railroad asked for a judgment that the area of establishing and enforcing railroad track safety standards was totally preempted by federal law and that the Parish Officials were totally without jurisdiction, power, or authority to establish or enforce railroad safety standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-8\"><em>December 15, 1971: </em>The federal court granted the Railroad\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. Shortly thereafter, the state court set a hearing date as to the Parish Officials\u2019 state suit for injunctive relief against the Railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-9\"><em>January 21, 1972: </em>The Railroad returned to federal court and asked for a preliminary injunction enjoining the Parish Officials from proceeding with their state court suit. After certifying the partial summary judgment under Rule 54(b), F.R.Civ.P., the United States District Court entered an order that \u201c[T]he granting of a preliminary injunction against the prosecution of [the state court] suit ... is necessary to protect the jurisdiction of this Court and the Department of Transportation, and to protect and effectuate the [partial] judgment in favor of New Orleans Terminal Company. . . . \u201d The court then issued the injunction restraining the Parish Officials from taking any further steps against the Railroad other than by continuing its suit for judicial review of the Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-14\">We note at the outset of our analysis that there are two distinctive features about this case. First, this is an appeal from only a partial summary judgment, which was made final, and therefore appealable, by a Rule 54(b) certification. The entire federal court case has not yet been finally decided below \u2014 the action for review of the Report of the Federal Railroad Administration is continuing to be litigated. Furthermore, the orders entered to date by the district court clearly indicate that the court intends to re-examine the injunction against the state court proceedings at the time a final judgment is entered regarding the review of that Report. Secondly, appellants\u2019 posture on this appeal is perhaps unique. Appellants sought to have the state court settle the controversy \u2014 they filed the original suit in state court, and when the Railroad removed it to federal court, appellants were successful in obtaining a remand back to the state court. Had the matter ended there, the federal court would not have become involved in the dispute, for a remand order is not reviewable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But appellants were not content to leave the entire case in state court. Apparently fearing that the Railroad could successfully use the Federal Railroad Administration\u2019s Report as a \u201cdefense\u201d to the state suit, appellants themselves invoked the jurisdiction of the federal court by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>bringing suit to attack the Report. By naming the Railroad as a party defendant in that action, appellants called upon the federal court to resolve the differences between' themselves and the Railroad. Their complaint is with the manner in which the federal court resolved the dispute they themselves asked it to resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-5\">I. THE PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-6\">The basic thesis underlying the district court\u2019s granting of the partial summary judgment is that a federal regulatory scheme has pre-empted the field of railroad safety to the exclusion of whatever interest in regulating railroad safety these individuals might otherwise have had outside the Act. We are in complete agreement with that conclusion, and we are fortified in reaching that result by the fact that we have a clear declaration of Congressional intent on that point to guide us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1214-7\">\u201cThe Congress declares that laws, rules, regulations, orders, and standards relating to railroad safety shall be nationally uniform to the extent practicable. A State may adopt or continue in force any law, rule, regulation, order, or standard relating to railroad safety until such time as the Secretary has adopted a rule, regulation, order, or standard covering the subject matter of such State requirement. A State may adopt or continue in force an additional or more stringent law, rule, regulation, order, or standard relating to railroad safety when necessary to eliminate or reduce an essentially local safety hazard, and when not incompatible with any Federal law, rule, regulation, order, or standard, and when not creating an undue burden on interstate commerce.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1214-8\">45 U.S.C. \u00a7 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-9\">The meaning of the Congressional declaration is clear. The ultimate goal of the Act is to establish nationally uniform control of railroad safety, but the statute is not iron-clad. The Act specifically authorizes a narrow spectrum of deviation from national uniformity, and the issue here is whether appellants\u2019 state court suit falls within one of the permissible exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-11\">The first statutory \u201cexception,\u201d which appears in the second sentence of \u00a7 434, is clearly inapplicable. Regulations covering the precise subject matter of the state court suit have been enacted, 36 Fed.Reg. 20336-343, 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 213.1-213.241, and those regulations are comprehensive in scope and detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-12\">Nor can the second \u201cexception,\u201d which appears in the final sentence of \u00a7 434, be said to envision this particular action. Three tests must be met if a state regulation is to be justified under the second \u201cexception\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1214-13\">(1) the state regulation or standard relating to railroad safety is necessary to eliminate or reduce an essentially local safety hazard, <em>see </em>Washington v. Chicago, M., St. P. &amp; P. RR., 1971, 79 Wash.2d 288, 484 P.2d 1146, appeal dismissed, 404 U.S. 804, 92 S.Ct. 108, 30 L. Ed.2d 36 (fire hazards along railroad rights-of-way);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1214-14\">(2) the local measure is not incompatible with any federal measure; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1214-15\">(3) the local measure does not unduly burden interstate commerce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1214-16\">We need not and do not decide whether those tests are here met, because in any event meeting those three conditions justifies only <em>State </em>action. This case is supported by United Gas Pipeline Co. v. Terrebonne Parish Police Jury, 1970, 319 F.Supp. 1138, aff\u2019d, 5 Cir. 1971, 445 F.2d 301. That case concerned the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1671-1684, which provided a similarly limited \u201cexception\u201d for <em>\u201cAny state agency.\u201d Id. </em>\u00a7 1672(b). The Railroad Safety Act, however, speaks of an exception for \u201cStates,\u201d and we do not .have before us an attempt by the State of Louisiana to regulate railroad safety; rather, we have before us individual officials of a parish government. Their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>remedy against unsafe railroad practices must fit within the borders of the federal Act and the enumerated qualifications and exceptions thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-5\">We do not purport to suggest at this time that the State of Louisiana, acting through its Attorney General, could not bring this same common-law suit to enjoin unsafe railroad practices. Nor do we intimate here that the Louisiana legislature, or some duly delegated agency acting for the State, could not establish standards under \u00a7 434\u2019s second exception. Lastly, we do not reach the issue of the extent to which the Act pre-empts State standards such as the common-law tests that appellants apparently seek to vindicate. <em>See </em>Napier v. Atlantic Coast Line RR., 1926, 272 U.S. 605, 47 S.Ct. 207, 71 L.Ed. 432. None of those issues are now before us, and we hold only that these individual officials are without authority under the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 to require the Railroad to meet any safety standard beyond those provided for in the national Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-6\">II. THE TEMPORARY INJUNCTION AGAINST STATE COURT PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-7\">Having decided that the district court correctly entered a judgment that appellants are without power to require the Railroad to meet any non-federal safety standards, we must next determine whether it was appropriate for the United States District Court to issue an injunction against further state court proceedings. The Railroad urges that the preliminary injunction was proper under either of two exceptions to the Anti-Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2283, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1215-8\">\u201cA court of the United States may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a State court except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1215-9\">First, the Railroad says that this injunction is needed in aid of the federal court\u2019s jurisdiction <em>and </em>to protect or effectuate its judgment. Secondly, the Railroad argues that the injunction is \u201cexpressly authorized by Act of Congress\u201d in passing the federal pre-emp-tive legislation, citing Mitchum v. Foster, 1972, 407 U.S. 225, 92 S.Ct. 2151, 32 L.Ed.2d 705. Finding the first alternative to be applicable, we pretermit consideration of the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-10\">In Tampa Phosphate RR v. Seaboard Coast Line RR., 5 Cir. 1969, 418 F.2d 387, and Woods Exploration &amp; Production Co. v. Aluminum Co. of America, 5 Cir. 1971, 438 F.2d 1286, this Court wrote at great length on the state of the law regarding federal court injunctions against state court proceedings. In the latter case we thought that we had \u201cat last reached the end of our long and protracted journey through the Appling Field and points beyond,\u201d 438 F.2d at 1316, but the importance of the issue justifies a few additional words.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-11\">The Anti-Injunction Act expressly excepts stays necessary in aid of the court\u2019s jurisdiction or needed to protect or effectuate its judgments. Here, both precepts appear, for the United States District Court still has before it part of the controversy between these parties \u2014 the judicial review of the Report \u2014 and the court has already finalized a judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) as to part of the controversy. In effect, the court below has by final judgment held that the Railroad cannot properly be subjected to the efforts of these individual local officials to impose some safety standard that lies outside of the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970. That part of the action is concluded and certainly rises to the level of <em>res judicata </em>effect that was our central concern in Woods Exploration &amp; Production Co. v. Aluminum Co. of America, <em>supra. </em>We find that the <em>Woods Exploration </em>and <em>Tampa Phosphate RR. </em>cases control and we hold that this injunction was proper. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>Those two cases are so directly in point that it would serve little purpose to quote from them at length; instead, we merely reiterate that a federal court may enjoin a state proceeding that is precluded under the doctrine of <em>res judi-cata. </em>While \u00a7 2283 was designed to ensure the state courts\u2019 adjudicative potency, its exceptions assure that the federal courts and their judgments will not be eunuchized and that their muscularity will not be atrophied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-4\">Although the character of the person <em>filing </em>the federal action does not control the issue, we cannot ignore the fact that here it was the Parish Officials themselves who invoked the jurisdiction of the federal court. This is not a ease of parties racing to the courthouse or racing to judgment, nor is this a case of parties suing each other in separate state and federal courts and then encouraging jealous cross-fire between the courts. None of those factors being present, many of the thorny considerations usually involved in these injunction cases are not even raised. Appellants themselves issued the invitations to dance in the federal ballroom, they chose their dancing partners, and at their own request they were assigned a federal judge as their choreographer. Now that the dance is over, appellants find themselves unhappy with the judging of the contest. They urge us to reverse and deciare that \u201cGood Night Ladies\u201d should have been played without the partial summary judgment having been granted and without the preliminary injunction having been issued. This we have declined to do, and in so doing we note that this is not The Last Tango for the Parish. Appellants still have an encore to perform and their day in court is not yet over. Their attack on the Report issued by the Federal Railroad Administration has yet to be decided. The Railroad Safety Act makes clear, however, that seeking judicial review of the Report\u2019s determination that the Railroad meets all applicable standards is the only remedy even arguably available to these particular individuals. See 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 432. The <em>State </em>may participate in regulating railroad safety under the Act, <em>see </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 435, 436, 439(a), but this case does not involve the State itself. Here we have individuals, representing a parish, waltzing into two courts simultaneously.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-6\">The trial court\u2019s holding that the Act is pre-emptive is correct. No attempt to regulate the safety of interstate railroads may be made unless the Act itself authorizes or allows the regulation. We hold that the court below properly rendered judgment that the Railroad could not be forced to participate in this state court cotillion, which was not brought by the State and which sought to impose safety measures that were not contemplated by the Act, and that the federal court, under the facts of this case, was the sole director of the terpsichorean exhibition and had the right to effectuate and protect its directional decisions. The adjudication having gravitated to the federal forum, appellants\u2019 attempt to repeal that law is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1211-13\">. The Federal Railroad Administration of the Department of Transportation was also named as a defendant in the principal federal suit but is only a nominal party on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1213-10\">. <em>See </em>Wright, Federal Courts \u00a7 41.
