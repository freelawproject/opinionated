In Re Sun Oil Co., 342 F.Supp. 976 (S.D.N.Y.1972). This finding, although disputed by the appellants, was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-27\"> The appellants further argue that a settlement between the owners of the two vessels for a salvage award of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>$4,000 to the owner of the <em>Pilot </em>is dis-positive on the liability question. There is no merit in this contention. Settlements are not to be used to establish liability against a party in other suits arising out of the same occurrence, Seaboard Shipping Corp. v. Jocharanne Tugboat Corp., 461 F.2d 500, 505 (2 Cir. 1972); Hawthorne v. Eckerson Co., 77 F.2d 844, 847 (2 Cir. 1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">Because the finding and conclusion of the district court that there was no voluntary aid were sufficient to support the judgment, it is unnecessary to consider the question of whether or not the Stand By Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 367 also would preclude recovery on the part of the crew.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
