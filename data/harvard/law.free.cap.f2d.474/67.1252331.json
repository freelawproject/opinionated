We agree with Gonzales that the class was inadequately represented when the class representative in the prior suit failed to appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-17\">The prior suit began in May 1969. Antonio Gaytan filed suit as a class action against Clifton Cassidy, Chairman of the Texas Department of Public Safety, in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, seeking a declaratory judgment that the Texas Safety Responsibility Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was unconstitutional and an injunction against its enforcement. Gaytan, an uninsured motorist, had been involved in an automobile accident in Texas, and pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5(a), 5(b) and 7 of the Act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> his driver\u2019s license and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>registration receipt on his vehicle were suspended without a hearing on liability or fault because he did not post security - \u2014 as required by the Act \u2014 for the damages claimed by the adverse party. A three-judge court was convened, 28 U.S.C., \u00a7\u00a7 2281 and 2284, and denied Gaytan and his class any relief by its holding that the Act was constitutional.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On direct appeal to the Supreme Court, 28 U. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>S.C. \u00a7 1253, the district court\u2019s judgment was vacated, and the case was remanded for reconsideration in light of Bell v. Burson, 402 U.S. 535, 96 S.Ct. 1586, 29 L.Ed.2d 90 (1971), which was decided after the three-judge court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">In <em>Bell </em>the Supreme Court held the Georgia Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act unconstitutional as violative of procedural due process.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Georgia Act, like the Texas statute under attack in <em>Gaytan, </em>provided that the motor vehicle registration and driver\u2019s license of an uninsured motorist involved in an accident would be suspended unless the motorist posted security for the amount of damages claimed by an aggrieved party, but did not provide for a hearing on liability or fault prior to the suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">On remand the three-judge court accordingly held the Texas Act unconstitutional. But, regarding the scope of relief to which Gaytan and his class were entitled, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-17\">\u201cThis order shall apply retroactively to the Plaintiff ANTONIO R. GAY-TAN, and prospectively from June 30, 1971, to all members of the class represented by said Plaintiff.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AN\">Having obtained full relief for himself, Gaytan did not appeal the court\u2019s denial of retroactive relief to the other members of his class.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-18\">The present action began in the Northern District of Texas on June 24, 1971, after the Supreme Court vacated the first <em>Gaytan </em>decision, but before the case was heard on remand. Pedro Gonzales filed a class action against Cassidy, the defendant in <em>Gaytan, </em>seeking the same relief as had been sought by Gay-tan in his suit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On July 1, 1971, the <em>Gonzales </em>court entered a temporary restraining order in favor of Gonzales and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>the other named plaintiffs in his action, prohibiting the defendant from suspending their licenses and vehicle registration receipts. This was before the amended order in <em>Gaytan </em>was rendered but only one day after the first order denying retroactive relief to all of the class except Gaytan was entered. On August 19, 1971, the <em>Gaytan </em>court entered its amended and final order. Then on August 25, 1971, the <em>Gonzales </em>court ordered a show cause hearing as to why its temporary restraining order of July 1 should not be made permanent. This hearing was held on September 28 and the court reasoned that, because Gayton v. Cassidy was a class action and because Gonzales and the class he sought to represent were members of the <em>Gay-tan </em>class, the principles of res judicata foreclosed their claims.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Gonzales appeals claiming that Gaytan\u2019s failure to appeal the final three-judge order in Gaytan v. Cassidy rendered his representation of the class inadequate, therefore precluding res judicata from attaching to that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">To answer the question whether the class representative adequately represented the class so that the judgment in the class suit will bind the absent members of the class requires a two-pronged inquiry: (1) Did the trial court in the first suit correctly determine, initially, that the representative would adequately represent the class ? and (2) Does it appear, after the termination of the suit, that the class representative adequately protected the interest of the class? The first question involves us in a collateral review of the <em>Gaytan </em>trial court\u2019s determination to permit the suit to proceed as a class action with Gaytan as the representative, while the second involves a review of the class representative\u2019s conduct of the entire suit \u2014 an inquiry which is not required to be made by the trial court but which is appropriate in a collateral attack on the judgment such as we have here. Our discussion will treat each question separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">The starting point in a trial court\u2019s determination to allow a suit to proceed as a class action is Rule 23(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides the prerequisites to a class action as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-11\">One or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all only if (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">The primary contention in this appeal is that Gaytan did not meet the requirements of 23(a) (4).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Remembering that at this point we are only concerned with the court\u2019s initial determination that Gaytan would be an adequate representative, we look to the criteria on which the decision should be based. There are two: (1) the representative must have common interests with the unnamed members of the class; and (2) it must appear that the representative will vigorously prosecute the interests of the class through qualified counsel.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We have little difficulty in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>concluding that Antonio Gaytan met both of these requirements when he filed his suit in May of 1969. He was an uninsured motorist as were the members of his class; he had an automobile accident in Texas and had failed to post the necessary security under the Act as had the members of his class; his license and registration receipt were suspended without a hearing on liability or fault just as occurred to the members of his class. Likewise, he had the same basic interests in not having his license suspended or in having the suspension revoked as did the other members of his class. It is clear then that Gaytan had common interests which coincided with those of the class he sought to represent. Furthermore, there are no allegations that Gaytan\u2019s attorney was not fully qualified to handle the case, or that, initially at least, he would not vigorously prosecute the action. The fact that Gaytan\u2019s counsel appealed to the Supreme Court after the three-judge court\u2019s adverse decision and subsequently won a reversal of that decision points significantly to counsel\u2019s qualification to handle the litigation. Therefore we cannot refuse to give res judicata effect to the judgment in Gaytan v. Cassidy on the basis that the trial court in that case erroneously determined that Gaytan would be an adequate representative of the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The second question is whether Gay-tan\u2019s conduct of the entire suit was such that due process would not be violated by giving res judicata effect to the judgment in that suit.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This is the crucial issue when the judgment in a class action is under collateral attack. Our first step, however, is to examine subdivisions (b) and (c) of Rule 23 in order to establish the proper context in which to make this inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Subdivision (b) of Rule 23 provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-8\">An action may be maintained as a class action if the prerequisites of subdivision (a) are satisfied, and in addition:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-9\">(1) the prosecution of separate actions by or against individual members of the class would create a risk of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-10\">(A) inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the class, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-11\">(B) adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would as a practical matter be disposi-tive of the interests of the other members not parties to the adjudications or substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their interests; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-12\">(2) the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final injunc-tive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-13\">(3) the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>vidual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy. The matters pertinent to the findings include: (A) the interest of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already commenced by or against members of the class; (C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; (D) the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Gaytan v. Cassidy obviously fits within (b)(2) \u2014 thus, to be specific, we are dealing with the res judicata effect of the judgment in a (b)(2) type of class action.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Subdivision (c) (3) provides: \u201cThe judgment in an action maintained as a class action under subdivision (b)(2), whether or not favorable to the class, shall include and describe those whom the court finds to be members of the class . .\u201d Although the <em>Gaytan </em>court\u2019s opinion, neither originally nor on remand, describes the class it considered Gaytan to be representing, we agree with the lower court here that Gonzales and the class he seeks to represent were members of the <em>Gay-tan </em>class and would at first blush appear bound by the <em>Gaytan </em>decision. But our inquiry into the binding effect of <em>Gay-tan </em>does not end with Rule 23 for, \u201calthough thus declaring that the judgment in a class action includes the class, as defined, subdivision (c)(3) does not disturb the recognized principle that the court conducting the action cannot predetermine the res judicata effect of the judgment; this can be tested only in subsequent action. <em>See </em>Restatement, Judgments \u00a7 86, comment (h), \u00a7 116 (1942).\u201d Advisory Committee\u2019s Notes to Rule 23 F.R.C.P., 28 U.S.C.A. at 301; Moore 23.60 at 1203. As a general rule though, a judgment in a class action will bind the absent members of the class.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The exception to this general rule is grounded in due process. Due process of law would be violated for the judgment in a class suit to be res judicata to the absent members of a class unless the court applying res judicata can conclude that the class was adequately represented in the first suit. Hansberry v. Lee, 311 U.S. 32, 61 S.Ct. 115, 85 L.Ed. 22 (1942). <em>See </em>Sam Fox Publishing Co. v. United States, 366 U.S. 683, 691, 81 S.Ct. 1309, 6 L.Ed.2d 604 (1961); Dierks v. Thompson, 414 F.2d 453 (1st Cir., 1969); Eisen v. Carlisle and Jacquelin, 391 F.2d 555 (2nd Cir., 1968); Mersay v. First Rep. Corp. of America, 43 F.R.D. 465 (S.D.N.Y., 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">The 1966 amendments to Rule 23 eliminated the distinctions between true, hybrid and spurious class actions and the differing res judicata effect of each type of action, thus broadening the effect of res judicata under the amended rule.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It follows then that a court \u2014 wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>er it be the trial court making its initial 23(a)(4) determination, or a subsequent court considering a collateral attack on the judgment in a class action \u2014 must stringently apply the requirement of adequate representation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Judge Frankel has noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-5\">\u201cThere are, of course, some obvious limitations in any case upon the extent to which absent parties will be concluded. For one thing, as the Advisory Committee observed, such parties have a clear right in some later litigation to attack the judgment which purports to bind them. In such a later case, at least the basic considerations going to the fairness of holding them bound will be open for reexamination. Factors which were not brought to the attention of the first court \u2014 including, most centrally, the adequacy of representation in the first suit; [citing Hansberry v. Lee, supra] \u2014 may lead to a changed perspective.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">M. Frankel, Some Preliminary Observations Concerning Civil Rule 23, 43 F.R.D. 39 (1967). And, as Justice Harlan observed: \u201cThe judgment in a class action will bind only those members .of the class whose interests have been adequately represented by existing parties to the litigation.\u201d Sam Fox Publishing Co. v. United States, <em>supra, </em>366 U.S. at 691, 81 S.Ct. at 1314. Our inquiry then into the adequacy of class representation for purposes of res judicata is made with the understanding that generally the class will be bound unless the party attacking the judgment can show that the class was inadequately represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">What standards should determine whether Gaytan adequately represented the class in Gaytan v. Cassidy? In Mersay v. First Republic Corp. of America, <em>supra, </em>the trial court was making the 23(a)(4) determination of whether the named plaintiff would adequately represent the class when it said, \u201cthe primary criterion is the forthrightness and vigor with which the representative party can be expected to assert and defend the interests of the members of the class, so as to insure them due process.\u201d Id. 43 F.R.D. at 470. This precept is equally applicable to the determination which must be made by a court when a class action judgment is under collateral attack. We hold that the primary criterion for determining whether the class representative has adequately represented his class for purposes of res judicata is whether the representative, through qualified counsel, vigorously and tenaciously protected the interests of the class. A court must view the representative\u2019s conduct of the entire litigation with this criterion as its guidepost.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-12\">We have previously recognized that Gaytan\u2019s 'representation was more than adequate up to the time the three-judge court entered its final order on remand. The narrow question, therefore, is whether Gaytan\u2019s failure to appeal this order, which denied retroactive relief to all members of the class except Gaytan, constitutes inadequate representation of the class so that they are not bound by the judgment. We are compelled to hold that Gaytan\u2019s failure to prosecute an appeal on behalf of the other members of his class rendered his representation of them inadequate. For this reason, the judgment in Gaytan v. Cassidy cannot be res judicata to the class.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Gaytan, through his attorney, vigorously represented the class until he obtained individual Relief. The problem is that he was representing approximately 150,000 persons, who, although having had their licenses and registration receipts suspended without due process, were denied any relief by the three-judge court\u2019s prospective only application of its decision. So long as an appeal from this decision could not be characterized as patently meritless or frivolous, Gaytan should have prosecuted an appeal. Otherwise, it cannot be said that he vigorously and tenaciously protected the interests of the class he was purporting to represent, or that all members of the class had been afforded due process of law by having a full day in court. It is axiomatic that an appeal is a significant element in the judicial process. Gaytan\u2019s failure to prosecute an appeal deprived the members of his class, whose rights were not vindicated by the three-judge court\u2019s decision, of full participation in this process.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Appellees do not meet the argument that Gaytan\u2019s failure to appeal rendered him an inadequate representative of the class. Instead, they advance an estoppel-type argument to support the proposition that Gonzales cannot raise the inadequate representation issue. Their position is that since counsel for Gonzales was aware that on remand the <em>Gaytan </em>court denied retroactive relief by his June 30, 1971 order, and finally denied such relief in its amended order of August 19, Gonzales is estopped to attack the judgment collaterally because he should have intervened in <em>Gaytan </em>for the purposes of appeal. We reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">First, as the' 1966 amendments to Rule 23 clearly illustrate, the purpose of a class action is to allow as few as one member of a class to prosecute an action for the benefit of the class if the requirements of 23(a) and (b) are met. This is one reason why the requirement of 23(a)(4) is stringently applied.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The purpose of Rule 23 would be subverted by requiring a class member who learns of a pending suit involving a class of which he is a part to monitor that litigation to make certain that his interests are being protected; this is not his responsibility \u2014 it is the responsibility of the class representative to protect the interests of all class members.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\"> Secondly, it would simply be inequitable to foreclose Gonzales from attacking the <em>Gaytan </em>judgment on the facts of our case. The <em>Gaytan </em>court rendered its initial order on remand denying retroactive application of its decision that the Texas Act was unconstitutional on June 30, 1971. The <em>Gonzales </em>court, nevertheless, entered a temporary restraining order on July 1, 1971, prohibiting the defendants in <em>Gonzales </em>(which are the same as those in <em>Gaytan) </em>from suspending plaintiffs-appellants\u2019 licenses or registration receipts. Thereafter, a motion was filed in <em>Gaytan </em>for clarification of the court\u2019s order. This \u2022motion was granted and on August 19, 1971, the <em>Gaytan </em>court issued an amended order giving relief only to the named plaintiff Gaytan and to those persons whose effective date of suspension occurred after June 30, 1971. Thus, there was not a final appealable judgment in <em>Gaytan </em>until August 19. Meanwhile, the <em>Gonzales </em>court\u2019s temporary restraining order remained in effect throughout this period of time. On August 28, 1971, the <em>Gonzales </em>court entered an order to show cause why its temporary restraining order should not be made permanent and set a hearing for September 28, 1971. By September 28th it was already too late for Gonzales to intervene for the purpose of prosecuting an appeal in <em>Gaytan. </em>Nevertheless, the <em>Gonzales </em>court held that <em>Gaytan </em>was res judicata to plaintiffs-appellants\u2019 claims. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>only remedy then available to Gonzales was to appeal the court\u2019s decision to apply res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">While some attorneys might have possessed the omniscience to have begun seeking intervention in <em>Gaytan </em>after that court\u2019s June 30th decision, we cannot fault counsel here for not doing so when one day later they obtained the relief which they were seeking in another court.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Also, inasmuch as the <em>Gaytan </em>decision on remand was subsequently amended during the time the temporary restraining order was in effect, we cannot say that counsel should have sought intervention during this time. Nor is counsel to be faulted for not seeking-intervention after August 19, 1971. The <em>Gonzales </em>court shortly thereafter ordered a hearing as to why the temporary restraining order should not be made permanent. To require counsel to have sought intervention in <em>Gaytan </em>while awaiting the hearing in <em>Gonzales </em>would require too much. In these circumstances the application of res judicata cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">On remand there will be at least two issues. The first will be whether this action may be maintained as a class action. The district court denied Gonzales\u2019s motion to allow this suit to proceed as a class action. In light of our decision and for reasons of judicial economy, we think the district court should reexamine this decision, and if it concludes that Gonzales meets the prerequisites of 23(a) and (b), it would seem appropriate to allow a class action. The second issue will be the retroactivity question.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We express no views on the resolution of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b171-9\">.

Suspension of issued licenses thus involves state action that adjudicates important interests of the licensees. In such cases the licenses are not to be taken away without that procedural due process required by the Fourteenth Amendment. [Citations omitted].

Gaytan v. Cassidy, No. SA69CA153 (W.D.Tex., June 30, 1971, amended August 19, 1971). The amended order clarified the original order by explaining that it granted relief only to those persons whose effective date of suspension occurred after June 30, 1971, and to Gaytan whose suspensions occurred prior to June 30.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b173-20\">. On appeal appellants assert that because \u201csome of the motorists in this cause . were only the registered owners of automobiles which were driven by someone else at the time of the respective accidents,\u201d their claims are not typical to those of Gaytan in that he was the driver of his vehicle. This contention approaches the frivolous for, although Rule 23(a)(3) requires that \u201cthe claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class,\u201d it is obvious that this is a distinction without a difference and appellants offer no reason why this distinction would prevent Gaytan from representing their interests. Gaytan was typical of the class within the meaning of Rule 23(a) (3) because he did not have interests which conflicted with those of the class, and because his claims for relief were based on the same legal or remedial theory as the appellants in the case at bar. <em>See </em>Katz v. Carte Blanche Corp., 52 F.R.D. 510 (W.D.Pa., 1971); Mersay v. First Rep. Corp. of America, 43 F.R.D. 465 (S.D.N.Y., 1968); 7 C. Wright and A.

Since Gonzales and the other named plaintiffs fell within the group to whom only prospective relief had been granted by the <em>Gaytan </em>court, in that their licenses had been suspended prior to June 30, 1971, they were denied relief by the application of res judicata. Plaintiff Louanner H. Edwards was granted relief, for the reason that his license had not been suspended prior to June 30.

One distinction between members of a class in a (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3), action is that absent (b),(l) and (b) (2) members do not have the privilege of opting out of the suit that is accorded to class members in a (b) (3) suit. <em>See </em>Research Corp. v.

The problems encountered by counsel here are illustrative of the problems encountered by lawyers, trial courts and appellate courts when two or more (b) (1) or (b),(2) class actions are proceeding simultaneously in the federal courts.
