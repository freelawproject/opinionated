Appellant, as a Virgin Islands employer, is subject to the workmen\u2019s compensation laws found in 24 V. I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 251-285. Section 272(b) sets forth the requirements for coverage of an employee, and section 273(c) provides for payment of the annual premium in two separate installments on or before March 31 and June 30 of the year in which it is due. Thus, an employer may delay full payment for several months after filing and still remain insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-11\">On February 6, 1969, appellant filed a report on wages paid for the previous year and estimated wages for 1969. No part of the 1969 premium was paid during 1969, however, despite the installment dates mentioned above. On February 6, 1970, an employee named Leon Denena was electrocuted in the course of his work. After awarding $10,000.00 to Denena\u2019s heirs, the Commissioner of Labor, by an authorized deputy, assessed the award and a thirty percent penalty against appellant upon finding that the company was uninsured at the time of the accident. This action occurred on July 1, 1970. The delinquent premium had finally been paid on February 27, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-13\">Appellant\u2019s principal argument on this appeal is that the district court erred in affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision because the doctrine of estoppel should have been applied against the government under the facts of this case. The district court agreed that prior to 1969 the custom had been for the Commissioner of Finance to assess workmen\u2019s compensation premiums after receiving a company\u2019s wage statement. This procedure was apparently changed in 1969, but the 1970 forms which were completed by appellant still recited the old procedure. Appellant maintains that its failure to pay was excusable since it expected to receive a bill, and it contends that the government should therefore be estopped from finding appellant uninsured and from ordering reimbursement of the award paid to Denena\u2019s heirs and imposing the thirty percent penalty. The district court rejected this argument on the ground that appellant was negligent in failing to request a bill some time before the next year\u2019s premium became due.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-14\">After carefully considering the briefs, oral argument and the district court opinion, we conclude that no error was committed. The doctrine of estoppel is not often permitted against a government,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and it cannot be successfully asserted here where the 1969 premium was not paid until after the accident in question at which time this premium was many months overdue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-15\">Appellant\u2019s second contention is a request that if this court affirms the district court, we should remand the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>case with instructions to order reimbursement to appellant of the amount of his 1969 premium. Appellant\u2019s theory is that the government should not be reimbursed for the award and also be allowed to keep the premium. The government concurred in this request at oral argument, and we agree that it is both fair and correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court as modified, and we remand this case to the district court so that it can determine through appropriate proceedings the exact sum of money which should be credited to appellant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1352-16\">. <em>See, e. g., </em>In re Hooper\u2019s Estate, 359 F.2d 569, 577-578 (3d Cir. 1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
