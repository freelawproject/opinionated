The board opinion, including footnotes, reads, in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1433-9\">An application [(Serial No. 301,-798)] has been filed [(June 24, 1968)] to register \u201cFIRON\u201d for medicinal tablets containing ferrous fumarate, use since January 30, 1959 being asserted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1433-10\">Registration has been opposed by The J. B. Williams Company, Inc., registrant of \u201cFUMIRON\u201d for [an] ethically sold medicinal for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1433-11\">Neither party has taken testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Amz\">While the goods of the parties are obviously closely related medical products for treating iron deficiencies, it is our considered opinion that \u201cFI-RON\u201d does not so closely resemble \u201cFUMIRON\u201d in sound, appearance or significance as to lead to a likelihood of confusion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1433-14\">Upon careful consideration of the record before us and the briefs and arguments of counsel, we find ourselves in agreement with the conclusions expressed by the board. The decision below is, accordingly, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AJ6W\">.
