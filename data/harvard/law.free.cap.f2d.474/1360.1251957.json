Longs-treth. Jurisdiction is founded upon diversity of citizenship, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 (1970). The law of Pennsylvania applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-23\">A judgment in favor of Bolender in the amount of $22,000 was entered on May 9, 1956 in wrongful death and survival actions against William Longs-treth, the son of Laura Longstreth who had been given permission by the latter to operate her automobile, and Bishop, who was operating the automobile at the request of William Longstreth when said car struck and killed Coll. Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company had defended William Longstreth in the lawsuit under a reservation of rights agreement and had refused to defend Bishop. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1362\">*1362</page-number>judgment remaining unsatisfied,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Bolen-der filed the present suit against the insurer on December 27, 1967, claiming that either or both William Longstreth and Bishop were covered under the insurance policy issued to Laura Longs-treth and that the insurer was estopped from asserting the policy limitation of $10,000 due to its lack of good faith in defending the prior suit and negotiating a settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-4\">Bolender is suing to enforce the following promise of the insurer contained in the insurance contract: \u201cCoverage F \u2014Bodily Injury Liability: To pay on behalf of the Insured all sums which the Insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury, sickness or disease, including death at any time resulting therefrom, sustained by any person, caused by accident and arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the automobile.\u201d Bolen-der\u2019s right to sue the insurer directly as a third party beneficiary of such promise to pay stems from the following provision: \u201cNo action shall lie against the Company, unless, as a condition precedent thereto, the Insured shall have fully complied with all the terms of this policy, nor until the amount of the Insured\u2019s obligation to pay shall have been finally determined either by judgment against the Insured after actual trial or by written agreement of the Insured, the claimant and the Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-6\">\u201cAny person or organization or the legal representative thereof who has secured such judgment or written agreement shall thereafter be entitled to recover under this policy to the extent of the insurance afforded by this policy <em>it</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1464-11\">The appellees do not contest Bolender\u2019s right under the above policy provision to bring an action against the insurer as a third party beneficiary of the insurance contract, and Pennsylvania law is clear that such a suit may be maintained.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But in light of the fact that this action was instituted 11% years after the judgment against the insured was rendered, the court below granted appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss on the ground that this action was barred after six years by the Pennsylvania statute of limitations applicable to contract actions, 12 P.S. \u00a7 31. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-12\">It is of course fundamental that a statute of limitations does not begin to run until a cause of action has accrued. But determining the time when a cause of action has accrued is often the subject of dispute, and this case is no exception. Pennsylvania law is replete with simplistic statements concerning the times causes of action accrue. For example, it is said that \u201cthe time specified in a statute of limitations does not begin to run until there is an existing right to sue forthwith.\u201d New York and Pennsylvania Co. v. New York Central R. R. Co., 300 Pa. 242, 245-246, 150 A. 480, 481 (1930). In Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington R. R. v. Quaker City Flour Mills Co., 282 Pa. 362, 367, 127 A. 845, 847 (1925), the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said, \u201cA cause of action accrues at the moment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>the party has a legal right to sue.\u201d And in Bell v. Brady, 346 Pa. 666, 669, 31 A.2d 547, 549 (1943), the Court stated that \u201ca cause of action accrues . . . when one has the right to institute a suit.\u201d If the contract is conditional, the statute runs from the time the condition is performed or exists. Tonkin v. Baum, 114 Pa. 414, 7 A. 185 (1886).</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-5\">Application of the above rules requires affirmance of the dismissal of this action. Bolender\u2019s right to sue to enforce the insurer\u2019s promise to pay was complete at the time the prior judgment was rendered. As is stated in the policy, \u201c[a]ny person or organization or the legal representative thereof who has secured such judgment . . . shall <em>thereafter </em>be entitled to recover under this policy to the extent of the insurance afforded by this policy.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Securing judgment was a condition precedent to Bolender\u2019s right to sue the insurer directly, and upon satisfying this term, she clearly had \u201can existing right to sue forthwith,\u201d which under Pennsylvania law, starts the running of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-7\">In an effort to escape the obvious, Bolender contends that since the insurance policy contains no time limitation on an injured party\u2019s right to claim payment, that right exists as <em>long </em>as the judgment against the insured remains valid and enforceable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The lack of such an express limitation in the policy is irrelevant, however, for the law, 12 P.S. \u00a7 31, imposes one. Bolender\u2019s position that a refusal of payment by the insurer is necessary to start the statute running is untenable. Refusal by the insurer is not a prerequisite to the right to institute suit to enforce the insurer\u2019s promise to pay, a right which Bolender ignored for 11V2 years, and the promise to pay was not part of a continuing contract.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1465-13\">We would end this opinion here were it not for our Brother Kalodner\u2019s dissent. We believe that the fundamental misconception of the dissent is its belief that the policy grants the right to sue on a judgment. The right to sue is on the contract, and the judgment is only relevant insofar as it is a condition precedent to the creation of the third-party beneficiary right in the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-14\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1463-14\">.

In 1963, Bolender filed a Writ of Execution on the judgment, but according to Bolender, \u201c[t]he whereabouts of Bishop being unknown and Longstreth having become a clergyman, the Writ was not acted upon.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1464-8\">.

The majority, in other words, has seen fit to focus its attention on the packaging, and not the content, of the judgment privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-4\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s disposition for these reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-5\">It is settled Pennsylvania law that (1) an action on a judgment is not governed by the six-year Pennsylvania Statute of Limitations applicable to contract actions,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) the vitality of a judgment prevails undiminished for a period of twenty years inasmuch as a presumption of payment arises only after a lapse of twenty years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1466-6\">The policy here provides that the insurer may be sued for recovery of a judgment obtained against its insured to the extent of its coverage. It does not fix a time limit for the institution of such an action although it could have done so under prevailing Pennsylvania law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1466-7\">Since the policy fixes no time limitations respecting the exercise of its right-to-sue provision we must resort to Pennsylvania decisions applicable to the construction of an insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-8\">These settled Pennsylvania principles are applicable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1466-16\">\u201cIt is well settled that an insurance policy will be construed most strongly against the insurer who has prepared it,\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and \u201c[i]n case of doubt and ambiguity, a provision of an insurance policy will be construed against the insurer who drafted the instrument.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdDK\">\u201cIn determining what constitutes the obligation of a contract, no principle is more firmly established than <em>that the laws which were in force at the time and place of the making of the contract enter into its obligation with the same effect as if expressly incorporated in its terms.\u201d </em>Beaver County Building and Loan Association v. Winowich, 323 Pa. 483, 489, 187 A. 481, 484 (1936) (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A974\">The majority has <em>not </em>given effect to the foregoing principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-17\">It has <em>not </em>construed the policy \u201cmost strongly against the insurer who has prepared it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-18\">It has <em>not </em>accorded the appellant the benefit of the Pennsylvania rule that an action on a judgment is not subject to the six-year Pennsylvania Statute of Limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-19\">It has barred a suit upon a judgment which is less than twenty years old although it concedes that the vitality of the judgment exists for twenty years under Pennsylvania law. (footnote 4, majority opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-20\">It has made a shambles of the right accorded by a policy to sue the insurer on a judgment by its ruling that when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>such an action is instituted it must be regarded as a suit upon the contract and not upon the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-5\">The net effect of the majority\u2019s ruling is that it makes a judgment subject to the impact of the six-year Pennsylvania Statute of Limitations, applicable to contracts, in disregard of the Pennsylvania rule that a judgment is not governed by this statute.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1467-6\">\u201cRich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1467-7\">In paraphrase: \u201cRich gifts wax poor when <em>judges </em>prove unkind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-8\">There remains this to be said:</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-9\">There is no precedent in Pennsylvania, or any other jurisdiction, state or federal, for the majority\u2019s holding that when a policy grants a right to sue the insurer on a judgment, such an action must be regarded as a suit upon a contract and not upon a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-10\">The majority here sets an unfortunate precedent of transcending importance in insurance law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-11\">I would vacate the Order of the District Court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1465-10\">.
