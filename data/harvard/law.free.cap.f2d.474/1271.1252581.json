(8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(2).) The Government\u2019s case in chief consisted of the testimony (1) of Mr. Leupp, a border patrol agent, who stopped appellant\u2019s car and who discovered that the passengers were illegal aliens, and (2) of two of the three alien girls. Their testimony, if credited, amply supported the elements of transportation and alienage. The key issue was appellants\u2019 knowledge of their illegal alien status. The aliens also testified that they never saw appellant until he picked them up as they were hitchhiking, after some unidentified people took them across the border and dropped them, following the driver\u2019s objection to their luggage. The only testimony that linked appellant to the aliens prior to his pickup and that tended to prove that appellant knew the girls were illegally in the country was Agent Leupp\u2019s testimony, admitted over hearsay objection, that the aliens told him, outside the presence of appellant, that they had seen appellant in Mexico, and he was awaiting them as they crossed the border.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-18\">The Government concedes, as it must, that the key testimony was hearsay; it argues, however, that it was admissible because appellant\u2019s counsel opened the door by inquiring into part of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>conversation on cross-examination. The question is a close one because the development of the testimony on direct and cross is rather fuzzy. However, it seems that there were two conversations between the aliens and the agent, one of them in appellant\u2019s presence and one outside his presence. Appellant\u2019s counsel tried to confine Agent Leupp to the first conversation. On redirect, the prosecution started into the second conversation. Upon ascertaining that appellant was not then present, appellant\u2019s counsel interposed the hearsay objection. The court overruled it, and the agent gave the damaging hearsay testimony. We think that this course of events did not open the door to the second conversation. Without the second conversation, the evidence was insufficient to go to the jury on the knowledge element. Appellant\u2019s motion to acquit should have been granted at the conclusion of the Government\u2019s case in chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-4\">The judgment is reversed with directions to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
