While it is true, as stressed by opposer, that applicant\u2019s mark includes the word \u201ctoro\u201d, it is in no way emphasized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1402\">*1402</page-number>therein, and, under the circumstances of this case, it is our opinion that this factor is not calculated to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive were these marks to be used for the specified goods. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1504-4\">We affirm. In so doing, it is pertinent to point out that the goods of the parties are distinctly different and noncompetitive. TOROID is for gears, gear cutters and blades used in consonance therewith, while TORO covers grass cutting machinery, automotive vehicles and snow plows. The respective goods, therefore, are entirely dissimilar and commercially unrelated. There is no indication of record that the TORO mark is used on gears and, although appellant contends otherwise, we are not persuaded that there is likelihood of confusion merely because appellant\u2019s lawn mowers and other goods sold under the TORO mark contain gears.</p>\n<p id=\"b1504-5\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"a-o-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1503-20\">.
