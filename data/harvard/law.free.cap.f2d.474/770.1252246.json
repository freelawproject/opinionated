We find both of these contentions without merit and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-19\">The succession of events which culminated in this conviction began on August 7, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-20\">At 5:55 p. m. on that day Appellant went to a Gulf Service Station on More-land Avenue in Atlanta and rented a Ryder U-Haul van. At about 7:00 or 7:30 the evening of August 7,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> two men were observed cutting tie-down chains and removing a Massey Ferguson farm tractor from a railroad car at the Constitution yard of Southern Railway in Atlanta. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>The two men then loaded the tractor into a Ryder U-Haul van and then began to depart. Two of the witnesses pursued the departing van in an automobile.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They saw another car joining up with the van. Upon stopping, three men emerged from the two vehicles and conversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">The stolen farm tractor was discovered around noon on August 8 in the backyard of Walter T. Jones. Jones testified that the tractor had been left across the street from his house and he had first seen it there sometime around 11:00 p. m. Saturday night. He indicated that he had moved it from across the street to his backyard early Sunday morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">At about 4:55 p. m. Sunday, August 8, Appellant returned to the Gulf Station on Moreland Avenue with the rented van where he was taken into custody by FBI and Railroad Security agents.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Arrest was made and it is undisputed that Appellant was correctly advised of his constitutional rights. It was at this point in time that the damaging statements (in the nature of exculpatory statements), whose admission into evidence the Appellant attacks, were made (see note 4, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b874-17\">Appellant entered a timely objection to the government\u2019s proffer of testimony relating to his damaging statements uttered at the time of his arrest (see note 4, <em>supra). </em>At this time the trial Judge conducted a suppression hearing to determine the voluntariness of the statements. He ruled the statements admissible. At the conclusion of the government\u2019s case the Court overruled Appellant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-18\">In support of his first argument Appellant relies on the ease of Miranda v. Arizona, 1966, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, its ancestors and its progeny. He contends that where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>the right to counsel attaches, as it did here (see note 4, <em>supra), </em>any statement obtained in the absence of counsel must be suppressed, independent of any issue of the voluntariness of the statement. He further alleges that once there has been a request for an attorney or a refusal to waive rights has been made, a subsequent knowing and intelligent waiver is impossible.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant contends that the trial court addressed their inquiry to the voluntariness of the statements but did not make a proper determination of waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Of course <em>Miranda </em>places upon the government a heavy burden both with regard to inculpatory and exculpatory remarks \u201cto demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his * * * right to retained or appointed counsel.\u201d Miranda v. Arizona, <em>supra, </em>384 U.S. at 475, 86 S.Ct. at 1628. But we disagree with Appellant\u2019s appraisal of the effect of the dialogue between him and the. arresting officer at the time of the arrest. There is no evidence that the FBI agent persisted in the interrogation after Anthony invoked his right to counsel (see note 4, <em>supra). </em>Nor is there evidence that Anthony manifested inconsistent conduct because of confusion. See United States v. Hopkins, 5 Cir., 1970, 433 F.2d 1041. The Judge could conclude that Anthony himself initiated further conversation with the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">In <em>Hopkins, supra, </em>we held that if the accused initiates the conversation, his statements do not result from \u201cinterrogations\u201d and are therefore admissible. Though there is no requirement that an accused be continually reminded of his rights once he has intelligently waived them, United States v. Phelps, 5 Cir., 1971, 443 F.2d 246, the record in this case shows that the FBI agent went the second mile by a second admonishment to Appellant. We conclude that the ensuing questions asked by the FBI agent were designed merely to pursue the line of inquiry begun by Appellant and uphold the trial Judge\u2019s ruling that Anthony waived his constitutional privilege. United States v. Hopkins, <em>supra; </em>United States v. Jacquillon, 5 Cir., 1972, 469 F.2d 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-10\"> We find the remainder of Appellant\u2019s argument unpersuasive. The guilty verdict is adequately supported by the evidence. It is undisputed that Appellant departed with the van from the rental agency and subsequent to the commission of the crime returned with the van. The evidence is clear that the van was used in furtherance of the crime. Witnesses observed three men in active participation of the crime. While the evidence is not uncontradicted that Appellant was one of these three, the guilt of the Appellant may be established without proof that Appellant personally did every act constituting the offense charged. Aiding and abetting means to assist the perpetrator of the crime. United States v. Williams, 1951, 341 U.S. 58, 71 S.Ct. 595, 95 L.Ed. 747. To be an aider and abettor requires that a defendant \u201cassociate himself with the venture, that he participate in it as in something that he wishes to bring about, that he seeks by his action to make it succeed.\u201d United States v. Harris, 10 Cir., 1971, 441 F.2d 1333. Here, if he did nothing else, Appellant provided the truck necessary to transport the stolen tractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b873-12\">. \u00a7 659.

At the trial two witnesses for the Appellant testified that he was in their company from approximately 6:30 p. m. until 11:30 p. m. Saturday night. Two other witnesses testified that Appellant had spent the remainder of that Saturday night with them from about 11:55 p. m. until the next morning. Appellant\u2019s wife testified that about 5:30 p. m. on the evening of August 7 she had spoken to the Appellant via long distance from Alabama where she was staying concerning his renting a truck for the purpose of moving her and her furniture back to Atlanta.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b874-6\">. During their pursuit of the van these witnesses were able to record and testify to the registration and tag numbers of the van.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b874-7\">. As to the subsequent events and dialogue FBI agent testified as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-8\">Q. After placing him under arrest, can you tell the jury what, if anything, you did in advising him as to his constitutional rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-10\">A. I advised him he was not required to make a statement, any statement he did make could be used against him. He had a right to consult with an attorney before making any statement. If he could not afford an attorney, one would he appointed for him. If he decided to answer questions, he had a right to stop answering at any time and have him present during questioning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-11\">Q. Did you understand he understood his rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-12\">A. He stated he wanted an attorney present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-13\">Q. Then what did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-14\">A. We didn\u2019t interview him at that time. He asked me then specifically what he was being charged with and at that time, I advised him he was being charged with theft of a farm tractor from the Southern Railway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-15\">Q. Just one minute, back up a minute. Did you cease your questioning of him at this time when he said he wanted an attorney; is that correct, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-20\">A. I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-21\">Q. Who instigated the next conversation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-22\">A. He did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-23\">Q. Are you sure of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-24\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-25\">Q. Tell us how he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-26\">A. He asked me just what he was being charged with. I told him he was being charged with the theft of a farm tractor from the Southern Railway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-27\">Q. What else happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-28\">A. At that point,' he said lie might steal an automobile or truck or something ho could sell, but he certainly wouldn\u2019t steal a farm tractor. lie didn\u2019t have any need for a farm tractor. He stated he rented a truck. At that point, I interrupted him to state anything he said could be used against him. He continued on after renting the truck, he turned it over to two individuals and that they had taken the truck and then they called him at four o\u2019clock in the morning and told him where the truck could be found. lie had just gotten the truck and returned it. I then asked him who the two individuals were and he stated that a good thief never rats on another thief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-29\">Q. Did he state anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-30\">A. I asked him if he considered himself a good thief, he said he did.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b875-7\">. We recognize and reaffirm the validity of our decisions, United States v. Phelps, 5 Cir., 1971, 443 F.2d 246; United States v. Blair, 5 Cir., 1972, 470 F.2d 331, which hold that once the suspect has requested an attorney that the <em>interrogation </em>must cease. But this in no way denigrates our holding today. For what we hold is that, on the facts of this case, the challenged statements were not the products of interrogation at all, but the voluntarily offered words of the Defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
