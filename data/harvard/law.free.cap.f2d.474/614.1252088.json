App. \u00a7 462(a). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-19\">In June 1968, the Armed Forces Examining and Entrance Station (AFEES) gave appellant a pre-induction physical examination and found him acceptable for military service. However, the physical examination papers which AFEES sent to appellant\u2019s local board, while indicating the results of a hearing test of both ears, included a blank audio-gram card. He contends that \u201cthe hearing test apparently was not administered\u201d in violation of Army Regulation 601-270, Ch. 4, Sec. 2, \u00b6 4-20H(3)(f), because of the blank audiogram card, and so his order to report for work was invalid. He had indicated in his report of medical history that he had had running ears and hearing loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-20\">The only evidence presented was appellant\u2019s selective service file. It shows that a hearing test was given in recording the test results of both ears. \u201cIt is the settled general rule that all necessary prerequisites to the validity of official action are presumed to have been complied with, and that where the contrary is asserted it must be affirmatively shown.\u201d Lewis v. United States, 279 U.S. 63, 73, 49 S.Ct. 257, 260, 73 L.Ed. 615 (1928); United States v. Neckels, 451 F.2d 709 (9th Cir. 1971); United States v. Crowley, 405 F.2d 400 (4th Cir. 1968). The record contains no evidence that the hearing test was not in fact administered.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
