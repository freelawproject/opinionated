Appellant was ordered to report for induction on March 23, 1971. After a series of postponements, he filed with his local board a dependency questionnaire, in an effort to obtain a III-A \u201chardship\u201d deferment based on his mother\u2019s alleged physical and emotional dependence upon him. After the local board had rejected appellant\u2019s hardship claim and again ordered him to report for induction, appellant\u2019s mother telephoned the clerk of the local board and informed her that she had suffered a severe lumbar strain requiring one week\u2019s hospitalization followed by a period of therapy during which appellant\u2019s assistance was needed to enable her to use traction equipment. No record of this telephone conversation appeared in appellant\u2019s file, because the clerk independently determined that the information \u201cwould not affect the young man\u2019s status or classification\u201d (T. 39).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-12\">Relying on United States v. Jackson, 5th Cir. 1972, 454 F.2d 821, appellant argues that the clerk\u2019s determination to exclude Mrs. Roberts\u2019 message from his file precluded the local board from considering the information and thus denied him the right to an administrative appeal in the event the board chose not to reopen his file. We agree that the clerk had no authority independently to exclude Mrs. Roberts\u2019 message from the file, but appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Jackson </em>is nevertheless misplaced. There, the clerk had excluded facts (a physician\u2019s report that the registrant suffered from functional hypoglycemia) that <em>arguably </em>formed the basis for a medical deferment. In the instant case, however, the claim that appellant was needed to help his mother use traction equipment during a relatively brief period of therapy could not even arguably entitle appellant to a hardship deferment. Accordingly the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b198-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
