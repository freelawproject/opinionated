By reason of this association with Midwest, the appellees applied for pension fund benefits from the appellant, Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund (\u201cThe Fund\u201d), a trust fund jointly administered by an equal number of employees with union trustees, in accordance with Section 302(c) of the Taft-Hartley Act, 29 U.S. C. 186(e). Midwest is signatory to a Participating Agreement with The Fund. Payments in behalf of the owner/operators had been made to the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>The Fund trustees declined to pay-pension benefits to the owner/operators, determining that they were not employees within the meaning of the Pension Plan. The District Court, 347 F. Supp. 1081, found the trustees\u2019 determination was arbitrary, unsupported by substantial evidence, and erroneous on a question of law under the general common law test incorporated in Article I, Section 7(d) of the Plan, which provided :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1368-4\">\u201cIn all instances, the common law test, or the applicable statutory definition of master-servant relationship shall control.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1368-5\">The issue presented for review was stated by the appellant, to-wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1368-6\">\u201cThe Court erred in holding that the Defendant Pension Fund Trustees acted arbitrarily and improperly when they determined that Plaintiffs were not employees for purposes of receiving pension benefits . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1368-7\">The appeal relates only to that part of the judgment of the District Court which determined that Appellees Shoemaker, Martin and Hayes were entitled to pension benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-8\">The District Court found that substantial control of the owner/operators was in the hands of Midwest. Route assignments were delegated by Midwest and no deviation was allowed. The owner/operators could work for no one else and, in fact, were subject to call for work by Midwest during the interim they were not driving. The owner/operators were expressly forbidden to have a substitute drive their trucks unless such substitute had been approved by Midwest. Midwest financed the owner/operators\u2019 tractors, deducting payments from their mileage payments. The tractors carried Midwest\u2019s name and I.C.C. identification number. The Court concluded that Appellees Shoemaker, Martin and Hayes were employees entitled to pension benefits and ordered judgment entered accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-9\">The essential characteristics of master and servant relation is the retention by the employer of the right to <em>direct </em>and <em>control </em>the manner in which the work shall be performed. Fruco Const. Co. v. McClelland, 192 F.2d 241, 244 (8th Cir. 1951). This \u2018right to control\u2019 test was early enunciated by Judge Learned Hand as being the \u201cdegree to which the principal may intervene to control the details of the agent\u2019s performance\u201d, Radio City Music Hall Corp. v. United States, 135 F.2d 715, 717 (2nd Cir. 1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-10\">The Illinois cases dealing with this issue are in accord. See Henn v. Industrial Comm., 3 Ill.2d 325, 121 N.E.2d 492 (1954); Village of Creve Coeur v. Industrial Comm., 32 Ill.2d 430, 206 N.E.2d 706 (1965); Standard Accident Insurance Co. v. Industrial Comm., 39 Ill.2d 172, 233 N.E.2d 543 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-11\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
