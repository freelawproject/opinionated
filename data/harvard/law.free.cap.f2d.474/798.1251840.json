The plaintiffs are, respectively, the owner and exclusive licensee under Eisler\u2019s United States Patent No. 2,706,697 (\u2019697).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>The complaints allege that the defendants infringed Claims 4 and 10-14 inclusive of \u2019697. The defendants pleaded collateral estoppel, claiming that the same issues before the court had been adversely decided against the plaintiffs in Technograph Printed Circuits, Ltd. v. Bendix Aviation Corporation, 218 F.Supp. 1 (D.Md.1963), aff\u2019d. 327 F.2d 497 (4th Cir. 1964), cert. den. 379 U.S. 826, 85 S.Ct. 53, 13 L.Ed.2d 36 (1964) (hereinafter <em>Bendix). </em>The district court sustained the defendants\u2019 pleas of estoppel and dismissed the cases.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm on the authority of Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University of Illinois Foundation, 402 U.S. 313, 91 S.Ct. 1434, 28 L.Ed.2d 788 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">In <em>Blonder-Tongue, </em>the Supreme Court granted certiorari following a conflict between the Seventh and Eighth Circuits as to the validity of the patent there in question. The Eighth Circuit had previously held the patent invalid in a suit by the Foundation as plaintiff against another defendant. The Seventh Circuit, in a suit by the Foundation as plaintiff, found the patent to be valid and infringed by Blonder-Tongue Laboratories. The court did not determine the issue of validity but overruled Trip-lett v. Lowell, 297 U.S. 638, 56 S.Ct. 645, 80 L.Ed. 949 (1936), insofar as it foreclosed a plea of estoppel by judgment by a defendant facing a charge of infringement of a patent brought by a plaintiff which had previously, as a plaintiff, had the patent declared invalid in litigation concerning the validity of the patent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court abolished the doctrine of mutuality of estoppel in such patent cases. It held that a plea of es-toppel by judgment could be affirmatively asserted by a defendant where the issue decided in the prior adjudication was identical with the one presented in the present action, where there was a final judgment on the merits in the prior case, and where the party-plaintiff against whom the plea was asserted was a party-plaintiff, or was in privity with such party-plaintiff, who received the adverse decision in the prior adjudication. The following excerpt from the opinion is the best expression of the court\u2019s reasoning and explains the standards to be followed in determining whether or not such a plea of estoppel should be sustained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-7\">\u201cEven conceding the extreme intricacy of some patent cases, we should keep firmly in mind that we are considering the situation where the patentee was a plaintiff in the prior suit and chose to litigate at that time and place. Presumably he was prepared to litigate and to litigate to the finish against the defendant there involved. Patent litigation characteristically proceeds with some deliberation and, with the avenues for discovery available under the present rules of procedure, there is no reason to suppose that plaintiff patentees would face either surprise or unusual difficulties in getting all the relevant and probative evidence before the court in the first litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-8\">\u201cMoreover, we do not suggest, without legislative guidance, that a plea of es-toppel by an infringement or royalty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>suit defendant must automatically be accepted once the defendant in support of his plea identifies the issue in suit as the identical question finally decided against the patentee or one of his privies in previous litigation. Rather, the patentee-plaintiff must be permitted to demonstrate, if he can, that he did not have \u2018a fair opportunity proeedurally, substantively and evi-dentially to pursue his claim the first time.\u2019 Eisel v. Columbia Packing Co., 181 F.Supp. 298, 301 (D.C.Mass.1960). This element in the estoppel decision will comprehend, we believe, the important concerns about the complexity of patent litigation and the posited hazard that the prior proceedings were seriously defective.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-4\">\u201cDetermining whether a patentee has had a full and fair chance to litigate the validity of his patent in an earlier case is of necessity not a simple matter. In addition to the considerations of choice of forum and incentive to litigate mentioned above, certain other factors immediately emerge. For example, if the issue is nonobviousness, appropriate inquiries would be whether the first validity determination purported to employ the standards announced in Graham v. John Deere Co., supra [383 U.S. 1, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545]; whether the opinions filed by the District Court and the reviewing court, if any, indicate that the prior case was one of those relatively rare instances where the courts wholly failed to grasp the technical subject matter and issues in suit; and whether without fault of his own the patentee was deprived of crucial evidence or witnesses in the first litigation. But, as so often is the ease, no one set of facts, no one collection of words or phrases, will provide an automatic formula for proper rulings on estoppel pleas. In the end, decision will necessarily rest on the trial courts\u2019 sense of justice and equity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-6\">\u201cWe are not persuaded, therefore, that the <em>Triplett </em>rule, as it was formulated, is essential to effectuate the purposes of the patent system or is an indispensable or even an effective safeguard against faulty trials and judgments. Whatever legitimate concern there may be about the intricacies of some patent suits, it is insufficient in and of itself to justify patentees relit-igating validity issues as long as new defendants are available. This is especially true if the court in the second litigation must decide in a principled way whether or not it is just and equitable to allow the plea of estoppel in the case before it.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">402 U.S. at 332, 91 S.Ct. at 1444.</p>\n<p id=\"aee-dedup-0\">The first issue here is whether the parties-plaintiff in the present eases are the same parties-plaintiff as in <em>Bendix. </em>In <em>Bendix, </em>the plaintiffs were Techno-graph Printed Circuits, Ltd., and Tech-nograph Printed Electronics, Inc. The plaintiffs in the' present cases are Tech-nograph Printed Circuits, Ltd., and Technograph Printed Electronics, Inc. Thus, the parties-plaintiff are the same in both instances and the requirement of <em>Blonder-Tongue </em>that the parties-plaintiff be identical or in privity has been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">We turn to the next requirement of <em>Blonder-Tongue: </em>that the issues in both proceedings be identical. In <em>Bendix, </em>the district court held that claims 4, 5, 10, 14, 15, and 16 of \u2019697 and certain claims of \u2019165 and \u2019960 were invalid for obviousness and anticipation. 218 F.Supp. 1, 31, 58. In the present appeal, no issue is raised concerning \u2019165 or \u2019960. Plaintiffs claim only that claims 4 and 10-14 inclusive of \u2019697 were infringed by the defendants. Although it appears that the validity of claims 11, 12, and 13 of \u2019697 were not specifically mentioned as being invalid in <em>Bendix, </em>an examination of those claims shows that they were dependent on claim 10,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>held invalid in <em>Bendix. </em>Also, the trial court\u2019s opinion states that the parties here conceded that the issues in suit were identical to the issues decided against plaintiffs in <em>Bendix </em>(340 F.Supp. 423, 425), and this is not contested on appeal. Accordingly, the requirement of <em>Blonder-Tongue </em>that the issues be identical in both proceedings has been complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">The next step in determining whether <em>Blonder-Tongue </em>should apply is to ascertain whether plaintiffs were given a full and fair opportunity, procedurally, substantively, and evidentially, to litigate the validity of \u2019697 in <em>Bendix. </em>We conclude that they were.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">The <em>Bendix </em>trial took twenty-nine court days, during which the plaintiffs filed 458 exhibits and the defendants 543 exhibits. Several additional days were spent by the court in visiting the plants of Bendix and of licensees of the plaintiffs. Following the last day of trial, the parties filed additional briefs, over 600 pages, followed by two days of argument. No claim was made then, nor is any made now, that the court, in <em>Bendix, </em>excluded any relevant evidence that was offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-13\">In its decision in <em>Bendix, </em>the district court discussed the background of Dr. Paul Eisler, the applicant in \u2019697.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court continued by setting out the claims in issue and the positions taken by the parties to the suit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court then traced, in a painstakingly detailed process that need not be repeated here, the history of the three Eisler patents in the Patent Office.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b904-14\">In discussing the issue of validity, the court recognized the statutory presump<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>tion of validity of a patent from the fact of its issuance and that the burden on one attacking the validity of the patent is heavy. <em>Bendix, </em>218 F.Supp. at 23. The court also recognized that the presumption of validity was weakened by the failure of the Examiner to cite a number of patents pertinent to the validity of plaintiffs\u2019 patents in issue. <em>Bendix </em>at 23. It then considered the state of the art prior to, and at the time of, Eisler\u2019s claimed inventions. In discussing the state of the prior art, the court not only considered those patents considered by the Examiner in the prosecution of the Eisler patents,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but also patents not mentioned by the Examiner, which the court felt were pertinent to the validity of Eisler\u2019s patents. Concerning the metallic resist claim of \u2019697, the court said that patents by Newton, Stubbles, McFarland, Dejey, and Payne were not cited by the Examiner, but that they clearly disclosed a metallic resist concept. <em>Bendix </em>at 37. Patents which were before the court and which were considered by it with respect to the Eisler patents were: Stevens and Dallas application No. 184,419, incorporated by reference in Stevens and Dallas Patent No. 2,219,497; Bassist, Patent No. 1,525,531; Miller, Patent No. 1,804,021; Pilkington, British Patent No. 461,275; Whilems, British Patent No. 454,937; Littledale, British Patent No. 327,356; O\u2019Connell, Patent No. 2,-288,735; the Russian Patent 59,791 to Abramson and Kabakova and the article published by them in 1940; Ducas, Patent No. 1,563,731; Norris, Patent No. 2,282,203; and Rubin, Patent No. 2,-443,119, as well as others. See <em>Bendix, </em>supra, 218 F.Supp. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\">The district court considered the Stevens and Dallas application to be a complete anticipation of the alleged Eisler inventions. But the court did not stop there; it continued, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-5\">\u201cShould another court find that the alleged Eisler inventions were not identically disclosed or described in the Stevens and Dallas application, this court unhesitatingly finds and holds that \u2018the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art\u2019 were \u2018such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the (alleged) invention(s) (were) made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains\u2019.\u201d (35 USC \u00a7 103)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-9\">\u201cEven apart from the Stevens and Dallas application the court holds that the other prior art, cited and uncited by the Examiner conclusively shows lack of novelty.\u201d 218 F.Supp. at 31.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">It found as a fact that the progress of printed circuitry was attributable to the development of a satisfactorily bonded metal clad laminate rather than any gain in the knowledge of the printing and etching of metals. The court said: \u201c. . . many were working at about the same time as Eisler on printing and etching techniques. None succeeded commercially until a satisfactory bonding of metal to insulation was obtained; thereafter, many succeeded.\u201d 218 F.Supp. at 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-12\">Throughout the district court\u2019s opinion in <em>Bendix, </em>there is shown painstaking deliberation by the court to consider the contentions presented by both sides. There is absolutely no evidence that the plaintiffs did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate the validity of patent \u2019697 in <em>Bendix, </em>procedurally, substantively, and evidentially. The opportunity to litigate standards of <em>Blonder-Tongue </em>were met in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-13\">The patents <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> having been declared invalid by the district court, plaintiffs appealed to this court. Both parties filed extensive briefs and were given two hours each for oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-14\">Plaintiffs, on appeal, urged that the lower court had erred in holding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>the Stevens and Dallas application was an anticipation of the Eisler patents in suit. In oral argument, counsel for Bendix admitted that the Stevens and Dallas application was not an anticipation of the metallic resist method of \u2019697, so this court was not misled by the too broad holding of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">The plaintiffs next urged that the district court erred in holding that the Eis-ler patents were invalid for obviousness. They contended that the district court failed to use an objective standard in determining the issue of obviousness. The standard they claimed the court should have used was whether or not the Eisler inventions, at the time they were made, were obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art. One of the basic themes of plaintiffs\u2019 appeal in <em>Bendix, </em>then, was that the district court applied the wrong standard as to obviousness and thus failed to grasp the issues and possibly the technical aspects of the subject matter in suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">This court considered the above allegations along with the other contentions raised by the plaintiffs in their appellate briefs and affirmed the decision of the district court. The affirmance was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-6\">\u201cAfter careful consideration of the record, the arguments and the briefs of counsel, we are persuaded that the patent claims are invalid for obviousness in the light of the prior art for the reasons discussed in the opinion of the District Court. Technograph Printed Circuits, Ltd. v. Bendix Aviation Corp., D.C.Md., 218 F.Supp. 1. Affirmed.\u201d 327 F.2d at 498.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">Instead of mentioning anticipation in the opinion, the contentions raised by the plaintiffs as to obviousness were considered and rejected. In affirming the district court\u2019s decision, the court squarely held plaintiffs\u2019 patent claims were invalid for obviousness, necessarily holding that the trial court did apply an objective standard in determining the issue of obviousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">Having received an adverse decision from a panel of this court, plaintiffs filed a Petition For Rehearing En Banc. In their petition, they stated that <em>Bendix </em>was a test case and contended that the district court and the panel of this court both failed to apply the objective test for obviousness. They also contended that since Bendix\u2019s counsel admitted in oral argument that the Stevens and Dallas applications did not anticipate the metallic resist method of \u2019697, the panel should not have affirmed on the basis of the district court\u2019s opinion as to obviousness because it was in error as to the anticipation issue. The court did not grant the Petition For Rehearing, emphasizing the decision of its panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">Plaintiffs next sought certiorari in the United States Supreme Court, which was denied in Technograph Printed Circuits, Ltd., et al. v. Bendix Corp., 379 U.S. 826, 85 S.Ct. 53, 13 L.Ed.2d 36 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-11\">In the face of recited adverse rulings in <em>Bendix, </em>the plaintiffs continued with infringement suits here, in the same district court, against the present defendants, relying on the rule of <em>Triplett </em>for the proposition that an adverse adjudication as to the claims of infringement of a patent does not preclude another suit on the same claims against a different defendant. While these suits were pending, in May, 1971, the Supreme Court decided <em>Blonder-.Tongue. </em>There, as recited before, the court overruled <em>Triplett </em>to the extent of allowing a plea of collateral estoppel under the conditions set forth in <em>Blonder-Tongue. </em>The defendants here then pleaded collateral estoppel and moved to dismiss on the basis of <em>Blonder-Tongue. </em>After careful consideration of the briefs and argument of counsel for all parties involved, consideration of the <em>Bendix </em>case and its history and record, and a consideration of what plaintiffs alleged to be new evidence, the district court granted the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-12\">The court below held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-13\">\u201cIt is the Court\u2019s firm opinion that: (A) Plaintiffs in <em>Bendix </em>had \u2018a fair opportunity procedurally, substantive<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>ly and evidentially to pursue\u2019 their \u2018claim the first time\u2019; (B) the standards with respect to obviousness announced in Graham v. John Deere, 383 U.S. 1, 10, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545 (1966) were met; (C) The opinions in the <em>Bendix </em>case do not indicate that it was one of those \u2018rare instances where the courts wholly failed to grasp the technical subject matter and issues in suit\u2019; (D) the plaintiffs were not deprived \u2018without fault\u2019 of their own \u2018of crucial evidence or witnesses\u2019 in the <em>Bendix </em>case; and (E) \u2018it is just and equitable to allow the plea of estoppel\u2019 in these cases.\u201d (Footnotes omitted) 340 F.Supp. at 425.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-4\">The district court set forth in detail its reasons for granting the motion in a well written opinion by Judge Watkins. 340 F.Supp. 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">The plaintiffs appealed. Their first contention in this court is that <em>Bendix </em>determined that the metallic resist process of \u2019697 was disclosed by Eisler\u2019s filing of patent \u2019960 on February 3, 1944. Thus, plaintiffs contend that the lower court\u2019s dictum about possible invalidity of \u2019697 for indefiniteness, both in <em>Bendix </em>(218 F.Supp. at 43) and below (340 F.Supp. at 433), was wrong. The argument is also made by inference in plaintiffs\u2019 first contention that the district court\u2019s ruling on anticipation was also erroneous. Since this court in <em>Bendix </em>affirmed the district court\u2019s holding of invalidity of the Eisler patents, including \u2019697, on the basis of obviousness, in light of the prior art, it is difficult to see the materiality of plaintiffs\u2019 first point.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The issue in the present cases is whether plaintiffs are estopped from litigating the validity of patent \u2019697 after this court\u2019s affirmance in <em>Bendix </em>holding that \u2019697 was invalid for obviousness, not whether a dictum of the district court and a point previously disposed of by concession are free from objection. We are of opinion that the first contention of plaintiffs does not disclose error.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">The second point on appeal is that both the district court and this court in <em>Bendix </em>\u201cwholly failed to grasp the technical subject matter and issues in suit.\u201d <em>Blonder-Tongue, </em>402 U.S. at 333, 91 S.Ct. at 1445. This point is based on the holding of the district court in <em>Bendix </em>that the Stevens and Dallas application anticipated all three of Eisler\u2019s patents.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Plaintiffs also say that the district court misread Stevens and Dallas and Whilems as teaching a metallic resist process. Because of this court\u2019s reliance in <em>jBendix </em>on the district court\u2019s opinion as to obviousness, plaintiffs contend that both courts were confused as to the subject matter in suit in <em>Bendix.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">Contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 assertion, the fact that all contentions concerning anticipation were disposed of without controversy and not considered by this court made it crystal clear that they were no longer any part of the case. To repeat, during oral argument, counsel for Bendix admitted that the Stevens and Dallas application was not an anticipation of the metallic resist method of \u2019697. This court did not affirm the district court in <em>Bendix </em>on the basis of anticipation, but on the <em>ground </em>of obviousness. Thus, the panel did understand the effect of the disclaimer by Bendix\u2019s counsel and neither approved of nor considered the district court\u2019s holding with reference to anticipation in affirming the decision of invalidity as to \u2019697.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">Having again reviewed the actions of the district court in Bendix, we are of opinion that the district judge did not misconstrue Whilems or Stevens and Dallas to the extent that he wholly failed to understand the technical sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>ject matter and issues. Whilems, the Stevens and Dallas application, and Eis-ler all concerned themselves with the use of various printing and engraving techniques to make electrical circuits. Where the district court erred in <em>Bendix </em>on the issue of anticipation was his necessary holding that the precise claims of the Stevens and Dallas application antic-' ipated Eisler \u2019697. Even if Whilems and the Stevens and Dallas application were so misconstrued by the district court, we are of opinion that the opinion in <em>Bendix </em>clearly shows that this was not \u201cone of those relatively rare instances where the courts wholly failed to grasp the technical subject matter and issues in suit.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The issue of anticipation having been removed, there is no evidence to show that this court wholly failed to grasp the situation in <em>Bendix, </em>either the issues or technical subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Plaintiffs next contend that the district court, in <em>Bendix, </em>failed to apply the standards set out in Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 17, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545 (1966).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> They allege that it failed to indicate why it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the electrical art to look to the non-electrical arts to make bimetallic conductive pathway patterns for electrical components. Further, it is argued that since the district court misread the Stevens and Dallas application, it was not able to accurately apply the objective standards of <em>Graham.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\"><em>Graham </em>was decided subsequent to <em>Bendix </em>but did not change the test of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It merely set out inquiries to be made in determining whether a patent is obvious under \u00a7 103 and gives effect to the objective test for obviousness set out in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">In <em>Blonder-Tongue, </em>the court said that one of the appropriate inquiries where the issue was that of obviousness should be \u201c. . . whether the first validity determination purported to employ the standards announced in Graham v. John Deere Co., supra.\u201d 402 U.S. at 333, 91 S.Ct. at 1445.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">In the instant cases, it is the opinion of the court that the district court in <em>Bendix </em>did employ the standards required by <em>Graham. </em>The district court specifically held that the Eisler patents, including \u2019697, were invalid for obviousness because they \u201cwould have been obvious at the time the [alleged] invention [s] [were] made to a person having ordinary skill in the art.\u201d 218 F.Supp. at 31. Throughout the district court\u2019s opinion, it discussed in detail the scope and content of the prior art as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>the differences between the prior art and the claims at issue in <em>Bendix. </em>218 F.Supp. 1, 25-38. Concerning the level of ordinary skill in the art, it is inconceivable that the district court could have held the Eisler patents invalid because they \u201cwould have been obvious at the time the [alleged] invention[s] [were] made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> without considering such a standard. At 218 F.Supp. 24, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-4\">\u201cWhen available literature, both patents and publications, not cited, is considered, and also the ability of persons unaware of the alleged inventions to reach the same results by the same means, the court has no hesitation in holding the patents, and the claims in suit, to be invalid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">This court is satisfied that the just quoted language from <em>Bendix </em>shows that the district court did consider the level of ordinary skill in the art in determining that Eisler\u2019s patent \u2019697 was invalid for obviousness<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and that the standard used by the district court is compatible with that required by <em>Graham.</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-12\">Plaintiffs also raise an issue that the Norris Patent No. 2,282,203 (\u2019203), issued May 5, 1942, was improperly considered by the court in <em>Bendix. </em>Even if this were true, plaintiffs have shown no reason why they could not have made the same argument to this court in the <em>Bendix </em>appeal. They had a fair chance to litigate the issue in <em>Bendix </em>and it may not be raised now. In all events, it does not show that the district court, in <em>Bendix, </em>did not grasp the technical subject matter or the issues involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-13\">The fourth point on appeal is that plaintiffs were deprived of crucial evidence through no fault of their own. The crucial evidence to which plaintiffs refer is the September 30, 1943 notes of one Milton D. Rubin.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> They contend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>that counsel for Bendix and Rubin, himself, misled them into a self-confessed failure to get access to the Rubin notes. They argue that they should not be collaterally estopped from asserting the validity of \u2019697 because not having the Rubin notes prevented them from having a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue of validity in the <em>Bendix </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">First, the plaintiffs allege that the Rubin notes were crucial evidence because they wanted to show that Rubin, being a person well beyond the ordinary skill in the art,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> had experimented with dissimilar metals but failed to discover the metallic resist process revealed in \u2019697. They argue that these notes, showing a failure to achieve the metallic resist process by one skilled in the art, could have resulted in a different result on the issue of obviousness of \u2019697 in the <em>Bendix </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">It should first be pointed out that the Supreme Court, in <em>Graham, </em>gave effect to the objective test for obviousness under \u00a7 103. After setting out the three basic factual inquiries to be made in applying such objective test, the opinion then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-6\">\u201cSuch secondary considerations as commercial success, long felt but unsolved needs, failure of others, etc., might be utilized to give light to the circumstances surrounding the origin of the subject matter to be patented. As indicia of obviousness or nonob-viousness, these inquiries may have relevancy.\u201d 383 U.S. at 17, 86 S.Ct. at 694.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-11\">Thus, the failure of others to achieve the results of an allegedly valid patent does not necessarily make that patent non-obvious; such failure is only evidence that the court may look to in applying the objective test of \u00a7 103 along with all the other evidence in the case. It is not controlling as a matter of law and is a secondary consideration.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">We turn now to the question of just how crucial the Rubin notes were to plaintiffs\u2019 case in <em>Bendix. </em>At p. 38 of their brief, plaintiffs state that the Rubin notes, \u201cplus the stated prior art failures, is <em>objectively </em>persuasive of obviousness of \u2019697.\u201d Although plaintiffs\u2019 statement may be abstractly correct, we believe that the Rubin notes, had they been introduced in the <em>Bendix </em>trial, probably would not have caused a different result. We feel that these notes would have been merely cumulative evidence entitled to secondary consideration. See <em>Graham. </em>In plaintiffs\u2019 appeal in <em>Bendix, </em>the point is raised that many who possessed more than ordinary skill in the art had failed to discover the processes described by Eisler\u2019s alleged inventions, thus showing non-obviousness. (See Brief of Plaintiffs in <em>Bendix, </em>p. 30.) Rubin\u2019s notes were at best cumulative. This court rejected this argument then, and we are of opinion now that the presentation of the Rubin notes would not have changed our decision, especially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>since they were cumulative evidence of a secondary character.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We do not then consider the Rubin notes crucial evidence within the meaning of <em>Blonder-Tongue.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\">Assuming, however, the Rubin notes to be crucial evidence, the record shows that plaintiffs were not deprived of them through no fault of their own.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Technograph purchased Rubin\u2019s patent \u2019119 on July 7, 1954, for 1500 shares of Technograph common stock, but did not get his notes as to the conception of the patent. Early in 1961, as part of the pre-trial procedures, Bendix filed a \u201cSupplemental Answer to Plaintiff\u2019s Interrogatory 6,\u201d which had asked Bendix to identify each instance of alleged prior invention of the subject matter of the patents in suit. Bendix\u2019s supplemental answer said that claims 4 and 10 through 16 of \u2019697 were conceived of by Rubin as early as September, 1943. [The date of the notes is 9/30/43] (See Appendix B, p. B-12.) Pursuant to this information, plaintiffs interviewed Rubin and his attorney on September 5, 1961. At this conference, Rubin informed the plaintiffs that if they wanted him to search his files for such information, he would have to be paid. The plaintiffs assumed, without any basis, that Rubin wanted something in excess of his regular rates. They then terminated the interview because they say they felt that the Rubin process was fully set forth in his patent and that it was not related to the Eisler patents in suit. The plaintiffs paid Rubin and his counsel for their time spent in the interview and pursued the matter no further. On September 22, 1961, counsel for Bendix advised the trial court and plaintiffs\u2019 counsel that Rubin would testify in the <em>Bendix </em>case. In outlining the general testimony Rubin was expected to give, Bendix\u2019s counsel stated that Rubin would testify that during 1943 he conceived a process wherein \u201ca negative representation of the desired circuit component was printed as by photographic means on the metal surface of a foil-plastic laminate, a dissimilar metal was deposited on the uneoated portions of the foil, the resist was removed, and the exposed metal was then removed by etching.\u201d (Appendix B, p. B-37.) On September 27, 1961, Bendix\u2019s counsel informed the trial court and plaintiffs\u2019 counsel that Bendix had decided not to call Rubin because it had been learned that Rubin had received payment from the plaintiffs for consultative services in the same litigation.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Rubin and his notes were not produced at the <em>Bendix </em>trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">Plaintiffs now contend that the McKie memo of September 7, 1961<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> shows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>that counsel for Bendix knew that the Rubin notes showed a failure to achieve the metallic resist process of \u2019697. They further allege that Bendix and Rubin misled them by implying that all the processes Rubin dealt with were set forth in his patent \u2019119. Thus, they argue that they did not try to get Rubin\u2019s notes because they had his patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">We disagree with the contention that plaintiffs were misled by Bendix and Rubin. We believe that Bendix\u2019s supplemental answer to their interrogatory filed in January, 1961 and the September 22, 1961 outline of Rubin\u2019s expected testimony was more than sufficient to put plaintiffs on notice that Rubin might have notes on processes which were relevant to the subject matter in suit. Plaintiffs show no basis for their assumption that Rubin wanted more than his usual fee for searching his records. The truth probably is that both parties were uncertain of how Rubin\u2019s testimony might affect their case and therefore neither party called him to testify in the <em>Bendix </em>trial. Additionally, plaintiffs have offered no plausible excuse whatsoever for their failure to take the discovery deposition of Rubin. In view of the supplemental answer to the interrogatory and the outline of Rubin\u2019s proposed testimony, the failure to even attempt to take Rubin\u2019s discovery deposition, standing alone, would be sufficient to take the Rubin notes out of the \u201cno fault of their own\u201d requirement of <em>Blonder-Tongue.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">The fifth and final point that the plaintiffs raise here is that it is not just or equitable to estop them from reliti-gating the validity, of Eisler\u2019s patent \u2019697 in view of a decision in the House of Lords on February 24, 1971 which sustained the validity of British patent No. 639,178.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Plaintiffs claim that British patent \u2019178 is similar to Eisler\u2019s American patent \u2019165, which is broader than \u2019697, and thus \u2019697, being more narrow, is a stronger patent than \u2019165 or \u2019178. From this, plaintiffs argue that they should be allowed to relitigate the validity of \u2019697 in light of the House of Lords decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">We disagree with plaintiffs\u2019 contention on this point. We agree with the analysis below of the House of Lords decision. 340 F.Supp. 423, 436-437. More importantly, allowing relitigation in the light of the House of Lords decision would allow subsequent litigation in light of a decision in a foreign forum which would not have been permitted in a domestic forum by <em>Blonder-Tongue. </em>We are not constrained to so weaken the <em>Blonder-Tongue </em>ruling by encouraging disappointed plaintiff patent holders to resort to a foreign forum in order to escape the consequences of domestic procedural rules in federal courts set out by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">A final point which should be mentioned is that, prior to the decision in <em>Bendix, </em>plaintiffs had filed several actions in Chicago for infringement of the same patents. After the <em>Bendix </em>decision, the Chicago district court granted summary judgment of dismissal based on <em>Bendix. </em>The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Upon remand to the district court, a class action was \u25a0commenced.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The action was\u2019 tried to the court. Before final argument, <em>Blonder-Tongue </em>was decided. The defendants then moved to dismiss on the ground of collateral estoppel based on <em>Bendix. </em>The district court in Illinois, after the decision of the district court in Maryland in the instant cas,es, sustained the pleas of estoppel, holding that plaintiffs had had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue of validity in <em>Ben</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number><em>dix. </em>Technograph Printed Circuits, Ltd., et al. v. Methode Electronics, Inc., et al., 174 U.S.P.Q. 197 (N.D.Ill.1972), appeal to the Seventh Circuit pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\">In conclusion, we should repeat the Supreme Court\u2019s statement in allowing the defense of collateral estoppel in patent cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-5\">\u201cEven conceding the extreme intricacy of some patent cases, we should keep firmly in mind that we are considering the situation where the patentee was plaintiff in the prior suit and chose to litigate at that time and place. Presumably he was prepared to litigate and to litigate to the finish against the defendant there involved. Patent litigation characteristically proceeds with some deliberation and, with the avenues for discovery available under the present rules of procedure, there is no reason to suppose that plaintiff patentees would face either surprise or unusual difficulties in getting all relevant and probative evidence before the court in the first litigation.\u201d 402 U.S. at 332, 91 S.Ct. at 1444.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">Here, the same plaintiffs considered <em>Bendix </em>a test case<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> by which they sought to establish the validity of Eisler\u2019s patents \u2019165, \u2019960, and \u2019697. They now seek to relitigate the issue of validity as to \u2019697. They failed to convince the district court in <em>Bendix </em>of its validity, and they failed on appeal to convince us that the district court was wrong in the instant cases, plaintiffs have failed to convince the same district judge who decided <em>Bendix </em>that they did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate in <em>Bendix. </em>Again, we agree with the district court. We are of opinion that the plaintiffs had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the validity of \u2019697 in <em>Bendix </em>and that it is just and equitable to allow defendants\u2019 pleas of estoppel. We believe the instant cases show precisely why the Supreme Court, in <em>Blonder-Tongue, </em>overruled <em>Triplett </em>and commenced the sustaining of pleas of estoppel by judgment in certain patent cases.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">The judgment of the district court is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b913-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b901-11\">. The first Eisler application for a United States Patent, Serial Number 520,991, was filed February 3, 1944. As a result of such application, Patent No. 2,441,960 (\u2019960) issued on May 25, 1948. On February 27, 1948, divisional application 11,798 was filed out of which Patent No. 2,587,568 issued on February 26, 1952, and was subsequently reissued on June 12, 1956 as United States Reissue 24,165 (\u2019165). Divisional application 11,798 was further divided by Application 261,989, filed December 17, 1951, and as a result Patent No. 2,706,697 (\u2019697) issued on April 15, 1955.

The process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>starts with an insulation-backed metal foil. A negative circuit imprint is made on the foil in acid resistant ink. Dissimilar metal is then plated onto the bare foil areas. The ink is then removed from the foil areas and the foil which is then bared is etched away in an acid bath that attacks the foil, but not the dissimilar metal. This leaves unetched the dissimilar metal and the foil protected thereunder. The effect is that the plated dissimilar metal acts as a resist to protect the underlying foil areas from being etched away.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b902-9\">.

There is no reason to believe nor evidence to show that the district court, in <em>Bendix, </em>applied anything other than the objective test of obviousness required by <em>Graham. </em>The record shows that plaintiffs\u2019 main argument in their Petition For Rehearing En Banc to this Court in <em>Bendix </em>was that an objective standard was not used in determining the issue of obviousness.

In dealing with the issue of obviousness, the court quoted the factual inquiries set out in <em>Graham, </em>and then said: \u201cWe conclude further that to those skilled in the art the use of the old elements in combination was not an invention by the obvious-nonobvious standard.\u201d 396 U.S. at 62, 90 S.Ct. at 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-15\">Nowhere in <em>Anderson\u2019s-Blaolc Rook </em>did the Supreme Court set out what was the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art, but the court necessarily considered it because of the holding that the patent was obvious.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b909-16\">.

Whether the defendants knew of Rubin\u2019s stock ownership in Technograph is not known.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b911-12\">. The McKie memo was written by Bendix\u2019s counsel, which did mention the Rubin notes of September 30, 1943. (Appendix Vol. II, pp. 216a-218a.) But, there is no indication whether Rubin showed counsel these notes- or counsel found them on his own. Also, there is no indication when Bendix\u2019s counsel first saw them. Bendix\u2019s counsel obviously had seen the Rubin notes by January, 1961, possibly in September, 1960, when he examined Rubin\u2019s materials on a $20 per hour consulting basis.
