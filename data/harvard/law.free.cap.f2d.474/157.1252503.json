Both were American citizens and embassy employees, with Erdos occupying the position of senior diplomat or charge d\u2019affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-27\">Returned to the United States, Erdos was tried and convicted of voluntary manslaughter <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. On appeal, the more important issues raised are whether the district court: (1) had jurisdiction to try Erdos for a crime occurring within an American embassy located in(a foreign country; (2) erred in holding that venue lay in the Eastern District of Virginia rather than the Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>trict of Massachusetts where the plane bearing Erdos first landed; and (3) improperly curtailed the cross-examination of a psychiatrist from a psychiatric treatise. We conclude there was jurisdiction and venue, and that the district judge\u2019s error in curtailing cross-examination was not sufficiently prejudicial to require reversal. We have also considered the other 13 assigned points of error and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment below will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\n<em>Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The district court based jurisdiction upon 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 7, which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">The term \u201cspecial maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States\u201d, as used in this title, includes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-8\">(3) Any lands reserved or acquired for the use of the United States, and under the exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction thereof, <em>or </em>any place purchased or otherwise acquired by the United States by consent of the legislature of the State in which the same shall be, for the erection of a fort, magazine, arsenal, dockyard, or other needful building. [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-9\"> The power of Congress to lawfully proscribe the killing of an American citizen by another American citizen within a diplomatic compound located in a foreign country is, we think, beyond question. U.S.Const, art. III, \u00a7 2; United States v. Flores, 289 U.S. 137, 146-147, 53 S.Ct. 580, 77 L.Ed. 1086 (1933); United States v. Bowman, 260 U.S. 94, 96-98, 43 S.Ct. 39, 67 L.Ed. 149 (1922). The-problem is not one of power but of intention, <em>i. e., </em>statutory construction. Erdos contends that the district court lacked jurisdiction to try him for an offense committed outside the territorial limits of the United States because Congress has not exercised its constitutional power so as to extend American criminal court jurisdiction to the United States Embassy in Equatorial Guinea. It is urged that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 7(3) must be read to apply only to areas within the geographical boundaries of \u00abthe United States and may not be given extraterritorial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">The embassy in question is leased by the United States from a private citizen of the new Republic of Equatorial Guinea. This lease agreement does not itself defeat criminal jurisdiction, however, since fee simple \u201cownership\u201d of the property by the United States is not a prerequisite to such jurisdiction. As the court in United States v. Archer, 51 F.Supp. 708 (S.D.Cal.1943), said at 709:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-13\">A consulate is, ordinarily, a building owned by the Government of the United States. And although it be not owned by the United States, it is a part of the territory of the United States of America.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-14\">In <em>Bowman, supra, </em>260 U.S. at 98-99, 43 S.Ct. 39, both public and <em>private </em>ships on the high seas were characterized as \u201cconstructively\u201d a part of the territory of the United States. Subsection (3) is not framed in the language of conveyancing. The test, as to property within or without the United States, it one of practical usage and dominion exercised over the embassy or other federal establishment by the United States government.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-15\">The much harder question is whether the third phrase of \u00a7 7(3) (dealing with places acquired by the federal government with the consent of the states and thus presumably within the territorial boundaries of the United States) modifies and limits the more general coverage of the preceding two phrases. The meaning is not perfectly clear. Nor is the legislative history.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Such an interpretation is not implausible, and, indeed, it is possible that when the statute was enacted the attention of the Congress was not in the slightest fo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>cused on extraterritorial jurisdiction. But if so, why the broad general language of phrases one and two \u2014 wholly unnecessary to implement the establishment of forts, dockyards and other needful buildings within the states plainly accomplished by phrase three ?</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Where the power of the Congress is clear, and the language of exercise is broad, we perceive no duty to construe a statute narrowly. The first two phrases connected by the conjunctive \u201cand\u201d relate to and modify each other. The result is to create a jurisdictional category: lands reserved or acquired for the use of the United States and under its exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction. It is only the third phrase, separated from the first two by a comma and the disjunctive \u201cor,\u201d that limits jurisdiction to places acquired (within the United States presumably) by the consent of state legislatures. We think the third phrase is independent of and does not modify the first two, and so read, the sentence describes two kinds of places or lands within the \u201cspecial\u201d jurisdiction of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\"> We hold that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 7(3) is a proper grant of \u201cspecial\u201d territorial jurisdiction embracing an embassy in a foreign country acquired for the use of the United States and under its concurrent jurisdiction. We further hold that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112 is a specific grant of subject matter jurisdiction with respect to manslaughter committed at a place within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\n<em>Venue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Venue, in cases of crimes committed outside any district, is controlled by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3238,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which provides in part that venue shall be in the district within the United States where the offender \u201cis arrested or first brought.\u201d The statute has a long history.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It was first enacted in 1790, amended in 1825, again in 1874, and most recently in 1963. In its original form, the statute used the word \u201capprehended.\u201d The 1825 version used the words \u201cfirst apprehended.\u201d In the 1874 version the word \u201cfound\u201d was substituted for the words \u201cfirst apprehended,\u201d but in the latest reenactment, the Congress reverted to the original idea of restraint and substituted the word \u201carrested\u201d for the word \u201cfound.\u201d The legislative history of the 1963 version explains that \u201cThe term \u2018found\u2019 in most cases means \u2018arrested.\u2019 \u201d 1963 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">The various versions of the statute have been construed time and again. <em>E. g., </em>United States v. Provoo, 215 F.2d 531, 537 (2d Cir. 1954); United States v. Townsend, 219 F. 761, 762 (2d Cir. 1915). The eases seem to agree, whether construing the words \u201cfound,\u201d \u201capprehended,\u201d or \u201cfirst apprehended,\u201d that'the Congress had restraint in mind. We think the phrase in the current version of the statute that venue shall be in the district in which the offender \u201cis arrested or is first brought\u201d means simply <em>\u201carrested\u201d </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>that venue is in that district within the United States where the offender is first restrained of his liberty in connection with the offense charged. Obviously, \u201cfirst brought\u201d could plausibly be interpreted to mean what it says, so that wherever an offender (traveling by air) touches down in the United States, that is the place where trial must be had. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>But it is settled otherwise. \u201cFirst brought\u201d within the context of the statute means first brought <em>in custody </em>with liberty restrained. United States v. Ross, 439 F.2d 1355, 1358 (9th Cir. 1971); <em>Provoo, supra, </em>at 537; Chandler v. United States, 171 F.2d 921, 927, 932-933 (1st Cir. 1948); Kerr v. Shine, 136 F. 61, 63-65 (9th Cir. 1905).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The commercial airplane in which Erdos returned to the United States was scheduled to make its initial landing in the United States at Dulles International Airport \u2014 located in the Eastern District of Virginia. Instead, it made an unscheduled intermediate stop in Boston, Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Erdos contends that the District of Massachusetts is the district with exclusive venue because that is the district into which he was \u201cfirst brought.\u201d He would be correct but for the judicial gloss, to which we have adverted, that has long since been applied to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The district court found as a fact that Erdos was not in custody on the return flight to the United States, nor in Boston, stating that \u201call the evidence was he was free to go where he wanted to,\u201d even when the plane landed at Dulles.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The district court, consequently, determined that Erdos was \u201cfirst found\u201d at Dulles when he was served with the complaint and summons upon his arrival there. For reasons previously stated, we read \u201cfirst found\u201d as meaning arrested. But it does not matter, for the record is clear that, if not arrested at Dulles, Erdos was subsequently arrested at Alexandria, also within the jurisdiction of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Findings of fact by a district court in a criminal case may not be disturbed on appeal unless they are clearly erroneous. Campbell v. United States, 373 U.S. 487, 493, 83 S.Ct. 1356, 10 L.Ed.2d 501 (1963); United States v. Graves, 428 F.2d 196, 200 (5th Cir. 1970). After carefully examining the record we believe there was ample evidence from which the district court could find that Erdos was <em>not </em>in custody within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3238 when his flight landed in Boston and, therefore, that venue was appropriate in the Eastern District of Virginia since that was the district in which he was first arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">\n<em>Cross-Examination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">At trial Erdos admitted killing Leahy and pleaded insanity as his defense. In furtherance of his defense, Erdos called as witnesses four psychiatric nurses who had attended him during his hospitalization and two psychiatrists. In rebuttal the government called two court-appointed psychiatrists, both of whom testified on direct examination that Erdos was only feigning mental illness after he killed Leahy.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-14\">While cross-examining one of the court-appointed psychiatrists, counsel for Erdos attempted to question the witness from an apparently recognized psychiatric treatise. The district judge sustained the government\u2019s objections to the use of the psychiatric treatise after the witness said that he had \u201cread portions of it . . . [but was] not familiar with the whole text.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-16\">There has been much progress in recent years toward expanding the \u201clearned treatise\u201d exception to the hearsay rule to allow liberal cross-examination of expert witnesses from respect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>ed texts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This trend was recognized and approved by the Supreme Court in Reilly v. Pinkus, 338 U.S. 269, 275, 70 S.Ct. 110, 94 L.Ed. 63 (1949), and expressly adopted by this court in Lawrence v. Nutter, 203 F.2d 540 (4th Cir. 1953), at 543:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">We need go no further in the pending case than to hold that the attention of an expert may be called in the course of cross examination to statements in conflict with his testimony contained in relevant scientific works which he recognizes as authoritative. This holding accords . . . with the more liberal view taken in the recent cases ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Before allowing cross-examination from a treatise, however, it must be established that the book is known by the witness and is a generally respected authority in the relevant field. <em>Reilly, supra, </em>338 U.S. at 275, 70 S.Ct. 110; <em>Lawrence, supra, </em>203 F.2d at 542. Since the district court prevented counsel for Erdos from establishing the authenticity and authority of the book, we assume it to be a \u201clearned treatise\u201d for purposes of appeal. We hold it was error to restrict cross-examination from this text. But error alone is not sufficient to justify reversal. Erdos was given every opportunity during his trial to present evidence supporting his defense of insanity. He was allowed ample latitude both in the direct examination of his own numerous witnesses and on cross-examination of the court-appointed psychiatrists. We think the curtailing of the cross-examination of one witness from one particular treatise during a lengthy trial was not error so grave as to require reversal where extensive evidence was properly admitted on the issue in question. Erdos\u2019s rights were not substantially affected by this incorrect ruling, and we therefore disregard the error.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-14\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112 provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-15\">(a) Manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being without malice.
