Wilson against Red Cloud Tribe, Number 58, Improved Order of Red Men of Messick, York county, Virginia. The parties are referred to as they appeared in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">The plaintiff is the widow of Howard Wilson who, at the time of his death and for several years prior to that time, was a member of the defendant association.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">The defendant (to which we shall hereafter refer as the Tribe), a fraternal benefit society, is an unincorporated association,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which is a subordinate lodge of the \u201cGreat Council of Virginia of the Improved Order of Red Men,\u201d a Virginia corporation, which, as stated in its constitution, \u201cexists by virtue of a charter granted it. by the Great Council of the United States of the Improved Order of Red Men.\u201d One of the objects of this order and this Tribe is to afford limited insurance benefits payable by the tribe to its members.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">The purpose of the action is to recover from the defendant a sum arrived at by multiplying $2 by the number of members of the defendant order in good standing at the time of the death of Howard Wilson, to which the plaintiff claims to be entitled under the benefit provisions of section 5, article VI, of the by-laws of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">By agreement a trial by jury was waived and all questions of fact and law were submitted to the decision of the court. Being of opinion that the plaintiff was entitled to recover and that at the time of Howard Wilson\u2019s death the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>had 414 members in good standing, the court entered judgment for the plaintiff for $828, with interest from October 10, 1932. To this judgment the defendant has been granted a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The first assignment of error is that the court erred in holding that, upon the facts proven, the plaintiff was entitled under the by-laws of the order to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">There is no material conflict in the evidence, and the important facts are as follows: On August 27, 1932, Howard Wilson, the husband of the plaintiff, was injured in an automobile accident. After being in a hospital for two weeks he was taken to his home in York county, where he died on September 24, 1932, as the direct result of his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">At the time he was injured he was indebted to the Tribe in the sum of $2.10 for dues and assessments for the three months ending June 30, 1932. On September 23, 1932, his stepmother, Mrs. Alice Wilson, paid for him to E. L. Forrest, the regular collector for the Tribe (called \u201cCollector of Wampum\u201d) $2.10 in full settlement of Wilson\u2019s dues and assessments for the three months ending June 30, 1932, and $1.80 for his dues and assessments for the three months ending September 30, 1932. For these payments official receipts of the Tribe were given. Wilson died the following day (September 24th) about 8:30 p. m.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">When these payments were made Wilson believed he was going to get well, as did his wife and his stepmother; and when Forrest received these payments he knew that Wilson was sick as a result of injuries received in this accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">The Tribe held a meeting every Saturday night. During the early part of the regular meeting held September 24, 1932, someone came in and said that Howard Wilson was dead. Shortly after this Forrest stated to the meeting that Wilson\u2019s dues had been paid; and at the close of the meeting he reported the total dues collected by him since the last meeting, which included the amounts paid by Wilson, and the whole amount reported by him was accepted by the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">No action was taken to return Wilson\u2019s dues until at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>meeting of the Tribe held on November 19, 1932 (the eighth after Wilson\u2019s death). At this meeting a motion was made and carried to \u201crefund Mr. Howard Wilson\u2019s dues for quarters June and September, to be paid to Mrs. Alice Wilson.\u201d In accordance with this resolution a check was sent to Mrs. Wilson for the $3.90 which she had paid for Howard Wilson. She endorsed the check and turned it over to Mrs. Bertha Wilson (the plaintiff), who promptly returned the check to the Tribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">No claim was made by Howard Wilson during his lifetime or is here being made for sick benefits. The Tribe has not paid and no claim is here being made for the $40 which section 4 of article VI of the by-laws of the Tribe prqvides shall be paid to help defray the funeral expenses of a member who dies while in good standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The Tribe issues no policy of insurance and the pertinent by-laws of the Tribe constitute the contract of insurance between the Tribe and its members. It is also pertinent to note that the insurance benefits are not payable by the superior or grand lodge but are payable by the local tribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">\u201cGeneral laws and rules of order for the government of tribes under its jurisdiction\u201d were adopted and promulgated in January, 1923, by the \u201cGreat Council of Virginia of the Improved Order of Red Men.\u201d These laws we shall hereafter refer to as \u201cGeneral Laws for Tribes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Section 134 of \u201cGeneral Laws for Tribes\u201d provides that \u201cthe Tribe shall adopt by-laws in accordance with these laws.\u201d The \u201cby-laws\u201d adopted by the Red Cloud Tribe bear unmistakable internal evidence of having been adopted in pursuance of the grand lodge\u2019s \u201cGeneral Laws for Tribes,\u201d and by section 7 of article XV of the Tribe\u2019s by-laws sections 53-58 of the \u201cGeneral Laws for Tribes\u201d are by reference incorporated verbatim in the Tribe\u2019s by-laws. In a similar manner many other sections of the \u201cGeneral Laws for Tribes\u201d are incorporated by reference in the by-laws of the Tribe. It is plain that the by-laws of the Tribe were intended to be and must be interpreted in the light of the provisions of the \u201cGeneral Laws for Tribes,\u201d the pertinent sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>tions of which are quoted in the footnote.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In quoting sections of the \u201cGeneral Laws for Tribes\u201d and of the by-laws of the Tribe we insert in brackets the interpretation given some of the order\u2019s idioms in the glossary printed as an appendix to the \u201cConstitution and General Laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The pertinent sections of the \u201cBy-laws of Red Cloud Tribe, No. 58,\u201d read:</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>\u201cArticle V.\u2014Dues, Fines and Assessments</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\u201cSection 1.\u2014Every member of this Tribe shall be required to pay into the wampum belt of this Tribe as dues from the time of adoption, re-instatement or admittance to membership herein one fathom, and fifty inches ($1.50) as quarterly dues, the same with all fines and assessments to be paid on or before the last council sleep in March, June, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>September and December, or within one council sleep thereafter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">\u201cSec. 2.\u2014On the death of a member in good standing;

The tribe to be reimbursed by assessment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">Article XVII, captioned \u201cNurse for Sick Brother\u201d provides for the furnishing of a nurse to a sick brother, who requires a nurse\u2019s service, for a period not exceeding three months at not exceeding $1.50 a day; and section 3 thereof reads in part as follows: \u201cAll nurse fees shall be paid from the general fund of the tribe, to be reimbursed by assessment of its members at the end of each quarter when dues are due.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">The Tribe contends that under the correct interpretation and construction of sections 2 and 3, article XV, of the bylaws of the Tribe, if a member, while in good health, becomes in arrears for the payment of dues and assessments, he <em>may </em>pay up such dues after he becomes sick or disabled, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>but such payment does not entitle either him or any person claiming through him to any benefits because of that spell of sickness or his death therefrom. Or to state it in another way, the Tribe contends that the clause in section 2, article XV, reading \u201cany member taken sick or disabled during that period shall not be entitled to any benefits during such sickness or disability,\u201d and the clause in section 3, article XV, reading \u201cbut such payment does not entitle him to benefits during such sickness or disability\u201d mean that neither he nor anyone claiming through him shall be entitled to any benefits because of such sickness or his death therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">On the other hand the plaintiff contends that, when the by-laws are correctly interpreted and construed, these propositions are established:</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">1. There are four separate and distinct classes of benefits provided for in the by-laws: (a) Sick benefits, (b) members\u2019 funeral or burial benefits, (c) death benefits, and (d) wife\u2019s funeral or burial benefits. Two of these classes of benefits (sick benefits and wife\u2019s funeral or burial benefits) are payable to the insured. On the other hand, the other two (funeral or burial benefits and death benefits) are payable to the wife of the insured, the first to be used for the burial of the insured and the second for her own use.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">2. A member in arrears is expressly permitted to pay up his arrearages after he becomes sick or disabled; but, notwithstanding such payment, is precluded from <em>himself </em>receiving any benefits during such sickness or disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">3. By the express provision of the last clause in section 3, article XV of the by-laws, no funeral benefits are payable if the member dies from a sickness which had its inception while he was in arrear. But the expression \u201cfuneral benefits\u201d means only the $40 payable under section 4, article VI, \u201cto help defray his funeral expenses,\u201d and does not include within its meaning the $2 for each member of the Tribe in good standing which is payable to the widow under section 5 of article VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">4. The language in section 3, article XV, which reads <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>\u201csuch payment does not entitle him to benefits during such sickness or disability,\u201d applies only to sick benefits and funeral or burial benefits in case of his wife\u2019s death, which are both payable to him. It has no application to benefits payable to the member\u2019s widow upon his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">5. As the sum here sued for is a benefit payable to the widow for her own use, and the member was not in arrear when he died, she is entitled to recover, notwithstanding he died from a sickness which had its inception while he was in arrear.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The trial court seems to have followed and accepted the reasoning of the plaintiff. This chain of reasoning, we think, is <em>not </em>sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">When the \u201cBy-laws of Red Cloud Tribe\u201d are read and interpreted in the light of the \u201cGeneral Laws for Tribes,\u201d we think there are only two classes of contractual benefits provided for in the by-laws\u2014(1) sick benefits and (2) funeral benefits, which latter class includes all benefits payable upon the death of a member or his wife. This interpretation is more consonant with the general spirit of the provisions of the \u201cGeneral Laws for Tribes\u201d and the by-laws of the Tribe than that for which the plaintiff contends; and must be adopted unless section 5 of article VI of the by-laws is to be held to be a direct violation of section 52 of the \u201cGeneral Laws for Tribes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">The sum payable under section 5, article VI of the bylaws to the widow of a member is raised by assessment as provided in section 2, article V.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">Section 52 of the \u201cGeneral Laws for Tribes\u201d provides that \u201cassessments may be made upon members for payment of sick or funeral benefits and orphans\u2019 tax <em>only.\u201d </em>(Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">Section 86 of the \u201cGeneral Laws for Tribes\u201d provides that when a greater amount than the minimum therein is provided for sick and <em>funeral </em>benefits \u201csuch excess may be disbursed as the by-laws may direct.\u201d (See, also, the last clause of section 96, making a similar provision relative to funeral benefits.)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>We are of opinion that the authority for the assessment of the members for benefits payable to the widow is to be found in the language quoted from section 86 and the last clause of section 96 of the \u201cGeneral Laws for Tribes\u201d relating to funeral benefits, and such benefit stands defined as a funeral benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">In this connection it may be noted that the language of the last clause of section 3 of article XV of the by-laws is \u201ccannot * * * be entitled to funeral benefits in case of death.\u201d The use of the plural instead of the singular \u201cfuneral benefit\u201d appears to be a recognition that the by-laws provide for more than one funeral benefit in case of the death of a member. There are only two benefits provided for in case of the death of a member\u2014(1) the $2 for each member payable to the deceased member\u2019s widow, and (2) the $40 to be used to help defray his burial expenses. If only one of these was meant to be embraced by the language of the last clause of section 3, article XV, the singular would be the appropriate form.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">We are of opinion that the true meaning of the bylaws is that the plaintiff is not entitled to the recovery here sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">But the plaintiff under her second assignment of error contends that even if this be so, the Tribe has waived the forfeiture by accepting and retaining for nearly two months the payment of Wilson\u2019s dues and assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">This contention is without merit. Section 3, article XV, of the by-laws expressly gave Wilson the right to pay the dues and assessments for which he was in arrear while suffering from a sickness contracted while he was in arrear, but it also stipulated that such payment should not entitle him (or those claiming under him) to benefits until he had recovered from that sickness. In view of this provision the Tribe could not lawfully have refused to accept payment of these arrearages. He had the right to pay them so as to be entitled to the universal password and privileges of the order other than benefits; and the acceptance of the payment did not operate to waive the stipulation that the pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number><em>ment </em>should not entitle him to benefits until he had recovered from the sickness from which he was then suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The judgment of the trial court will be reversed, and judgment here entered for the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b238-13\"> Section 6058, Code Va. 1919.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b241-6\"> Pertinent sections of \u201cGeneral Laws for Tribes.\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"AY\">\u201cSec. 41.
