Accordingly, our review is <em>de novo. E.g., Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005). A claim is \u201cfrivolous if it does not have an arguable basis in fact or law\u201d. <em>Brewster v. Dretke, </em>587 F.3d 764, 767 (5th Cir.2009). To determine if a complaint fails to state a claim, our court applies the same standard of review applicable to dismissals made pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), and will uphold a dismissal if, \u201ctaking the plaintiffs allegations as true, it appears that no relief could be granted based on the plaintiffs alleged facts\u201d. <em>Samford v. Dretke, </em>562 F.3d 674, 678 (5th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Harris v. Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153, 156 (5th Cir.1999)); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">On appeal, Westley further asserts Sergeant Howard slammed him to the ground after he was restrained, and frequently uses excessive force against inmates. He did not, however, present these assertions in district court; therefore, they will not be considered here. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">For his excessive-force claim, Westley fails to show the court erred in dismissing his claim. Regarding the extent-of-injury factor used in analyzing excessive-force claims, Westley complains of significant injuries, including memory loss, partial use of his back, dizziness, and blackouts. <em>See Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 7, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992). His complaints are contradicted by the documents he attached to his amended complaint, which reflected only minor bruises and scratches. In examining the remaining <em>Hudson </em>factors, we consider: \u201cthe need for application of force, the relationship between that need and the amount of force used, the threat reasonably perceived by the responsible officials, and any efforts made to temper the severity of a forceful response\u201d. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). In that regard, Westley admitted in his amended complaint that Officers were responding to a fight between Westley and another inmate, and Sergeant Howard acted because he \u201cbelieved [Westley] was not cooperating to [t]he fullest\u201d. In the light of the foregoing, Westley\u2019s appeal is frivolous. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Our dismissal of Westley\u2019s complaint as frivolous, and the district court\u2019s dismissal on the same ground, count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Westley is hereby cautioned that, if he accumulates three strikes, he will no longer be allowed to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility, unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury\u201d. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b432-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
