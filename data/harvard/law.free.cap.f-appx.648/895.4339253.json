We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b920-14\">In 2009, Gonzalez was convicted of one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(ii), 846. Applying the 2008 Sentencing Guidelines Manual, the Probation Office assigned Gonzalez a base-offense level of 34 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(a)(3), because the crime involved possession of at least 15 but less than 50 kilograms of cocaine. Gonzalez received a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), because he possessed a dangerous weapon. He also received a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(c), because he was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of the conspiracy, resulting in a total-offense level of 38. Because Gonzalez had no criminal-history points, he was assigned a criminal-history category of I. His resulting Guidelines range was 235 to 293 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-15\">At his sentencing, Gonzalez accepted responsibility and was granted a two-level reduction. The district judge also sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>tained his objection to the role enhancement, making Gonzalez eligible for safety-valve relief. With the omission of the role-enhancement adjustment, reduction for acceptance of responsibility, and application of safety-valve relief, Gonzalez\u2019s offense level was reduced to 32, resulting in a Guidelines range of 121 to 151 months of imprisonment. The judge sentenced Gonzalez to 110 months of imprisonment, an 11-month (9 percent) downward variance from the bottom of his Guidelines range. The judge varied downward, because the crime did not involve the use of an actual firearm, which reduced the dangerousness and seriousness of the crime. We affirmed Gonzalez\u2019s conviction and sentence on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>414 Fed.Appx. 189 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Thereafter, Gonzalez filed a motion for appointment of counsel to, assist him in preparing a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduction of his sentence under Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which the district judge construed as a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. The government agreed Gonzalez was eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 782 and recommended his sentence be reduced to 97 months of imprisonment, the low end of his amended Guidelines range. The government further noted the Sentencing Guidelines prohibited the judge from reducing Gonzalez\u2019s sentence below the minimum of his amended Guidelines range. The judge granted Gonzalez\u2019s motion and reduced his sentence to 97 months of imprisonment. In granting this reduction, the judge stated he had considered the revised Guidelines range and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">On appeal, Gonzalez argues the judge erred in failing to grant him a comparable downward variance in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding and reduce his sentence to 86 months of imprisonment. By not granting this additional variance, he asserts the judge failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">We review de novo conclusions regarding the scope of legal authority by a district judge under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Colon, </em>707 F.3d 1255, 1258 (11th Cir.2013). A defendant is eligible for a reduced sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) when an amendment listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(d) lowers the Guidelines range calculated by the sentencing judge. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(A)). The judge must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding but need not state specifically the applicability of each factor in determining the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>568 F.3d 923, 927 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-10\">District judges are generally prohibited from reducing a defendant\u2019s sentence to a term below the minimum of the amended Guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A). The only exception to this prohibition is where the defendant received a sentence below the applicable Guidelines range at the original sentencing pursuant to <em>a substantial-assistance motion filed by the government. Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(B). In that situation, the judge may apply a comparable reduction to the amended Guidelines range in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>Id. </em>A judge cannot sentence a defendant below the amended Guidelines range, however, when the downward departure or variance at the original sentencing was not based on the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n.3). We have held Amendment 759 to the Guidelines, which limits a judge\u2019s ability to issue a sentence below the minimum of the amended Guidelines range, does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause; exceed the Sentencing Commission\u2019s authority under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984; violate separation of powers principles; or violate the Administrative Procedure Act. <em>See Colon, </em>707 F.3d at 1258-62 (affirming the denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion on the ground the judge lacked authority to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence below the amended Guidelines range).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">Amendment 782 provides a two-level reduction in the base-offense levels for most drug quantities listed in the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1(c). U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 782. For offenses involving at least 15 but less than 50 kilograms of cocaine, Amendment 782 reduces the base-offense level from 34 to 32. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cSection 2D1.1(c)(4) (as so redesignat-ed) is amended by striking \u2018Level 34\u2019 and inserting \u2018Level 32.\u2019\u201d); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">The district judge did not err in failing to reduce Gonzalez\u2019s sentence below the amended Guidelines range. The judge correctly determined Gonzalez was eligible for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 782, correctly identified his amended Guidelines range, and reduced his sentence to 97 months of imprisonment, the bottom of the amended Guidelines range, after considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Smith, </em>568 F.3d at 927. This was the lowest possible sentence the judge could have imposed on Gonzalez, because the variance Gonzalez received at sentencing was not based on his substantial assistance; consequently, the judge lacked authority to apply a comparable reduction in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1)(A), (B); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.3); <em>Colon, </em>707 F.3d at 1258-62. Therefore, the judge did not err in failing to grant Gonzalez a comparable downward variance from the amended Guidelines imprisonment range in his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
