Jackman, Jr., appeals pro se from the orders of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (\u201cthe DNJ\u201d) dismissing his third habeas petition for lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>jurisdiction and denying his motion to alter or amend that dismissal. For the reasons that follow, we will summarily affirm both orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">In 2000, a grand jury in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania (\u201cthe WDPA\u201d) returned a two-count indictment against Jackman. The first count charged him with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e)(1) by being a felon in possession of firearms, while the second count charged him with violating 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5861(d) and 5871 by possessing an unregistered destructive device. Jackman pleaded guilty to the first count and a jury found him guilty of the second count. After determining that Jackman was subject to a sentencing enhancement under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), the WDPA sentenced him to 262 months in prison. We affirmed that judgment. <em>See United States v. Jackman, </em>72 Fed.Appx. 862, 863 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Thereafter, Jackman moved the WDPA to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, raising dozens of claims. The WDPA denied \u00a7 2255 relief, concluding that each of his claims had already been litigated, was procedurally defaulted, and/or was meritless. We then denied a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). <em>See </em>C.A. No. 07-1023.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Later, while incarcerated in a fpderal prison in Ohio, Jackman filed a habeas petition in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio (\u201cthe NDOH\u201d) pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. That petition claimed, inter alia, that he was actually innocent of being a felon in possession of firearms. ' The NDOH dismissed the petition, concluding that Jack-man had failed to show that a \u00a7 2255 motion was inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. Jackman moved to alter or amend that dismissal, but the NDOH denied that motion. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit subsequently affirmed the NDOH\u2019s rulings in an unpublished order.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">After Jackman was transferred to a federal prison in New Jersey, he filed a second habeas petition, this time in the DNJ. His second petition reiterated his actual innocence claim and also alleged, inter alia, -that he had not been appointed competent counsel in his criminal case. The DNJ dismissed that petition \u2014 essentially echoing the reasoning of the NDOH \u2014 and later denied Jackman\u2019s motion to alter or amend that dismissal. We then affirmed the DNJ\u2019s two orders. <em>See Jackman v. Shartle, </em>535 Fed.Appx. 87, 89-90 <em>&amp; </em>n. 6 (3d Cir.2013) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">Undeterred, in 2014, Jackman filed his third habeas petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This new petition, which was filed in the DNJ, claimed that he was actually innocent of both of his criminal counts, and that a sentencing enhancement should not have been applied to him because his three prior drug offenses did not actually qualify as predicate convictions under ACCA. On January 7, 2015, the DNJ dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction, explaining that Jackman had once again failed to demonstrate that a \u00a7 2255 motion was inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. Jackman timely moved the DNJ to alter or amend that dismissal, but the DNJ denied this motion in an order entered on September 28, 2015. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In reviewing the DNJ\u2019s dismissal of Jackman\u2019s third habeas petition, we exercise plenary review over the DNJ\u2019s legal conclusions and review its factual findings for clear error. <em>See Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002) (per curiam). We review the DNJ\u2019s denial of his motion to alter or amend for abuse of discretion, except with respect to matters of law, over which our review is plenary. <em>See Addie v. Kjaer, </em>737 F.3d 854, 867 (3d Cir.2013). We may take summary action if this appeal fails to present a substantial question. <em>See </em>3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">A \u00a7 2255 motion is the presumptive means by which a federal prisoner can collaterally attack the validity of his conviction or sentence. <em>See Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002). A federal prisoner may challenge the validity of his conviction or sentence via a \u00a7 2241 petition only if he establishes that a \u00a7 2255 motion would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); see <em>Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 538. The \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d exception applies in rare circumstances only, such as when a federal prisoner had \u201cno prior opportunity to challenge his conviction for a crime that an intervening change in substantive law could negate with retroactive application.\u201d <em>Okereke, </em>307 F.3d at 120 (citing <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 251 (3d Cir.1997)). A \u00a7 2255 motion is not inadequate or ineffective merely because relief under \u00a7 2255 was previously denied or the federal prisoner cannot meet the gatekeeping requirements for filing a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 539. \u201cIt is the inefficacy of the remedy, not the personal inability to use it, that is determinative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">We agree with the DNJ that this case is not one of the rare instances in which a \u00a7 2255 motion would be inadequate or ineffective. Jackman does not allege that an intervening change in law decriminalized the conduct for which he was convicted. Additionally, the claims in his third habeas petition, none of which appears to hinge on new law or evidence, could have been raised during his criminal proceedings and/or in his first \u00a7 2255 motion. In fact, he did raise at least one of these claims (his claim that he is actually innocent of being a felon in possession of firearms) in both a 2002 motion to dismiss the indictment and his first \u00a7 2255 motion; however, the WDPA rejected that claim. That Jackman\u2019s first \u00a7 2255 motion was denied, and that he may be unable to raise his current claims in a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, does not render \u00a7 2255 inadequate or ineffective. Accordingly, we find no error in the DNJ\u2019s decision to dismiss his third habeas petition, and we conclude that the DNJ acted within its discretion in denying his motion to alter or amend that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">Because this appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the DNJ\u2019s January 7, 2015 and September 28, 2015 orders.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Ayr\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b266-8\">. Jackman styled this petition as being brought under Article I, Section 9, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution. However, for substantially the reasons given by the DNJ, that court properly treated the petition as being brought under \u00a7 2241.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b267-7\">. Jackman does not need a COA to proceed with this appeal. <em>See United States v. Cepero, </em>224 F.3d 256, 264-65 (3d Cir.2000) (en banc), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Gonzalez v.
