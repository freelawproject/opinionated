He says that the district court abused its discretion by not considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and by classifying him as a career offender. Garcia was not eligible for a sentence reduction, because he was sentenced as a career offender. So the district court did not have the authority to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Furthermore, a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion cannot be used to challenge his status as a career offender. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
