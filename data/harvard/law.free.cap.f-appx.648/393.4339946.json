HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">Defendant Great Plains Oilfield Rental, LLC leased a \u201cfrac tank\u201d to codefendant Chesapeake Operating, Inc., which contracted to have plaintiff Nabors Completion <em>&amp; </em>Production Services Co. haul the tank between two locations in Oklahoma. Two tires on the tank trailer blew out and the tank scraped along the pavement, sparking a sizable fire. Nabors appeals the district court\u2019s summary judgment in favor of Defendants. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">Nabors provides services for oil, gas, and mineral well-drilling operations. In July 2001, Nabors (then known as Pool Company Texas LTD) entered into a Master Service Agreement (MSA) whereby Nabors became an approved independent contractor for Chesapeake. The MSA included indemnification and other provisions allocating responsibilities and liabilities between the two companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-18\">On March 22, 2011, pursuant to the MSA, Nabors employee Billy Bridge was hauling a frac tank trailer between Shat-tuck, Oklahoma, and Leedey, Oklahoma. The trailer was leased from Great Plains to Chesapeake. Bridge inspected the trailer \u2014 including the tires \u2014 before beginning the approximately two-hour trip, and again when he stopped for a bite to eat. On both inspections, the tires looked to be in good condition and properly maintained. Yet when Bridge was halfway to his destination and traveling at about fifty-five miles per hour,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> both left rear tires on the trailer blew out in quick succession. The tank scraped the pavement, throwing off sparks that landed on dead grass and started a large fire. That fire caused significant property damage, and Nabors negotiated with the affected landowners settlements totaling $1.65 million and releasing from further liability both Nabors and Chesapeake.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-19\">Nabors filed this lawsuit in Texas state court in March 2013, and Chesapeake removed it to federal court on the ground of diversity jurisdiction. Chesapeake then unsuccessfully moved to transfer the action to the Western District of Oklahoma. Following discovery and the filing of cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants. This appeal timely followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard on appeal as that applied below.\u201d <em>Rogers v. Bromac Title Servs., L.L.C., </em>755 F.3d 347, 350 (5th Cir.2014). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). A genuine dispute as to a material fact exists if a reasonable jury could find for the nonmovant. <em>Rogers, </em>755 F.3d at 350. We may affirm on any ground raised below and supported by the record. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Nabors challenges the district court\u2019s summary judgment on its claims for (A) contractual indemnification and (B) contribution. We find no genuine dispute as to any material fact on either claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">The indemnity claim turns on Texas contract law, which directs us to \u201cpresume that the parties to a contract intend every clause to have some effect\u201d and \u201cgive terms their plain, ordinary, and generally accepted meaning unless the instrument shows that the parties used them in a technical or different sense.\u201d <em>Heritage Res., Inc. v. NationsBank, </em>939 S.W.2d 118, 121 (Tex.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">Nabors first contends that the district court erred when it interpreted Section 2.3 of the MSA, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-11\">[Nabors] agrees to visually inspect all materials and equipment furnished by [Chesapeake] directly employed in the course of operations conducted hereunder and shall notify [Chesapeake] of any apparent defects therein before using such materials and equipment. [Nabors] shall assume no liability related to any [Chesapeake] provided materials and services. [Nabors] shall not be liable for claims due solely to latent defects.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-13\">The district concluded that (1) the penultimate quoted sentence did not shift all liability from the underlying accident to Chesapeake, because the accident did not relate to Chesapeake-provided \u201cmaterials and services\u201d; and (2) under the last quoted sentence, Chesapeake would be liable to Nabors if the accident arose solely from \u201clatent defects\u201d in the tires; but (3) there was \u201cno evidence that a latent defect was the sole cause of the accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-14\">Nabors does not contest that the frac tank trailer and its tires are \u201cequipment\u201d (and not \u201cmaterials\u201d) within the meaning of the MSA. But Nabors urges that even though the penultimate sentence refers only to \u201cmaterials and services,\u201d it should be read to encompass \u201cequipment\u201d also, because \u201cthe entire Section 2.3 pertains to materials, equipment, and services.\u201d We disagree. Section 2.3 uses the words \u201cmaterials\u201d and \u201cequipment\u201d in three other sentences, and the heading encompassing the section refers separately to \u201cLABOR, EQUIPMENT, MATERIALS, SUPPLIES AND SERVICES.\u201d Yet the sentence at issue omits \u201cequipment.\u201d This omission appears deliberate. <em>See FPL Energy, LLC v. TXU Portfolio Mgmt. Co., </em>426 S.W.3d 59, 68 (Tex.2014) (\u201cWe will not, as TXUPM urges, selectively import terms from other provisions to compensate for the absence of the term \u2018energy'; rather, we conclude that the omission was intentional and deliberate.\u201d). And as the Supreme Court of Texas has explained, \u201ccourts will not rewrite agreements to insert provisions parties could have included or to imply restraints for which they have not bargained.\u201d <em>Tenneco Inc. v. Enter. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number><em>Prods. Co., </em>925 S.W.2d 640, 646 (Tex.1996). We therefore agree with the district court that Section 2.3 does not shift liability-related to \u201cequipment\u201d \u2014 including the frac tank trailer \u2014 to Chesapeake.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Next, Nabors contends that the district court overlooked a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the accident was caused solely by \u201clatent defects\u201d in the tires. The MSA does not define \u201clatent defects,\u201d and \u201c[w]hen words are not defined in a contract, [Texas courts] interpret them according to their plain and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Gray &amp; Co. Realtors, Inc. v. Atl. Hous. Found., Inc., </em>228 S.W.3d 431, 434 (Tex.App.2007). We thus construe this term as referring to \u201c[a] product imperfection that is not discoverable by reasonable inspection and for which a seller or lessor is generally liable if the flaw causes harm.\u201d <em>Latent Defect, </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (10th ed.2014); <em>see Gray, 228 </em>S.W.3d at 434 (looking to Black\u2019s Law Dictionary for the meaning of an undefined contract term).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">We agree with the district court that Nabors failed, to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the damages at issue were caused <em>solely </em>by a latent defect. Bridge, who was hauling the tank at the time of the incident, was unable to pinpoint a reason for the blowout; he testified that \u201csometimes blowouts just happen,\u201d even with \u201cbrand new tire[s],\u201d and that Nabors viewed the incident as an \u201cuncontrollable accident.\u201d Bridge further testified that the tires appeared properly maintained, that strong winds at the time of the incident resulted in \u201ca lot more weight on the left side of ... the trailer,\u201d and that the blowouts occurred when he \u201ccame down through a low spot\u201d on the highway. An expert retained by Nabors opined that the tires \u201chad bluing and wrinkling in the sidewalls\u201d attributable to \u201coverdeflection (either underinflation or over loading),\u201d and stated that \u201c[t]he exact cause of the failure of the tires was not known.\u201d That expert offered no opinion on when the bluing and wrinkling occurred, or on whether the accident was attributable to any latent or preexisting defect. Nabors appears to argue that this absence of evidence as to whether the tires were defective itself constitutes evidence that the blowout was caused solely by a latent defect, but we disagree: as the opponent of a properly supported summary-judgment motion, Nabors had the burden of \u201ceom[ing] forward with evidence to support the essential elements of its claim.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Emps. v. City Pub. Serv. Bd., </em>40 F.3d 698, 712 (5th Cir.1994). Because Nabors failed to do so, the district court properly determined that there was no triable issue as to Chesapeake\u2019s liability for damages \u201cdue solely to latent defects.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Finally, Nabors argues that aside from any latent defect, the district court overlooked evidence that Chesapeake\u2019s or Great Plains\u2019s negligence in maintaining the frac tank trailer caused the blowout, and that Defendants are therefore required to indemnify Nabors under Section 6.5 of the MSA. That section requires Chesapeake to \u201cprotect, defend, indemnify and hold harmless [Nabors] ... from and against all claims ... arising from the acts of [Chesapeake] in favor of third parties and persons not employed or contracted by [Nabors or Chesapeake] on account of ... damage to property.\u201d In support of this argument, Nabors points to evidence that (1) Great Plains was responsible for maintaining its equipment, (2) an inspection report completed two weeks after the left tires of the trailer blew out noted different issues with other tires on the right side of the trailer, and (3) another Great Plains trailer had a similar blowout incident months after the accident in suit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>We first note that the MSA does not mention Great Plains, that the operative complaint does not allege that Great Plains is a party to the MSA, and that Nabors cites no evidence for its implicit proposition that Section 6.5 imposes indemnification obligations on Great Plains or for Great Plains\u2019s conduct. But even assuming that Great Plains\u2019s conduct is relevant to Section 6.5 of the MSA, Nabors points to no evidence that, and articulates no theory for how, Great Plains\u2019s purported negligence caused the damage resulting from the March 22, 2011 fire \u2014 which predated all of the evidence on which Nabors relies. Thus, like Nabors\u2019s other contentions, its argument based on Section 6.5 of the MSA fails to show that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on its indemnity claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Nabors also argues that the district court erred in dismissing its claim for contribution, which Nabors contends is controlled by Oklahoma law because it hinges on tort principles that would have governed if the Oklahoma landowners whose property was damaged had filed lawsuits against Nabors and Chesapeake.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">But Defendants strongly argue that Nabors should be estopped from arguing that Oklahoma law applies to this claim. \u201cJudicial estoppel has three elements: (1) The party , against whom it is sought has asserted a legal position that is plainly inconsistent with a prior position; (2) a court accepted the prior position; and (3) the party did not act inadvertently.\u201d <em>Flugence v. Axis Surplus Ins. Co. (In re Flugence), </em>738 F.3d 126, 129 (5th Cir.2013). In opposition to Defendants\u2019 motion to transfer this action to a district court in Oklahoma, Nabors categorically stated that \u201cTexas law applies to this dispute\u201d and that the lawsuit should therefore stay in the Southern District of Texas with a court \u201cmore familiar with Texas law, which governs.\u201d Nabors also stressed that the \u201cunderlying tort\u201d was not at issue in this case. The district court then denied the transfer motion. Against this inconsistent and intentional prior legal position on a matter decided in its favor, Nabors provides no record citation for its reply argument that it \u201chas consistently asserted that its contractual claims are governed by Texas law ... and its contribution claims are governed by Oklahoma law.\u201d We thus conclude that Nabors is estopped from arguing that Oklahoma law should apply.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-12\">And Texas law is clear that Nabors\u2014 which settled all claims with the landowners before any judgment was entered against it \u2014 is not, under the comparative negligence statute it cites in the alternative,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> entitled to contribution. <em>See Int\u2019l Proteins Corp. v. Ralston-Purina Co., </em>744 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>S.W.2d 932, 934 (Tex.1988) (\u201cWe [have held] that a settling defendant did not have a right to contribution at common law, or under the comparative negligence statute_\u201d (citations omitted)); <em>Beech Aircraft Corp. v. Jinkins, </em>739 S.W.2d 19, 20-21 (Tex.1987) (holding that an adverse judgment is an \u201cessential prerequisite to contribution\u201d and rejecting a settling defendant\u2019s claim for contribution). Thus, the district court properly granted summary judgment on this claim as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">For the reasons stated, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b418-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm.

Bridge did not receive a traffic citation, and no party claims that he drove negligently or recklessly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b420-6\">. In its reply brief, Nabors asserts that, under Section 6.5 of the MSA, it is ''seeking indent-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>nity due to Chesapeake\u2019s act[s] of supplying Nabors with a trailer that had tires with latent defects and negligently maintaining the trailer.\" Nabors did not mention Chesapeake\u2019s conduct in its original brief's discussion of Section 6.5, and \"we do not consider arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief,\u201d <em>United States v. Transocean Deepwater Drilling, Inc., </em>767 F.3d 485, 492 (5th Cir.2014). Even if we were to consider this argument, Nabors\u2019s contentions based on a latent defect fail for the reasons explained above and Nabors points to no other evidence that Chesapeake \"negligently maintain[ed] the trailer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b421-14\">.
