We granted a certificate of appealability on the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-5\">(1) Whether the district court erred in concluding that Byrd\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition was barred by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\u2019s one-year statute of limitations, in light of the evidence that the state amended Byrd\u2019s sentence in June 2010; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-6\">(2) If so, whether the district court also erred in its alternative order, in which it sua sponte dismissed Byrd\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition, effectively with prejudice, based on his failure to exhaust his state court remedies prior to requiring a response from the state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">After thorough review, we affirm the dismissal of Byrd\u2019s petition as untimely.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>the dismissal of a federal habeas petition as time-barred under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). <em>Cole v. Warden, Ga. State Prison, </em>768 F.3d 1150, 1155 (11th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 1905, 191 L.Ed.2d 773 (2015). We are not bound to accept a respondent\u2019s concession on appeal. <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1306 n. 14 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-11\">The AEDPA establishes a one-year statute of limitations for federal habeas petitions filed by state prisoners, which runs from \u201cthe date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). The AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations begins to run when the judgment under which the petitioner is in custody, consisting of both the petitioner\u2019s conviction and sentence, is final. <em>Ferreira v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>494 F.3d 1286, 1293 (11th Cir.2007). Thus, when a petitioner is resentenced after the imposition of his original conviction and sentence, the AED-PA\u2019s statute of limitations runs from the date on which the newly imposed sentence becomes final. <em>See id. </em>at 1292-93. In <em>Ferreira, </em>the petitioner was originally convicted and sentenced in 1997, but was re-sentenced in 2003 after succeeding on a state post-conviction motion. <em>Id. </em>at 1288. We determined that Ferreira\u2019s judgment became final when he was resentenced in 2003 and that his \u00a7 2254 petition, filed shortly after his new sentence became final, thus was timely. <em>Id. </em>at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-14\">Under Georgia law, a sentencing court retains the inherent power to, at any time, correct clerical errors in a written sentence to reflect the court\u2019s intent at the time the sentence was imposed. <em>Griggs v. State, </em>314 Ga.App. 158, 723 S.E.2d 480, 481 (2012). This type of correction does not constitute a modification of the sentence, because it simply perfects the record. <em>Taylor v. State, </em>157 Ga.App. 212, 276 S.E.2d 691, 692 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-15\">Here, the district court did not err dismissing Byrd\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition as untimely. As the record shows, Byrd\u2019s judgment became final for purposes of the AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period in 2007, the limitations period expired in 2008, and he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>did not file his first state habeas petition until 2010. Thus, the one-year limitations period expired in 2008 <em>before </em>Byrd filed any motion that could toll the limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Moreover, the June 2, 2010 order amending his sentence was merely the correction of a clerical error in the original order that did not reset the limitations period. Indeed, the 2010 state court order lists \u201cAmended Sentence,\u201d \u201cModified Sentence,\u201d and \u201cRe-Sentencing\u201d as distinct options. It has the box for \u201cAmended Sentence\u201d checked and notes \u201cprevious sentence written as concurrent.\u201d The marking of the box for an amended sentence instead of a modified sentence or resentencing and the reference to the way in which the original sentence was written \u2014 rather than what was imposed \u2014 both show that the sentence amendment was akin to the correction of a clerical error to reflect the court\u2019s original intent that related back to the original sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Byrd\u2019s filings further suggest that the June 2010 amendment merely corrected a clerical error. In his \u00a7 2254 petition and response to the magistrate judge\u2019s order to show cause, Byrd said that he was sentenced to 25 years\u2019 imprisonment on October 15, 2007. Further, the \u201cSentence Computation Report\u201d Byrd submitted with .his response to the magistrate judge\u2019s order to show cause indicated that he was sentenced to consecutive 20 and 5 year sentences on October 15, 2007. If Byrd\u2019s October 15, 2007 sentence was 25 years\u2019 imprisonment, then the June 2, 2010 order amending his sentence to be consecutive 20- and 5-year sentences was not a substantive modification akin to a resentencing. <em>See Ferreira, </em>494 F.3d at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">Accordingly Byrd\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was untimely filed in October 2014. Because the district court did not err in dismissing Byrd\u2019s petition as untimely, it is unnecessary for us to reach the issue of whether his claims also were unexhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b906-12\">. In addition, Byrd\u2019s motion to supplement the record is hereby GRANTED IN PART as to the documents attached to his motion, namely, the Supreme Court of Georgia\u2019s order dismissing his first state habeas petition, the state court's June 2, 2010 final disposition order, and the state's answer and motion to dismiss his second state habeas petition, and DENIED IN PART as to the remaining documents referenced in his motion. The state\u2019s motion to supplement the record is hereby GRANTED.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
