UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, Defendant-Appellee.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b433-14\">No. 15-31010</docketnumber>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"AY3\">Summary Calendar.</p>\n<court data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b433-15\">United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b433-17\">May 13, 2016.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b433-18\">Stacy Michael Meaux, Abbeville, LA, pro se.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Before KING, CLEMENT, and OWEN, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b434-5\">PER CURIAM: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Pro se litigant Stacy Meaux appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his civil rights complaint, purportedly filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, for frivolity and failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Meaux\u2019s brief is convoluted and somewhat difficult to follow. He alleges that the \u201cFederal Government\u201d should be held responsible for a litany of alleged constitutional wrongs committed against him in the past twenty years by private individuals, corporations, and government agencies, including state, local, 'and federal authorities. Meaux claims that the Government has infringed his First, Second, Fourth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. We address first the claims and corresponding arguments that we are able to discern from Meaux\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">Like the district court, we read Meaux\u2019s brief to request, in part, that this court invalidate prior state court judgments, specifically, a settlement in a personal injury suit instituted by Meaux and a child custody judgment. Under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, this court lacks jurisdiction to entertain Meaux\u2019s collateral attacks on state judgments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-16\">Meaux also attacks the constitutionality of prior state criminal prosecutions and resulting convictions against him. Because Meaux\u2019s claims effectively challenge \u201cthe fact of his conviction,\u201d and thus \u201cfall within the \u2018core\u2019 of habeas corpus,\u201d they are not cognizable under \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-17\">The district court rejected Meaux\u2019s remaining claims as time-barred, explaining that Louisiana\u2019s one-year personal injury statute of limitations applies to \u00a7 1983 actions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court attempted to glean the dates of accrual underlying Meaux\u2019s claims from the pleadings, despite Meaux\u2019s failure to provide precise dates. While we think the district court was likely correct in its determination that Meaux\u2019s claims were untimely, we decline to engage in such an undertaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-18\">Regardless, Meaux has failed to comply with Rule 28 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, which requires that an appellant\u2019s brief set forth \u201cappellant\u2019s contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While we liberally construe pro se briefs, litigants are still required to reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>comply with the strictures of Rule 28.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Though Meaux purports to provide a table of authorities and statement of issues, his brief merely asserts causes of action untethered to legal authority or record support. Beyond his insistence that the \u201cFederal Government has direct responsibility for correcting [his] situation,\u201d Meaux has not identified the \u201cprecise relief sought.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, Meaux\u2019s brief is primarily a restatement of the facts presented to the district court; he has failed to identify error relating to the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claims.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Consequently, we consider Meaux\u2019s remaining claims to be abandoned.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b434-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
