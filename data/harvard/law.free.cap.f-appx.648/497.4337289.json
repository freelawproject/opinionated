He filed a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the Western District of Louisiana, where he currently is incarcerated. In his \u00a7 2241 petition, Freeman challenged the legality of his conviction in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rosemond v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 134 S.Ct. 1240, 188 L.Ed.2d 248 (2014). The district court construed the petition as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and dismissed it for want of jurisdiction. Freeman appeals the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">A prisoner may avoid the jurisdictional stricture of \u00a7 2255(a) if he demonstrates that no adequate or effective relief is attainable by motion under \u00a7 2255 and that relief under \u00a7 2241 is therefore proper. <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001); <em>see </em>\u00a7 2255(e). Unlike a \u00a7 2255 motion, a \u00a7 2241 petition must be filed \u201cin the district of the prisoner\u2019s incarceration.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 895 n. 3 (5th Cir.2001). However, \u201c\u00a7 2241 is not a mere substitute for \u00a7 2255[,] and ... the inadequacy or inefficacy requirement is stringent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 901; <em>see Christopher v. Miles, </em>342 F.3d 378, 382 (5th Cir.2003) (noting that \u00a7 2255(e) provides a narrow exception to the general rule and the applicant\u2019s burden of demonstrating \u00a7 2255\u2019s inadequacy is heavy).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-12\">The savings clause of \u00a7 2255 provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-13\">[a]n application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-14\">\u00a7 2255(e). A petitioner may file a \u00a7 2241 petition in accordance with \u00a7 2255(e) if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6J\">(1) the petition raises a claim that is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the claim was previously foreclosed by circuit law at the time when it should have been raised in petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion; and (3) that retroactively applicable decision establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-15\"><em>Garland v. Roy, </em>615 F.3d 391, 394 (5th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks, citation, and brackets omitted). \u201c[T]he core idea is that the petitioner may have been imprisoned for conduct that was not prohibited by law.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-16\">Here, we need not decide the issues of retroactivity and unavailability because there is no possibility that the jury convicted Freeman of a nonexistent offense. <em>See Christopher, </em>342 F.3d at 382-83 (assuming that the petitioner could satisfy the retro-activity and unavailability prongs and de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>nying relief on the third prong because the petitioner failed to demonstrate actual innocence). At trial, the evidence established that Freeman planned the robbery, recruited accomplices, coordinated the actions of his accomplices, and served as the getaway driver. <em>See Rosemond, </em>134 S.Ct. at 1249 (\u201cSo for purposes of aiding and abetting law, a person who actively participates in a criminal scheme knowing its extent and * character intends that scheme\u2019s commission.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Because Freeman cannot establish that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense, he is not entitled to relief under \u00a7 2241, and the district court correctly characterized Freeman\u2019s purported habeas petition as an unauthorized successive motion to vacate under \u00a7 2255. <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 453 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b522-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
