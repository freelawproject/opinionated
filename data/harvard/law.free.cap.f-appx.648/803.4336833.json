Because neither Chambers nor Cox violated clearly established law, we affirm the district court\u2019s .judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-19\">Sometime on March 19, 2013, Chambers received a call from Chris Zeigler, a lieutenant with the Elmore County Sheriffs Department. Zeigler, who was off-duty at the time, explained that he had received a call from'Amy Shumate, who said that she had just left the home of Jeremy Acre and his wife, Lindsay, and that the Acres \u201cwere potentially involved in a physical altercation at that time.\u201d Zeigler then relayed to Chambers that, about two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>weeks earlier, \u201che had completed an incident/offense report involving Jeremy and Lindsay Acre where Jeremy had allegedly strangled his wife and bound her with duct tape and ... threatened her with some type of weapon, I believe a handgun,\u201d but that Lindsay had \u201crefused to pursue criminal prosecution against [Jeremy]\u201d at that time. Zeigler said that he had been to the Acres\u2019 home on an earlier occasion to speak with Jeremy; that \u201cthis problem between the Acres had been going on for a couple of weeks\u201d; that there was \u201ca history of violence there, being domestic violence\u201d; and that \u201cMr. Acre did own a weapon also that was ... allegedly used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Zeigler asked Chambers to conduct a welfare check on the Acres. A welfare check is a routine police practice where officers \u201ccheck on someone\u2019s well-being.\u201d Because Jeremy was \u201chostile or very temperamental,\u201d Zeigler instructed Chambers to \u201ctake somebody with [him]\u201d when he checked on the Acres and \u201cto use extreme caution\u201d around Jeremy. After the call from Zeigler, Chambers phoned Cox and briefed him about what Zeigler had said. In particular, Chambers told Cox that Jeremy \u201chad been known to have a weapon,\u201d so that they should \u201cuse extreme caution\u201d during the visit.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">At around 10:54 p.m., the defendants arrived at the Acres\u2019 home, which was dark. They approached the front door, listened there, and, hearing nothing, knocked. When no one responded to their first knock, they knocked again.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">The parties dispute exactly what happened next. We resolve that dispute by adopting Lindsay\u2019s account of events \u2014 at least where it materially differs from the defendants\u2019 \u2014 since it was the deputies who prevailed at summary judgment. <em>See Tolan v. Cotton, </em>572 U.S. \u2014, 134 S.Ct. 1861, 1866, 188 L.Ed.2d 895 (2014). Lindsay heard the deputies knock and told Jeremy that she thought someone was at the door. Jeremy grabbed his gun and went to check. Just before he opened the door, the deputies heard a semi-automatic firearm being chambered with a round of ammunition. Chambers turned to Cox and said, \u201chey, that\u2019s a gun,\u201d then drew his own firearm and held it by his side. Jeremy opened the door in a manner Lindsay described as \u201cmore forceful[] than normal.\u201d When he saw the deputies, who were in uniform and clearly recognizable as law enforcement officers, he looked at Lindsay with what Chambers describes as \u201cthis enraged look on his face,\u201d and said, \u201cReally?\u201d Lindsay insisted to him that she had not called the sheriff. Chambers says she \u201ccowered down to [Jeremy]\u201d when she told him that. Jeremy never asked or expressed any uncertainty about why the deputies were there.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-10\">The deputies noticed that Jeremy, who was \u201cobviously angry\u201d and \u201cagitated,\u201d was holding a gun, and Chambers, \u201cfear[ing] for [his own] safety as well as [his] partner\u2019s safety,\u201d told Jeremy to put it down. Jeremy refused, insisting that \u201cit was his home and he had every right to hold his gun.\u201d After repeatedly instructing Jeremy to put his gun down, Chambers pointed his gun at Jeremy and ordered him to put it down. Jeremy continued to refuse, his voice becoming louder and louder. Eventually, Cox told Chambers \u201cthat he was going to tase [Jeremy],\u201d at which point Jeremy tried to shut the door on the deputies. Chambers, however, managed to put his foot in the door before Jeremy could shut it. He then pushed the door open to \u201cmake sure that [Jeremy] wasn\u2019t fixing to try to shoot me through the door or cause harm to [Lindsay].\u201d A few seconds after the deputies entered the Acres\u2019 home,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>Jeremy \u201caggressively ... rush[ed]\u201d them, \u201craising [his] weapon in a threatening manner\u201d that led Chambers to believe Jeremy was \u201cfixing to, you know, shoot [him] or Deputy Cox or both.\u201d Sensing \u201cthat [his] life as well as [his] partner\u2019s life was in danger,\u201d Chambers fired his weapon, killing Jeremy before he could reach either deputy. Lindsay and Morris, the representative of Jeremy\u2019s estate, brought \u00a7 1983 claims against Chambers and Cox, alleging two Fourth Amendment violations: (1) unlawfully entering the Acres\u2019 home; and (2) using excessive force against Jeremy. The district court granted summary judgment to the deputies on the ground that qualified immunity shielded them from the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">It is undisputed that Chambers and Cox were acting within them discretionary authority at all times relevant to this case, and they are therefore entitled to qualified immunity unless their conduct violated clearly established law. <em>See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). The \u201cdispositive inquiry\u201d for purposes of deciding whether official conduct violated clearly established law \u201cis whether it would have been clear to a reasonable officer in the [deputies\u2019] position that their conduct was unlawful in the situation they confronted.\u201d <em>Wood v. Moss, </em>572 U.S. \u2014, 134 S.Ct. 2056, 2067, 188 L.Ed.2d 1039 (2014) (alterations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">The deputies did not violate clearly established law when they entered the Acres\u2019 home because the law allows law enforcement personnel to enter a home without a warrant when exigent eircum-stances call for it. <em>See Brigham City v. Stuart, </em>547 U.S. 398, 403, 126 S.Ct. 1943, 1948, 164 L.Ed.2d 650 (2006). \u201cOne exigency obviating the requirement of a warrant is the need to assist persons who are seriously injured <em>or threatened mth such injury.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). Under the circumstances and based on Zeigler\u2019s report to them, the deputies reasonably concluded that there was an imminent threat of domestic violence. As the Supreme Court has explained, \u201cso long as they have good reason to believe such a threat exists, it would be silly to suggest that the police\u201d could not enter a home \u201cto determine whether violence (or threat of violence) has just occurred or is about to (or soon will) occur.\u201d <em>Georgia v. Randolph, </em>547 U.S. 103, 118, 126 S.Ct. 1515, 1525, 164 L.Ed.2d 208 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">That is exactly what the deputies did here. They had a report that Jeremy was \u201cpossibly engaged in a domestic violence type of situation\u201d with Lindsay and that he had violently attacked her in the past. When they encountered Jeremy on the night of the shooting, he was visibly \u201cenraged,\u201d refused to put down his loaded gun despite the deputies\u2019 repeated commands that he do so, and accused Lindsay of calling the cops. They saw Lindsay cowering and heard her insist to Jeremy that she hadn\u2019t called anyone. And so, when Jeremy tried to lock himself in his home with Lindsay, the deputies reasonably feared for Lindsay\u2019s safety (as well as their own). Based on those circumstances, viewed in their totality, a reasonable officer in the deputies\u2019 position could have believed that violence was imminent, so that exigent circumstances warranted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>deputies\u2019 entering the Acres home to protect Lindsay (and themselves) from Jeremy.</p>\n<p id=\"A5t\">The plaintiffs also contend that the use of deadly force against Jeremy violated his Fourth Amendment rights. We have explained that \u201c[a]ny use of force must be reasonable,\u201d and that \u201c[rjeason-ableness is dependent on all the circumstances that are relevant to the officer\u2019s decision to use deadly force, including ... whether the suspect poses an immediate danger to the officer or others ... and the feasibility of providing a warning before employing deadly force.\u201d <em>Jean-Baptiste v. Gutierrez, </em>627 F.3d 816, 821 (11th Cir.2010). The use of deadly force \u201cis judged objectively, and [the deputies are] shielded from liability unless application of that standard would inevitably lead every reasonable officer in [their] position to conclude the force was unlawful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alterations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"Axi1\">The officers had a reasonable belief that there was an imminent threat of domestic violence when they entered the Acres\u2019 home. Jeremy had refused to put down his firearm after repeated instructions to do so, and he continued to refuse to put it down even after Chambers pointed his service weapon at him and ordered him to do so. After the deputies entered the home, Jeremy came toward them threateningly with a loaded firearm in his hand, and only at that point did Deputy Chambers discharge his firearm. Under those circumstances, our binding precedent dictates that the use of deadly force did not violate clearly established law. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 821-22; <em>Garczynski v. Bradshaw, </em>573 F.3d 1158, 1168 (11th Cir.2009); <em>Robinson v. Arrugueta, </em>415 F.3d 1252, 1256 (11th Cir.2005); <em>Kesinger ex rel. Estate of Kesinger v. Herrington, </em>381 F.3d 1243, 1249 (11th Cir.2004); <em>Carr v. Tatangelo, </em>338 F.3d 1259, 1269 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Montoute v. Carr, </em>114 F.3d 181, 185 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b829-8\">. What happened in those few seconds is disputed. The deputies say they tased Jeremy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>and he briefly fell to the floor, then got up. The plaintiffs argue that data from the taser shows it was not fired until about nine minutes after the deputies reported that shots had been fired. That sequence of events is immaterial to the outcome here because the plaintiffs\u2019 excessive force claims are predicated on the deputies\u2019 use of deadly force against Jeremy, not their use of the taser.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
