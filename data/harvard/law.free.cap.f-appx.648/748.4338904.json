On appeal, Shchupak, who was found to be deportable and who is not concurrently applying for adjustment of status, argues that the immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) violated his equal protection rights by determining, that he is ineligible for waiver under INA \u00a7 212(h). After thorough review, we deny Shchupak\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-14\">When the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s order as the final agency decision. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2005). Although we lack jurisdiction to review a decision of the Attorney General to grant or deny a waiver under INA \u00a7 212(h), we have jurisdiction to review the legal question of whether the petitioner is statutorily eligible to apply for a \u00a7 212(h) waiver. <em>Lanier v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>631 F.3d 1363, 1365 n. 2 (11th Cir.2011). We review the BIA\u2019s statutory interpretation <em>de novo, </em>\u201cbut will defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of a statute if it is reasonable and does not contradict the clear intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Jaggernauth v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>432 F.3d 1346, 1350 (11th Cir.2005). Constitutional challenges are reviewed <em>de novo. Lapaix v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 1138, 1143 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-15\">Section 212(h) provides that the Attorney General, in her discretion, may waive an alien\u2019s inadmissibility from having certain criminal convictions if the petitioner demonstrates that his \u201cdenial of admission would result in extreme hardship\u201d to a United States citizen family member, and the Attorney General has \u201cconsented to the alien\u2019s applying or reapplying for a visa, for admission to the United States, or adjustment of status.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h). \u201c[Fjederal classifications such as those at issue in \u00a7 212 of the [INA] are subject to minimal scrutiny under the rational basis standard of review, and are valid if not arbitrary or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Poveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>692 F.3d 1168, 1172 (11th Cir.2012) (quotation omitted). Under the rational basis standard, the alien bears the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>burden of establishing that the government regulation is arbitrary or unreasonable, and not rationally related to the government\u2019s purpose. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Previously, we held that the BIA\u2019s prior interpretation of \u00a7 212(h), which permitted the waiver for .deportable (as opposed to inadmissible) aliens only if the deportable alien could apply for adjustment of status or had departed and returned to the United States after their criminal conviction, was unconstitutional as a violation of equal protection. <em>Yeung v. INS, </em>76 F.3d 337, 338-41 (11th Cir.1995). However, \u201c[i]n the wake of <em>Yeung, </em>the Board has \u2018abandoned\u2019 its previous position.\u201d <em>Poveda, </em>692 F.3d at 1173. Currently, the BIA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaB\">interprets section 212(h) to provide that the Attorney General may grant a waiver in two situations: first, the Attorney General may provide a waiver to an alien at the border who seeks admission, including an alien who has departed the United States after committing a de-portable offense, so long as the alien remains outside our borders while applying for relief; and second, the Attorney General may provide a waiver to an alien within our borders after his conviction for a deportable offense so long as he applies for an adjustment of status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7T\"><em>Id. </em>Thus, \u201can alien who remains within the United States must apply for adjustment of status to obtain a waiver under section 212(h).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1173-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">In <em>Poveda, </em>we held that the BIA\u2019s current interpretation of INA \u00a7 212(h) is reasonable and thus entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference. <em>Id. </em>at 1176; <em>see Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 865, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984) (holding that where Congress has not unambiguously spoken in a statute on an issue, the statutory interpretation by the agency entitled to administer it is entitled deference so long as the interpretation is reasonable). We noted that the true distinction between those eligible and ineligible for the \u00a7 212(h) waiver \u201cis not \u2018lack of international travel,\u2019\u201d but rather between \u201cthose criminal aliens who seek to be admitted to the United States, and those criminal aliens who are being deported from the United States.\u201d <em>Poveda, </em>692 F.3d at 1177 (quotations and emphasis omitted). We further held that there are multiple rational bases for distinguishing between aliens who are inadmissible and aliens who are deportable. <em>Id. </em>at 1176-78; <em>see also Rivas v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>765 F.3d 1324, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2014) (dealing with the availability of nunc pro tunc waivers to deportable aliens who left and reentered the United States).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">Here, the IJ did not err in denying Shchupak\u2019s application for a \u00a7 212(h) waiver. Shchupak is not eligible for relief because he is a deportable alien in the United States and did not concurrently file an application for adjustment of status. <em>See Poveda, </em>692 F.3d at 1173-74. Further, Shchupak\u2019s reliance on <em>Yeung </em>is unavailing, because this Court has since held that the BIA\u2019s current interpretation of \u00a7 212(h) is reasonable. <em>See Poveda, </em>692 F.3d at 1173, 1176-78. Moreover, <em>Poveda </em>held that the distinction between deporta-ble and inadmissible aliens has a rational basis, and that holding has not been overruled or undermined to the point of abrogation. <em>See United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2008) (Under the prior panel precedent rule, subsequent panels are bound by the holding of a prior panel \u201cunless and until it is overruled or undermined to the point of abrogation by the Supreme Court or by this court sitting en banc.\u201d). Thus, Shchupak\u2019s argument is foreclosed by our prior precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
