He contends that the district court erred when it denied his motion without considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">In 2011 Gonzalez-Mendiola pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute five kilograms or more of a mixture containing cocaine and 500 grams or more of a mixture containing methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A)(ii), (vii), and 846. That offense carries a statutory minimum sentence of 10 years. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). At the sentence hearing, the district court calculated his base offense level at 34 based on the drug quantity table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(a)(5), (c)(3) (2010), and after the application of several adjustments, it assigned him a total offense level of 33. With his criminal history category of I, Gonzalez-Mendiola\u2019s advisory guidelines range was 135 to 168 months. The district court sentenced him to 135 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">After Gonzalez-Mendiola was sentenced, the government moved for a reduction in his sentence based on the substantial assistance he had provided to the government. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) (\u201cUpon motion of the [government, the court shall have the authority to impose a sentence below a level established by statute as a minimum sentence so as to reflect a defendant\u2019s substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person ... \u201d); Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b)(1) (\u201cUpon the government\u2019s motion ... the court may reduce a sentence if the defendant, after sentencing, provided substantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person.\u201d). The district court granted that motion and reduced his sentence to 100 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">In 2015 Gonzalez-Mendiola filed a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence, arguing that Amendment 782, which retroactively amended \u00a7 2D1.1, had lowered his offense level to 31 and his advisory guidelines range to 108 to 135 months. He asserted that the court could reduce his sentence below that range because he had previously received a below-guidelines sentence based on substantial assistance. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(B) (\u201cIf the term of imprisonment imposed was less than the term of imprisonment provided by the guideline range ... pursuant to a government motion to reflect the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance to authorities, a reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range ... may be appropriate.\u201d). The government did not oppose Gonzalez-Mendiola\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-11\">The district court denied the motion. It agreed that Amendment 782 had reduced Gonzalez-Mendiola\u2019s advisory guidelines range, but noted that his 100-month sentence already fell below that amended range. The court stated that it had already considered \u201call substantial assistance credit\u201d and had determined that \u201cno further comparable substantial assistance departure shall be applied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-12\">On appeal Gonzalez-Mendiola contends that the district court erred when it denied his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion without considering the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He also argues that the district court applied the \u201cwrong legal standard\u201d in deciding whether to reduce his sentence because it considered his previous sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>tence reduction instead of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to reduce a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009). We have held that the district court \u201cmust engage in a two-part analysis\u201d when making that decision. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). . First, the court must recalculate the defendant\u2019s sentence under the amended guidelines. <em>See id. </em>at 780-81. Second, it must decide whether and to what extent to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence \u2014 a decision that \u201cshould be made in light of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 781; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. 1(B)(i). \u201cThe district court is not required to articulate the applicability of each factor, as long as the record as a whole demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1256 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">As far as we can tell from the record, the district court performed the first part of this analysis. However, the district court\u2019s order does not mention the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and neither does Gonzalez-Mendiola\u2019s motion. No in-person hearing was held on the motion at which Gonzalez-Mendiola could have objected to the district court\u2019s failure to consider those factors. Without any indication that the district court weighed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we will vacate his sentence and remand so that we can be assured that the district court considers them. <em>See Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1257; <em>United States v. Douglas, </em>576 F.3d 1216, 1220 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201c[I]f it is not possible to determine from the record whether the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we must vacate and remand the case to the district court.\u201d). We emphasize, however, that although the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors on remand, \u201cits decision whether to reduce [Gonzalez-Mendiola\u2019s] sentence, and to what extent, remains discretionary.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1257 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
