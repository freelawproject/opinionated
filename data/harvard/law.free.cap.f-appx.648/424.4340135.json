Liberally construing his <em>pro se </em>brief, <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993), he contends the court erred by failing to: adequately explain its decision; allow him to respond to new information provided to the court before his sentencing hearing (an Amendment 782 worksheet prepared by the probation officer and provided, <em>inter alia, </em>to Marlin); consider his post-sentencing conduct; and avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, thereby fulfilling the goals of Amendment 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-20\">Section 3582(c)(2) grants a court the discretion to modify a defendant\u2019s sentence if he \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission\u201d. Once a reduction is authorized, the court determines whether it is warranted based on consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and \u201cthe danger to any person or the community that may be posed by a reduction\u201d. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(B)(i)-(ii). It also \u201cmay consider\u201d the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(B)(iii). Therefore, the court\u2019s decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion; its interpretation of the guidelines, <em>de novo; </em>and its findings of fact, for clear error. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-21\">Marlin\u2019s' assertions are refuted by the record and foreclosed by precedent. A district court is not required to explain its \u00a7 3582-motion denial. <em>See id. </em>at 672-73. Nonetheless, the record shows the court expressly considered Marlin\u2019s motion as a whole, the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and his post-sentencing conduct. Additionally, the record demonstrates Marlin had the opportunity to respond to the Amendment 782 worksheet before sentencing because the court ordered his being able to do so, and he addressed the worksheet in responding to the Government\u2019s motion opposing his sentence reduction. Finally, the assertion the denial of the sentence reduction creates unwarranted sentencing disparities is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>595 F.3d 1322, 1323 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"ADz\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b448-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
