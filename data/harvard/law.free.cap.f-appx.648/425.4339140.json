Wade contends that he should be permitted to raise a claim based on <em>Burrage v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 134 S.Ct. 881, 187 L.Ed.2d 715 (2014), under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Wade has not carried his burden of showing that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate and ineffective to test the legality of his detention. <em>See Garland v. Roy, </em>615 F.3d 391, 394 (5th Cir.2010). The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AX-\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
