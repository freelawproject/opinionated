Chapter 12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b198-19\">OPINION<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"Axa\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b198-20\">Andrew Allam, Sr. appeals from an order of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, which dismissed his complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. We will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-21\">In her Report and Recommendations (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d), the Magistrate Judge noted that Allam\u2019s claims (both .those in his original complaint and those in his proposed amended complaint) were barred by the two-year statute of limitations for civil rights violations. Allam filed objections to the R &amp; R claiming, among other things, that the Court should use the \u201cresidual\u201d statute of limitations. The District Court adopted the R &amp; R and dismissed the complaint, finding Allam\u2019s objections to be without merit. Allam timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-22\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we exercise plenary review of a district court decision dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>Roman v. Jeffes, </em>904 F.2d 192, 194 (3d Cir.1990); <em>Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000). A complaint fails to state a claim if, accepting all well-pled factual alle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>gations as true, the allegations do not \u201cplausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.\u201d <em>Bistrian v. Levi, </em>696 F.3d 352, 365 (3d Cir.2012) (quoting <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 679, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">We agree with the District Court that it is apparent from Allam\u2019s complaint (and his proposed amended complaint) that his claims are time-barred. The incidents in his complaint occurred in 2009 and 2010, but he did not file his complaint until December of 2014. The District Court properly held that a two-year period of limitations applies to Allam\u2019s claims that his civil rights were violated when his children were removed from his home, <em>see Kach v. Hose, </em>589 F.3d 626, 634 (3d Cir.2009) (two-year period of limitations applies for \u00a7 1983 action arising in Pennsylvania), and we agree that amendment would be futile.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. Al-lam\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b198-24\">. This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"ALO\">. While a district court generally must give the plaintiff an opportunity to amend a complaint before dismissing it for failure to state a claim, opportunity to amend is not required if, as here, amendment would be futile. <em>See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 108 (3d Cir.2002). In his objections, Allam argued that the violation of his rights continued until March 6, 2012, when his children were adopted. But even that date is beyond the period of limitations. And Allam does not in any way challenge the untimeliness determination in his argument in support of appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
