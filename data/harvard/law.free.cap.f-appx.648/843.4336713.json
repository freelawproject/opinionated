Williams\u2019s Sentencing Guidelines range was 46 to 57 months in prison, with a statutory maximum of 120 months. Williams argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. We affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">On May 11, 2015, Williams pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). Williams\u2019s Sentencing Guidelines range for this , offense was 46 to 57 months. At the sentence hearing on July 22, 2015, both defense counsel and the government asked for a sentence within the guidelines range. Williams then told the court that he took full responsibility for his crime. He also noted that he had a four-year-old daughter and asked for leniency.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">The court sentenced Williams to 69 months in prison. The judge justified this upward departure by explaining that the guidelines range \u201csubstantially underre-presents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history and the likelihood that he will commit other crimes.\u201d This criminal history, the court continued, included several juvenile convictions. By age 15, Williams had three juvenil\u00e9 delinquency convictions for home burglaries. Then, when Williams was 16, he fled from police in a car that he eventually crashed into a cemetery fence. Williams was found with a firearm when arrested for that incident. By age 18, Williams had two more felony convictions, one for theft and the other for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">The judge further noted that \u201cthe nature of the defendant\u2019s previous convictions are such that he narrowly, narrowly missed qualifying as an armed career criminal, which would have required, under the present system of sentencing, a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence.\u201d The judge added that he was \u201ctroubled by the firearms violations associated with this case\u201d because \u201cthe evidence supports the conclusions that Mr. Williams shot at an individual with a firearm on two separate occasions during September 2014 and that one of his victims was shot multiple times.\u201d The judge concluded: \u201cThe defendant has demonstrated an alarming disregard for the safety of his own life and for life of others by his actions. For all of these reasons, the Court has imposed a sentence above the advisory guideline range.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">Our review of a criminal sentence is for \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d based on \u201cthe totality of the facts and circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1188-89 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion when it (1) fails to afford consideration to relevant factors that were due significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor, or (3) commits a clear error of judgment in considering the proper factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1189 (quotation omitted). When a sentence exceeds the guidelines range, we \u201cmust consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Even then, \u201cwe are to vacate the sentence ... only if [ ] we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190 (quotation omitted). The party challenging the sentence \u201cbears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006) (alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>Williams has not shown that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. Williams suggests that the judge should not have considered his juvenile delinquency convictions in addition to his adult convictions as a basis to increase his sentence. He notes that the \u201cSentencing Commission has specifically decided to limit the relevance of juvenile adjudications at sentencing out of a concern for disparate treatment of individuals.\u201d Williams is correct that the Sentencing Guidelines do not factor certain juvenile adjudications into the defendant\u2019s criminal history score \u201cdue to the differential availability of [juvenile] records.\u201d <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4A1.2 n. 7. But the guidelines do not forbid a judge from counting juvenile conduct when considering \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Also, this Court has upheld upward variances in light of a defendant\u2019s numerous juvenile adjudications, as well charges that were not pursued. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1232-35, 1239-40 (11th Cir.2009). The defendant in <em>Shaw </em>received a 120-month sentence (the statutory maximum for his crime) even though he had a Sentencing Guidelines range of 30 to 37 months. <em>Id. </em>at 1240. We held that this sentence was reasonable given the defendant\u2019s lengthy juvenile and adult criminal history. <em>See id. </em>at 1241; <em>see also United States v. Williams, </em>989 F.2d 1137, 1141 (11th Cir.1993) (\u201c[W]e hold that the district court properly considered Williams\u2019s remote juvenile sentences in deciding whether to depart upward from the guidelines range.... Ignoring this serious criminal conduct would serve merely to obscure his serious history of criminality and the likelihood that he would commit crimes in the future.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">Williams also suggests that the district court improperly considered that, in the judge\u2019s words, Williams \u201cnarrowly, narrowly missed\u201d the Armed Career Criminal Act\u2019s (ACCA) mandatory minimum 15-year sentence given \u201cthe nature of [his] previous convictions.\u201d Williams argues that the fact that he did not have enough ACCA predicates \u201cweighs in favor of not sentencing him as though he had the [predicates] necessary to trigger the statute.\u201d To be clear, Williams\u2019s 69-month sentence was nearly ten years below ACCA\u2019s mandatory minimum. As for Williams\u2019s single ACCA-eligible offense, a district court may consider prior offenses under the \u00a7 3553(a) factors even if the \u201cprevious offenses were included in [the defendant\u2019s] criminal history and were therefore part, of the calculation of his guideline range.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322-24 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). All of Williams\u2019s previous criminal conduct \u201cfits squarely into one of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the history and characteristics of the offender, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), and was therefore a proper basis for the court\u2019s consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1323.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">Given Williams\u2019s history and the fact that he was being sentenced for possessing a firearm after shooting two people just a few months earlier, Williams has not shown that the sentencing judge made a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. His sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
