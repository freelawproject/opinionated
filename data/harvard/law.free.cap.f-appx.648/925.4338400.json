In 2004, Calvert filed a Title VII race discrimination claim against the county, his employer at the time. After his 2004 lawsuit settled, Calvert applied approximately 26 times for county positions but only received an interview for a juvenile court clerk position in 2011. According to the Panel Selection Recommendation Form,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Calvert was ranked fourth out of all the candidates and recommended for hire. However, he did not receive an offer, even though four candidates ranked below him did.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-15\">On appeal, Calvert first argues that the district court erred in excluding as inadmissible hearsay what Calvert characterizes as direct evidence of retaliation\u2014 namely statements by the juvenile court\u2019s human resources coordinator Kinsheka Smith that Calvert\u2019s job application was blocked because of his prior Title VII lawsuit against the county. Second, Calvert argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the county because he presented circumstantial evidence that created a triable issue of fact under the convincing mosaic theory of <em>Smith v. Lockheed-Martin Corp., </em>644 F.3d 1321, 1328 (11th Cir.2011).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After careful review, we vacate and remand because Calvert has established a triable issue of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">Calvert seeks to rely on statements by Smith as evidence of retaliation. Calvert testified that in August or September of 2011, he saw Smith at a meeting. Smith told him that he did well in the interview, but his \u201cemployment was blocked from up the street ... because of the previous lawsuit that [he] had filed.\u201d According to Calvert, Smith explained that someone \u201ceither up the street or in her department\u201d read an article about his previous lawsuit, and his job placement \u201cwas blocked from up the street.\u201d Calvert started to \u201cpush a little bit\u201d to find out who blocked his employment, but Smith did not answer. Lewis Pittman, a friend of Calvert\u2019s who worked in the juvenile court and was on the selection panel, also testified that Smith told him \u201csomebody up the street\u201d did not want to hire Calvert because of the lawsuit: The district court excluded these statements as inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings at the summary judgment stage for abuse of discretion. <em>City of Tuscaloosa v. Harcros Chemicals, Inc., </em>158 F.3d 548, 556 (11th Cir.1998). \u201c[T]he abuse of discretion standard of review recognizes that ... there is a range of choice for the district court and so long as its decision does not amount to a clear error of judgment we will not reverse even if we would have gone the other way had the choice been ours to make.\u201d <em>McMahan v. Toto, </em>256 F.3d 1120, 1128 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">A court cannot consider inadmissible hearsay when ruling on a summary judgment motion. <em>Macuba v. Deboer, </em>193 F.3d 1316, 1322 (11th Cir.1999); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)(4) (\u201cAn affidavit or declaration-used to support or oppose a [summary judgement] motion must be made on personal knowledge [and] set out facts that would be admissible in evidence.\u201d). Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, hearsay is a statement \u201c(1) the declarant does not make while testifying at the current trial or hearing; and (2) a party offers in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 801(c). Hearsay is generally inadmissible with a few exceptions. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-9\">Calvert first argues that Smith\u2019s statements are admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(D), which excepts from the definition of hearsay a statement used against a party that was \u201cmade by the party\u2019s agent or employee on a matter within the scope of that relationship and while it existed.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(D). Courts have admitted employee statements under Rule 801(d)(2)(D) \u201cwhere there is sqme evidence that the statements reflected some kind of participation in the employment decision or policy of the employer.\u201d <em>Rowell v. BellSouth Corp., </em>433 F.3d 794, 800 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">In <em>Rowell, </em>the plaintiff claimed he was forced to retire because of his age during a reduction in force. <em>Id. </em>at 795. At summary judgment, the plaintiff tried to rely on testimony by a co-worker that the coworker\u2019s supervisor said the company preferred to \u201ckeep the youth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 800. We concluded that the testimony was not admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(D) because there was no evidence that the supervisor was involved in the decision to make the reduction in force or that he \u201chad received any information\u201d from upper management that indicated age was a factor. <em>Id. </em>at 801. The manager\u2019s statement was \u201cin reality nothing but the inadmissible opinion of\u2019 a non-decisionmaker. <em>Id. </em>at 800.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">In <em>Kidd v. Mando American Corp., </em>731 F.3d 1196 (11th Cir.2013), we \u201cma[de] clear that <em>Rowell </em>did not hold ... that a non-decisionmaker can <em>never </em>be considered an agent under Rule 801(d)(2)(D).\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 1209 (emphasis added). A \u201cstatement made by a non-decisionmaker may be both relevant and attributable to the defendant employer if the non-decision-maker was sufficiently involved in the deci-sionmaking process leading up to the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1208 n. 16. However, we suggested in <em>Kidd </em>that if an employee\u2019s role in the adverse decision is \u201clargely ministerial,\u201d then Rule 801(d)(2)(D) does not make that employee\u2019s statements admissible. <em>Id. </em>at 1210. We used \u201cthe gathering of resumes submitted ... for management to review\u201d as an example of a ministerial role. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Smith\u2019s statements are not admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(D). The evidence does not show that Smith\u2019s duties rose above a ministerial role in the decisionmaking process. Smith\u2019s duties consisted of scheduling interviews, answering questions, and being the designated contact person for acceptances. Smith also selected interview questions, helped average applicant scores, and submitted the Panel Selection Recommendation Form to the final decisionmaker, the Juvenile Court\u2019s Chief Administrative Officer Omotayo Alii. However, there is no evidence that Smith was \u201cconsulted by ... management\u201d or \u201cotherwise included in the decisionmaking process.\u201d <em>See Kidd, </em>731 F.3d at 1210. The record does not support the conclusion that Smith was sufficiently involved in communications between Alii and anyone \u201cup the street\u201d who had, authority to block Calvert\u2019s candidacy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">Calvert next claims that Smith\u2019s statements are admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(C), which excludes from the definition of hearsay opposing party statements which were \u201cmade by a person whom the party authorized to make a statement on the subject.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(C). Although there is evidence that Smith had the authority to answer questions regarding the interviewing process, there was no evidence that she was authorized to make statements to candidates regarding the actual reasons they were not hired.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">Since neither Rule 801(d)(2)(C) nor Rule 801(d)(2)(D) applies, the district court did not abuse its discretion, in sustaining the county\u2019s objection to the admissibility of testimony about Smith\u2019s alleged statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">We review a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment <em>de novo. Zaben v. Air Products &amp; Chemicals, Inc., </em>129 F.3d 1453, 1455 (11th Cir.1997) (per curiam). Summary judgment is appropriate when, making all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue of material fact. <em>Id.; see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">When analyzing a retaliation claim based on circumstantial evidence, we usually employ the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>analytical framework. <em>Bryant v. Jones, </em>575 F.3d 1281, 1307 (11th Cir.2009). Under this framework, a plaintiff must first establish a <em>prima facie </em>case by showing that (1) he engaged in an activity protected under Ti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>tle VII, (2) he suffered ah adverse employment action, and (3) there is a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action. <em>Brown v. Ala. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>597 F.3d 1160, 1181 (11th Cir.2010). Once a plaintiff establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation, the burden of production shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. <em>Bryant, </em>575 F.3d at 1308. If the defendant carries this burden, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the proffered reason was merely a pretext to mask retaliatory actions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">However, the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework \u201cis not the <em>sine qua non </em>for a plaintiff to survive summary judgment in a discrimination case.\u201d <em>Sims v. MVM, Inc., </em>704 F.3d 1327, 1333 (11th Cir.2013). \u201c[A] plaintiff will always survive summary judgment if he presents circumstantial evidence that creates a triable issue concerning the employer\u2019s discriminatory intent.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>644 F.3d at 1328. <em>\u201cA </em>triable issue of fact exists if the record, viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, presents a convincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence that would allow a jury to infer intentional discrimination by the decision-maker.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">Calvert has established \u201ca convincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence\u201d that would permit a jury to infer that the county retaliated against him because of his previous lawsuit. The record shows that Smith sent Alii an email between Calvert\u2019s interview and the sending out of offers. The email informed Alii that Calvert had been fired by the county before, which was the event that led to his prior Title VII lawsuit. Alii forwarded this email to the Juvenile Court Chief Judge with a notation that she would call.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">Alii testified that she did not remember any such call, and that she decided not to hire Calvert because he kept calling Smith and another employee and demanding to be hired based on his ranking from the court\u2019s internal scoring of the interviews, which he had somehow learned. However, this explanation is contradicted by Smith\u2019s testimony that Calvert called to ask about how he scored and Calvert\u2019s voicemail, left either July 11, 2011 or August 31, 2011, in which he asked if the county had completed its scoring yet. Calvert\u2019s voicemail established that he did not know if scoring had occurred as of July 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">Further, Alii stated that Calvert\u2019s demands to be hired came \u201c[a]fter the interview process but before the selection or consideration of any candidates.\u201d The timeline of events contradicts this explanation. The offer letters to the first five candidates selected were sent by July 5. However, Calvert did not leave the voice-mail inquiring about scores until, at the earliest, July 11. These discrepancies create material issues of fact that preclude summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">In addition to this evidence, there was an unexplained asterisk and the word \u201cskip\u201d written next to Calvert\u2019s name on the interview score sheet and recommendation form. Smith admitted she wrote the word \u201cskip\u201d next to Calvert\u2019s name on the score sheet, but claimed she did not remember why she wrote it. However, Smith also testified she was not the one who decided to \u201cskip\u201d Calvert; according to her, she did not \u201cmake the final decisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">This evidence, combined with the fact that Calvert was not hired despite scoring within the top four candidates, creates a triable issue concerning the county\u2019s discriminatory intent. <em>See id. </em>at 1328. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>therefore vacate the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b950-10\">. The panel members combined their scores for the top five applicants on this form and then ranked the applicants according to score.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b950-11\">. Calvert also argues that the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment violated his Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial, but we do not address that issue because he raised it for the first time on appeal. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. </em>Sw. <em>Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b952-5\">. We recognize that Smith sent Alii an email on June 27, 2011, between the interviews and the sending out of offers explaining that Calvert had been involuntarily terminated by the county (the event that led to Iris prior lawsuit). Alii then forwarded this information to her boss, the Juvenile Court Chief Judge, with a note that Alii would call the judge later. This email is important circumstantial evidence, as explained below, However, it does not show that Smith was involved in the alleged blocking as an agent of the county. It was Alii who forwarded the information and who said she would call the judge later. Smith does not appear to be involved beyond giving information to Alii.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
