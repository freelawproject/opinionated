He seeks our review of a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denying his request to reopen his removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">We review for abuse-of-discretion under a highly deferential standard. <em>Barrios-Cantarero v. Holder, </em>772 F.3d 1019, 1021 (5th Cir.2014). The BIA\u2019s refusal to reopen sua sponte does not deprive us of jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Mata v. Lynch, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2150, 2155, 192 L.Ed.2d 225 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">The BIA reasoned that the motion to reopen was untimely by more than 18 years from September 30, 1996, the latest date on which Hernandez could have timely filed it under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The BIA also noted that Hernandez\u2019s bid for reopening was \u201cnumber barred\u201d because it was his third request. The BIA found no exceptional circumstances warranting sua sponte reopening. Hernandez has failed to brief the issues of the time bar, the number bar, or the BIA\u2019s discretion to reopen sua sponte.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-16\">These crucial issues therefore are abandoned. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003) (noting that unargued issues are deemed abandoned).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-17\">Instead, Hernandez' argues inaccurately that the BIA failed to consider his contentions in light of a 1988 injunction affording certain procedural safeguards to Salvadorans. The injunction was set forth in <em>Orantes-Hernandez v. Meese, </em>685 F.Supp. 1488, 1511-14 (C.D.Cal.1988), and reaffirmed with slight modifications in <em>Orantes-Hernandez v. Gonzales, </em>504 F.Supp.2d 825 (C.D.Cal.2007). Hernandez has not explained how the <em>Orantes-Hernandez </em>injunction affects his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-18\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b487-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
