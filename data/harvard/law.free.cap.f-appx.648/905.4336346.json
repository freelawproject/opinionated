She alleged that J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\u201cChase\u201d), Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company (\u201cM and T\u201d), and Bayview Loan Servicing LLC (\u201cBayview\u201d) violated the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601 et seq. (RESPA), and that Chase committed negligence per se, by mishandling her home mortgage after she temporarily fell into delinquency. Nunez sent two RESPA \u201cnotices of error\u201d to Chase and one to Bayview alleging various mortgage account errors. - First, she says Chase wrongly allowed her home to be foreclosed on despite having signed a loan-modification agreement with her. Second, she says Chase acted inconsistently with the loan-modification agreement before transferring the mortgage to M and T, which she also believes violated the agreement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>The district court ignored Nunez\u2019s second set of allegations and did not construe the facts favorably to her. After careful consideration, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"AD7-\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss under [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure] 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Ironworkers Local Union 68 v. AstraZeneca Pharm., LP, </em>634 F.3d 1352, 1359 (11th Cir.2011) (quotation omitted). Even when assertions in a complaint are arguably ambiguous, they should be construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Fla. v. S. Everglades Restoration Alliance, </em>304 F.3d 1076, 1083-84 (11th Cir.2002). To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint need only contain sufficient facts, accepted as true, to \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). It must \u201craise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 555, 127 S.Ct. at 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">RESPA \u2014 as implemented by Regulation X, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1024 (2015) \u2014 allows borrowers to notify mortgage servicers of possible account errors. <em>See </em>12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1024.35. Once properly notified, a servi-cer must respond in one of two ways:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsAW\">(A) Correct[ ] the error or errors identified by the borrower and provid[e] the borrower with a written notification of the correction, the effective date of the correction, and contact information, in-eluding a telephone number, for further assistance; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-10\">(B) Conduct! ] a reasonable investigation and provid[e] the borrower with a written notification that includes- a statement that the servicer has determined that no error occurred, a statement of the reason or reasons for this determination, a statement of the borrower\u2019s right to request documents relied upon by the servicer in reaching its determination, information regarding how the borrower can request such documents, and contact information, including a telephone number, for further assistance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5a\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1024.35(e)(1)(i). Account errors are broadly defined by \u00a7 1024.35(b), which includes a residual category for \u201c[a]ny other error relating to the servicing of a borrower\u2019s mortgage loan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1024.35(b)(11).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">Nunez fell behind on her home mortgage \u2014 originally serviced by Chase \u2014 in 2010. Chase initiated foreclosure proceedings and received judgment in its favor in October 2012. However, before the foreclosure sale took place, Nunez and Chase entered into a loan-modification agreement in January 2013,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which allowed her to avoid foreclosure by making reduced monthly payments. Or so she thought.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">Despite the loan-modification agreement, Chase failed to timely notify the state court that the foreclosure sale should be cancelled or continued. Chase had originally requested that the state court postpone the foreclosure sale, which was rescheduled for March 20, 2013. But Chase waited too late to request further postponement \u2014 its foreclosure attorneys <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>asked on the eve of the sale, despite a requirement that such requests be heard at least ten days beforehand.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The foreclosure sale proceeded and Nunez\u2019s property was sold on March 20, 2013. She claimed that she suffered eviction attempts as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">Notwithstanding the foreclosure sale, Nunez submitted all her \u201ctrial\u201d payments and was approved for a permanent loan modification in May 2013. Around the same time, Chase sought to rescind the foreclosure sale. When this failed, Chase cancelled the loan-modification agreement with Nunez and stopped applying her payments to the loan (though it retained them in a \u201csuspense account\u201d). In February 2014, Chase began again with the rescission process. The next month, Nunez sent a RESPA notice of error letter to Chase, informing it of the wrongful foreclosure on her home and requesting that it investigate and remedy the error by \u201cimplement[ing] the terms of the loan modification agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">Chase promptly responded. Despite documenting this chain of events, Chase maintained that \u201cthere has not been an error with [Nunez\u2019s] loan.\u201d It averred that the loan-modification agreement had been \u201ccanceled,\u201d but said that \u201c[i]f the [rescission] is approved, we can then review [Nunez\u2019s] mortgage for a modification.\u201d The foreclosure sale was ultimately rescinded on May 15, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">In late May and early June of 2014, Chase reopened negotiations for a loan-modification agreement with Nunez. Chase said it could renew the old loan-modification agreement if Nunez paid $3,450.09 toward her account. Chase acknowledges that she did so on July 3, 2014,</p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">Nevertheless, Nunez continued to receive letters from Chase titled \u201cAcceleration Warning (Notice of Intent to Foreclose).\u201d Inconsistent with the loan-modification agreement, these letters claimed that Nunez was in default, listed substantial (and conflicting) payments that were supposedly past due, and threatened another foreclosure. Nunez claimed that the three such letters she attached to her amended complaint were simply \u201cexamples [and] are not intended to be exhaustive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b932-11\">The renewed loan-modification agreement was completed in late August 2014. Significantly, Nunez did not concede that the loan-modification was ever successfully <em>implemented </em>\u2014 quite the contrary. <em>See infra </em>pp. 9-10. Nunez filed this lawsuit against Chase on September 10, 2014. She also sent a second RESPA notice of error letter to Chase, documenting its \u201ccontinued failure to honor [her] loan modification agreement.\u201d Once again, Chase responded by denying any error.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-12\">On September 16, 2014, Nunez\u2019s loan was transferred to M and T.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Chase alleged that this transfer occurred \u201cwith the modified loan terms and monthly payment in place.\u201d On the other hand, Nunez alleged that the servicing errors regarding the loan-modification agreement were \u201congoing.\u201d For support, she attached to her amended complaint: (1) a September 30th letter from M and T stating that \u201cyou are presently in default\u201d and threatening another foreclosure, and (2) an October 2nd letter from Bayview stating that \u201c[y]our account may have been referred to an attorney for legal action, and additional fees and charges may be accruing.\u201d Nunez sent a third RESPA notice of error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>letter, this time to Bayview, on October 8, 2014. She documented the past problems with her account and requested that Bay-view \u201cconfirm that the loan modification has been completely boarded and that your company will not take further collection activity.\u201d Neither Bayview nor M and T ever responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">In her amended complaint, Nunez claimed that (1) Chase had violated RES-PA by failing to reasonably investigate and respond to her two notices of error; (2) Chase had thereby committed negligence per se; and (3) Bayview and M and T had violated RESPA by failing to respond to her third notice of error. The defendants both moved to dismiss the complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, and Nunez responded. The district court granted both motions and denied Nunez\u2019s request for reconsideration, Nunez timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">The district court erred by granting the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss. The court did not properly construe the facts alleged by Nunez in accord with the standard applied on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. Specifically, the district court construed Chase\u2019s \u201c[q]uizzieal[ ]\u201d responses to Nunez\u2019s notices of error as evidence of a reasonable investigation that \u201cfix[ed] the problem,\u201d all while relying on unsupported inferences about Chase\u2019s intentions and versions of the facts that contradict the allegations in Nunez\u2019s amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">In concluding that Chase\u2019s responses complied with \u201cthe letter and spirit of [RESPA],\u201d the district court impermissibly drew inferences in Chase\u2019s favor. Despite acknowledging that Chase\u2019s finding of no error was \u201codd conclusion\u201d and \u201cstands in contrast to the history traced out in the loan,\u201d the court took it upon itself to offer a \u201cfairer assessment\u201d of Chase\u2019s real intentions. The \u201c[q]uizzical[ ]\u201d responses, the court speculated, were actually a ruse designed to \u201ccomply with [RESPA\u2019s] binary response options.\u201d That is, Chase \u201cchose\u201d to repeatedly state that no error had occurred \u2014 despite secretly \u201cconcluding] that there was a problem\u201d \u2014 because RESPA \u201cdoes not contemplate errors of the type that cannot be fixed within the thirty day response deadline.\u201d According to the district court, Chase\u2019s unreasonable assessments of the situation were just an adept workaround. This analysis simply failed to give proper deference to what Nunez said in her pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">Beyond that, the district court ignored another set of Nunez\u2019s allegations and again construed facts favorably to the defendants. Throughout this case, Nunez has clearly alleged that Chase failed to properly implement and honor the loan-modification agreement, and she has attached documents that support this claim. <em>See, e.g., </em>Doc. 1 at 6 (\u201c[A]s the documents attached hereto as Exhibit \u2018D\u2019 reflect, Chase continues to fail to honor the loan modification agreement, and is once again pursuing foreclosure and collection activity.\u201d); Doc. 24 at 7 (\u201c[A]s the documents attached hereto as Exhibit \u2018D\u2019 and \u2018F\u2019 reflect, Chase continued to fail to honor the[] loan modification agreement, and continued to pursue foreclosure and collection activity for the entire time that it serviced Plaintiffs loan.\u201d); <em>Id. </em>at 10 (\u201c[Chase] fail[ed] to properly handle and implement [Plaintiffs] approved loan modification.\u201d). In deciding Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss, the district court was required to accept these allegations as true and construe all facts in the light most favorable to Nunez. <em>Ironworkers Local Union 68, </em>634 F.3d at 1359. Instead, the court ignored these allegations and concluded that Chase \u201c[did] the best it could,\u201d \u201cfix[ed] the problem,\u201d and \u201cput [Nunez] in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>her desired modified repayment program.\u201d These conclusions were not proper in deciding Rule 12(b)(6) motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Viewed in the light most favorable to her, Nunez has alleged that her home was wrongly foreclosed on despite a valid loan-modification agreement, simply because Chase failed to timely request postponement of the foreclosure. Chase later purported to v cancel its loan-modification agreement with her because it could not rescind the wrongful foreclosure. Even though it eventually did rescind the' foreclosure and accept payment from Nunez to renew the loan-modification agreement, Chase continued to shower Nunez with letters claiming she was in default and threatening another foreclosure. When she repeatedly notified Chase that these errors had occurred, Chase flatly denied any error. Nunez\u2019s allegations \u2014 each supported by attachments \u2014 are not reflected in the district court\u2019s conclusions. Her claim that Chase failed to conduct a reasonable investigation into or correct its errors as required by RESPA rises above the level of speculation. <em>See Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. at 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Attempting to justify the improper standard applied by the district court, the defendants argue that the court merely favored facts from Nunez\u2019s attachments over her \u201cconclusory and unwarranted accusations.\u201d However, the \u201cfacts\u201d that the defendants allude to are taken'from Chase\u2019s own letters. For example, in response to Nunez\u2019s claim that Chase failed to properly implement the loan-modification agreement, .the defendants point to: (1) Chase\u2019s second letter denying any error, and (2) Chase\u2019s letter enclosing the renewed loan-modification agreement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These documents do not contain \u201cspecific factual details\u201d that \u201cforeclose recovery as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Griffin Indus., Inc. v. Irvin, </em>496 F.3d 1189, 1206 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted). They are legal documents, drafted by one of the movants, which contain disputed accounts of the facts. Elevating claims in Chase\u2019s own letters over the plaintiffs allegations in the amended complaint and in other attachments would turn the standard for considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion on its head.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-8\">The district court\u2019s dismissals of Nunez\u2019s RESPA claim against Bayview and M and T, as well as Nunez\u2019s negligence per se claim against Chase, were premised on the reasoning we rejected above. For the RESPA claim against Bayview and M and T, the district court concluded that dismissal was proper because Chase had already adequately responded to Nunez\u2019s concerns. For the negligence per se claim against Chase, the district court concluded that dismissal was warranted because RESPA had not been violated. These conclusions cannot stand at this stage of the proceedings. After careful consideration of the record before us and the parties\u2019 briefs, we REVERSE and REMAND.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b931-8\">. Chase disputes when this agreement began, claiming it did not take full effect until May 2013 because the initial period was merely a \"trial.\u201d As the district court noted, this period was only a \"trial\u201d insofar as final approval depended on Nunez making the reduced payments (which she did) \u2014 Chase did not retain total discretion over whether to grant a permanent loan modification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b932-7\">. The exact number of days before the sale that Chase sent tire request is not clear, but it appears to have been between one and five.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b932-13\">. Bayview allegedly partnered with M and T to service loans, including Nunez's.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b934-6\">. To the extent the second letter is cited to show that the loan-modification agreement was executed by Chase in August 2014, it is not even relevant. Nunez does not dispute this fact. She contends that Chase did not properly implement or honor the loan-modification agreement, not that it didn\u2019t exist.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
