In May 2012 Vickers submitted a complaint to Aerotek and Hyundai claiming that Michael Miller, her supervisor and a Hyundai employee, had sexually harassed her. She alleged that Miller made inappropriate comments to her and engaged in unwelcome touching, Aerotek and Hyundai jointly investigated Vickers\u2019 allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-11\">During that investigation, other workers did not corroborate Vickers\u2019 allegations of harassment and Miller denied them. He and at least two other workers also informed investigators that Vickers herself had made several off-color comments during her time at Hyundai. On one occasion, for instance, Vickers apparently said to Miller, \u201c[W]hat you\u2019re not talking to me today? If I had gave you some pussy it would have been different,\u201d or, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to talk to me anymore, because I wouldn\u2019t fix the fault on the machine? It would have been the same way if I would have given you some pussy.\u201d On another occasion, a worker asked Miller to help \u201cput [something] id the back,\u201d to which Vickers responded, \u201cOh don\u2019t tell Mike to put it in the back!\u201d The parties appear to agree that Vickers\u2019 comment was sexual innuendo.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-12\">The investigation also revealed what Hyundai viewed as evidence of less than genuine motives on Vickers\u2019 part. Two employees reported that Vickers had asked them whether a previous worker had won a $6 million sexual harassment lawsuit against Hyundai. One of those employees also reported that Vickers had asked her \u201cif you' could be fired if you lied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-13\">Based on those findings, Hyundai concluded that Vickers\u2019 complaint was without merit. It also concluded that her comments to and about Miller violated the company\u2019s anti-harassment policies. As a result, Hyundai requested that Aerotek reassign Vickers to a different company and banned her from its premises. Aero-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>tek then terminated Vickers\u2019 employment with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Vickers filed this lawsuit in federal district court alleging that by banning her from its premises, Hyundai had retaliated against her in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>After discovery, Hyundai moved for summary judgment. The magistrate judge. found that even if Vickers could establish a prima facie case of retaliation, she had not successfully rebutted Hyundai\u2019s proffered non-discriminatory reason for its actions. As such, the magistrate judge recommended granting summary judgment against Vickers. The district court agreed, adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, and granted summary judgment to Hyundai. This is Vickers\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Title VII provides that \u201c[i]t shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of [its] employees ... because [s]he has made a charge ... under this subchapter.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). If the plaintiff estab-. lishes a prima facie case of retaliation, the burden shifts to the employer to \u201cproffer a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action;\u201d <em>Meeks v. Computer Assocs. Int'l, </em>15 F.3d 1013, 1021 (11th Cir.1994). That burden \u201cis exceedingly light.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). And if the employer satisfies it, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to \u201cdemonstrate that the employer\u2019s proffered explanations are a pretext for retaliation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Hyundai contends that even if Vickers established a prima facie case of retaliation, it successfully proffered non-retaliatory reasons for its actions. Hyundai claims that it banned Vickers because it concluded that she made statements that violated the company\u2019s anti-harassment policies, it believed she lied during the investigation of her complaint, and it thought she filed her complaint against Miller in bad faith. Those reasons satisfy Hyundai\u2019s \u201cexceedingly light\u201d burden to proffer legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for its action. <em>Id. </em>The burden is therefore on Vickers to show that Hyundai\u2019s proffered explanations are pretextual. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">To establish pretext, Vickers \u201cmust demonstrate that the proffered reason[s] [were] not the true reason[s] for the employment decision.\u201d <em>Jackson v. State of Ala. State Tenure Comm\u2019n, </em>405 F.3d 1276, 1289 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted). And she can establish that \u201cindirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Id, </em>(quotation marks omitted). We must determine whether she has \u201cdemonstrated such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in [Hyundai]\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">Vickers attempts to show pretext in three ways. She first argues that Hyundai disavowed its explanation that it banned Vickers because it found that she violated its anti-harassment policy. She cites the following deposition testimony from Kelly Rucker, a former Hyundai representative who sat on the committee that reviewed Vickers\u2019 complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-12\">Q: [\u00b6]... ] So is it your testimony, then, that the sole reason for her removal was at that she had filed a eom-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>plaint which you-all believed to be\u2014 or you believed to be unsubstantiated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-4\">A. We felt \u2014 The committee felt like\u2014 and I agreed with the committee\u2014 that it was made in not good faith. We didn\u2019t\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-5\">Q. So the decision was not taken to remove her because of any statements that she made?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-6\">A. It was just that we believed that this was not a legitimate complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQj_\">Vickers asks us to construe that exchange as an admission that Hyundai had abandoned its other explanations for banning her. The district court rejected that reading, stating, \u201cTaken in context, the portion of Rucker\u2019s deposition that Vickers quotes ... does not support her assertion-\u201d We agree with the district court. Immediately after the exchange quoted above, Rucker discusses Vickers\u2019 comment \u2014 the one that violated Hyundai\u2019s anti-harassment policies \u2014 and stated that Hyundai \u201cconfirmed that [Vickers] made that statement.\u201d Read in that context, we do not construe Rucker\u2019s testimony as disavowing Hyundai\u2019s earlier explanation that it removed Vickers because it believed she violated the company\u2019s anti-harassment policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">Vickers next argues that pretext is demonstrated by the fact that Hyundai offered different reasons for its actions at different times. Hyundai first claimed that it banned Vickers based on her violation of company policy, but it later claimed that it banned her because she lied and filed her complaint in bad faith. We have said, however, that the existence of multiple non-retaliatory or nondiscriminatory reasons for the employer\u2019s action does not show pretext, especially when those reasons are not inconsistent. <em>See Tidwell v. Carter Products, </em>135 F.3d 1422, 1428 (11th Cir.1998) (\u201c[T]he existence of a possible additional nondiscriminatory basis for [an employee\u2019s] termination does not prove pretext.\u201d); <em>Zaben v. Air Prods. &amp; Chems., Inc., </em>129 F.3d 1453, 1458 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201cAlthough the company gave differing explanations for the selection of employees to be discharged ... its reasons are not ... necessarily inconsistent.\u201d). Although Hyundai gave multiple reasons for banning Vickers from its premises, that fact alone does not show pretext, especially since Hyundai\u2019s reasons were not inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-11\">Finally, Vickers argues that Hyundai\u2019s reasons were pretextual because it did not discipline Miller, a similarly-situated employee, for engaging in the same type of misconduct. She asserts that Miller used profane language, which presumably violated Hyundai\u2019s anti-harassment policies, and lied during the investigation into her allegations against him. To succeed on that argument, Vickers would have to show that Miller engaged in conduct that was \u201cnearly identical\u201d to hers. <em>Stone &amp; Webster Constr., Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>684 F.3d 1127, 1134-35 (11th Cir.2012). \u201cWe require that the quantity and quality of the comparator\u2019s misconduct be nearly identical to prevent courts from second-guessing employers\u2019 reasonable decisions and confusing apples with oranges.\u201d <em>Maniccia v. Brown, </em>171 F.3d 1364, 1368 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-12\">Vickers has failed to supply enough evidence to show that the quantity and quality of Miller\u2019s alleged misconduct was \u201cnearly identical\u201d to her own and that the proof of misconduct was the same. Miller and Vickers were both alleged to have engaged in conduct of a sexually harassing nature, but only Vickers was alleged to have filed in bad faith a false report. The only support for the allegations against Miller was Vickers\u2019 statements, while the allegations against Vickers were supported by statements of multiple witnesses. A reasonable employer could have believed the allegations against Vickers but not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>those against Miller. And .we \u201cdo not sit to review the accuracy of the employer\u2019s fact findings.\u201d <em>Jones v. Bessemer Carraway Med. Ctr., </em>151 F.3d 1321, 1324 n. 16 (11th Cir.1998); <em>see also Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets of Fla., Inc., </em>196 F.3d 1354, 1363 n. 3 (11th Cir.1999) (\u201cAn employer who fires, an employee under the mistaken but honest impression that the employee violated a work rule is not liable for discriminatory conduct.\u201d); <em>Nix v. WLCY Radio/Rahall Commc\u2019ns, </em>738 F.2d 1181, 1187 (11th Cir.1984) (\u201cBut Title VII does not take away an employer\u2019s right to interpret its rules as it chooses, and to make determinations as it sees fit under those rules.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Vickers has failed to meet her burden of establishing a genuine issue of material fact with regard to whether Hyundai\u2019s proffered reasons for its action were pre-textual. For that reason, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to Hyundai.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b777-8\">. For purposes of summary judgment, Hyundai conceded that it was Vickers\u2019 employer under Title VII.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
