As the appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-23\">In 2000, Concepcion pleaded guilty in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey to one count of conspiring to distribute heroin, and the District Court sentenced him to 325 months of imprisonment. We affirmed the judgment at C.A. No. 00-2132. Concepcion then filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, which the District Court denied. We declined to issue a certificate of appealability at C.A. No. 02-4127. Following Concepcion\u2019s initiation of a RICO action against 56 governmental employees, including judges and United States attorneys, the District Court entered an order permanently-enjoining him . \u201cfrom filing further claims in this jurisdiction without leave of the Court.\u201d Subsequent to this injunction, in 2010, the District Court denied Concepcion\u2019s request to file a \u00a7 2241 petition. We summarily affirmed the District Court and found that he \u201cfailed to demonstrate that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention, as he raised arguments that could have been raised on direct appeal or in his \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Concepcion v. Zickefoose, </em>442 Fed.Appx. 622, 623 (3d Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-24\">Concepcion filed the instant petition in 2015, raising a litany of claims related to his 2000 conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On November 9, 2015, the District Court dismissed his petition for lack of jurisdiction because it was \u201cessentially a second or successive \u00a7 2255 petition brought without leave of the Court of Appeals.\u201d This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and review de novo the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Concepcion\u2019s habeas petition. <em>Ballentine v. United States, </em>486 F.3d 806, 808 (3d Cir.2007). We may summarily affirm the District Court where \u201cit clearly appears that no substantial question is presented or that subsequent precedent or a change in circumstances warrants such action.\u201d 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">We detect no error in the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Concepcion\u2019s petition because his claims \u2014 which all relate to the validity of his federal conviction and sentence \u2014 must normally be raised .in a \u00a7 2255 motion. Because he has already filed one and lost on the merits, he may not file another without obtaining our permission. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h). And as we explained in our 2011 opinion, he may not use section 2241 instead unless he shows that such a motion would be \u201cinadequate of ineffective.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Cradle v. U.S. ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002). None of his claims meet, that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Accordingly, we will summarily affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b184-19\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P, 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b184-20\">. Among other things, he claims that FBI informants planted heroin at his residence, that the District Court lacked personal and subject matter jurisdiction, and that the government \u201cfailed to tile a notice of acceptance of criminal jurisdiction with the governor of the State of New Jersey.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Azb\">. In his \"Application/Brief in .Support of a Great Writ of Habeas Corpus\u201d filed with this Court, Concepcion addresses the substance of his underlying claims, but fails to address why he could not have asserted them in his previous \u00a7 2255 motion. We also note that, in, denying Concepcion\u2019s application for a COA on this motion, we rejected at least one of the claims he asserts in the instant petition \u2014 his claim related to <em>Apprendi.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
