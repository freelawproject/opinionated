On appeal, Parra-Guz-man argues that his previous Georgia con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>viction for family violence battery under Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 16-5-23.1(a), (f) should not be considered an aggravated felony that would support an eight-level sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review, we \"affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">Section 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides that \u201c[i]f the defendant previously was deported, or unlawfully remained in the United States, after ... a conviction for an aggravated felony, increase by 8 levels.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). The Application Notes for that Guideline define \u201caggravated felony\u201d as having the same meaning as given to that term in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n.3(A). Section 1101 includes in its definition of aggravated felony \u201ca crime of violence,\u201d as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). A crime of violence is defined in \u00a7 16(a) as \u201can offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">Georgia law divides the crime of battery into three major categories, with each requiring a higher level of injury. A person commits simple battery under Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-5-23(a) when he or she either \u201c[ijntentionally makes physical contact of an insulting or provoking nature with the person of another\u201d or \u201c[intentionally causes physical harm to another.\u201d A person commits battery under Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-5^-23.1(a) when he or she \u201cintentionally causes substantial physical harm or visible bodily harm to another.\u201d A person commits aggravated battery under Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 16-5-24(a) when he or she \u201cmaliciously causes bodily harm to another by depriving him or her of a member of his or her body, by rendering a member of his or her body-useless, or by seriously disfiguring his or her body or a member thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b999-13\">A person can be convicted of a family violence battery when he or she \u201cintentionally causes substantial physical harm or visible bodily harm\u201d to one of a list of specified family members. Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 16-5-23.1(a), (f). Visible bodily harm is defined as \u201cbodily harm capable of being perceived by a person other than the victim and may include, but is not limited to, substantially blackened eyes, substantially swollen lips or other facial or body parts, or substantial bruises to body parts.\u201d Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 16-5-23.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-14\">In <em>Hernandez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1336 (11th Cir.2008), this Court analyzed whether a simple battery conviction in Georgia, under the \u201cintentionally causes physical harm\u201d prong in Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-5-23(a)(2), constituted a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a). <em>Hernandez, </em>513 F.3d at 1338. This Court explained that a conviction under this prong \u201crequired more than simple physical contact with the victim; it required intentionally causing <em>physical harm </em>to the victim through physical contact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1340 (citing <em>Hammonds v. State, </em>263 Ga.App. 5, 587 S.E.2d 161, 163 (2003)). This Court concluded that a conviction under \u00a7 16-5-23(a)(2) constituted a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d mainly because Georgia courts had interpreted the language of the statute to require \u201cactual physical contact that inflicts pain or injury.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>Parra-Guzman argues that the precedential scope of our decision in <em>Hernandez </em>has been eroded by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S. 133, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010). In <em>Johnson, </em>the Supreme Court held that Florida\u2019s battery statute, which required \u201c[actually and intentionally touch[ing]\u201d another person, \u201cno matter how slight\u201d the physical contact, did not constitute a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) because it did not have \u201cas an element the use ... of physical force against the person of another.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>559 U.S. at 135-45, 130 S.Ct. at 1268-74 (quotation marks omitted). Specifically, the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe phrase \u2018physical force\u2019 means <em>violent </em>force \u2014 that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 140, 130 S.Ct. at 1271.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">We need not decide whether <em>Johnson </em>applies to the definition of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a). Even assuming <em>Johnson </em>applied to \u00a7 16(a), it would not be of any use to Parra-Guzman. Again, as this Court stated in <em>Hernandez, </em>Georgia courts have interpreted the causing-physical-harm element in \u00a7 16-5-23(a)(2) as requiring \u201cactual physical contact that inflicts pain or injury.\u201d <em>Hernandez, </em>513 F.3d at 1340. We see no meaningful difference between that characterization and the definition of \u201cviolent force\u201d used in <em>Johnson, </em>i.e. \u201cforce capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>559 U.S. at 140, 130 S.Ct. at 1271. As such, we do not see how <em>Johnson </em>abrogates our decision in <em>Hernandez </em>that a conviction under \u00a7 16-5-23(a)(2) constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">The only difference between the simple battery definition in \u00a7 16-5-23(a)(2) at issue in <em>Hernandez </em>and the battery definition in \u00a7 16-5-23.1(a) at issue here is that the battery definition here actually requires a greater level of physical or bodily injury. If intentionally causing physical harm to another qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d then certainly intentionally causing \u201csubstantial\u201d physical harm or visible bodily harm to another, as Parra-Guzman was convicted of doing, qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">The district court did not err in concluding that Parrar-Guzman\u2019s family violence battery conviction under Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 16-5-23.1(a), (f) is a crime of violence, therefore making it an aggravated felony for purposes of applying an eight-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). Therefore, we affirm Parra-Guzman\u2019s 24-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b999-9\">.
