Following removal to federal court, both parties filed motions for summary judgment, with Bitterroot arguing that any foreclosure action by MTGLQ was time barred under Texas law and MTGLQ arguing that its foreclosure action was timely and that it held title to the property in question. The district court denied Bitter-root\u2019s motion for summary judgment but granted MTGLQ\u2019s motion. Bitterroot now appeals. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-14\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b439-15\">The instant appeal arises from a dispute over the parties\u2019 right to title and their security interests in a property in San Antonio, Texas. On November 12, 2005, John Harvey executed a Texas Home Equity Note (Note) in the amount of $94,320.00 payable to American Equity Mortgage, Inc., (AME) and executed a Texas Home Equity Security Instrument (Deed of Trust) granting AME a security interest in a property located in San Antonio as part of the loan made to Harvey. The Note included an acceleration clause whereby the holder of the Note could require immediate payment of the principal of the Note and all interest on the Note in the event that Harvey defaulted on payments required by the Note and Deed of Trust. Under the Deed of Trust, the note-holder could foreclose on the property in the event of default by Harvey pursuant to the holder\u2019s security interest in the property. Thereafter, a nominee for AME assigned the Note and the Deed of Trust to Citimortgage, Inc. (Citimortgage);</p>\n<p id=\"b439-16\">On October 26, 2007, Citimortgage informed Harvey that he was in default on his loan and needed to pay $1,976.38 in order to cure the default. Citimortgage then sent another Notice of Default on November 3, 2008, informing Harvey that failure to cure the default would result in acceleration of the loan. Finally, on February 20, 2009, Citimortgage sent Harvey a Notice of Acceleration informing him that Citimortgage had elected to accelerate the maturity of the debt. Citimort-gage subsequently filed an application for foreclosure of the property guaranteed as a security interest under the Deed of Trust but later successfully moved to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>this- application dismissed in late 2009. Another application for foreclosure of the property was filed in August 2010, but the application was similarly dismissed in 2011. On November 4, 2010, Citimortgage assigned the Note and Deed of Trust to Defendant-Appellee MTGLQ Investors, L.P. (MTGLQ).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">In a matter unrelated to MTGLQ\u2019s security interest, the property was sold in 2011 to DTND Sierra Investments, LLC (DTND), at a homeowner\u2019s association foreclosure sale resulting from Harvey\u2019s failure to pay the homeowner\u2019s association assessments and dues. DTND later assigned its interest in the property to Plaintiff-Appellant Bitterroot Holdings, LLC (Bitterroot). Following the sale, MTGLQ\u2019s counsel sent another Notice of Default and Notice of Acceleration to Harvey stating that MTGLQ had decided to accelerate the maturity of Harvey\u2019s debt. MTGLQ then filed its own application for foreclosure of the property in the 166th Judicial District Court of Bexar County, Texas, on June 24, 2013. And on November 8, 2013, that court ruled that MTGLQ could proceed with a foreclosure sale of the property based on its rights under the Note and the Deed of Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Seeking to enjoin the foreclosure sale, Bitterroot filed the instant action in the 73rd Judicial District Court of Bexar County on August 1, 2014. MTGLQ then removed the action to the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas on October 2, 2014, asserting diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a). Bitterroot subsequently filed an amended complaint in federal court against MTGLQ, seeking to have the court enjoin MTGLQ\u2019s foreclosure sale. In particular, Bitterroot brought a trespass to try title action against MTGLQ, asserting that it had title to the property. Bitterroot also asserted that MTGLQ violated the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA), alleging that MTGLQ had misrepresented facts in its state foreclosure action.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Both parties moved for summary judgment on July 6, 2015. In its motion for summary judgment against Bitterroot, MTGLQ asserted its right to foreclose and that it had superior title to Bitterroot. MTGLQ also argued that its foreclosure action was timely filed within the relevant limitations period because it brought the action within four years of accelerating the loan in 2012 and that any previous acceleration attempts were immaterial to the limitations period because they were abandoned. MTGLQ attached a number of exhibits to its motion, including the affidavit of a senior loan analyst, Howard R. Handville, who recounted the history of the Note and the Deed of Trust leading up to Bitterroot\u2019s suit. Bitterroot, for its part, moved for partial summary judgment against MTGLQ. In its motion, Bitterroot argued that MTGLQ was barred from bringing the foreclosure action. Bitterroot claimed that the four-year limitation period to bring a foreclosure action had run because there had been an acceleration of the Note in 2008, and Citimortgage and MTGLQ had failed to abandon the acceleration, In the alternative, Bitterroot argued that Harvey had relied upon the 2008 acceleration notice and that his reliance precluded Citimortgage or MTGLQ from abandoning the acceleration. Bitterroot later filed its opposition to MTGLQ\u2019s motion for summary judgment, contending that the Handville affidavit could not be considered by the court because Handville had not been identified as a witness in' MTGLQ\u2019s Rule 26 disclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">On October 23, 2015, the district court entered final judgment denying Bitter-root\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment and granting MTGLQ\u2019s motion for summary judgment. With respect to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Handville affidavit, the district court concluded that the failure to disclose Hand-ville as a witness was harmless, as Bitter-root had previously been aware of the Handville affidavit and the failure to disclose had been inadvertent.' As to the merits, the district court held that Bitter-root failed to establish a genuine dispute of fact that its title to the property was superior to that of MTGLQ on its trespass to try title claim. Moreover, the court held that the right to foreclose was not barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Responding to Bitterroot\u2019s reliance argument, the district court held that it was less than clear that the Supreme Court of Texas would recognize a detrimental reliance exception to abandonment of acceleration of a loan. But the court also held\u2014 assuming that there was a detrimental reliance exception \u2014 that Bitterroot failed to show that Harvey detrimentally relied on the previous accelerations. In particular, the court noted that Harvey remained in debt both before and after the notices of acceleration and that Bitterroot failed to show other evidence of detrimental reliance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bitterroot timely appealed the district court\u2019s judgment on November 23, 2015, contending that the district court erred in granting summary judgment and by not excluding the Handville affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as the district court. <em>Rogers v. Bromac Title Servs., L.L.C., </em>755 F.3d 347, 350 (5th Cir.2014). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). A genuine dispute of material fact exists \u201cif the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). However, \u201c[a] mere scintilla of evidence will not preclude granting of a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Schaefer v. Gulf Coast Reg\u2019l Blood Ctr., </em>10 F.3d 327, 330 (5th Cir.1994) (per curiam). \u201cWe construe all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party when reviewing grants of motions for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Dillon v. Rogers, </em>596 F.3d 260, 266 (5th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Murray v. Earle, </em>405 F.3d 278, 284 (5th Cir.2005)). With respect to Bitterroot\u2019s objection to the Handville affidavit, \u201c[w]e review for abuse of discretion a decision not to exclude documents under [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure] 37.\u201d <em>Tex. A &amp; M Research Found. v. Magna Transp., Inc., </em>338 F.3d 394, 402 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">III. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">On appeal, Bitterroot primarily argues that the district court erred because MTGLQ\u2019s right to foreclose was barred by the statute of limitations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Texas law provides that \u201c[a] sale of a real property under a power of sale in a mortgage or deed of trust that creates a real property lien must be made not later than four years after the day the cause of action accrues.\u201d Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 16.035(b). The relevant Texas statute then adds that \u201c[o]n the expiration of the four-year limitations period, the real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>property lien and a power of sale to enforce the real property lien become void.\u201d Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 16.035(d). However, \u201c[i]f a note or deed of trust secured by real property contains an optional acceleration clause, default does not ipso facto start limitations running on the note.\u201d <em>Holy Cross Church of God in Christ v. Wolf, </em>44 S.W.3d 562, 566 (Tex.2001). \u201cRather, the action accrues only when the holder actually exercises its option to accelerate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And \u201c[e]ven when a noteholder has accelerated a note upon default, the holder can abandon acceleration if the holder continues to accept payments without exacting any remedies available to it upon declared maturity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 566-67. Consequently, when a note-holder abandons acceleration, the limitations period on foreclosure actions generally restarts. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">The district court found that, while Citi-mortgage had previously twice accelerated the Note upon default in 2008 and 2010, both notices of acceleration had been abandoned when Citimortgage dismissed its foreclosure actions in state court. As a result, the limitations period on MTGLQ\u2019s foreclosure action began when it accelerated the Note in 2012, and its action was filed within the four-year limitations period. Bitterroot does not contest the district court\u2019s holding with respect to abandonment but argues instead that abandonment could not have reset the limitations period because Harvey had detrimentally relied on the initial acceleration by Citimortgage. According to Bitterroot, the district court erred when it concluded that there was no detrimental reliance exception to abandonment of acceleration under Texas law.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">However, we need not determine whether or not the district court erred in this respect because it correctly found that, assuming that there was a detrimental reliance exception to abandonment, Harvey failed to show detrimental reliance. <em>See Bramblett v. Comm\u2019r, </em>960 F.2d 526, 530 (5th Cir.1992) (\u201cThis court can affirm a lower court\u2019s decision if there are any grounds in the record to support the judgment.\u201d); <em>cf. Boren v. U.S. Nat'l Bank Ass\u2019n, </em>807 F.3d 99, 105 (5th Cir.2015) (\u201cAs an initial matter, Texas\u2019 intermediate appellate courts are in agreement that the holder of a note may unilaterally abandon acceleration after its exercise, so long[ ] as the borrower neither objects to abandonment nor has detrimentally relied on the acceleration.\u201d). In order to show detrimental reliance under Texas law, a party \u201cmust show that he materially changed his position in reliance\u201d on another party\u2019s promise or representation. <em>Sandel v. ATP Oil &amp; Gas Corp., </em>243 S.W.3d 749, 753 (Tex.App. \u2014 Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, no pet.). In support of its detrimental reliance argument, Bitterroot alleged\u2014 through Harvey\u2019s own affidavit \u2014 that, as a result of the original acceleration, Harvey decided not to pay off debt he owed to a homeowner\u2019s association, decided not to get loan modification assistance, and moved out of his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">As the district court correctly concluded, the evidence adduced by Bitterroot was insufficient to show a dispute of material fact that Harvey relied on the Citimort-gage acceleration to his detriment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Harvey\u2019s decision not to pay off a debt following the original acceleration was not a material .change in his position because he was in debt before and after the accelera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>tion. Harvey\u2019s failure to obtain loan modification assistance similarly was not a material change because Harvey admitted that he did not know about loan modification programs prior to the acceleration. And while Harvey alleged that he moved out of his house as a result of the acceleration, the district court correctly recognized that Harvey\u2019s affidavit failed to show any particular legal or financial consequences incurred as a result of this decision. We therefore conclude that the district court did not err when it held that there was no evidence of detrimental reliance and that the statute of limitations did not preclude MTGLQ\u2019s foreclosure suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">IV. BITTERROOT\u2019S OBJECTION TO THE HANDVILLE AFFIDAVIT</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Separately, Bitterroot argues that the district court should not have allowed MTGLQ to introduce the Handville Affidavit as evidence because MTGLQ failed to include Handville as a witness in its Rule 26 initial disclosures. A party is generally \u201cnot allowed to use ... information or [a] witness to supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial\u201d where that party \u201cfails to provide information or identify a witness [in its initial disclosures] as required by Rule 26(a) or (e).\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(c)(1). However, Rule 37 provides that this failure to disclose may be excused and evidence may be introduced where the failure \u201cwas substantially justified or is harmless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, where a district court allows non-disclosed evidence to be used, we look to four factors in determining whether the district court was within its discretion in permitting the introduction of the evidence: \u201c(1) the importance of the evidence; (2) the prejudice to the opposing party of including the evidence; (3) the possibility of curing such prejudice by granting a continuance; and (4) the explanation for the party\u2019s failure to disclose.\u201d <em>Tex. A &amp; M Research Found., </em>338 F.3d at 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the Handville affidavit to be introduced. As the district court recognized, the affidavit was important to the case, as it authenticated many of the claims at issue in the case and traced the history of the Note and the Deed of Trust. There was also no surprise in introducing the affidavit because, while the affidavit had not been included in MTGLQ\u2019s Rule 26 disclosures, the affidavit had previously been used without objection by MTGLQ in a motion opposing remand. Moreover, the district court recognized that the failure to disclose the affidavit was not deliberate, but rather due to the fact that the court\u2019s own scheduling order did not make clear the deadline for the Rule 26 disclosures. We cannot conclude based on these detailed findings that the district court abused its discretion when it admitted the affidavit into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b439-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b441-7\">. The district court also granted summary judgment to MTGLQ on Bitterroot\u2019s DTPA claims. These claims are not before us on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b441-11\">. Bitterroot does not challenge the district court\u2019s holding that Bitterroot failed to establish a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether its title to the property was superior to that of MTGLQ.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b442-5\">. The district court also found that there was no evidence that Harvey had objected to Citimortgage\u2019s motions to dismiss its original foreclosure applications. <em>See Manes v. Bletsch, </em>239 S.W. 307, 308 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014 Austin 1922, no writ) (''[W]here the payer is not objecting to the recall of such option, we can see no reason why the payee could not revoke the same as well as not to have exercised it in the beginning.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
