He then brought this lawsuit against the company for violating accessibility requirements under Title III of the American Disabilities Act. After the insurance company failed to respond to Deutsh\u2019s suit, Deutsh filed a motion for entry of default judgment. The district court denied the motion \u2014 without prejudice \u2014 because it determined that Deutsh had not shown he was entitled to injunctive relief, which is the only relief available to him under the statute. 42 U.S.C.A, \u00a7 12188; <em>Perez v. Doctors Hosp. at Renaissance, Ltd., </em>624 Fed.Appx. 180, 183 (5th Cir.2015) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">This court is required to determine the basis for jurisdiction, even when the parties have failed to do so. <em>Muse v. Aranda, </em>263 F.3d 164, 2001 WL 803800, at *1 (5th Cir.2001) (per curiam). We lack jurisdiction to review the denial of Deutsh\u2019s motion for the entry of default judgment. <em>See Adult Film Ass\u2019n of Am., Inc. v. Thetford, </em>776 F.2d 113, 115 (5th Cir.1985) (per curiam) (holding that a denial of a default judgment without final judgment on the merits is not an appealable final order); <em>Muse, </em>263 F.3d at *1 (the same). This case is still live in district court, however, and Deutsh may file another motion for default judgment explaining why he is entitled to injunctive relief under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">The appeal is therefore DISMISSED FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
