Worrills argues that the district court erred by applying a two-level enhancement for making a \u201cthreat of death\u201d during the robbery. United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F). First, Worrills asserts that his statement that he had a gun would not instill a fear of death in a reasonable person on these facts. Second, Worrills contends that this enhancement amounted to impermissible double counting because a \u201cthreat of death,\u201d as we have construed that term, is inherent in every bank robbery. After careful consideration, we affirm Worrills\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-15\">Worrills robbed a bank after he discovered that his account there was overdrawn. Around midday on December 17, 2014, Worrills visited a Bank of America branch and tried to make a withdrawal. The teller informed Worrills that his account had a negative balance and that he would need to deposit $381 to have it reactivated. Wor-rills declined to do so and left.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-16\">Two hours later, Worrills returned to the bank. He approached the same teller with a deposit slip in one hand and his other hand out of sight, possibly in the pocket of his hoodie. Worrills said to the teller, \u201cI\u2019ve got a gun, just give me the money.\u201d The teller later reported that she could tell from Worrills\u2019s demeanor that he wasn\u2019t joking. Worrills then handed over the deposit slip, on which he had written, \u201cGive me all your money, I\u2019ve got a gun,\u201d In these circumstances, the teller was \u201cplaced [ ] in fear\u201d and surrendered $3,764 to Worrills. Worrills left the bank. On December 26, 2014, he turned himself in. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>During questioning, he denied that he had a gun during the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">We review a district court\u2019s application and interpretation of the Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Murphy, </em>306 F.3d 1087, 1089 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam). We also review <em>de novo </em>whether an enhancement constitutes double counting. <em>United States v. Kapordelis, </em>569 F.3d 1291, 1315 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">A two-level sentencing enhancement applies when a \u201cthreat of death\u201d was made during a robbery. USSG \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F). The defendant need not expressly threaten to kill the victim; engaging in any conduct \u201cthat would instill 'in a reasonable person ... a fear of death\u201d is sufficient. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2B3.1, cmt. n. 6. This Court has held that statements to the effect of \u201cI have a gun\u201d support a threat-of-death enhancement. <em>See Murphy, </em>306 F.3d at 1089. This is because \u201c[a] reasonable bank teller given [such a note] would reasonably have this reaction: Tf I do not give this robber money ..., I will be shot; and people who are shot often die.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">Double counting occurs \u201cwhen one part of the Guidelines is applied to increase a defendant\u2019s punishment on account of a kind of harm that has already been fully accounted for by application of another part of the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Dudley, </em>463 F.3d 1221, 1226-27 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted). However, double counting is permitted if the Sentencing Commission intended the result and each section is conceptually separate. <em>Id. </em>at 1227. \u201cAbsent a specific direction to the contrary, we presume that the Sentencing Commission intended to apply separate sections cumulatively.\u201d <em>Kapordelis, </em>569 F.3d at 1315.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">The district court did not <em>err </em>by applying the threat-of-death enhancement. The test is whether Worrills\u2019s conduct would instill a fear of death in a reasonable person in the teller\u2019s circumstances. <em>See Murphy, </em>306 F.3d at 1089. Verbally and in a demand note, Worrills ordered the teller to give him money and stated that he had a gun. The teller could not see one of Worrills\u2019s hands because he kept it below the counter. She reported that this conduct \u201cplaced her in fear ..., which caused her to then provide the money.\u201d Under this Court\u2019s precedent, such conduct was sufficient to support a threat-of-death enhancement. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">Worrills argues that mitigating circumstances made it unreasonable for the teller to fear death \u2014 namely, she recognized him' as a customer from his earlier visit. Wor-rills bases, this \u201cmitigating circumstances\u201d theory on two out-of-circuit cases. In these cases, the Sixth and Seventh Circuits recognized a \u201crare,\u201d \u201cunusual\u201d exception to the general rule that statements to the effect of \u201cI have a gun\u201d support a threat-of-death enhancement. <em>United States v. Wooten, </em>689 F.3d 570, 576 n. 3 (6th Cir.2012); <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>155 F.3d 844, 847 (7th Cir.1998). When \u201cunique factual circumstances ... prevent! ] the case from fitting the standard [threat-of-death] mold,\u201d this exception may apply. <em>Wooten, </em>689 F.3d at 576 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-11\">In <em>Wooten, </em>the exception applied because: (1) the defendant was calm, placed both hands on the bank counter, and seemed to be joking; (2) the robbery did not include \u201challmarks of experienced bank robbers\u201d like a demand note or a mask; and (3) the teller reported that he never felt threatened or afraid. <em>Id. </em>at 572-73, 578-79. Even if we were to adopt this exception, it would not apply here because no mitigating circumstances are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>present: Worrills kept one hand out of sight, had a serious demeanor, used a demand note, and frightened the teller. The fact that Worrills was a customer with an overdrawn, inactivated account does not mitigate his threat. If anything, it amplifies his threat because it shows he was desperate for money.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Nor did the district court err by rejecting Worrills\u2019s claim of double counting. Bank robbery is defined as taking from a bank, credit union, or savings and loan association \u201cby force and violence, or by intimidation.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a). Making a \u201cthreat of death\u201d is not included as an element of the offense. <em>See id. </em>Bank robbery triggers a base offense level of 20, to which the threat-of-death enhancement is separately added. USSG \u00a7 2B3.1(a), (b)(2)(F). Worrills argues that his method of intimidating the teller (saying he had a gun) was \u201cthe least dangerous or consequential way\u201d to get the money \u2014 nothing less serious would have worked. Thus, Worrills claims, his intimidating conduct was an inherent part of bank robbery, and using it to enhance his sentence is impermissible double counting.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">We reject Worrills\u2019s contention that making a threat of death, as we have construed that term, is inherent in every bank robbery. Worrills minimizes the effect of his words when he argues that threatening the teller with a gun was \u201cthe only way that [ ] Worrills could reasonably expect the teller to comply with his demand.\u201d There are surely less dangerous or consequential ways to get the money from tellers, who are typically trained not to offer resistance. Because threatening victims with death goes beyond mere intimidation, \u201c[t]he harm at which the [threat-of-death] enhancement is aimed is conceptually distinct from the harm that [Worrills\u2019s robbery] caused.\u201d <em>Dudley, </em>463 F.3d at 1227. This conclusion is bolstered by the presumption that the Sentencing Commission intends to apply separate sections cumulatively. <em>See Kapordelis, </em>569 F.3d at 1315.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">For these reasons, we affirm Worrills\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
