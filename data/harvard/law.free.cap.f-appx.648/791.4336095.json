No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AqzA\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"ARA\">On appeal, Brooks challenges the denial of his motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant. In support of his motion to suppress, Brooks contends (1) the search warrant was unconstitutionally overbroad; and (2) the search warrant was executed unreasonably because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>government failed to return Brooks\u2019s property within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">In considering the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, we review fact determinations for clear error and application of law to the facts <em>de novo. United States v. Boyce, </em>351 F.3d 1102, 1105 (11th Cir.2003). We construe all facts in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">The Fourth Amendment requires a search warrant to describe particularly the place to be searched and the things to be seized. U.S. Const. amend. IV. A search warrant\u2019s \u201cdescription is sufficiently particular when it enables the searcher reasonably to ascertain and identify the things to be seized.\u201d <em>United States v. Santarelli, </em>778 F.2d 609, 614 (11th Cir.1985). We apply the Fourth Amendment\u2019s particularity requirement \u201cwith a practical margin of flexibility, depending on the type of property to be seized.\u201d <em>United States v. Wuagneux, </em>683 F.2d 1343, 1349 (11th Cir.1982). Thus, in determining the sufficiency of a warrant\u2019s description, we consider whether the description \u201cis as specific as the circumstances and nature of activity under investigation permit.\u201d <em>Id,; see also United States v. Blum, </em>753 F.2d 999, 1001 (11th Cir.1985) (search warrant for \u201cmiscellaneous merchandise fraudulently obtained\u201d was sufficiently specific where probable cause existed to believe defendants possessed merchandise obtained by fraud but the government \u201cdid not know precisely what the merchandise was or from whom it had been obtained.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">We reject Brooks\u2019s contention that the search warrant was unconstitutionally overbroad. In an introductory paragraph, the search warrant stated that probable cause existed to believe that a computer or other digital device at Brooks\u2019s residence was being used knowingly to possess child pornography, in violation of Florida\u2019s child pornography statutes. The search warrant then set forth a detailed list of items-to-be-seized, including computer hardware, software, and digital storage devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">That some of the descriptions of the items-to-be-seized contained no express reference to child pornography or to the exploitation of children fails to render the search warrant impermissibly overbroad. When read within the context of the entire warrant, the descriptions are sufficiently particular to enable officers to \u201creasonably ascertain and identify the things to be seized\u201d as being <em>only </em>those items pertinent to an investigation related to child pornography. Given that child pornography images may be stored anywhere on a computer or digital device, the search warrant in this case was \u201cas specific as the circumstances and nature of activity under inves: tigation [would] permit.\u201d <em>See Wuagneux, </em>683 F.2d at 1349. Moreover, nothing requires a search warrant to contain a \u201csearch protocol\u201d specifying the computer files subject to being searched. <em>See United States v. Khanani, </em>502 F.3d 1281, 1290 (11th Cir.2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-12\">Brooks contends that the government violated his Fourth Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>rights by holding his non-contraband property for over ten months. As a result, Brooks argues he was entitled to suppression of all evidence obtained pursuant to the search warrant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Exclusion of evidence is an \u201cextreme sanction\u201d to be used only as a \u201clast resort.\u201d <em>Herring v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 135, 129 S.Ct. 695, 700, 172 L.Ed.2d 496 (2009). A Fourth Amendment violation, in and of itself, does not require necessarily the exclusion of evidence. <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo trigger the exclusionary rule, police conduct must be sufficiently deliberate that exclusion can meaningfully deter it, and sufficiently culpable that such deterrence is worth the price paid by the justice system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 702. \u201c[T]he exclusionary rule serves to deter deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent conduct.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">The record shows that Brooks\u2019s property was seized, pursuant to a search warrant, on 2 August 2012. The government began its forensic examination of Brooks\u2019s computer files five days later and completed the examination in mid-December 2012. On 26 April 2013, Brooks filed a motion for return of all property seized during the search, pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 41(g).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court granted Brooks\u2019s motion on 7 June 2013, ordering the return of all property \u201cnot commingled with contraband and that can be located with Defendant\u2019s assistance.\u201d The government complied with the court\u2019s order by 17 June 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">On this record, Brooks has failed to demonstrate that the government engaged in \u201cdeliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent conduct.\u201d The government acted with reasonable diligence in conducting its forensic examination. The government also returned Brooks\u2019s requested non-contraband property within a reasonable time after the district court granted Brooks\u2019s Rule 41(g) motion. Thus, even if the government\u2019s retention of Brooks\u2019s property constituted some Fourth Amendment violation \u2014 which we reject \u2014 the facts of this case do not rise to the level necessary to justify the \u201cextreme sanction\u201d of exclusion. The district court committed no error in denying Brooks\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">Brooks next challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for an acquittal on Counts One through Five, which charged Brooks with receipt of five named files containing child pornography. Brooks argues that insufficient evidence existed that he \u201cknowingly received\u201d the charged images.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-11\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of judgment of acquittal on sufficiency of evidence grounds.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>732 F.3d 1299, 1303 (11th Cir.2013). In determining the sufficiency of the evidence, \u201cwe consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, drawing all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in the government\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We will not overturn a jury\u2019s verdict unless no \u201creasonable construction of the evidence would have allowed the jury to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>To obtain a conviction for receiving child pornography, the government must prove, among other things, that the defendant \u201cknowingly receive[d]\u201d child pornography through means affecting interstate commerce, \u201cincluding by computer.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(2). A person \u201cknowingly receives\u201d child pornography by viewing, acquiring, or accepting intentionally child pornography on a computer from an outside source. <em>United States v. Pruitt, </em>638 F.3d 763, 766 (11th Cir.2011) (interpreting substantively identical child pornography offense in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">The government may use circumstantial evidence to prove that pornography was obtained via the internet. <em>United States v. Dodds, </em>347 F.3d 893, 900 (11th Cir.2003) (evidence that images on defendant\u2019s computer were traded frequently on the internet and that defendant had access to and was familiar with the internet was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that the images were obtained using the internet). We have also concluded that \u201cEvidence that a person has sought out\u2014 searched for \u2014 child pornography on the internet and has a computer containing child-pornography images ... can count as circumstantial evidence that a person has \u2018knowingly receive[d]\u2019 child pornography.\u201d <em>Pruitt, </em>638 F.3d at 766.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Evidence presented at trial showed that Brooks was familiar with and used regularly file-sharing software to search for and to receive pornography. Brooks explained to officers that, when he wanted to keep a file, he would move it from the file-sharing download folder into a user-created folder on his computer. Brooks also admitted that he had downloaded inadvertently child pornography in the past, but he claimed he always deleted those files immediately. Yet, Brooks\u2019s computer contained several images of child pornography (including the five charged files) that were saved in user-created folders. These images were titled using terms commonly used to identify child pornography images on the internet. Evidence also showed that child pornography files had been made available on peer-to-peer networks from Brooks\u2019s IP address and that Brooks had used a search term indicative of child pornography. On this record, the government presented sufficient circumstantial evidence to allow the jury to infer that Brooks received knowingly the charged images via the internet.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">Brooks argues that he was entitled to judgment of acquittal based on evidence that Brooks possessed a CD containing the five charged images that predated the files on his computer and based on testimony that the government\u2019s forensic expert could not confirm that Brooks downloaded the charged images from the internet. That this evidence might support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence, however, is not enough: \u201cthe issue is <em>not </em>whether a jury reasonably could have acquitted but whether it reasonably could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>See United States v. Jiminez, </em>564 F.3d 1280, 1285 (11th Cir.2009) (emphasis added). Brooks failed to show that no reasonable jury could have found him guilty; we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-13\">Brook next challenges the denial of his motion to dismiss Count Six of the indictment, which charged Brooks with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>transportation of child pornography.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We review the sufficiency of an indictment <em>de novo. United States v. Pena, </em>684 F.3d 1137, 1147 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"Ao23\">In charging Brooks with knowingly transporting child pornography, the indictment cited to and tracked the language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(1)(B) and (b)(1). Because the indictment (1) set forth the essential elements of the charged offense; (2) provided Brooks with adequate notice of the charge; and (3) enabled Brooks to rely upon the resulting judgment for purposes of double jeopardy, we conclude it was sufficient. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">That the indictment identified no intended or actual recipient of the charged images does not render the indictment insufficient: the identity of the alleged recipient is no element of the offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(1)(B); <em>United States v. Crippen, </em>579 F.2d 340, 342 (5th Cir.1978) (an indictment need not allege factual details beyond the essential elements of the charged offense). Moreover, although the indictment specified no exact time of the alleged offense, it included sufficient details \u2014 including the date of the alleged transport and name of the file allegedly shared \u2014 to protect Brooks from double jeopardy. <em>See United States v. Steele, </em>178 F.3d 1230, 1234-35 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b817-8\">. We also agree with the district court\u2019s alternative ground for denying Brooks's motion: the good-faith exception. Nothing evidences that the officers\u2019 search exceeded the scope of the warrant\u2019s authorization, that the warrant was obtained improperly, or that \u201ca reasonably well trained officer would have known that the search was illegal despite the [search warrant\u2019s] authorization,\u201d <em>See United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 3420 n. 23, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984); <em>United States v. Travers, </em>233 F.3d 1327, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b818-7\">. In support of his argument, Brooks relies mainly on two cases: <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>565 F.3d 1347 (11th Cir.2009), and <em>United States v. Laist, 702 </em>F.3d 608 (11th Cir.2012). These cases, however, involve the reasonableness of the government\u2019s delay in obtaining a search warrant <em>after </em>evidence had already been seized <em>without </em>a warrant. <em>Mitchell </em>and <em>Laist </em>say nothing about the circumstances in which a delay in returning property seized lawfully pursuant to a search warrant may trigger the exclusionary rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b818-13\">. Brooks made no request \u2014 formal or infer-, mal \u2014 for the return of his property before this date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b819-7\">. We reject Brooks's contention that the jury had to stack inferences impermissibly to reach a guilty verdict; the circumstantial evidence of Brooks\u2019s knowing receipt of child pornography was ample.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b820-7\">. The jury acquitted Brooks of the transportation charge and convicted him, instead, of the lesser-included offense of possession of child pornography.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
