The district court denied Bennett\u2019s motion to amend her complaint to add a claim under Louisiana\u2019s whistleblower statute and a claim under \u00a7 1983 for violations of procedural due process, then granted Consolidated\u2019s motion for summary judgement as to the Title VII claims. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-19\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b450-20\">Bennett worked at Consolidated from 1991 until her termination in 2012. Her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>annual reviews during the period of employment reveal a mixed record involving periods of tardiness and excessive personal phone calls, but also periods of stronger performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The \u201ckey event\u201d at the center of this litigation occurred on March 26, 2012. That morning, Bennett drank ice water from a styrofoam cup in her office. After leaving her office for an indeterminate period of time, she returned and took a sip from the same cup, expecting cold water from melted ice. However, the liquid she drank \u201cstarted burning\u201d her mouth, suggesting to her that there was more than just water in the cup. After investigating, Bennett determined that the contents of her cup smelled like the hand sanitizer in a bottle on her desk. She concluded that someone had put hand sanitizer in the cup.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">After discussing the incident with her superiors, Clyde Martin and Nancy Galofa-ro, Bennett reported the incident to Tangi-pahoa County Sheriffs Office (TCSO) the next morning. The TCSO interviewed Bennett, Martin, and Galofaro and took the cup into evidence to investigate. No criminal charges were brought. However, the incident was greatly distressing for Bennett, causing her to cry on multiple occasions. According to Bennett, her superiors treated her poorly in the aftermath of the hand sanitizer incident as she pressed for further investigation, and they yelled and screamed at her because they \u201cwanted [her] to drop\u201d it.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">After her 2012 evaluation, Martin recommended that Bennett receive a 2% cost of living salary increase. Bennett wrote a letter to Board of Commissioners\u2019 (BOC) Personnel Committee \u2014 a four-member committee that makes personnel recommendations to the full nine-member BOC, which governs Consolidated \u2014 protesting the insubstantial nature of her pay increase and questioning whether the lack of a larger raise was related to the hand sanitizer incident and her reaction thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">The Personnel Committee scheduled a meeting with Bennett to discuss her salary-related complaints. At the meeting, Bennett presented the committee with a second letter detailing the hand sanitizer incident. The Personnel Committee then deliberated. According to a member of the committee, Carlo Bruno, a consensus was reached during the deliberation that Bennett\u2019s employment should be terminated for three reasons: (1) her \u201cdocumented history of tardiness, excessive personal telephone calls, excessive personal visitors, and lack of initiative\u201d; (2) a belief among the committee that \u201cBennett manufactured the entire ... hand sanitizer incident\u201d; and (3) Bennett \u201cmisled the Personnel Committee into believing that the purpose\u201d of her meeting with the committee \u201cwas to discuss her 2012 evaluation and pay raise,\u201d but instead \u201cshe focused the meeting almost entirely\u201d on the hand sanitizer incident. The full BOC then voted to terminate Bennett, with one dissenting vote, and Bennett was fired the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">Following her termination, Bennett filed a charge with the EEOC alleging discrimination and retaliation. In response to the charge, Consolidated filed a position statement with the EEOC, denying that Bennett\u2019s termination was discriminatory or retaliatory and asserting that, \u201c[i]n summary, Ms. Bennett was terminated due to her poor performance and failure to perform the assigned work \u2014 not for any other reason.\u201d The position statement specifically referenced Bennett\u2019s \u201creceipt of personal phone calls and visitors at work, her failure to be punctual, and her unproduc-tiveness\u201d as factors that influenced her termination, all of which \u201chad nothing to do with her race, age, or disability.\u201d The EEOC issued a right to sue letter. Subsequently, Bennett filed a workers\u2019 compen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>sation claim based on the hand sanitizer incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Bennett then filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, alleging discriminatory and retaliatory termination under Title VII. Following the close of discovery, Consolidated filed a motion for summary judgment. Along with her opposition brief, Bennett filed a motion to amend her complaint. She sought to add a procedural due process. claim under Loudermill<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and a claim under Louisiana\u2019s whistleblower statute alleging that she was terminated in retaliation for reporting the hand sanitizer incident to authorities. The district court denied Bennett\u2019s motion to amend and granted Consolidated\u2019s motion for summary judgment in its entirety. Bennett timely appealed from both of these decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and applying the same standard as the district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to amend the complaint for abuse of discretion, unless the denial was solely based on the futility of the proposed amendment, in which case we review de novo.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-14\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b452-15\">The district court denied Bennett\u2019s motion to amend the complaint both because it was filed months after the deadline for motions to amend pleadings set by the district court\u2019s scheduling order and because Bennett\u2019s proposed amendment would be futile in light of the statutes of limitations applicable to the contemplated new claims. Bennett contends that both of these grounds were erroneous. Because we conclude that the district court did not err in denying Bennett\u2019s motion on the ground that she failed to establish \u201cgood cause\u201d to amend after the scheduling order deadline, we need not reach the futility ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-16\">Where a motion to amend under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) is filed after the deadline for such motions set by a scheduling order in the district court, Rule 16(b) governs the amendment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under Rule 16(b), once a scheduling order is entered, it \u201cmay be modified only for good cause and with the judge\u2019s consent.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That is, \u201c[a]s to post-deadline amendment, a party must show good cause for not meeting the deadline before the more liberal standard of Rule 15(a) will apply to the district court\u2019s denial.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Good cause under Rule 16(b) \u201crequires a party to show that the deadlines cannot reasonably be met despite the diligence of the party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>needing the extension.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Four factors in particular are relevant to the determination: \u201c(1) the explanation for the failure to timely move for leave to amend; (2) the importance of the amendment; (3) potential prejudice in allowing the amendment; and (4) the availability of a continuance to cure such prejudice.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Bennett failed to establish \u201cgood cause.\u201d Bennett claims that she only learned that she had viable whistleblower and procedural due process claims after reading the declarations of Martin, Galofaro, and Bruno, submitted by Consolidated in connection with its motion for summary judgment, which attributed her termination in part to the Personnel Committee\u2019s shared belief that Bennett manufactured the hand sanitizer incident. However, Bennett conducted no discovery at all. Had she inquired in discovery as to the reasons for her termination, she would have learned prior to the close of discovery and prior to the amendment deadline that the hand sanitizer incident played a role in her termination. Thus, it cannot be said that Bennett exercised diligence, and the first factor weighs heavily in favor of Consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Additionally, allowing Bennett to amend her complaint at this late stage would require the district court to reopen discovery and necessitate new dispositive motions. Thus, Consolidated would suffer prejudice in a manner that cannot be ameliorated by a continuance.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>' Our conclusion that the district court\u2019s determination was a reasonable exercise of discretion is bolstered by the fact that \u201cwe more carefully scrutinize a party\u2019s attempt to raise new theories of recovery by amendment when the opposing party has filed a motion for summary judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Bennett\u2019s motion to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">Bennett also contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on her Title VTI discrimination claim. Under the <em>McDonnell Douglas</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>burden-shifting framework, the plaintiff bears the initial burden of setting forth a prima facie case of discrimination, which requires 'her to \u201cestablish that she (1) is a member of a protected class, (2) was subjected to- an adverse employment action, (3) was qualified for her position, and (4) was replaced by someone outside of the protected class.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> If the plaintiff makes this showing, the burden of production shifts to the defendant to \u201carticulare] a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>employment action.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> If the defendant carries this burden, the plaintiff must establish that the proffered reason is not the true basis for the adverse employment action, but is instead a pretext.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The plaintiff also carries the ultimate burden of proving intentional discrimination.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Here, the district court concluded, and Consolidated does not contest, that Bennett has established a prima facie case of discrimination. Bennett does not dispute that the three reasons offered by Consolidated for her termination \u2014 specifically, (1) that Bennett has a \u201chistory of tardiness, excessive personal telephone calls, excessive personal visitors, and a lack of initiative\u201d; (2) that she manufactured the hand sanitizer incident; and (3) that she misled the Personnel Committee regarding the nature of her request for a meeting \u2014 are nondiscriminatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Instead, Bennett asserts that she has carried her burden of showing that the reasons are pretextual. Specifically, she argues that the explanations given by Consolidated in the district court and on appeal are inconsistent with the reason given by Consolidated in its position statement to the EEOC, and that this inconsistency alone satisfies her burden of demonstrating pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">In its EEOC position statement, Consolidated denied Bennett\u2019s charges of discrimination and retaliation, stating, \u201c[i]n summary, Ms. Bennett was terminated due to her poor performance and failure to perform the assigned work \u2014 not for any other reason.\u201d Consolidated specifically cited Bennett\u2019s \u201creceipt of personal phone calls and visitors at work, her failure to be punctual, and her unproductiveness\u201d as factors supporting the BOC\u2019s decision to terminate. According to Bennett, the fact that Consolidated gave only one reason to the EEOC but has given three reasons for terminating Bennett in this litigation suggests that the reasons now given are pre-textual.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-14\">In support of her argument, Bennett claims that in <em>Burton v. Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.,</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Fifth Circuit set forth a <em>per se </em>rule that inconsistencies between the explanation given to the EEOC and that given to the district court suffice to carry a plaintiffs burden of showing pretext. However, in <em>Burton, </em>we simply held, commonsensically, that a purported reason that only comes to light <em>after </em>the decision to terminate has been made cannot be the real reason for termination; we did not suggest that inconsistencies render a reason \u201cnecessarily illegitimate,\u201d as Bennett asserts.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> To be sure, we also noted that a rationale may be \u201c \u2018suspect\u2019 where it ha[s] \u2018not remained the same\u2019 between the time of the EEOC\u2019s investigation and the ultimate litigation.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> However, in those cases in which we have focused on inconsistent rationales, there has been otherwise strong evidence of pretext.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> No such independent evidence ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>ists here at all, as Bennett\u2019s case depends entirely on the purported inconsistency.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">More importantly, the three reasons given to the district court are not actually inconsistent with the reason given to the EEOC. Rather, the first reason \u2014 a performance-based one involving a history of personal phone calls and visitors, as well as a lack of initiative \u2014 is identical to the explanation given in the position statement, and the other two reasons do not contradict what was told to the EEOC. In <em>Burton, </em>we recognized that reasons for a termination that are merely \u201cadditional,\u201d and not contradictory, do not necessarily suggest pretext.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Indeed, we have never held that an employer giving additional reasons to the district court to supplement those given to the EEOC supports an inference of pretext.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The mere fact that Consolidated\u2019s attorneys provided the EEOC with only one of Consolidated\u2019s three justifications for terminating Bennett\u2019s employment does not constitute a substantial showing of pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The closest Bennett comes to showing that the reasons given to the district court are inconsistent with the reason given to the EEOC is the fact that in the EEOC position statement, Consolidated stated that Bennett was fired based on her performance and \u201cnot for any other reason.\u201d According to Bennett, the disclaimer of other grounds for termination renders any supplementary reason inconsistent. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">In any event, even were Bennett correct that the three rationales offered by Consolidated in this litigation are inconsistent with the reason provided to the EEOC, and that this inconsistency carries her burden of demonstrating pretext, summary judgment would still be appropriate with respect to Bennett\u2019s ultimate burden. For an employer to be liable for discrimination under Title VII, the employee must establish not only that the employer\u2019s purported basis for termination was pretextual, but also \u201cthat the real reason was intentional discrimination.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Although in many circumstances a plaintiff may defeat summary judgment merely by carrying her burden of showing that the defendant\u2019s proffered reason was false, coupled with meeting her initial burden of establishing a prima facie case,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> this result does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>follow in every case.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">In <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., </em>the Supreme Court held that judgment as a matter of law in favor of the employer would be appropriate, notwithstanding a plaintiff raising an issue of fact as to pretext, \u201cif the record conclusively revealed some other, nondiscriminatory reason for the employer\u2019s decision, or if the plaintiff created only a weak issue of fact as to whether the employer\u2019s reason was untrue and there was abundant and uncontroverted independent evidence that no discrimination had occurred.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Interpreting <em>Reeves, </em>we have held that \u201cwhether summary judgment is appropriate\u201d once an employee raises a triable issue as to pretext \u201cdepends on numerous factors, including \u2018the strength of the plaintiffs prima facie case, the probative value of the proof that the employer\u2019s explanation is false, and any other evidence that supports the employer\u2019s case and that properly may be considered.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Here, even if Bennett has cast some minimal degree of doubt on any of Consolidated\u2019s reasons for terminating her employment, her evidence of pretext is weak at best. Additionally, she has not offered even a scintilla of evidence that race had anything to do with the termination.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Accordingly, no reasonable jury could conclude that the real reason for Bennett\u2019s termination was race, and under the framework of <em>Reeves, </em>Consolidated would be entitled to summary judgment even if Bennett carried her burden of showing pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">Additionally, Bennett does not attempt to call into question the explanation Consolidated gave to both the EEOC and the courts \u2014 her lackluster performance. Accordingly, she has failed to carry her burden of \u201crebut[ting] each discrete reason proffered by the employer.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">In sum, Bennett has not put forth evidence that Consolidated\u2019s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for firing her were pretextual, and the district court properly granted summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">In a single sentence of her brief, Bennett also asserts that \u201c[although [she] did not oppose the motion for summary judgment on the retaliation claim [in the district court], that decision must also be reversed for the same reasons that the decision on the discrimination claim must be reversed.\u201d Plainly, even if the retaliation claim had merit, she has waived it.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Moreover, contrary to arguments in Bennett\u2019s reply brief, the position statement\u2019s insistence that Bennett was not terminated in retaliation for reporting the hand sanitizer incident is not inconsistent with Consolidated\u2019s acknowledgment that Bennett\u2019s extended discussion of that incident at her meeting to discuss her raise was a factor in her termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">* # *</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">For the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s decision in its entirety.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b450-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
