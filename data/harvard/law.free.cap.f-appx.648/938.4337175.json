Brothers argues that the administrative law judge failed to account for her limitations in timely completing tasks and responding appropriately to supervisors in the hypothetical question posed to the vocational expert and in the assessment of Brothers\u2019s residual functional capacity. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-16\">The administrative law judge accounted for Brothers\u2019s limitations. The administrative law judge gave \u201cgreat weight\u201d to the findings of Dr. David S. Bailey, a psychologist, that Brothers could understand and complete basic instructions and had extreme limitations in interacting with the public, coworkers, and supervisors. And the administrative law judge gave great weight to the findings of Dr. Clifford Guarnaccia, a state psychologist, that Brothers had \u201csome limitation in understanding and remembering detailed instructions, [yet could] sustain attention for two-hour periods\u201d to \u201ccomplete tasks\u201d with occasional reminders by a supervisor with whom Brothers might \u201cdevelop interpersonal problems\u201d but could \u201cmaintain basic social interactions.\u201d <em>See Sharfarz v. Bowen, </em>825 F.2d 278, 279 (11th Cir.1987). Based on this evidence, the administrative law judge found that Brothers could \u201cwork only where no production rate or pace is required[,] can perform only simple routine tasks, and can work where only occasional interaction with the public and co-workers is required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b963-9\">The administrative law judge also included those limitations in the hypothetical question posed to the vocational expert. <em>See Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1180 (11th Cir.2011). The administrative law judge was not required to refer to supervisors when the residual functional capacity assessment and the hypothetical question included a restriction on Brothers\u2019s social, interaction in the workplace. And the administrative law judge was not required to \u201cspecifically refer to every piece of evidence ... [when his] decision [reveals] ... that [he] considered [Brothers\u2019s] medical condition as a whole.\u201d <em>Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1211 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-10\">We AFFIRM the judgment in favor of the Commissioner.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
