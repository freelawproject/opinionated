He argues that the sentence is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8553(a). Sau-cedo-Canales contends that the illegal reentry guideline renders his sentence unreasonable because it .is without empirical basis and impermissibly double counts his criminal history. He further contends that his sentence excessively penalizes his offense, which is essentially one for interna-tionab trespass, and he urges that the district court failed to adequately consider his personal history and circumstances, including that his prior lenient sentences show that his prior offenses were not serious, that he had not reentered for three years since his last reentry, and that he only reentered due to economic hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">We review sentences for substantive reasonableness, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). As he concedes, Saueedo-Canales\u2019s empirical-data argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009). We have likewise rejected the argument that a guidelines sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is unreasonable because illegal reentry is a mere trespass offense. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). Furthermore, Saueedo-Canales\u2019s sentence, which is at the bottom of the applicable guidelines range, is presumed reasonable. <em>See United States v. Rashad, </em>687 F.3d 637, 644 (5th Cir.2012). His general disagreement with the propriety of his sentence and the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d at 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Saucedo-Canales has not demonstrated that the district court abused its discretion by sentencing him to 27 months, the bottom of the applicable guidelines range. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b482-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
