Davis\u2019s original Guidelines range was 120 to 150 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court determined that his amended Guidelines range is 120 to 125 months\u2019 imprisonment, and after considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it reduced his sentence to 144 months\u2019 imprisonment. Davis now appeals. He argues that the district court incorrectly calculated his amended Guidelines range and abused its discretion by (1) sentencing him above his amended Guidelines range, (2) failing to properly consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and (3) deciding his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion without affording him an opportunity to address the Government\u2019s response to his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion or to contest a memorandum submitted to the court by the Probation Office.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b850-13\">Davis first claims that the district court incorrectly calculated his amended Guidelines range. The crux of Davis\u2019s argument is that the court did not properly apply Guidelines amendments 706, 750, and 782 in calculating his amended range. However, under the Guidelines\u2019 current Drug Quantity Table and Drug Equivalency Tables \u2014 which take into account those amendments<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u2014 Davis\u2019s base offense level is 24,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and his criminal history category is VI. Taken together, that base level and criminal history category result in an amended Guidelines range of 100 to 125 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A. In addition, because the statutory mandatory minimum for one of Davis\u2019s drug offenses at the- time of the offense was 120 months\u2019 imprisonment,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> his Guidelines range cannot include a sentence below 120 months. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 5G1.1(b). Thus, as the district court concluded, Davis\u2019s amended Guidelines range is 120 to 125 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Davis next asserts that the district court abused its discretion in reducing his sentence to a term of imprisonment above his amended Guidelines range.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> According to Davis, the district court only had authority to either (1) deny his request for reduction or (2) reduce his sentence to a term within his amended Guidelines range. But, when an amendment permits a reduction, district courts have discretion to determine the extent of the reduction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(B)(i) (\u201cConsistent with 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2), the court shall consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. 3553(a) in determining: (I) whether a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is warranted; and (II) the extent of such reduction.... \u201d); <em>Smith, </em>568 F.3d at 926-27. And, although the Guidelines specifically limit courts\u2019 authority to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence below his amended Guidelines range, they do not proscribe reduced sentences that are above a defendant\u2019s amended Guidelines range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2). As such, the district court did not <em>ipso facto </em>abuse its discretion by reducing Davis\u2019s sentence to a term of imprisonment above his amended Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">Davis also argues that the district court abused its discretion by failing to properly consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Specifically, he asserts that the court erred because it did not consider his post-sentencing conduct. This argument is without merit. The Guidelines provide that district courts have discretion to consider or forego consideration of post-sentencing conduct.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(B)(iii) (stating that the district court \u201cmay\u201d consider the prisoner\u2019s post-sentencing conduct); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">Finally, Davis argues that the district court abused its discretion by ruling on his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion without providing him an opportunity to address the Government\u2019s response to his motion or to contest the memorandum submitted by the Probation Office. A district court abuses its discretion in resolving a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion if it fails to \u201cfollow proper procedures in making its determination.\u201d <em>See United States v. Jules, </em>595 F.3d 1239, 1241-42 (11th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted and alteration adopted). In a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, \u201ceach party must be given notice of and an opportunity to contest new information relied on by the district court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-12\">Here, the Probation Office memorandum provided new information \u2014 that two Disciplinary Reports have been issued to Davis during his time in prison. Moreover, the Government\u2019s response referenced that information, and it included multiple allegations that appeared to be new because the Government, as it now concedes, mischar-acterized certain facts about Davis\u2019s criminal conduct. Nevertheless, the district court decided Davis\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>without allowing him to respond to either submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">Despite not affording Davis an opportunity to address the Government\u2019s response or the Probation Office memorandum, the district court did not commit reversible error. Assuming that the court erred, the error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Marroquin-Medina, </em>817 F.3d 1285, 1293 (11th Cir.2016) (reviewing a procedural error in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding for harmless error); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>613 F.3d 1305, 1310 n. 7 (11th Cir.2010) (per curiam) (applying harmless error to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings). First, on appeal, Davis has admitted to the two Disciplinary Reports, demonstrating that he would not have contested them before the district court. Second, in putting forth the inaccurate factual allegations at issue, the Government\u2019s response cited to Davis\u2019s Presentence Investigation Report (PSI), and the PSI \u2014 of which the district court had the benefit \u2014 includes the proper account of those facts. Third, after the district court decided Davis\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, he filed replies to the Government\u2019s response and, in the replies, contested the inaccurate factual allegations. But, the district court found Davis\u2019s arguments unconvincing. It construed the replies as motions for reconsideration and denied the motions. For these reasons, the court\u2019s failure to provide Davis an opportunity to address the Probation Office memorandum and the Government\u2019s response was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b850-7\">. Because Davis is proceeding pro se, we have \"liberally construed\u201d his filings \"to afford review on any legally justifiable bas[is].\u201d <em>See United States v. Holt, </em>417 F.3d 1172, 1175 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b850-8\">. Davis also challenges the district court\u2019s decision on two other bases. But, after thorough consideration of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that those challenges fail and do not require discussion here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b850-9\">. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 (amended Nov. 1, 2015); <em>Id. </em>App. C, Amend. 782 (effective Nov. 1, 2014); <em>Id. </em>App. C, Amend. 750 (effective Nov. 1, 2011); <em>Id. </em>App. C, Amend. 706 (effective Nov. 1, 2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b850-10\">. Davis was convicted for various drug crimes, and at his original sentencing for those crimes, he was held responsible for 9.9 grams of cocaine base and 1,594.3 grams of cocaine powder. To determine the Guidelines range for offenses involving multiple types of illegal drugs, we calculate the \"marijuana equivalent\u201d for the total amount of drugs involved. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>772 F.3d 662, 669 (11th Cir.2014). Under the applicable Drug Equivalency Table, those quantities convert to a total of 354.21 kilograms of marijuana equivalent. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1, cmt. n. 8(D). That amount of marijuana equivalent corresponds to a base offense level of 24. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2D1.1(c)(8).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b850-15\">.Davis concedes that the offense \u2014 his conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B)(iii) (2008) \u2014 is subject to a 120-month statutory mandatory minimum.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b851-8\">.

Relatedly, to the extent Davis further asserts that the district court abused its discretion because its \u201creduction\u201d decision was inconsistent with the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we conclude that \u2014 based on our review of the record, including Davis\u2019s significant criminal history \u2014 the decision was within the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
