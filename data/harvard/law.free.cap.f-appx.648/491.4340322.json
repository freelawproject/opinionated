The district court dismissed Shelton\u2019s complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 after determining that the complaint was time barred. Our review is <em>de novo. Harris v. Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153, 156 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"AKX\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, exhaustion of administrative remedies is \u201crequired for any suit challenging prison conditions,\u201d including a <em>Bivens </em>claim. <em>Woodford v. Ngo, </em>548 U.S. 81, 85, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006). As the district court noted, Shelton concedes that even to date, he has never exhausted his administrative remedies. <em>See Huff v. Neal, </em>555 Fed.Appx. 289, 292-93 (5th Cir.2014) (describing the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 four-step administrative process for resolving grievances by inmates, which generally requires an inmate to file within twenty days of the incident both an informal resolution form (BP-8) and a formal Administrative Remedy Request (BP-9) to begin the process).</p>\n<p id=\"AlR\">Shelton argues that he is entitled to equitable tolling because he was transferred to state custody a mere three days after the assault and was not provided federal administrative forms. However, he was returned to federal custody in 2005 and yet still waited until 2012 to file any administrative form with the Bureau of Prisons (BOP).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Even if Shelton had had the benefit of equitable tolling during the time he was in state custody, his 2012 filing still would not have met the twenty-day deadline for filing the BP-8 and BP-9 forms. Furthermore, Shelton has never filed the remaining administrative forms necessary to exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See Huff, </em>555 Fed.Appx. at 293 (explaining that there are four steps to exhausting BOP administrative remedies, which requires filing forms BP-8 through BP-11, and \u201c[a]n inmate has not exhausted his administrative remedies until his claim has been denied at all levels\u201d). Because Shelton has not exhausted his administrative remedies, the district court properly dismissed his complaint. <em>Woodford, </em>548 U.S. at 90, 93-94, 126 S.Ct. 2378 (holding that exhaustion of administrative remedies is still required to bring a federal suit, even when administrative remedies are no longer available due to the inmate\u2019s failure to meet the administrative deadlines: \u201cProper exhaustion demands compliance with an agency\u2019s deadlines and other critical procedural rules \u2014 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"A_m\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b515-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AtM\">. Shelton argues that he should be exempt from the administrative deadlines because when he returned to federal custody in 2005 and attempted to utilize the administrative process, his counselor told him it was too late to file a grievance since the assault had occurred thirteen months earlier. While we have granted equitable tolling when a defendant \"has actively misled a plaintiff about the cause of action or has prevented him \u2018in some extraordinary way from asserting his rights,\u2019 \u201d Shelton\u2019s counselor\u2019s advice was technically correct and, more importantly, there is no evidence the defendants actually prevented Shelton from filing an administrative form. <em>Wilson v. U.S. Penitentiary Leavenworth, </em>450 Fed.Appx, 397, 399 (5th Cir.2011) (quoting <em>Teemac v. Henderson, </em>298 F.3d 452, 456 (5th Cir.2002)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
