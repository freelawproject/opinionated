Gabriel contends that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. Gabriel also seeks reassignment to a different district judge on remand. Reversible error has been shown; we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing without direction of reassignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence \u2014 whether it is imposed inside or outside the guidelines range \u2014 under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\">In sentencing an individual defendant, the district court must first consider the applicable guidelines range, the parties\u2019 arguments, and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>at 596. The district court then \u201cmust make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597. The district court must also \u201cadequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A district court commits \u201csignificant procedural error\u201d when it, among other things, fails to calculate properly the guidelines range, fails to consider the section 3553(a) factors, or fails \u201cto adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After determining that a sentence is procedurally sound, we review the sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness under the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">At Gabriel\u2019s sentencing hearing, after confirming the parties had no objections to the Presentence Report, the district court made the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-11\">[Tjhis Court feels that the guidelines in this case, which is a criminal offense level ten, criminal history category I, that gives you an exposure of up to twelve months imprisonment, is totally out of touch. They haven\u2019t taken into consideration how credit card and counterfeit credit card fraud has just gone viral in this country. There\u2019s a credit card fraud being committed every five seconds and something has to stop this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b946-12\">The parties presented arguments to the court; each party requested a sentence of 6 months\u2019 imprisonment. Before imposing Gabriel\u2019s sentence, the district court made these comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-13\">Mr. Gabriel, even though, fortunately, you got caught only after a loss of $439, you had pre-encoded cards with your name on it that had a potential of thousands of dollars, $9000, and probably would have defrauded somebody if you hadn\u2019t been caught.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-14\">As I said earlier, the guidelines in this case the Court thinks are inappropriate. And the public has to know that if they try to defraud other people and steal their identity, they\u2019re going to have to pay for it. This has to stop somehow.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b946-15\">The court then sentenced Gabriel to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-16\">On appeal, Gabriel first argues that the district court erred procedurally by failing to calculate his advisory guidelines range. The district court made no mention of Gabriel\u2019s guidelines range of 6 to 12 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court did, however, state correctly Gabriel\u2019s criminal offense level and criminal history category, and that the guidelines provided for \u201cexposure of up to twelve months imprisonment.\u201d At this point, we see no \u201csignificant procedural error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">Gabriel goes on to contend that the district court erred by failing to consider the section 3553(a) factors. We stress that nothing \u201crequires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (the district court\u2019s explicit acknowledgement that it considered the parties\u2019 arguments and the section 3553(a) factors is sufficient). Moreover, we have affirmed a sentence as proeedurally reasonable where the district court failed entirely to state that it had considered the section 3553(a) factors, but where the record otherwise demonstrated that the district court had considered the sentencing factors. <em>See United States v. Dorman, </em>488 F.3d 936, 944 (11th Cir.2007) (no procedural error occurred because the district court discussed facts pertinent to several section 3553(a) factors in ruling on defendant\u2019s objections and motion for a downward departure).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">Here, as in <em>Dorman, </em>the district court made no mention of the specific section 3553(a) factors and failed to state more broadly that it had considered the statutory factors in imposing Gabriel\u2019s sentence. But this case is different from <em>Dorman. </em>The district court in <em>Dorman </em>imposed a within-guidelines sentence and engaged in a detailed discussion of facts specific to the case that also pertained to the section 3553(a) factors. <em>See id. </em>at 944-45. Given the brevity of the district court\u2019s comments in this case and our precedent, we conclude that the record is insufficient to establish that the district court considered the array of factors necessary for proper sentencing \u2014 including the section 3553(a) factors \u2014 especially when imposing an above-guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">Next, Gabriel contends that the district court erred proeedurally when it failed to explain adequately the chosen sentence. A district court is required \u201cat the time of sentencing,\u201d to \u201cstate in open court the reasons for its imposition of a particular sentence.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c). In doing so, a district court must \u201ctailor its comments to show that the sentence imposed is appropriate, given the factors to be considered as set forth in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d 1176, 1181 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">\u201cThe appropriateness of brevity or length\u201d of the court\u2019s stated reasons \u201cdepends upon circumstances\u201d and is left in large part \u201cto the judge\u2019s own professional judgment.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The district court must, however \u201cadequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">The Guidelines are not mandatory. Nevertheless, one \u201ccircumstance\u201d important in determining the adequacy of the district court\u2019s explanation is whether the sentence imposed is inside or outside the guidelines range. \u201c[W]hen a judge decides simply to apply the Guidelines to a particular case, doing so will not necessarily require lengthy explanation.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468 (concluding that the district court\u2019s statement that the within-guidelines sentence was \u201cappropriate\u201d was legally sufficient because the case was \u201cconceptually simple\u201d and the record evidenced the district court considered the parties\u2019 arguments and supporting evidence). As the Supreme Court did in <em>Rita, </em>we have affirmed within-guidelines sentences as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>procedurally reasonable where the district court provides a brief explanation of the sentence imposed and the record establishes clearly that the court considered the section 3553(a) factors. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Agbai, </em>497 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2007) (no procedural error when the court described the case as \u201ccookie-cutter\u201d and discussed the need for deterrence and to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, because the record indicated the court considered the section 3553(a) factors and concluded that the guidelines range was proper in a mine-run case); <em>Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d at 1181-82 (no procedural error when the district court explained that the sentence imposed was \u201cconsistent with\u201d the guidelines, \u201caccords with the array of factors specified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553,\u201d \u201cadequately reflects the seriousness of the offense,\u201d and was \u201cneither greater nor lesser than necessary to achieve the statutory purposes of sentencing\u201d and where the record made it <em>\u201cobvious </em>the court considered many of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d (emphasis in original)); <em>cf. United States v. Veteto, </em>920 F.2d 823, 826-27 (11th Cir.1991) (vacating as procedurally unreasonable a within-guidelines sentence where the district court stated only that the sentence \u201cseemed right\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">Meanwhile, the imposition of a sentence outside the advisory guideline range often necessitates a more detailed explanation. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (requiring a sentencing court to state \u201cthe specific reason for the imposition of a sentence\u201d outside the advisory guidelines range); <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468 (a judge imposing a sentence outside the guidelines range \u201cwill explain why he has done so\u201d). In <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081 (11th Cir.2008), we concluded that the district court failed to explain adequately its reasons for varying below the guidelines range. Even though the district court listed expressly the section 3553(a) factors and explained that it viewed the sentence imposed as \u201cappropriate\u201d based on those statutory factors, we concluded the record allowed no meaningful appellate review because the district court offered \u201cno reasoning or indication of what facts justified\u201d the variance or of \u201chow the below-guidelines sentence furthered the purposes of sentencing.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1089, 1093-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">We accept that, in some circumstances, the district court may vary categorically from the guidelines range based solely on a policy disagreement with the guidelines. <em>See Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574-75, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) (involving the 100:1 crack to powder cocaine ratio). The district court\u2019s decision to do so, however, is entitled to \u201cgreatest respect\u201d when the court determines that the case falls \u201coutside the heartland\u201d of cases contemplated by the Sentencing Commission and is subject to \u201ccloser review\u201d in a \u201cmine-run case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the District Court does not tell us enough about why this defendant got this sentence or whether this case is a mine-run case or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">In this case, the record evidences no \u201cindividualized assessment based on the facts presented\u201d and contains no comments tailored to explain how the specific sentence imposed is appropriate for this defendant, in the light of the section 3553(a) factors. Instead, the district court concluded that the \u201cguidelines in this case\u201d were \u201cinappropriate\u201d and \u201ctotally out of touch\u201d given that credit card fraud has recently \u201cgone viral.\u201d Although the district court discussed somq facts pertinent to the section 3553(a) factors, it is not \u201cobvious\u201d from the record that the court decided on the sentence based on the parties\u2019 arguments or the section 3553(a) factors. We also cannot determine whether the district court based its sentencing decision solely on a policy disagreement with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>the guidelines or whether the court considered Gabriel\u2019s case to be a \u201cmine-run case\u201d or one that falls \u201coutside the heartland.\u201d Given the record and the pertinent case-law, we cannot conclude that the district court\u2019s explanation \u2014 which is not focused on the circumstances of this case and this defendant-for the above \u2014 guidelines sentence is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">Because Gabriel\u2019s sentence is procedurally unreasonable, we need not address his arguments about substantive reasonableness. We vacate Gabriel\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">We deny Gabriel\u2019s request for reassignment on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">VACATED AND REMANDED.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b949-13\"> We note that the district court also appears to have violated the rule set forth in <em>United States v. Jones, </em>899 F.2d 1097, 1102-03 (11th Cir.1990), when it failed at the sentencing hearing to \"elicit [] fully articulated objections following the imposition of sentence,\u201d This omission played no part in our decision to vacate Gabriel's sentence and to remand; we mention the omission only so that the district court may elicit such objections upon resentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
