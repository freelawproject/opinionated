Their dispute arises out of an accident that occurred during the ambulatory transportation of a two-year-old patient. Children\u2019s Hospital hired Gold Cross to transport the patient and Children\u2019s Hospital\u2019s \u201ccritical care team,\u201d which consisted of a nurse and a therapist, to an airport in Georgia. Two Gold Cross employees drove the ambulance, which was owned by Gold Cross, while the patient, nurse, and therapist rode in the back. When they arrived at the airport, the Gold Cross employees began removing the patient from the ambulance. During that process, the stretcher to which the patient was bound tipped over onto the tarmac. It was later discovered that the girl had been paralyzed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">The patient\u2019s father and a guardian <em>ad litem, </em>sued Gold Cross and Children\u2019s Hospital jointly. (They also sued the Gold Cross employees, who were later dismissed.) Gold Cross ultimately settled the claims against it and Children\u2019s Hospital for $9 million. In its settlement agreement, Gold Cross expressly reserved the right to pursue a contribution claim against Children\u2019s Hospital. Exercising that right, Gold Cross filed a complaint in Georgia state court seeking contribution from Children\u2019s Hospital under Georgia law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Children\u2019s Hospital removed the case to federal court and later moved for summary judgment on the contribution claim. Gold Cross cross-moved for summary judgment and, in the alternative, requested that the court certify the contribution question to the Georgia Supreme Court. The district court denied Gold Cross\u2019 request to certify the question and granted summary judgment to Children\u2019s Hospital. <em>See Gold Cross EMS, Inc. v. Children\u2019s Hosp. of Ala., </em>79 F.Supp.3d 1316 (S.D.Ga.2015). Gold Cross then moved for reconsideration, which the district court denied. <em>See Gold Cross EMS, Inc. v. Children\u2019s Hosp. of Ala., </em>108 F.Supp.3d 1376 (S.D.Ga.2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-7\">Georgia law recognizes \u201cthe right of contribution between settling joint tort-feasors when there has been no apportionment of damages by a trier of fact.\u201d <em>Zurich Am. Ins. Co. v. Heard, </em>321 Ga.App. 325, 740 S.E.2d 429, 432 (2013). However, \u201c[w]here no judgment finding both tortfea-sors liable has been entered ... the party seeking contribution must prove that his own negligent action and those of the alleged joint tortfeasors jointly caused the harm.\u201d <em>Suggs v. Hale, </em>278 Ga.App. 358, 629 S.E.2d 11, 15 (2006) (quotation marks and alterations omitted). In other words, the party seeking contribution must show that the alleged joint tortfeasor committed \u201cseparate and independent acts of negligence.\u201d <em>Zimmerman\u2019s, Inc. v. McDonough Const. Co., </em>240 Ga. 317, 240 S.E.2d 864, 866 (1977) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">Gold Cross cannot establish that Children\u2019s Hospital committed any independent acts of negligence that contributed to the harm at issue here. The evidence shows that Gold Cross\u2019 employees, and only Gold Cross\u2019 employees, were handling the stretcher when it tipped over on the tarmac. Gold Cross asserts that Children\u2019s Hospital\u2019s nurse, who was at least present during the accident, was negligent in failing to supervise Gold Cross\u2019 employees when they removed the child from the ambulance. However, Gold Cross cites no Georgia case law to support the proposition that Children\u2019s Hospital had such a duty and, aside from that, they do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>explain how Children\u2019s Hospital\u2019s supervision would have prevented Gold Cross\u2019 employees from dropping the stretcher.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\">Gold Cross contends that even if it cannot establish independent acts of negligence, it is still entitled to contribution. It argues that Children\u2019s Hospital is vicariously liable for the negligence of Gold Cross\u2019 employees because those employees were borrowed or joint servants of both Children\u2019s Hospital and Gold Cross, and that Children\u2019s Hospital and Gold Cross were therefore joint employers or joint masters.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Even if Gold Cross could seek contribution based on Children\u2019s Hospital\u2019s potential vicarious liability, Gold Cross has failed to establish that its employees were borrowed or joint servants of Children\u2019s Hospital. To succeed on that theory, Gold Cross would have to show that. Children\u2019s Hospital exercised \u201ccomplete control\u201d over Gold Cross\u2019 employees. <em>See Food Giant v. Davison, </em>184 Ga.App. 742, 362 S.E.2d 447, 448-49 (1987); <em>Garden City v. Herrera, </em>329 Ga.App. 756, 766 S.E.2d 150, 152-53 (2014). Based on the record before us, Gold Cross cannot establish that control.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Gold Cross next contends that it is entitled to contribution because Children\u2019s Hospital could not delegate its duty of care to Gold Cross. Specifically, Gold Cross argues that because Children\u2019s Hospital operates an ambulance service and ambulance services are common carriers, Children\u2019s Hospital owed a non-delegable duty of extraordinary diligence to its passengers. That argument fails because Children\u2019s Hospital was not acting as an ambulance service or as a common carrier at the time the patient was injured. <em>See DeMott v. Old Town Trolley Tours of Savannah, Inc., </em>328 Ga.App. 657, 760 S.E.2d 703, 706 (2014) (finding that common carrier\u2019s duty of extraordinary diligence is not implicated when \u201cno carrier-passenger relationship existed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">Finally, Gold Cross contends that the district court erred in denying its request to certify the following question to the Georgia Supreme Court: \u201c[W]hether Georgia law permits contribution between two employers, masters or principals ... both of whom were alleged to be vicariously liable in tort for the acts or omissions of joint employees or agents, where one has paid all of the cost of settling the claim against the two entities.\u201d The decision to certify a question of state law is discretionary. <em>See Lehman Bros. v. Schein, </em>416 U.S. 386, 390-91, 94 S.Ct. 1741, 1744, 40 L.Ed.2d 215 (1974). Because the Gold Cross employees were not joint or borrowed servants, this case does not raise the question Gold Cross identifies. As such, the district court did abuse its dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>cretion in refusing to certify that question to the Georgia Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">AFFIRMED,</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">. In that action, Gold Cross also asserted a claim for breach of a joint defense agreement. That claim is not relevant to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">. In the district court Gold Cross also argued that it and Children\u2019s Hospital were engaged in a joint venture. In its opening brief, however, Gold Cross makes only passing references to its joint venture theory, fails to develop or elaborate any argument about that issue, and does not cite any case law or other authorities relevant to that argument. Thus, despite its protestations to the contrary in its reply brief, Gold Cross has abandoned that argument. See <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003) (finding that a party abandoned an issue when he made only \"passing references\u201d to it in his opening brief); <em>United States v. Woods, </em>684 F.3d 1045, 1064 n. 23 (11th Cir.2012) (noting that a party abandons an issue \u201cby failing to develop any argument on it in his opening brief\u201d); <em>United States v. McKinley, </em>732 F.3d 1291, 1295 n. 1 (11th Cir.2013) (deeming an issue abandoned when a party \"did not elaborate any argument regarding [the issue] in his initial brief or cite any authority relevant to such an argument\u201d); <em>United States v. Evans, </em>473 F.3d 1115, 1120 (11th Cir.2006) (stating that this Court will not consider \"arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief\u201d) (quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
