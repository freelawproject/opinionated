Humphrey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    512 U.S. 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    129 L.Ed.2d 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994). The district court held that \u00a7 356 does not toll Appellant James Mills's \u00a7 1983 claims and thus, all but two of Mills's claims are time-barred. Because\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   did not legally prevent Mills from filing his \u00a7 1983 claims during his criminal appeal, we agree with the district court. We also find Mills's remaining claims were properly dismissed, not because those claims are barred by collateral estoppel, but because reversal of Mills's conviction was not a favorable termination. We therefore affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 14, 2013, Covina Police Department Officer Terrance Hanou pulled Mills over for a traffic stop after seeing Mills exit a hotel and drive to another hotel. Hanou claimed he pulled Mills over because his vehicle registration was expired. Mills alleges Hanou noticed Mills \"for no reason other than his physical appearance-large framed, bald headed, Caucasian,\" and that when Hanou checked Mills's vehicle license, the database showed the registration was current.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Hanou acknowledged Mills's registration was valid but asked to search Mills's car. Mills refused. Hanou then made two calls to his supervisor and asked Mills if there were any weapons in the vehicle. Mills\n   informed Hanou of an unloaded shotgun in the cargo compartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Hanou requested that Mills exit the vehicle and Mills complied. Hanou immediately handcuffed Mills, conducted a pat down search, and found $10,000 cash on Mills's person. Hanou then searched Mills's vehicle and found the shotgun and an additional $7,000 cash. After the search, Hanou arrested Mills claiming he found illegal drugs and \"a smoking device\" in Mills's vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Prior to Mills's criminal trial, Mills moved to suppress evidence of the alleged drugs, arguing Hanou's search violated his Fourth Amendment rights. The California Superior Court denied the motion. At trial, Hanou testified he found drugs during the search. Mills testified \"there were no drugs in his vehicle,\" \"there was evidence that the drugs were planted,\" and Mills's counsel closed by stating, \"Mr. Mills did not have drugs in his car. Those drugs were planted, and he's not guilty.\" On June 6, 2014, Mills was convicted of one count of possession of a controlled substance (methamphetamine) and one count of possession of a smoking device and was sentenced to eighteen months' probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 3, 2016, the California Court of Appeal overturned Mills's conviction. The Court of Appeal held, in an unpublished opinion, that Hanou violated Mills's Fourth Amendment rights by searching the vehicle without probable cause and therefore, the Superior Court erred by denying Mills's suppression motion. Because \"[t]he methamphetamine Hanou recovered from the center console and the methamphetamine and methamphetamine pipe he recovered from the luggage formed the evidentiary basis for [Mills's] convictions in th[e] case,\" the Court of Appeal held that further proceedings below would be an \"idle gesture,\" and remanded for dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 22, 2016, Mills filed this suit against the City of Covina, Covina Police Chief Kim Raney, and Hanou, alleging, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , claims for: (1) unlawful stop and detention, (2) false arrest, (3) false imprisonment, (4) malicious prosecution, (5) failure to screen and hire properly, (6) failure to train properly, (7) failure to supervise and discipline, and (8)\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   municipal liability against the City of Covina. The district court dismissed all but Mills's \u00a7 1983 claim for malicious prosecution and the related\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim as time-barred. The district court held that\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   \"did not bar [Mills] from filing his claims while he was subject to a criminal prosecution,\" and thus, California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 356 did not toll his claims during the pendency of his criminal appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mills filed two amended complaints against only the City of Covina and Hanou (collectively \"Appellees\") alleging, under \u00a7 1983, claims for: (1) malicious prosecution and (2)\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   municipal liability. On August 4, 2017, Appellees moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that Mills's amended claims were barred by collateral estoppel or, in the alternative, that Mills failed to establish a favorable termination of his criminal proceedings. The district court held that collateral estoppel barred Mills from relitigating the issue of whether he possessed drugs, and thus, probable cause was conclusively established. The district court did not reach Appellees' favorable termination argument. Mills now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The parties and the district court agree that those claims accrued on April 14, 2013, when the search was conducted and Mills was arrested. That is correct. \"[T]he accrual date of a \u00a7 1983 cause of action is a question of federal law ....\"\n   <em>\n    Wallace v.

California's two-year statute of limitations for personal injury actions thus applies to Mills's claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20335.1\">\n    Cal.

His claims would therefore be time-barred absent tolling. The parties agree that California Government Code \u00a7 945.3 tolled the statute of limitations during Mills's criminal\n   proceedings in the Superior Court, but not during his criminal appeal. The parties also agree that, but for additional tolling, the statute of limitations elapsed during Mills's criminal appeal. Mills, however, argues that California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 356 tolled the statute of limitations during the pendency of his criminal appeal because he was legally prevented from bringing those claims during that period by the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   . We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Under \u00a7 356, \"[w]hen the commencement of an action is stayed by injunction or statutory prohibition, the time of the continuance of the injunction or prohibition is not part of the time limited for the commencement of the action.\" As Appellees argue, a judicially created bar to commencing an action appears to fall outside \u00a7 356 based on its plain language. The California Supreme Court, however, has explained that \u00a7 356\"has been applied in situations where the action is legally prohibited by other means than injunctions or statutory prohibition.\"\n   <em>\n    Hoover v. Galbraith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2277347\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-3d/7/519/#p526\">\n    7 Cal. 3d 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 526,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=102%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20733\">\n    102 Cal.Rptr. 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=498%20P.2d%20981\">\n    498 P.2d 981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1972) (collecting cases). Indeed, while the California Supreme Court has not specifically addressed the impact of a judicially created bar on \u00a7 356, it has held \"that the running of the statute of limitations is suspended during any period in which the plaintiff is legally prevented from taking action to protect his rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Dillon v.
