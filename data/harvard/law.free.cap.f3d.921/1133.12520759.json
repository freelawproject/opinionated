Because Redlin failed to file the action within six months after the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) mailed a notice of final denial of Redlin's initial claim, and the statute of\n   limitations did not restart when the VA declined to consider Redlin's second attempt to file the same claim, we affirm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We begin with an overview of the legal framework governing FTCA claims.

According to his complaint, Michael Redlin was treated at a VA facility in Tucson, Arizona. Beginning on or about September 25, 2014, the VA \"failed to promptly diagnose and discontinue treatment of a chest tube placed within the plaintiff's lung parenchyma [internal lung structures and tissues] which resulted in permanent damage and loss of pulmonary function.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Redlin presented a claim based on this September 25, 2014 incident to the VA on a standard government claim form.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The claim, which requested damages of $ 200,000, was received by the agency on January 7, 2015. The VA issued a final denial of Redlin's claim in a letter dated July 14, 2015, and sent to Redlin by certified mail. The VA's denial letter stated that, after conducting an investigation, the VA had determined that \"there was no negligent or wrongful act on the part of an employee of the [VA] acting within the scope of employment that caused [Redlin] compensable harm.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As required by the regulations,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2014.9\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 14.9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), the denial letter set out the steps Redlin could take if he was \"dissatisfied with this decision.\" First, Redlin could file a request for reconsideration with the VA General Counsel. \"To be timely, VA must\n   <em>\n    receive\n   </em>\n   this request within six months of the mailing of this final denial.\" Alternatively, Redlin \"may file suit directly under the FTCA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201346\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and 2671 - 2680,\" and seek judicial relief in a federal district court. If Redlin took the latter course, he \"must initiate suit within\n   six months of the mailing of this notice as shown by the date of this denial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Redlin did not file a suit in federal court or a request for reconsideration with the VA by January 14, 2016, six months after the VA's final denial on July 14, 2015. Instead, on January 13, 2016, Redlin mailed a second claim form to the VA, referencing the same September 25, 2014 incident, along with a letter from his counsel. The letter stated that Redlin had previously submitted a claim that had been denied on July 14, 2015, and described the new form as a \"Supplemental Administrative Claim\" meant \"to provide additional information regarding [Redlin's] negligence claim, and to increase the amount he is demanding for damages\" to $ 2,000,000. The VA received this second claim on January 22, 2016, which was past the six-month statute of limitations set out in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), and past the six-month deadline to file a request for agency reconsideration set out in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2014.9\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 14.9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In a letter dated February 11, 2016, the VA informed Redlin's counsel that its July 14, 2015 denial letter constituted the agency's final action on Redlin's claim. Because the second claim was not received until January 22, 2016, the VA \"could not consider it to be a timely request for reconsideration\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2014.9\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 14.9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). It concluded that \"[s]ince VA has already investigated and denied a claim regarding Mr. Redlin's allegations, [it] cannot consider the supplemental claim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Six months after the VA's letter regarding Redlin's second claim, on August 10, 2016, Redlin filed this suit against the United States based on the September 25, 2014 incident. The United States moved to dismiss the action under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on the ground that it was barred by the applicable statute of limitations,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The district court granted the government's motion to dismiss. The court reasoned that because more than six months had elapsed between the VA's final denial of Redlin's claim on July 14, 2015, and the filing of Redlin's lawsuit on August 10, 2016, the suit was time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Redlin filed a timely notice of appeal. The district court had jurisdiction over this action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201346\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). We have jurisdiction to review its final order of dismissal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

On appeal, Redlin advances several arguments as to why the district court nonetheless erred in dismissing his lawsuit as untimely. We consider each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   First, Redlin argues that his second claim, which was received by the VA on January 22, 2016, should be deemed a timely amendment of his first claim, or a timely request for reconsideration. We disagree. If his second claim is deemed to be an amendment, it is not timely. The regulations allow a claim to be amended \"at any time prior to final agency action\" or, where there has been no final agency action\n   within six months of a claimant's filing, prior to a claimant's exercise of the option to file suit in federal court under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202675\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2014.2\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 14.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Because Redlin's second claim was received by the VA after it mailed its final denial, it was not timely. Similarly, if Redlin's second claim is deemed to be a request for reconsideration it is likewise not timely: it was received by the VA on January 22, 2016, which was more than six months after the VA mailed its notice of final denial of his claim on July 14, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gervais\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10525204\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/865/196/#p197\">\n    865 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   196-98 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2014.9\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 14.9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Therefore, the second claim did not toll the six-month time frame for filing a lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Second, Redlin raises a statutory argument. He argues that he fully complied with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) because he presented his administrative claim to the agency within two years of the date the claim accrued, and he filed his district court action within six months of the VA's denial of his second claim on February 11, 2016. According to Redlin, the district court erred in applying\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2014.2\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 14.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) to hold that the second claim was not a timely amendment. Redlin reasons that because the statute permits a claimant to file a claim with the agency at any time during the two-year period after the claim accrues, the agency had no authority to promulgate a regulation that would prevent the claimant from amending that claim during this period. Such a regulation, Redlin argues, impermissibly shortens the two-year statute of limitations, and is thus an unreasonable interpretation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Following this reasoning, Redlin asserts that if a claimant chooses to present an amended claim to the agency after the agency has mailed a final notice of denial for the initial claim, but within two years of the claim's accrual, the agency must mail a new final denial as to the amended claim. The new final denial, Redlin argues, would restart the six-month time frame in which the claimant could file a legal action. In Redlin's view, a claimant could continue this process of presenting amended claims and receiving new final denials during the entire two-year period after the claim accrued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We disagree. Section 2401(b) provides that an action must be brought within six months \"after the date of mailing\" of notice of final denial of the claim.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). This language makes clear that the limitations period begins running as soon as the agency mails its initial final notice,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parker v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535002\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/935/176/#p177\">\n    935 F.2d 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 177 (9th Cir. 1991) ; nothing in the statute indicates that subsequent notices from the agency could alter or extend the running of the six-month period on the tort claim at issue. Indeed, if claimants could make successive filings regarding the same claim, and each filing required the agency to make a successive denial that restarted the statute of limitations on that claim, the six-month limitations period would effectively be read out of the statute. Because we must generally \"give effect to every word of a statute wherever possible,\"\n   <em>\n    Leocal v.
