We affirm the district court's application of Washington law and its discovery sanctions against Appellants, but reverse its grant of summary judgment in Ace's favor and remand for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Damage to the gas purification plant\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellants, Ingenco Holdings, LLC and its wholly owned subsidiary, Bio Energy (Washington), LLC (collectively, \"Ingenco\") operate a gas purification plant at the Cedar Hills landfill in King County, Washington. The plant converts raw landfill gas into usable natural gas. The final step of the purification process involves the removal of excess nitrogen from the landfill gas in a nitrogen rejection unit, or \"NRU\". The gas is directed through adsorbent beads, to which nitrogen adheres, contained within pressure vessels. The beads, which are essentially a filter medium, cannot withstand the direct pressure of the\n   landfill gas inflow, which, if unmediated, can grind the beads down into dust. To reduce the force of the gas flow on the beads, a \"diffuser basket\" is suspended from the top of, and surrounds, each bead-filled pressure vessel. The diffuser basket, in particular its perforated bottom plate, acts as a shield that prevents the full force of the incoming landfill gas from striking the beads directly. Instead, the incoming stream of gas strikes the diffuser basket's bottom plate first, is diffused, and then passes through the beads in the pressure vessel with reduced force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The diffuser basket bottom plate, or shield, is secured to the rest of the diffuser basket by metal straps, or brackets. On October 1, 2010, the metal straps securing the bottom plate of pressure vessel number thirty-two's (\"V32\") diffuser basket broke and the bottom plate fell away, leaving the beads in V32 unprotected. The parties dispute the reason for the breakage. Ace maintains that the bottom plate flexed, leading to excess stress upon, fractures in, and ultimately failure of, the metal straps. Ingenco contends that the bottom plate could not flex unless subjected to pressures far greater than those present within the nitrogen rejection unit. Instead, Ingenco posits, the flow of landfill gas caused the bottom plate's metal straps to vibrate at a frequency that coincidentally matched the straps' natural vibration frequency, or resonant frequency.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   These unforeseeable vibrations, Ingenco argues, caused the metal straps to change shape and break.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Whatever the cause of the strap breakage, once the diffuser basket's bottom plate fell away from the assembly, there was no longer any shield in place to protect the adsorbent beads from the full pressure of the incoming stream of landfill gas. The unmediated gas flow pulverized the 30,000 pounds of beads in V32 into dust, resulting in an automatic total shutdown of the facility on October 5, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ingenco thought it had removed, or would be able to remove, the dust from all gas processing systems, and re-started the facility on October 13, 2010. Unbeknownst to Ingenco, however, dust from the pulverized beads in V32 had infiltrated other parts of the system, including other bead-containing pressure vessels. Dust from the V32 beads abraded against undamaged beads in the other pressure vessels, degrading those beads as well. Eventually, the accumulation of bead dust forced an automatic shutdown of the plant in March 2011. The plant remained idle for several months as Ingenco investigated alternative nitrogen filtration options and undertook repairs. Ingenco did not begin cleanup or repair operations until November 2011. The plant resumed operation in August 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The insurance coverage dispute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Ingenco filed a property damage and business interruption insurance claim with Ace in May 2011. Ingenco's all risks insurance policy, issued by Ace, covered against \"all risks of direct physical loss or damage occurring ... from any external cause.\" The policy, however, excluded \"[f]aulty or defective material, faulty workmanship, faulty methods of construction, [or] errors or omissions in plan or specification or designs ... unless loss by a peril not otherwise excluded ensues ....\" The policy also excluded \"[g]radual deterioration, depletion, inherent vice, [or] latent defect ..., unless such loss is caused directly by\n   physical damage not otherwise excluded ....\" A separate Boiler and Machinery endorsement (\"the Endorsement\") covered property damage and business losses \"resulting from an Accident\" to a pressure vessel. The Endorsement's definition of \"Accident,\" however, excluded \"depletion, deterioration[, ... and] wear and tear.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Ace denied coverage on several grounds. Ace claimed that, as a threshold matter, Ingenco failed to comply with a notification provision that required Ingenco to notify Ace of all losses. Specifically, Ace claimed that Ingenco failed to notify Ace of both the October diffuser shield failure and the resulting loss of beads in V32 until May 11, when the plant shut down for the second time. With respect to coverage, Ace took the position that Ingenco's losses were not caused by any \"external\" force, but rather from defects in the diffuser basket and the overly delicate adsorbent beads. Thus, Ace reasoned, without an \"external cause\" there was no covered loss, and even if there were an external cause, coverage would nevertheless be lacking under the \"defective material,\" \"wear and tear,\" \"deterioration,\" and other, similar exclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Procedural history\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ingenco brought suit in the Western District of Washington, alleging causes of action for breach of contract and declaratory relief, as well as statutory claims under Washington's Consumer Protection Act and Insurer Unfair Conduct Act. The parties eventually filed cross motions for summary judgment. The district court granted Ingenco's motion insofar as Ingenco argued that Washington law should apply to all claims, and that, under Washington law, Ingenco's alleged failure to comply with the policy's notice provision did not preclude coverage absent prejudice to Ace. The court ruled for Ace, however, that Ingenco's losses did not result from an \"external cause,\" but rather from an \"inherent problem in the system,\" which system had been designed to withstand the \"external\" force at issue, i.e., the landfill gas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The district court also ruled that the \"ensuing loss\" exception to the \"defective material\" exclusion did not apply to create coverage because there was no covered loss in the first place. In a similar vein, the district court concluded that Ingenco's losses were caused by wear and tear resulting from normal operation, and therefore fell outside the Endorsement's definition of covered \"Accident.\" Lastly, the district court ruled that, even in the event of coverage, business interruption losses would be limited to the \"hypothetical\" reasonable repair period, regardless of the actual time necessary to complete repairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In a separate order, the district court found that Ingenco had failed to timely disclose or produce evidence related to its state law bad faith claims. As a discovery sanction, the district court precluded Ingenco from introducing any such evidence and, accordingly, dismissed Ingenco's statutory claims for lack of proof of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Ingenco now appeals the district court's orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We review grants of summary judgment, and partial grants of summary judgment, de novo.\n   <em>\n    Flores v.

Choice of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Ingenco is a citizen of Virginia. Ace is a citizen of Pennsylvania. The gas processing plant at issue here is located in Washington, where Ingenco filed suit. The district court engaged in a lengthy choice of law analysis, much of which is unchallenged by the parties. The court properly determined, for example, that Washington's choice of law rules control in this diversity matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Patton v. Cox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9452666\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/276/493/#p495\">\n    276 F.3d 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 495 (9th Cir. 2002). The court also properly determined that an actual conflict exists between Washington and Virginia law. Specifically, the district court observed that under Virginia law, an insured's compliance with a notice provision in an insurance contract is a condition precedent to coverage even where there is no prejudice to the insurer, while under Washington law, an insurer must demonstrate prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State Farm Fire &amp;Cas.

The district court also correctly determined that Washington looks to Section 188 of the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws to resolve contract choice of law questions involving multiple-risk policies and looks to Section 145 of the Restatement for tort issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Milgard Mfg., Inc. v. Illinois Union Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. C10-5943 RJB,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%203298912\">\n    2011 WL 3298912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5-8 (W.D. Wash. Aug. 1, 2011). The parties do not dispute these conclusions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The parties do dispute, however, whether the district court correctly concluded that Washington law applies. The Restatement provides that the local law of the state with the \"most significant relationship to the transaction and parties\" should control, and that the most significant relationship can be determined by reference to five factors: (1) the place of contracting; (2) the place of negotiation; (3) the place of performance; (4) the \"location of the subject matter of the contract[;]\" and (5) the residence, place of incorporation, and place of business of the parties. Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 P 188(2) (1971). Notably, the Restatement further\n   provides that \"[t]hese contacts are to be evaluated according to their relative importance with respect to the particular issue.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%203298912\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    1. The place of contracting\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Restatement defines \"the place of contracting\" as \"the place where occurred the last act necessary ... to give the contract binding effect ....\" Rest. (Second) Conflict of Laws \u00a7 188, cmt. e;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    First Commerce, LLC v. Sheldon\n   </em>\n   , No. 213 CV 01915 RFB GWF,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205791542\">\n    2016 WL 5791542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (D. Nev. Sept. 29, 2016). The parties dispute whether the insurance contract, or at least the addition of the Washington gas processing plant (the \"Cedar Hills facility\") to an existing insurance policy, was entered into in Washington or Virginia. Both sides, however, conflate the \"place of contracting\" factor with the \"place of negotiation\" factor. Indeed, all of the parties' citations to the record appear to pertain more to negotiation of the insurance contract than to its execution. Given that Ingenco's risk manager, Raymond Yerly, and Ace's managing agent, Tim Drag, met in Virginia and were both located in Virginia, it seems likely that the contract was executed in Virginia. In any event, however, \"standing alone, the place of contracting is a relatively insignificant contact.\" Rest. (Second) Conflict of Laws \u00a7 188, cmt. e.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    2. The place of negotiation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The record is also somewhat unclear with respect to the place of negotiation. Yerly and Drag did have in-person meetings in Virginia. Ingenco's broker, who communicated with Drag, also appears to have been located in Virginia. Drag acknowledged, however, that prior to the addition of the Washington Cedar Hills facility to the policy, Ace investigated the Washington plant, presumably in person, and that up to fifty percent of Ace's due diligence may have occurred in Washington. Furthermore, some of the negotiations may have occurred by telephone from different states. Neither Yerly nor Drag could recall having a substantive, in-person meeting regarding the Washington facility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the place of negotiation factor is either neutral, or perhaps weighs slightly in favor of Ace and Virginia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rest. (Second) Conflict of Laws \u00a7 188, cmt. e (\"This contact is of less importance when there is no one single place of negotiation and agreement, as ... when the parties do not meet but rather conduct their negotiations from separate states by mail or telephone.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    3. The place of performance\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   With respect to the place of performance, neither party identifies where Ingenco performed, either by paying premiums or otherwise. Ace asserts that its own place of performance was Virginia because the policy states that any loss is to be \"adjusted with\" and payable to Ingenco, and Ingenco's mailing address is in Virginia. The meaning of the policy's \"adjusted with\" language is not entirely clear, but suggests that Ace will adjust any claim in collaboration with Ingenco. Ace's managing agent, however, acknowledged that roughly fifty percent of the adjustment of Ingenco's claim took place in Washington, and that the rest took place in New York, not Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   With respect to payment of insurance benefits, some courts have held that the place of performance is the place where payment under a policy would be made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pinnacle Realty Mgmt.

The location of the subject matter of the contract\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Ace argues that the location of the subject matter of the contract \"mostly covers Virginia property.\" This argument depends entirely on the fact that the policy at issue here covers thirteen locations in Virginia and only one in Washington. That emphasis is misplaced, however. The policy in question covers eighteen separate facilities across five states. Although Virginia is home to the largest number of insured facilities, the coverage amount for the lone Washington facility dwarfs the combined coverage amounts of all seventeen other facilities, let alone the amounts of the thirteen Virginia facilities. The Cedar Hills facility is insured for $35 million in property losses and $12 million in business interruption losses, while the other seventeen facilities are insured for a total of approximately $31.3 million.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, it cannot be said that the policy covers \"mostly\" Virginia property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Furthermore, to the extent Ace argues that Section 188 factors look to a jurisdiction's relationship with a contract, rather than with a specific property, Ace cites no authority, and ignores the language of Section 188 itself, which states that contacts \"are to be evaluated according to their relative importance\n   <em>\n    with respect to the particular issue\n   </em>\n   .\" Rest.

Here, the fortuity analysis is complicated somewhat by Ingenco's inconsistent references to both \"flow induced vibrations\" and \"the process gas\" as the cause of its losses, as discussed above. Were the inquiry focused on the fortuity of \"the process gas,\" Ingenco could not possibly succeed, as it is undisputed that all parties fully expected the stream of landfill gas to enter the Cedar Hills facility and, as Ingenco concedes, the incoming stream of gas never exceeded expected tolerances. The focus of our fortuity analysis, however, is not on the fortuity of the process gas or some other cause, but rather on whether Ingenco's\n   <em>\n    loss\n   </em>\n   was fortuitous. There is no evidence in the record that the failure of the diffuser basket cover plate straps, or the subsequent obliteration of the adsorbent media, was inevitable. Nor is there any evidence in the record that either party had reason to believe, at the time the policy issued, that the diffuser basket cover would fail under normal gas pressures, or that the adsorbent media would ever be exposed to an unmediated stream of high\n   pressure gas. Lastly, Ingenco's expert opined that the resonant vibrations in the metal straps were not, and could not have been, reasonably foreseen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Magi, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 790 F.Supp. at 1047-48 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Burlington v.

Thus, it appears that Ingenco's loss was indeed fortuitous, or that there is, at the very least, a triable issue of fact regarding the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    3.

It would seem to be inconsistent with the broad protective purposes of \"all risks\" insurance to impose on the insured ... the burden of proving the precise cause of the loss or damage. It is not surprising, therefore, that courts which have considered claims under insurance policies with essentially the same insuring language as the policy before us have consistently refused to require the insured to demonstrate that the loss or damage was occasioned by an external cause.

On the one hand, landfill gas was certainly essential to the\n   <em>\n    operation\n   </em>\n   of the Cedar Hills facility.

The district court based that conclusion on its determination that because the purification system, and in particular the diffuser basket, was (1) designed to withstand landfill gas and (2) failed to do so, it must have suffered from an inherent defect. This logic, which Ace essentially reiterates on appeal, is difficult to square, particularly in the all risks context. Although, in general, system failures of any kind can conceivably result from an inherent defect, so too might failures occur for some other, justifiably unexpected reason.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    City of Burlington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9112594\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/332/38/#p49\">\n    332 F.3d at 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[I]n hindsight[, ] structural defects might appear inevitable, ...

The district court stated that the V32 diffuser basket was \"not necessarily defective,\" and acknowledged that Ingenco presented \"some evidence that the [diffuser] basket may not have been defectively designed.\" This observation is impossible to reconcile with the district court's conclusion on summary judgment that an inherent defect nevertheless existed. Ingenco's expert opined not only that resonant vibrations caused\n   the V32 shield failure, but also that such failure was rare, that the vibrations were unforeseeable and, perhaps for that reason, that the relevant design codes do not require testing for resonant vibrations. Although Ace's experts certainly disagree, that genuine dispute of fact is material to the questions whether (1) the gas purification system, or V32's diffuser basket and its adsorbent beads, did, in fact, suffer from an inherent defect and (2) accordingly, whether the cause of Ingenco's loss was internal or external.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   We therefore conclude that the district court's grant of summary judgment to Ace on the question of whether Ingenco's loss was the result of an \"external cause\" must be reversed. The district court, and to some extent, the parties, failed to consider the role of fortuity in all risks insurance disputes. There is, at least, a dispute of fact as to whether Ingenco's loss here was fortuitous. We take no position at this juncture on the question whether the Washington Supreme Court would require a separate showing of external causation. Even assuming, however, that Ingenco must make such a showing, and even assuming that \"external cause\" is coterminous with \"inherent defect,\" there is a triable issue of fact as to whether Ingenco's purification system, and/or its components, suffered from such a flaw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Ensuing Loss Exception\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Ingenco's all risks policy excluded losses resulting from \"[f]aulty or defective material, faulty workmanship, faulty methods of construction, [or] errors or omissions in plan or specification or designs ... unless loss by a peril not otherwise excluded ensues ....\" Ingenco argues that, even if V32's diffuser basket was defectively designed, and even if its failure therefore constitutes an uncovered \"internal\" cause of loss, the \"ensuing loss\" exception quoted above preserves coverage for the post-failure damage to the adsorbent beads throughout the purification system. Ace's opposition is based largely upon the contention, discussed at length above, that the damage at issue here did not result from an \"external cause.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   As Ingenco points out, the Washington Supreme Court discussed ensuing loss exclusions in\n   <em>\n    Vision One, LLC v.

Ingenco concedes that the loss of the V32 diffuser shield was not covered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ingenco argues, however, that because the destruction of the adsorbent beads occurred subsequent to the shield failure, the ensuing loss provision should operate to cover the bead-related loss, regardless of the fact that the shield failure itself is excluded. In response, Ace argues that \"nobody is concerned with damage to the diffuser basket itself,\" and thus the bead-related damage is not an\n   <em>\n    ensuing\n   </em>\n   loss, but rather the excluded loss itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Ace's argument appears to be inconsistent with its prior assertion that the high-pressure stream of landfill gas was the internal cause of Ingenco's loss.\n   <em>\n    Vision One\n   </em>\n   counsels that the key question is whether \"the loss that ensues\n   <em>\n    from the excluded event\n   </em>\n   is covered or excluded.\"\n   <em>\n    Vision One\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4021808\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/174/501/\">\n    174 Wash.2d at 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=276%20P.3d%20300\">\n    276 P.3d 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Ace's understanding of \"the excluded event\" is difficult to pin down. In the external cause context, Ace argues that the stream of landfill gas was an internal, causative event, and was thus excluded. In the ensuing loss context, in contrast, Ace appears to suggest a different precipitating \"excluded event,\" suggesting that the breakdown of the adsorbent beads is the primary event. At the same time, however, Ace also states that the loss of the beads was \"caused by the diffuser basket's defective design,\" suggesting yet a third potential preliminary, excluded cause. Ace cannot have it both (or all three) ways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Proceeding, therefore, with the understanding that the loss of the adsorbent beads did ensue from some prior, but excluded loss or event, whether it be the stream of gas or the failure of the diffuser shield, the question remains whether the loss of the beads was itself excluded.\n   <em>\n    Vision One\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4021808\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/174/501/\">\n    174 Wash.2d at 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=276%20P.3d%20300\">\n    276 P.3d 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, to compare these facts to the examples cited in\n   <em>\n    Vision One\n   </em>\n   , is the loss of the beads more akin to the fire damage in the mis-wiring example or to the mold in the defective construction case? We conclude that the answer is the former. Although in the latter example, the mold did ensue from faulty construction, the ensuing loss provision nevertheless did not preserve coverage because mold itself was an excluded peril.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=276%20P.3d%20300\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, there was no specific exclusion regarding the loss of the beads, just as in the mis-wiring example, there was no specific exclusion for fire.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, even if it were conclusively established that the diffuser shield suffered from some inherent defect, the subsequent destruction of the adsorbent beads would be covered under the policy's ensuing loss exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The Endorsement's \"Accident\" coverage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Ingenco also argues that the separate Boiler and Machinery endorsement to the policy independently confers coverage for Ingenco's losses. The Endorsement covered \"Accident[s],\" defined as a \"sudden and accidental breakdown of an Object,\" exclusive of \"depletion, deterioration, ... [and] wear and tear ....\" As discussed above, Ingenco's experts opined that the \"truly sudden\" breakdown of V32's diffuser shield, which resulted in the\n   destruction of the adsorbent beads in V32 and throughout the system, was the \"unexpected\" result of unanticipated resonant vibrations that were \"not foreseeable.\" Thus there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the Endorsement applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Actual Time of Repair\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Assuming, for the sake of argument, that there is coverage, the policy covers business interruption losses for \"only such length of time ... as would be required with the exercise of due diligence and dispatch to rebuild or replace\" damaged property. Ingenco did not resume operations at Cedar Hills for approximately sixteen months after the second, March 2011 shutdown. Nor did Ingenco perform any remedial work at the facility for approximately nine months, during which time Ingenco evaluated alternative options for nitrogen removal. Nevertheless, Ingenco seeks to recover for the entire sixteen-month shutdown period. Ace argues that Ingenco's business interruption recovery should be limited to the \"theoretical period of restoration.\" The district court largely agreed with Ace, concluding that the applicable period \"is limited to the hypothetical period of restoration.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Some courts have held that the applicable period for an insured to reenter business is the \"theoretical replacement time.\"\n   <em>\n    Vermont Mut.

Other courts have agreed that it makes \"perfect sense\" to look first to actual time of repair in cases where businesses have completed repairs or resumed operations by the time a court is presented with the task of interpreting coverage provisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SR Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%20827074\">\n    2005 WL 827074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Alevy\n   </em>\n   , repairs had already been made by the time Ace denied Ingenco's claim. We conclude that under such circumstances, the actual time of repair has some bearing on what period \"would be required with the exercise of due diligence and dispatch to rebuild or replace\" damaged property. We further observe, however, that Ingenco does not argue, nor does any authority appear to state, that the applicable repair period should be measured by \"actual replacement time\" even where the actual time to repair is unreasonable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, although\n   Ingenco's actual time to repair might be relevant to the question whether a sixteen-month shutdown was consistent with \"the exercise of due diligence and dispatch,\" it is by no means dispositive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Sanctions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The district court determined that Ingenco willfully withheld evidence of damages on its state law statutory claims.

The district court observed that Ace requested damages information in written interrogatories several months before Ingenco ultimately, after an additional request from Ace, provided the information at a Rule 30(b)(6) deposition. Furthermore, Ace points out, as did the district court, that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(1)(A)(iii) requires the disclosure of \"a computation of each category of damages claimed by the disclosing party-who must also make available ... the documents or other evidentiary material ... on which each computation is based, including materials bearing on the nature and extent of injuries suffered,\" regardless whether the opposing party requests such information. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)(A)(iii). The district court concluded that Ingenco's initial disclosures, which were never supplemented, never disclosed any damages information related to statutory claims. Here, on appeal, Ingenco has not presented any argument explaining this failure to meet its affirmative obligations under Rule 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   When a party fails to disclose information required by Rule 26, Rule 37(c)(1) provides that the improperly withheld information should be excluded, unless the failure to disclose is \"substantially justified or harmless.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1). Here, the district found that Ingenco's eleventh hour disclosure was not substantially justified, and was not harmless because it disrupted both Ace's and the court's schedules. Although the court's prejudice explanation was not particularly detailed, its conclusion was not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The district court also recognized that, because exclusion of Ingenco's statutory damages evidence as a Rule 37(c) sanction would be dispositive of Ingenco's statutory claims, which require a showing of damages, the court was required to consider (1) whether Ingenco's noncompliance involved willfulness, fault, or bad faith, and (2) whether lesser sanctions were available.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    R&amp;R Sails\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3741236\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/673/1240/#p1245\">\n    673 F.3d at 1247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court made the required findings of willfulness, fault, and bad faith, supported\n   by evidence that Ingenco (1) ignored Ace's written interrogatories, (2) never complied with its Rule 26 obligations, or even attempted to do so until one day before the discovery cutoff, and then (3) attempted to blame Ace for those failures instead of justifying or explaining them. The district court also explained that a lesser sanction would not be appropriate because (1) Ingenco had not put forth any viable alternative and (2) any lesser sanction requiring the reopening of discovery would have interfered with the impending trial date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in sanctioning Ingenco for failure to disclose statutory damages information to Ace, even though those sanctions resulted in the dismissal of Ingenco's statutory claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   For the reasons stated above, we\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   the district court's orders in part, insofar as they apply Washington law and exclude evidence of damages for purposes of state law claims as a discovery sanction.
