First,\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   applied the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Matchett\n   </em>\n   to hold that the Guidelines are not susceptible to void-for-vagueness challenges no matter whether a prisoner was sentenced before or after\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5922473\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/1350/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5922473\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/1350/\">\n    at 1354-55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, although the Supreme Court has held that the new legal rule of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   applies retroactively to cases on collateral review because it is \"substantive,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Welch v.

In brief,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   was a substantive decision that entitled prisoners sentenced under the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act to relief because it made clear that the law had never authorized their convictions and sentences. By contrast, a new rule extending\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   to set aside pre-\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   career-offender sentences-all of which fall within the substantive statutory ranges prescribed by\n   Congress-would require only the procedural formality of a resentencing in which the district court would have the power to impose exactly the same sentence as before. Such a rule, as we concluded in\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   , would not be substantive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5922473\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/1350/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5922473\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/1350/\">\n    at 1355-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To my mind, this nutshell summary of\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   's second holding says all that needs to be said. But, because some of my colleagues see the matter differently, this statement explains at greater length why a new rule extending\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   's void-for-vagueness holding to invalidate pre-\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   career-offender sentences would not be substantive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I divide my discussion in three parts. First, I explain that the rationale underlying the retroactivity of substantive rules is that courts lack the authority to enter a judgment of conviction or impose a sentence the substance of which the law does not authorize, and I explain that the new rule that Judge Martin's statement advocates would not be substantive in this sense because the sentences it would invalidate were imposed within the statutory ranges established by Congress. Second, I explain that Judge Martin's counterargument cannot be squared with\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   . Third, I respond briefly to Judge Rosenbaum's statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    A.

Every sentence that has ever been imposed under the Guidelines-either before or after\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   -falls within the statutory range of punishment\n   prescribed by Congress for the defendant's offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mistretta v.

And every court that has ever imposed a sentence under the Guidelines had the authority to impose a sentence within the statutory range.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Take Stoney Lester as an example. Lester pleaded guilty in 2003 to distributing more than five grams of crack cocaine, an offense with a statutory range of five to 40 years of imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), (b)(1)(B)(iii). The sentence he received under the Guidelines-21 years and 10 months-was squarely within the statutory range and, as such, within the authority granted to the district court by Congress. So even if the career-offender provision that was used to calculate Lester's sentence under the Guidelines were somehow unconstitutionally vague, the substantive exception would not extend to Lester's sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   To look at the same idea from a different angle, consider the result if Lester or a similarly situated prisoner prevailed in a vagueness attack on the career-offender sentencing Guideline. A successful vagueness challenge would establish only that the district court improperly relied on an unacceptably unclear directive in arriving at the prisoner's sentence. But it would not in the slightest establish that the district court lacked the authority to impose the substantive sentence at which it arrived. On the contrary, as\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   observed, the district court could impose exactly the same sentence on remand after the appellate court corrected its error.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5922473\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/1350/\">\n    823 F.3d at 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The \"Mandatory Guidelines\" and\n   </em>\n   Booker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Judge Martin's statement responds that this reasoning \"fundamentally misunderstands how the mandatory Guidelines worked\" because it ignores that, before\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   , \"the\n   <em>\n    shortest\n   </em>\n   sentence the District Court was legally allowed to give [Lester]\" \"[o]nce categorized as a career-offender\" was greater than \"the\n   <em>\n    longest\n   </em>\n   sentence he could have received if not deemed a career offender.\" Statement of Martin, J., at 48. The argument is not expressly framed in terms of whether the district court had the substantive authority to impose Lester's sentence, but to translate it into those terms is easy enough. In this view, it does not matter to retroactivity that the district court could sentence a pre-\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   career offender like Lester to the same term of imprisonment\n   <em>\n    today\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 49. Instead, the critical point is that-without the career-offender\n   provision-it lacked the substantive authority to impose the sentence\n   <em>\n    then\n   </em>\n   , in the pre-\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   era when the Guidelines dictated what sentences were \"legally allowed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   This response contains an important internal tension. In Judge Martin's account, the putative unconstitutionality of the career-offender Guideline, which her statement contends was established by the Supreme Court's 2015 decision in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , must \"relate back\" to the time of Lester's sentencing in 2003; otherwise, there would be no ground to argue that Lester's sentence was substantively invalid. But the advisory nature of the Guidelines, which was established by the Supreme Court's 2005 decision in\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   , must\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   relate back to Lester's sentencing. If\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   's construction of the Guidelines' legal status was the correct view of the law at the time of Lester's sentencing, then the \"mandatory Guidelines\" did not exist in a legal sense, did not limit the district court's discretion to choose an appropriate sentence within the statutory range, and did not render his actual sentence substantively invalid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The premise that the Sentencing Guidelines were in the strictest sense legally binding before\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   pervades Judge Martin's statement.

But that cannot be right. If\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   's effect was to change the essential legal status of the Guidelines from mandatory to advisory, then it must have been one of two things: either a legislative amendment that removed the textual command that courts apply the Guidelines as mandatory,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), from the Sentencing Reform Act and replaced it with a provision that the Guidelines be treated as advisory or, alternatively, a constitutional amendment that newly prohibited the mandatory application of the Guidelines.

To be sure, an act of Congress instructed that the sentencing court \"shall impose a sentence of the kind, and within the range,\" defined in the Guidelines,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), and district courts thought that this mandatory instruction was legally binding. The courts of appeals thought so too. But, if\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   is right, we were all wrong. The law-not judges' understanding of the law, but the\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   law-was otherwise. The Sixth Amendment forbade the mandatory application of the Guidelines whenever they prescribed a sentence greater than the law allowed based only on the facts reflected in a guilty verdict or plea. And, as interpreted by\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   in the light of that constitutional prohibition, the Sentencing Reform Act did not prescribe the mandatory application of the Guidelines in any other circumstances either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The district court\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   err when it sentenced Lester, but the error was not imposing an illegal sentence under a mandatory, but unconstitutionally vague, sentencing Guideline. Instead, its error-an error that also happened to be shared by every other district court at the time-was treating the career-offender Guideline as mandatory in the first place. To be sure, that was an error of \"constitutional significance,\" as\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   confirmed. Statement of Martin, J., at 49. But it was a\n   <em>\n    procedural\n   </em>\n   constitutional error, not a substantive one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Varela v.

And, although Judge Martin's statement suggests that my acknowledgment of that error should convince me to \"agree to fix the sentences mistakenly imposed as mandatory,\" the whole point of\n   <em>\n    Teague\n   </em>\n   is that merely procedural \"mistake[s]\" do not warrant the extraordinary \"fix\" of collateral relief. Statement of Martin, J., at 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   That job is reserved for substantive rules, and, in the light of\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   cannot possibly have established that the district court lacked the substantive authority to impose Lester's sentence. If the sentencing court had known what\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   later clarified to be the correct understanding of the law, it would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   have recognized that, \"[b]y law, the longest sentence [Lester] could ... receive[ ] ... was 151 months.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48 (emphasis omitted). Instead,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   or no\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , it would have recognized that it was \"legally allowed,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , to impose\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   sentence within the statutory range of five to 40 years-just as it could if it sentenced Lester today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Of course, we do not know what sentence Lester would have received if the district court had been aware of what\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   later held. But all we need to know is whether his sentence was within the substantive authority of the district court at the time it was imposed. And it clearly was. So\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   was absolutely right to hold that a new rule extending\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   to set aside pre-\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   sentences based on the career-offender Guideline would not be substantive and would not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    C.

And the third part propounds a doctrine of judicial lawmaking that contradicts\n   <em>\n    Marbury\n   </em>\n   's rationale for judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The first part of Judge Rosenbaum's statement quarrels with my account of the substantive exception. I am not sure Judge Rosenbaum's belief that the exception concerns equally\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   action by any branch, not just the judiciary, can be squared with basic habeas principles or with the precedents-all of which stress the sentencing \"court['s] lack[ ] [of] power to exact a penalty that has not been authorized by any valid criminal statute,\"\n   <em>\n    Welch\n   </em>\n   , 136 S.Ct. at 1268 ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Siebold\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4636\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/100/371/#p375\">\n    100 U.S. at 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We think [habeas lies],\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   , if the laws are unconstitutional and void,\n   <em>\n    the Circuit Court acquired no jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   of the causes.\" (emphases added)), or the habeas court's lack of \"authority to leave in place a conviction or sentence that violates a substantive rule,\"\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   , 136 S.Ct. at 731 -but I also doubt that it matters. After all, my argument is that Lester's sentencing court did not exceed its powers because the statutory provision that purported to limit its sentencing discretion was unconstitutional and therefore void. Far from \"gloss[ing] over th[e] constitutionally significant problem\" of the mandatory application of the Guidelines, Statement of Rosenbaum, J., at 55, I argue that\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   's holding that their mandatory application was unconstitutional controls the question we are discussing. And it establishes that the only rule the district court violated when it sentenced Lester was procedural, not substantive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The second part of Judge Rosenbaum's statement identifies the heart of my argument, but it offers no meaningful response. I have said that statements like \"\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   made the Guidelines advisory\" are ubiquitous but not precisely accurate. Judge Rosenbaum's statement responds only by confirming that they are ubiquitous but makes no effort to refute my point that they are imprecise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 58-60. I have said that courts used to treat the Guidelines as mandatory but that, as\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   held, they committed legal error by doing so. Judge Rosenbaum's statement responds only by insisting that courts used to treat the Guidelines as mandatory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 60. Her statement's flotilla of quotations from the United States Reports,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 58-59, ignores, first, that\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   held that the literal sense of those statements is false and, second, that courts routinely describe the terms and intended effects of statutes\n   <em>\n    as if\n   </em>\n   they were valid even as they hold the opposite.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611443\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1461/#p1486\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that the unconstitutional Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act \"banned the authorization of sports gambling in casinos\" and \"prohibited the spread of state-run lotteries\");\n   <em>\n    Marbury\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121268\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/5/1/\">\n    5 U.S. at 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The authority ...\n   <em>\n    given\n   </em>\n   to the supreme court ... appears not to be warranted by the [C]onstitution ....\" (emphasis added)). The second part's only direct response to my argument-that \"the\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   Court did not make the Guidelines advisory because they were always advisory, since the Sixth Amendment never allowed them to be mandatory\"-is that it \"is certainly interesting on a metaphysical level.\" Statement of Rosenbaum, J., at 60.

This long sentence was required by law at the time because the sentencing court had to treat Mr. Lester as a \"career offender\" under the then-mandatory United States Sentencing Guidelines. The Eleventh Circuit's binding precedent required the sentencing judge to count Mr. Lester's past conviction for walkaway escape as a \"crime of violence\" under a provision of the career-offender guideline known as the \"residual clause.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a) (2003). If Mr. Lester had not been sentenced as a \"career offender,\" his term of incarceration would have been at least nine years shorter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   About eleven years after he was sentenced, the Supreme Court invalidated the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act.\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Happily for Mr. Lester, things turned out better for him in the Fourth Circuit. That court said Mr. Lester's sentence contained a \"fundamental defect.\" Specifically, the Fourth Circuit said Mr. Lester's longer sentence based on his walkaway escape conviction was fundamentally defective since the Supreme Court had made plain that this should not count as a crime of violence.\n   <em>\n    Lester v.

Va. Feb. 27, 2019). He served 15 years and seven months in prison. This was more than two-thirds of the sentence originally imposed on him, and three years longer than he would have served if his walkaway escape conviction had not counted in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   I asked the Court to withhold the issuance of the mandate in Mr. Lester's case, in hopes that we could correct what I see as two errors in\n   <em>\n    In re Griffin\n   </em>\n   . First, I believe\n   <em>\n    In re Griffin\n   </em>\n   erroneously held that the mandatory Guidelines are not subject to vagueness challenges. Second, I think\n   <em>\n    In re Griffin\n   </em>\n   was wrong to say that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   does not apply retroactively in mandatory Guidelines cases. This Court declined to take up either issue. In making that decision, the Court also denied Mr. Lester all relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   I wrote a dissent from the denial of en banc rehearing to express my disagreement with\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   . But since Mr. Lester has won his freedom, there is no longer a need for en banc review of his case. Still, I am mindful that Mr. Lester is breathing free air solely because of a happenstance administrative decision to move him to a prison in the Eastern District of Virginia, together with his savviness in filing a \u00a7 2241 petition while he was there. Failing either one of these things, Mr. Lester would have been required to serve six more years in prison. His case is a testament to the arbitrariness of contemporary habeas law, where liberty can depend as much on geography as anything else. It also illustrates how limited is relief for the thousands of inmates sentenced within the Eleventh Circuit and whose sentence\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   affected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Not all inmates will be moved out of this Circuit. Also,\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   continues to stand as binding precedent in this Circuit.

If he had not been designated a career-offender, the law would not have permitted a sentence of higher than 151 months. Once he was designated a career-offender, however, the law did not permit the District Judge to impose a sentence of less than 262 months. The mandatory Guidelines established sentences in the same way ACCA does. Under ACCA, three prior qualifying convictions require a minimum fifteen-year sentence instead of a maximum ten-year sentence.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).

And just before excising the statutory provision that made the Guidelines mandatory, the Supreme Court stated that the Guidelines \"are not advisory; they are mandatory and binding on all judges\" because \u00a7 3553(b)\"directs that the court 'shall impose a sentence of the kind, and within the range' established by the Guidelines.\"\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925862\" index=\"374\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/220/\">\n    543 U.S. at 233-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925862\" index=\"375\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/220/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (opinion of Stevens, J.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Indeed, the Pryor Statement's conclusion today that the Guidelines \"were\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   really mandatory\" conflicts even with Judge William Pryor's own prior statements. Judge Pryor has previously described the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 as \"ma[king] the Guidelines mandatory.\"\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3682099\" index=\"376\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/708/#p718\">\n    607 F.3d at 717-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In fact, as I have noted, Judge Pryor found that \"[b]ecause Congress\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   sentencing courts to apply the Sentencing Guidelines and impose a sentence within the applicable guidelines range, it was reasonable to view the Guidelines as effectively setting minimum and maximum penalties that varied based on the circumstances of the offense and the characteristics of the offender.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3682099\" index=\"377\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/708/#p718\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). And he explained that \"the Court in ...\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   ... made the Guidelines advisory.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3682099\" index=\"378\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/708/#p718\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Today, though, the Pryor Statement chalks these remarks up to a failure of linguistic precision and seeks to rewrite history.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pryor Statement at 17. According to the Pryor Statement, the\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   Court did not make the Guidelines advisory because they were always advisory, since the Sixth Amendment never allowed them to be mandatory.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. That is certainly interesting on a metaphysical level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   But it ignores reality. Back here on Earth, the laws of physics still apply. And the Supreme Court's invalidation of a law does not alter the space-time continuum. Indeed, there can be no dispute that from when the Guidelines were adopted in 1984 to when the Supreme Court handed down\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   in 2005, courts mandatorily applied them, as \u00a7 3553(b) required, to scores of criminal defendants-including many who still sit in prison because of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   It's also a particularly mindboggling bit of judicial fiction to, in one breath, conclude that the Guidelines were always advisory, and in the next, withhold relief from individuals in Lester's circumstances by noting the advisory Guidelines do not apply retroactively because\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   is a procedural rule, even though, according to the Pryor Statement, the Guidelines always were advisory. Under the Pryor Statement's reasoning, the Guidelines were\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   mandatory, but to inmates like Lester, they will\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   be mandatory, since these prisoners remain subject to their punishment. This heads-I-win-tails-you-lose logic cannot withstand scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Either the Guidelines were never mandatory, in which case, Lester and inmates like Lester would not have been sentenced under the mandatory regime or at least would not remain in prison because of the mandatory regime (a circumstance that is clearly not the case), or they were mandatory until\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   ruled they weren't, and inmates like Lester can mount\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   challenges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The last portion of the Pryor Statement that warrants a response is its theory that when\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   invalidated the mandatory nature of the Guidelines, that was really just a change in \"judicial doctrine,\" but not \"a change in law.\" Pryor Statement at 16. According to the Pryor Statement, the Supreme Court could not have made the Sentencing Guidelines advisory because the \"Supreme Court wields judicial power, not legislative power\" and therefore \"has no power to amend the text or meaning of any statute ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   To be sure, the \"Supreme Court wields judicial power, not legislative power\" and therefore \"has no power to amend the text or meaning of any statute.\" But that does not mean the Supreme Court's actions do not, in a very real sense, change the law. In my view, there are at least two problems with the Pryor Statement's line of thinking to the contrary: it ignores the reality of what happened in\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   , and it undermines the courts' constitutional power of judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   First, I address what happened in\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   . When the United States went to sleep on January 11, 2005,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"379\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) was the law of the land, and sentencing courts were required to \"impose ... sentence[s] of the kind, and within the range\" established by the Guidelines.

Call it a change in doctrine, law, policy-pick the noun-but the reality will always be the same: the Court's change effectively excised the Guidelines' mandatory language from the United States Code, rendering what were once statutorily imposed mandatory Guidelines advisory. Importantly, the Court had a duty under the Constitution to make this change to our law because \"[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\"\n   <em>\n    Marbury v. Madison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121268\" index=\"383\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/5/1/\">\n    5 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Cranch 137, 177,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121622\" index=\"384\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/5/137/\">\n    2 L.Ed. 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1803). And here, \u00a7 3553(b)(1) violated the Constitution. That leads to my second point. Our duty to \"say what the law is\" likewise makes it our job, when a statute is unlawful, to render it unenforceable by saying what the Constitution requires\n   of the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121622\" index=\"385\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/5/137/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"If two laws conflict with each other, the courts must decide on the operation of each.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   The Federalist No. 78. So while it is true that the \"Supreme Court ... has [only] the authority to say what a statute means,\" Pryor Statement at 17, sometimes those statements necessarily force a change in the law. And under our Constitution, those changes are every bit as valid and must be followed every bit as much as if Congress itself had enacted them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   is a good example; one day the Guidelines were mandatory, and the next day they were not, solely because of the Supreme Court's opinion striking down \u00a7 3553(b)(1). So while we can pretend that the Supreme Court's decisions do not \"change[ ] the law,\" Pryor Statement at 17, the reality is that in our constitutional system, sometimes they can and they do. And as I have noted, when that happens, those changes are just as valid under our constitutional system as if Congress had statutorily enacted them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Finally, I must respond to Judge Pryor's charge that this Statement does not \"say what the law is,\" but rather what I supposedly think \"it should be.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pryor Statement at 27 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Marbury\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121268\" index=\"386\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/5/1/\">\n    5 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   177 ) (quotation marks omitted). I trust that any honest reading of this Statement soundly rebuts that accusation. Nor does daring to disagree with the Pryor Statement's analysis make my analysis either what I think the law \"should be\" or immodest. And I will let the irony of the Pryor Statement's suggestion to the contrary speak for itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   In short,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   's rule applies retroactively when an unconstitutionally vague law results in the application of a fixed sentencing range that is higher than it otherwise would have been. Pre-\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   , when courts applied the career-offender guideline, that resulted in a higher mandatory minimum than otherwise would have pertained to a defendant under the mandatorily applied Guidelines. So\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   's rule applies to pre-\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   sentences that imposed the career-offender guideline based on at least one predicate conviction that qualified under only the unconstitutionally vague residual clause. Nor does the judicial fiction that the Guidelines \"were\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   really mandatory\" somehow erase the fact that they were applied in a mandatory way for more than 20 years. So if because of the residual clause, a prisoner was incorrectly sentenced under the career-offender guideline in the pre-\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   sentencing regime, he can establish a viable\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim.
