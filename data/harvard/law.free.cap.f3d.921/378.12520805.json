The suit alleged the state's Republican lawmakers drew the congressional map to entrench Republican power in Pennsylvania's congressional delegation and disadvantage Democratic voters. Plaintiffs contended the Republican redistricting plan violated the Pennsylvania Constitution by burdening and disfavoring Democratic voters' rights to free expression and association and by intentionally discriminating against Democratic voters, disadvantaging their representational rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This appeal, although arising from that litigation, does not involve the substance of the underlying state constitutional challenge. Rather, it involves a fee dispute stemming from a brief period during which the suit was before a federal district court. Some five months after the suit was filed in state court, defendant State Senate President Pro Tempore Joseph Scarnati-a Republican lawmaker who sponsored the 2011 redistricting plan-removed the matter to federal court, contending federal jurisdiction existed because of a newly scheduled congressional election. Following a burst of filings and an emergency hearing, the federal District Court remanded the matter to state court, where the suit continued and has since concluded.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Relying on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), the federal court later directed Senator Scarnati personally to pay $ 29,360 to plaintiffs for costs and fees incurred in the removal and remand proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Senator Scarnati disputes whether he-a party to the case only in his official capacity as President Pro Tempore of the State Senate-should have been held personally liable for the costs and fees award. Recognizing the Supreme Court's directive that courts carefully adhere to the distinction between personal and official capacity suits, we will resolve this issue in favor of Senator Scarnati. As to his other challenges to the award, we conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in holding the removal lacked an objectively reasonable basis, nor in calculating the proper costs and fees to be awarded. Accordingly, we will affirm those parts of the Court's order, reverse its order holding Senator Scarnati personally liable, and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As noted, on June 15, 2017, plaintiff-appellees-eighteen Pennsylvania Democratic voters-filed a petition in the Pennsylvania\n   Commonwealth Court contending Pennsylvania's 2011 congressional districting plan was a product of partisan gerrymandering that violated the Pennsylvania Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the petition, in 2011 Republican state lawmakers \"dismantled Pennsylvania's existing congressional districts and stitched them back together with the goal of maximizing the political advantage of Republican voters and minimizing the representational rights of Democratic voters.\" Joint Appendix (App.) 45. The suit named as defendants various state officials, all \"in their official capacities as parties who would be responsible for implementing the relief\" sought. App. 56. These included Governor Thomas Wolf; Secretary of the Commonwealth Pedro Cort\u00e9s; Bureau of Commissions, Election, and Legislation Commissioner Jonathan Marks; Lieutenant Governor Michael Stack; Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives Michael Turzai; and Senate President Pro Tempore Scarnati. The Commonwealth and the General Assembly were also named as defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Four months later, the Commonwealth Court stayed the case on the motion of defendants Senator Scarnati, Representative Turzai, and the General Assembly. Due to the delay in the Commonwealth Court, plaintiffs asked the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to assume extraordinary jurisdiction to resolve the case before the 2018 congressional elections. On November 9, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court granted plaintiffs' request because the \"case involves issues of immediate public importance.\" App. 320. It vacated the stay and ordered \"expeditious[ ]\" proceedings below, setting a year-end deadline for the Commonwealth Court to conduct a trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On November 13, the Commonwealth Court issued an expedited scheduling order, with trial set for December 11, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The day after the Commonwealth Court issued its scheduling order, Senator Scarnati removed the case to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Although the underlying petition included only state law claims, he contended there was federal question jurisdiction because, on October 23, 2017, Governor Wolf issued a Writ of Election to set a special election for a newly vacant seat in Congress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 2, cl. 4 (\"When vacancies happen in the Representation from any State, the Executive Authority thereof shall issue Writs of Election to fill such Vacancies.\"). Senator Scarnati maintained that because the Writ was issued under the United States Constitution, it introduced a \"substantial question of federal law\" into the case-whether a state court could \"strike down\" a congressional district for which a special election was already scheduled. App. 24. In the notice of removal, Senator Scarnati averred that Representative Turzai and the General Assembly had consented to removal, and contended he did not need the consent of the other defendants because of their \"nominal\" status. App. 25-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs learned of the removal the next day, November 15, and within twenty-four hours filed an emergency motion to remand to state court. The United States District Court scheduled a hearing for that afternoon on plaintiffs' motion to remand. Right before the hearing, Senator Scarnati filed his own emergency motion seeking remand to state court. The motion explained that there was a misunderstanding\n   with Representative Turzai, who did not actually consent to removal. The District Court held its hearing-attended by plaintiffs' counsel who traveled from Washington, D.C.-and then granted Senator Scarnati's motion, remanding the case to state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In accordance with the District Court's remand order, plaintiffs asked for, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), \"payment of just costs and ... attorney fees[ ] incurred as a result of the removal.\" They sought: (1) $ 49,616.50 in attorneys' fees, which covered 82 hours of work by 10 attorneys from the Washington, D.C. office of Arnold &amp; Porter Kaye Scholer and the Public Interest Law Center of Philadelphia (PILCOP); and (2) $ 3,120.02 in costs for travel and legal research expenses. Those fees and costs had been incurred preparing the remand motion, preparing for and attending the emergency hearing, and preparing the costs motion itself. Plaintiffs also suggested sanctions were warranted under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 or the Court's inherent authority. Finally, they contended \"Senator Scarnati and his counsel ... should be held jointly and severally liable\" for any award to \"avoid placing the burden for such fees and costs on Pennsylvania taxpayers.\" App. 400.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The District Court granted plaintiffs' motion and awarded costs and fees under \u00a7 1447(c).\n   <em>\n    League of Women Voters of Pa. v. Pennsylvania\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-5137,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201787211\">\n    2018 WL 1787211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 13, 2018). It held removal was improper because Senator Scarnati had no basis for believing that removal was timely or that he did not need the consent of the executive branch defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4-5. The Court did not \"stat[e] any opinion on whether there was 'colorable' federal jurisdiction,\" and did \"not come to any conclusion that improper motive or bad faith [was] involved.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Turning to the amount of the award, the Court found that all written work by plaintiffs' counsel was \"excellent,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , and that the removal action \"amounted to an 'emergency situation,' \"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *7, necessitating \"[a] good deal of urgent research and preparation,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. It recognized that with \"numerous attorneys in two different locations\" there was \"some perhaps unavoidable duplication of effort\" by plaintiffs' lawyers, and so reduced the hours by twenty percent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. The Court determined it would only award fees at a prevailing local rate in Philadelphia rather than the higher rates billed by the Washington, D.C. lawyers,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *6, and applied a \"blended hourly rate\" of $ 400 per hour, which it found was \"a fair median hourly rate for the PILCOP lawyers,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. The resulting fee award was $ 26,240, and the Court also awarded the full $ 3,120.02 in costs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, and without explanation, the Court found \"Senator Scarnati should personally be liable for these fees and costs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8. He appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The primary issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in imposing personal liability on Senate President Pro Tempore Scarnati for the costs and fees award. He challenges other aspects of the Court's decision, contending plaintiffs were not entitled to an award at all under \u00a7 1447(c), and that the Court erred in calculating the amount owed. We first address the predicate question of plaintiffs' entitlement to a \u00a7 1447(c) award. We next turn to the most contested issue on appeal: the Court's decision to impose the award on Senator Scarnati in his personal, rather than official, capacity. Finally, we assess whether the costs and fees awarded were appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   To determine whether plaintiffs are entitled to costs and fees as a result of the removal, we begin with a review of the removal provisions relevant to this case. A defendant may generally remove a civil action from state court if it is one over \"which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). In addition to establishing federal subject matter jurisdiction, a removing defendant must comply with several statutory procedural requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 1446, 1447. Two of those provisions are at issue here. First, removal must occur within thirty days of the defendant's \"receipt ... of the initial pleading,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1446(b)(1), or within thirty days of the defendant's \"receipt ... of a copy of an amended pleading, motion, order or other paper from which it may first be ascertained that the case is one which is or has become removable,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1446(b)(3). Second, all defendants must join in or consent to removal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1446(b)(2). If the removing defendant fails to comply with these procedural requirements, \"[a] motion to remand the case ... must be made within 30 days after the filing of the notice of removal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1447(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   When a case is remanded to state court, the removing defendant may be liable for expenses associated with the unsuccessful removal: \"An order remanding the case may require payment of just costs and any actual expenses, including attorney fees, incurred as a result of the removal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Martin v. Franklin Capital Corp.\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court announced the proper standard for awarding fees under \u00a7 1447(c) : \"Absent unusual circumstances, courts may award attorney's fees under \u00a7 1447(c) only where the removing party lacked an objectively reasonable basis for seeking removal.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5940566\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/132/#p141\">\n    546 U.S. 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 141,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5940566\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/132/#p141\">\n    126 S.Ct. 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5940566\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/132/#p141\">\n    163 L.Ed.2d 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005). The Court adopted that standard instead of a narrower one under which fees could be awarded only if the removing party's position was \"frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5940566\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/132/#p141\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5940566\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/132/#p141\">\n    at 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5940566\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/132/#p141\">\n    126 S.Ct. 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In holding that the test should \"turn on ... reasonableness,\" the Court \"recognize[d] the desire to deter removals sought for the purpose of prolonging litigation and imposing costs on the opposing party, while not undermining Congress' basic decision to afford defendants a right to remove as a general matter, when the statutory criteria are satisfied.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5940566\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/132/#p141\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5940566\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/132/#p141\">\n    at 140-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5940566\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/132/#p141\">\n    126 S.Ct. 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Here, the District Court determined Senator Scarnati had no objectively reasonable basis for contending the removal statutory criteria were satisfied, as removal was both untimely and lacked the consent of the executive branch defendants.
