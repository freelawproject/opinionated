Because a district court in Florida confirmed the award here, Florida law applies. Under Florida law, claim preclusion bars NTCH-WA's claims because NTCH-WA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   is seeking the same remedy it sought in arbitration, the evidence needed to prove NTCH-WA's claims here is the same, ZTE Corp. is in privity with its wholly-owned subsidiary ZTE USA, and the parties are suing in the same capacity as in the arbitration.

Steinmann sued ZTE USA\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   ZTE Corp. in California. ZTE USA moved to compel arbitration, and the parties eventually stipulated to a consolidated arbitration. From that point, the arbitration \"went forward as a single unified proceeding that bound ZTE USA, PTA-FLA, Daredevil, NTCH-WA, and NTCH-West Tenn.\"\n   <em>\n    PTA-FLA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178102\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/844/1299/#p1302\">\n    844 F.3d at 1303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In December 2011, the ClearTalk entities filed an Amended Statement of Claim in the arbitration. In the Amended Statement, each of the ClearTalk entities asserted claims against ZTE USA and ZTE Corp., although only Steinmann had, to that point, brought claims against ZTE Corp. The ClearTalk entities nonetheless contended that ZTE Corp. should be a party to the arbitration as to all claims because ZTE USA and ZTE Corp. \"were alter egos of each other. ZTE Corp. so dominates the operations and decision-making of ZTE USA that the two entities are in effect indistinguishable.\" In the alternative, the ClearTalk entities asserted that ZTE USA and ZTE Corp. \"were in fact agents and/or principals and/or coconspirators of each other.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The arbitrator declined to hear the claims against ZTE Corp., with the exception of Steinmann's claims. The arbitrator determined \"that the scope of the arbitration\" was limited to \"all the claims, counterclaims, and defenses that exist or may arise between and among the parties subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in the lawsuits pending at the time of the agreement to arbitrate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The arbitration hearing began in August 2013. The arbitrator \"heard close to 30 witnesses, and, in addition, reviewed many hundreds of exhibits submitted for consideration.\" In February 2014, the arbitrator issued the Final Award in the arbitration, denying the ClearTalk entities' claims. The United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida confirmed the award under the Federal Arbitration Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district court's judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    PTA-FLA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178102\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/844/1299/#p1302\">\n    844 F.3d 1299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Once the arbitrator determined that NTCH-WA could not proceed against ZTE Corp. in arbitration, NTCH-WA initiated this action. Its Second Amended Complaint asserted claims for breach of contract, tortious interference, fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, promissory estoppel, and unjust enrichment against ZTE Corp. The district court stayed the case several times pending\n   the conclusion of arbitration. After the Eleventh Circuit rendered its decision, the district court lifted the stay and granted ZTE Corp.'s motion for summary judgment, dismissing NTCH-WA's claims. The district court held that the arbitration award precludes NTCH-WA from pursuing its current claims. NTCH-WA filed a timely notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We review de novo whether claim preclusion bars NTCH-WA's claims.\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

PTA-FLA intended to use the equipment to establish a wireless network in Florida. But when the equipment allegedly did not work, the parties shifted their focus to other markets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In late 2007, Daredevil entered into an agreement (the \"Missouri Agreement\") with ZTE Corp. and ZTE USA to establish a wireless network in Missouri. Under that agreement, the ZTE entities agreed to provide base stations and handsets to Daredevil at favorable prices. NTCH-WA, as an affiliate of Daredevil, is alleged to be a third-party beneficiary of the handset provision of the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Around the same time, the ZTE entities and the ClearTalk entities agreed to establish a wireless network in Washington. As part of that plan, the ClearTalk entities agreed to purchase remote switches from the ZTE entities. The ZTE entities delivered two remote switches. Those switches relied on a primary switch, located in Tennessee, to function. NTCH-WA accordingly sought and received assurances from ZTE agents that the primary switch would function. As an additional part of the plan, the parties amended the Missouri Agreement, in the \"Missouri Addendum,\" and agreed that ZTE Corp. and ZTE USA would send forty base stations originally intended for use in Missouri to Washington instead. NTCH-WA is alleged to be a third-party beneficiary of the Missouri Addendum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Relying on these agreements and promises, NTCH-WA allegedly expended significant resources to prepare a Washington network for use. The problem, as NTCH-WA alleges it, is that the primary switch in Tennessee never worked, and the ZTE entities never provided the base stations and handsets that were promised, giving rise to various claims. In the arbitration, NTCH-WA asserted claims for breach of contract, fraud, and unjust enrichment. Here, NTCH-WA has asserted claims for breach of contract, tortious interference, fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, promissory estoppel, and unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Regardless of the disparate theories of the claims asserted, the arbitration and this suit concern the same facts: NTCH-WA alleges that the ZTE entities-in the Missouri Agreement and Addendum, and through the representations of agents-promised to provide working telecommunications equipment to NTCH-WA but failed to do so. The relevant evidence-what was promised, what was delivered, and damages sustained-would be the same in both actions. Because the two suits concern the same facts and evidence, they are the same \"causes of action\" under Florida law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Albrecht\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7614537,7614610\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/444/8/\">\n    444 So.2d at 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   NTCH-WA contends that the causes of action differ because this case concerns different contracts and different activities than the arbitration. That is not so. NTCH-WA is relying on the same contracts (the Missouri Agreement and Addendum), the same promises (certain equipment would be provided and the equipment would work), and the same alleged bad acts (failure to make the primary switch operational, to provide base stations, and to provide handsets) as it did in the arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    3\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Third, privity exists between ZTE Corp. and ZTE USA, ZTE Corp.'s wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary.

Under Florida law, this parent-subsidiary relationship is sufficient to show privity at the time of the arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   NTCH-WA nonetheless contends that ZTE USA and ZTE Corp. were not in privity because, in connection with a motion\n   to dismiss in this action, an agent of ZTE Corp. declared that ZTE Corp. and ZTE USA are different corporate entities, have different principal places of business, and have different assets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The declaration, however, states that ZTE USA is ZTE Corp.'s wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary.

NTCH-WA contends that, for that reason, ZTE Corp. should not be able to invoke claim preclusion as a defense here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   NTCH-WA's contention is unpersuasive.
