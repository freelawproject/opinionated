The district court found the order was not final and dismissed the worker's complaint.

A Department of Labor administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") found that Grimm had sustained work-related injuries while employed by Vortex. The ALJ therefore ordered Vortex to \"pay or reimburse the Claimant for all medical expenses arising from the Claimant's work-related injuries,\" and to \"provide treatment going forward, including the diagnostic procedures and therapies his treating physicians judge appropriate.\" The Benefits Review Board (\"BRB\") affirmed the ALJ's order.
