Her asylum application was assigned to asylum officer Thomas Powell, who interviewed her with her immigration attorney on February 15, 2000. Powell later arranged an appointment with Lu to meet her alone at her apartment. At this meeting, Powell fondled Lu and told her that he would approve her application only if she accepted his sexual demands. Lu rejected Powell's advances, and shortly\n   after learned that her asylum application had been denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Jie Hao, also a Chinese national, arrived in the United States in 1999 and likewise applied for asylum. Powell interviewed her with her attorney on May 22, 2000, and a few days later attempted to arrange a meeting alone with Hao in her home. Hao's attorney, who had also represented Lu, contacted the Department of Justice (DOJ) to report Powell's conduct. Hao met with a DOJ agent, and agreed to cooperate with the government, including by allowing the government to record her meeting with Powell. The agent told Hao to signal him during the meeting if Powell engaged in improper conduct or attempted to touch her, and the agent would protect her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the meeting on June 4, 2000, Powell told Hao that he would approve her asylum application for $ 2,000. At some point in the meeting, he also slapped Hao's buttocks multiple times and kissed her on the cheek. The DOJ agent did not intervene during the meeting. At a follow up meeting on June 8, Hao gave $ 2,000 (which she had previously received from DOJ agents) to Powell. Powell took the money, touched Hao on the knee, asked for a hug, and again kissed Hao on the cheek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As a result of this sting operation, the United States indicted Powell for violating Lu's civil rights under color of law, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20242\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and for seeking bribes from both Lu and Hao in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (B)(2)(A).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Xue Lu v.

Their complaint alleged: (1) deprivation of constitutional rights, (2) negligence, (3) sexual battery, (4) assault and battery, (5) intentional infliction of emotional distress, (6) cruel and inhumane and degrading treatment, (7) interference with the right to seek asylum, and (8) gender discrimination, harassment, and violence against women. In 2005, after Powell's conviction and sentencing, the court granted the government's motion to dismiss the action against the United States for failure to state a claim, on the ground that Powell was acting outside the scope of his employment when he perpetrated the sexual assaults on the plaintiffs, and therefore the United States could not be held liable on a respondeat superior theory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On appeal, we reversed in part and remanded two claims for trial.\n   <em>\n    Xue Lu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784857\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/621/944/#p946\">\n    621 F.3d 944\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 951.

In an August 5, 2013 order, the district court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs on both claims, reasoning that Powell interfered with the plaintiffs' right to asylum or their due process right to a meaningful hearing for asylum relief, and that Powell's offensive touching constituted intentional infliction of emotional distress. The district court awarded $ 500,000 in damages to Lu and $ 700,000 in damages to Hao.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After the verdict, the plaintiffs moved for attorneys' fees. The district court determined it could award \"attorney fees at market rates in cases involving bad faith by the United States\" if it \"finds that the fees incurred during various phases of litigation are in some way traceable to the [defendant's] bad faith.\"\n   <em>\n    Xue Lu v.

Based on this standard, the court found that the government's conduct resulted in two incidents of pre-litigation bad faith conduct and two incidents of bad faith conduct during the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   First, the court held the DOJ agent's \"failure to come to [Hao's] aid after Powell touched Plaintiff['s] buttocks\" constituted bad faith pre-litigation conduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Second, the court found that the government had engaged in pre-litigation bad faith conduct by delaying consideration of Hao's asylum application for seven years, until the criminal case against Powell was resolved.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Third, the court found the government had engaged in bad faith conduct by arguing during the litigation that Hao could not claim she suffered an injury from Powell's touching because Hao gave \"express, voluntary written consent\" to participate in the sting operation, and had assumed the potential risks associated with the operation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court found that Hao had consented only to assisting in the sting, not to being a victim of offensive touching, and therefore this argument was in bad faith.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Finally, the district court held that the government had engaged in bad faith conduct by arguing that Hao and Lu's claims were barred by the intentional tort exception under the FTCA\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   even though we had previously held on appeal that Lu and Hao could bring claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The district court did not, however, agree that all of the conduct identified by Lu and Hao before or during the litigation constituted bad faith. For instance, the government's reliance on an immigration judge's findings did not constitute bad faith. Nor did the government engage in bad faith conduct by making a reference to Lu and Hao's claims as \"mere allegations\" during the proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4 n.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The district court concluded that \"[u]nder the totality of the circumstances\" the government's bad faith \"has affected all portions or phases of the litigation since June 8, 2000,\" the date of the sting operation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.

First, we held that the district court had not clearly erred in holding that the government engaged in bad faith conduct when the DOJ agent failed to come to Hao's aid, although \"we might well have come to a different conclusion on de novo review.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4247439\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/638/614/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4247439\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/638/614/\">\n    at 618-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We held that the final two years of delay (from 2005 to 2007), which \"occurred in the ordinary course of processing\" Hao's asylum application, did not rise to the level of bad faith.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4247439\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/638/614/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 619 n.2.

Because we had rejected the conclusion that the government's intentional tort argument constituted bad faith conduct, the court set out to calculate which fees were \"traceable to the three findings of bad faith affirmed by the Ninth Circuit,\" namely the DOJ agent's failure to come to Hao's aid, the government's delay in considering Hao's asylum application, and the government's argument that Hao had consented or assumed the risk of Powell's sexual touching.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535409\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/916/492/#p495\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   To trace these fees, the district court relied on a declaration submitted by plaintiffs' counsel, which provided two alternatives for calculating attorneys' fees.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535409\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/916/492/#p495\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   First, counsel argued that \"all work performed in this case is traceable to Powell's bad faith\" and so all fees should be awarded. As an alternative, however, counsel traced the hours incurred by each attorney or staff member to one or more of the district court's three surviving findings of bad faith. The plaintiffs took a broad view of traceability. For instance, the declaration claimed that two incidents of bad faith conduct-the DOJ agent's failure to assist Hao after Powell touched her, and the government's delay in consideration of Hao's asylum application-\"existed from the inception of the litigation so the majority of Plaintiffs' counsels' work was in some way traceable to that bad faith conduct.\" Further, the declaration claimed that the government's argument about the FTCA's exception for intentional torts related to Powell's offensive touching, and therefore work addressing the intentional tort argument was also traceable to bad faith. Finally, the declaration claimed that because work for both Hao and Lu substantially overlapped, only work performed solely for Lu was not recoverable. Based on this analysis, the declaration concluded that the work traceable to bad faith amounted to $ 676,751 in fees,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535409\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/916/492/#p495\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , some $ 200,000 less than the amount the district court had previously awarded for the entire litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Without undertaking any independent analysis, the district court adopted the declaration, and concluded that \"[t]he evidence submitted by Plaintiffs demonstrates $ 676,751 in fees expended in the underlying action is traceable to one or more of the three findings of bad faith by the Government,\" and awarded the entire amount to plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2, *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiffs also moved for attorneys' fees incurred on the appeal of the previous fee award and post-remand.

There are several inconsistencies. First, the district court did not expressly apply\n   <em>\n    Goodyear\n   </em>\n   's but-for standard or undertake the granular inquiry indicated by that opinion, i.e., segregating individual expense items or categories of such items and establishing that they would not have been incurred except for the government's misconduct. Rather, the court relied on the plaintiffs' declaration, which provided only broad generalizations about causation, and did not calibrate a close \"causal link,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12603202\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1178/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12603202\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1178/\">\n    at 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , between the sanctionable conduct and specific legal tasks. Further, in indicating that the majority of plaintiffs' fees were recoverable merely because the government's bad faith conduct \"existed from the inception of the litigation,\" the declaration appeared to adopt the temporal approach rejected in\n   <em>\n    Goodyear.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, the declaration encompassed fees for work done for both Hao and Lu, contrary to\n   <em>\n    Goodyear\n   </em>\n   's clarification that it is inappropriate to grant fees \"for all legal work relating to\" specified claims \"regardless of whether the same work would have been done (for example, the same depositions taken) to contest the non-frivolous claims in the suit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12603202\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1178/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12603202\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1178/\">\n    at 1187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Although the district court failed to provide the close analysis generally required by\n   <em>\n    Goodyear\n   </em>\n   , we must still consider whether this is one of the \"exceptional cases\" identified in\n   <em>\n    Goodyear\n   </em>\n   where the \"grind\" of tracing each legal fee to a specific bad faith act is not required.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12603202\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1178/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12603202\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1178/\">\n    at 1187-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court did not make any finding to that effect, but certain of the district court's statements suggest that it deemed the case to be one where the government's misconduct was such that it was appropriate to shift all or a portion of the plaintiffs' fees \"in one fell swoop.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12603202\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1178/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12603202\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1178/\">\n    at 1187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, in stating that under the \"totality of the circumstances\" the government's bad faith \"has affected all portions or phases of the litigation since June 8, 2000,\" the date of the sting operation, the district court suggested that the government's bad faith conduct \"so permeated the suit as to make that misconduct a but-for cause of every subsequent legal expense,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12603202\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1178/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12603202\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1178/\">\n    at 1189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, the district court held it could award attorneys fees \"if it finds that the fees incurred during various phases of litigation are\n   <em>\n    in some way traceable\n   </em>\n   to the [defendant's] bad faith,\"\n   <em>\n    Xue Lu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%2011087106\">\n    2016 WL 11087106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535409\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/916/492/#p495\">\n    916 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   497 ) (alteration and emphasis in district court order), a standard that may be applicable in exceptional cases,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535409\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/916/492/#p495\">\n    916 F.2d at 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, the district court's bad faith findings included the government's prelitigation conduct (i.e., the failure to come to Hao's aid during the sting and five of the seven years of delay in processing Hao's asylum application), which\n   <em>\n    Goodyear\n   </em>\n   indicated is a consideration in exceptional cases,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12603202\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1178/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1187-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating it had approved the award in\n   <em>\n    Chambers\n   </em>\n   because \"literally everything the defendant did-'his entire course of conduct' throughout, and indeed preceding, the litigation-was 'part of a sordid scheme' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On the other hand, there are several indications that this case is not such an exceptional case. Our prior opinion makes clear that not all of the government's activity is part of a \"sordid scheme.\" We concluded that the government's argument that the FTCA's intentional torts exception barred plaintiffs' claims did not constitute bad faith, and that the district court's contrary finding was \"without support in the record.\"\n   <em>\n    Xue Lu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4247439\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/638/614/\">\n    638 F.

We also held that the final two years of delay in processing Hao's asylum application \"occurred in the ordinary course\" and did not rise to the level of bad faith.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4247439\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/638/614/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 619 n.2. Nothing in the record suggests that the government engaged in needless delay of the litigation, attempted to harass the plaintiffs with unwarranted depositions or discovery, defied the letter or spirit of a court order, or otherwise attempted to hamper the judicial process.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chambers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107845\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/32/#p43\">\n    501 U.S. at 37-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107845\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/32/#p43\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the district court itself chose to ignore the declaration's assertion that all work performed in the case was traceable to the government's bad faith, and ultimately declined to award some $ 200,000 in attorneys' fees. Such a ruling would be inconsistent with a conclusion that the government's misconduct \"so infected the lawsuit as to account for each and every expense the [plaintiffs] subsequently incurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Goodyear\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12603202\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1178/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   We therefore conclude that, as in\n   <em>\n    Goodyear\n   </em>\n   , there is too much uncertainty regarding the record and the district court's reasoning to determine whether the district court's fee award is consistent with the\n   <em>\n    Goodyear\n   </em>\n   standard.
