R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The judge had deemed Fidelity immune from suit here based on an immunity provision in the Bank Secrecy Act (\"BSA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205318\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(3)(A) - a provision that says, most pertinently, that a \"financial institution that makes a voluntary disclosure of any possible violation of law or regulation to a government agency ... shall not be liable to any person under any law or regulation of the United States, [or] any constitution, law, or regulation of any State ..., for such disclosure.\" Seeing no reason to reverse the judge's thoughtful decision, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    How the Case Got Here\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We draw the facts from the complaint's allegations, which at this stage of the litigation we must accept as true and construe in the light most favorable to plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Schatz\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Republican State Leadership Comm.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723950\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/50/#p55\">\n    669 F.3d 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 55 (1st Cir. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Parties' Dealings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At all times relevant to this suit, AER operated as a registered investment advisor, serving wealthy clients nationally. In 2009, AER joined Fidelity's Wealth Central platform, giving it access to Fidelity's investment technologies - technologies that AER relied on in advising its clients. William and Peter were two of AER's clients. And they were and are, respectively, chairman and chief executive officer of a billion-dollar company called Deutsch Family Wine &amp; Spirits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Starting in 2011 and continuing through part of 2012, the Deutsches pursued a \"China Gold\" investment strategy introduced by AER and supported by Fidelity - a strategy that resulted in their acquiring millions of shares of China Medical Technologies, Inc. (\"China Medical\"), all in the hopes of making a profit from an eventual management buy-out or a third-party acquisition of that company. In March 2012, Fidelity offered the Deutsches the chance to participate in its \"fully paid lending program,\" in which they would lend Fidelity their China Medical shares for an interest-based fee. If they accepted Fidelity's offer, they probably would have been able to engineer a \"short squeeze.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   But they declined, saying they had no interest in lending stock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Apparently unwilling to take no for an answer, Fidelity lent about 1.8 million of the Deutsches' China Medical shares to short sellers or their brokers between May and early June 2012. Fidelity made money from these loans. But the Deutsches got nothing - no notice of what Fidelity was up to, no collateral to protect their interests, and no compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 11, 2012, after \"a routine monthly transfer of [China Medical] shares between the Deutsches' margin accounts,\" Fidelity's surreptitious lending triggered a recall obligation, basically because Fidelity had loaned more China Medical securities\n   than legally permitted (fyi, all dates in the rest of this paragraph refer to 2012 as well). Over the next several days, Fidelity issued recall notices for about 1.8 million shares. The recalls for about 1.2 million shares failed, however, causing Fidelity to believe a short squeeze would occur. Ultimately, China Medical's stock price went from $ 4.00 per share on June 13 to $ 11.80 per share on June 29. Fidelity ended up buying roughly 1.2 million shares on the open market between June 19 and June 27. And the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") halted trading in China Medical securities on July 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Investigations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Sometime around July 5, 2012, Fidelity filed a suspicious activity report (\"SAR\") with the federal Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, accusing the Deutsches of manipulating China Medical's stock price. Plaintiffs base this allegation on an internal memo written by David Whitlock, an employee in Fidelity's Compliance Department, which they say \"upon information and belief ... reflects the contents\" of the SAR.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whitlock's memo recommended that Fidelity's Investigations, Evaluation and Response Department investigate the Deutsches' China Medical-related activities because they had \"the appearance of attempting to influence a short squeeze in the stock of China Medical.\" And \"a scheme to manipulate the price or availability of stock in order to cause a short squeeze is illegal,\" his memo added.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In August 2012, the SEC kicked off an investigation of both AER and Peter Deutsch for (in plaintiffs' words) \"possible market manipulation in the equities of China Medical.\" AER, for example, received one SEC subpoena and participated in one SEC interview. Peter also participated in one SEC interview. State securities agencies investigated AER as well. William was not investigated at all, apparently (he makes no allegation that he was). Ultimately, neither the SEC nor the state agencies pursued enforcement actions against AER or Peter. Still, AER had to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in defending itself and did not \"economically recover\" from the ordeal. Peter had to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars too and suffered emotional distress as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Proceedings in the Southern District of Florida\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Invoking diversity jurisdiction, the Deutsches and AER later sued Fidelity in Florida's federal district court. Their operative complaint contained an array of Florida-law claims, including claims predicated on the SAR -\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , negligent reporting and misrepresentation, fraud, and tortious interference with existing and prospective business relations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Fidelity eventually moved to dismiss the complaint or to transfer the case to Massachusetts's federal district court. Most pertinently for our purposes, Fidelity's dismissal arguments pushed the idea that the BSA immunized it from any civil liability for filing the SAR. And its transfer arguments pushed the notion that all the events leading to the suit happened in or around Massachusetts. Plaintiffs opposed\n   the motion, contending among other things that the BSA did not shield Fidelity from liability for its \"bad faith\" filing of the SAR and that Florida was a reasonably convenient forum for all concerned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Noting \"the vast majority of the facts underpinning [p]laintiffs' cause[s] of action did not occur in ... Florida,\" the federal district court in Florida held that \"the locus of operative facts in this case favors a transfer to the District of Massachusetts.\" So that court transferred the action to Massachusetts under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and denied Fidelity's \"other arguments and requests\" as moot.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   To use some legalese, the Florida federal court here was the \"transferor court\" and the Massachusetts federal court was the \"transferee court.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Atl.

A common theme in each claim was that Fidelity filed an SAR falsely accusing plaintiffs of trying to manipulate the market for China Medical stock, which sparked the governmental investigations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Fidelity responded with a motion to dismiss the complaint. First Fidelity argued that First Circuit law applied to federal questions transferred here under \u00a7 1404(a). Then citing\n   <em>\n    Stoutt\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Banco Popular de Puerto Rico\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9322505\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/320/26/\">\n    320 F.3d 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1st Cir. 2003), Fidelity wrote \"that the BSA provides a financial institution with\n   <em>\n    absolute immunity\n   </em>\n   from civil liability for filing a[n] SAR.\" The provision Fidelity relied on says (as we said earlier) that a \"financial institution that makes a voluntary disclosure of\n   <em>\n    any possible violation of law\n   </em>\n   or regulation to a government agency ... shall not be liable to any person under any law or regulation of the United States, [or] any constitution, law, or regulation of any State ..., for such disclosure.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205318\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(3)(A) (emphasis added). Keep the italicized phrase \"any possible violation of law\" in mind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs opposed the motion, arguing that the \u00a7 1404(a) transfer left the applicable law unaffected. Which meant Eleventh Circuit law, specifically\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    First Union National Bank of Florida\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11901627\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/129/1186/\">\n    129 F.3d 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 1997), controlled and (to quote their memo) holds \"that immunity may be conferred in this case (transferred from Florida District Court) only with respect to a[n] SAR filing made in good faith.\" And, plaintiffs continued, because Fidelity used the SAR \"as a smoke screen to camouflage [its] own contraventions of law\" and did not \"objective[ly] identif[y] a possible violation\" by plaintiffs, Fidelity's \"bad faith\" filing precluded a grant of immunity under the BSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Taking up the motion, the district judge wrote that when federal-law questions arise, \"the transferee court will apply the law of its own circuit\" - a \"general rule\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   that \"applies with equal force where a transferee court is considering a federal statutory defense in a diversity case.\"\n   <em>\n    AER Advisors Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fidelity Brokerage Servs. LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526902\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/327/278/#p284\">\n    327 F.Supp.3d 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 284 (D. Mass. 2018). And with that, the judge applied this Circuit's interpretation of the BSA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526902\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/327/278/#p284\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Relying on\n   <em>\n    Stoutt\n   </em>\n   , the judge then wrote that the BSA grants financial institutions \"absolute immunity from suit, even when [their] disclosures are fabricated or made with malice\" - in other words, there is no \"good faith qualification to [civil] immunity,\" meaning this immunity applies even to fraudulent SARs filed by an institution to \"falsely point blame at others to cover up its own wrongdoing.\"\n   <em>\n    AER Advisors Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526902\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/327/278/#p284\">\n    327 F.Supp.3d at 284-85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing\n   <em>\n    Stoutt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9322505\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/320/26/\">\n    320 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   30-33 ). The judge also rejected plaintiffs' theory that Fidelity's SAR could not have stated a \"possible violation of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 285. Even if Fidelity \"'knew that there was (in reality) no violation,'\" the judge reasoned, \"[b]ased on [p]laintiffs' own allegations, the SAR ... 'was cast' as a disclosure of a possible violation of securities law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Stoutt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9322505\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/320/26/\">\n    320 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   30 ). Criminal law, the judge added, is the mechanism to deter and remedy false reports to the government, whose agents are quite capable of \"filter[ing] out SARs reporting 'false charges' and decid[ing] not to pursue those investigations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9322505\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/320/26/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Stoutt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9322505\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/320/26/\">\n    320 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   32 ). So the judge dismissed the case under Rule 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 280.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    The Parties' Principal Appellate Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Unhappy with the judge's ruling, plaintiffs appeal, making two basic arguments (echoing their positions in the district court). One is that Eleventh Circuit precedent applies because the case came to our Circuit via a transfer order from a court in the Eleventh Circuit. And, plaintiffs say, Eleventh Circuit precedent holds that BSA immunity requires a good-faith filing - a requirement not met here because Fidelity filed \"an intentionally misleading SAR ... to cover up [its] own wrongdoing.\" The second argument is that even if First Circuit precedent applies, we (in their words) must not read the BSA as \"immuniz[ing] an institution that filed a report disclosing an objectively impossible violation that falsely implicated the victim of the financial institution's\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   wrongdoing - leading the government to investigate the victim rather than the perpetrator.\" To let Fidelity escape scot-free would frustrate the congressional purpose behind the BSA, which is to help \"law enforcement by incentivizing reports of violations of law\" - \"\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to incentivize the issuance of reports that will be of no use to law enforcement;\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , reported facts that could not possibly constitute a violation of law\" (quotations taken from their brief). And they insist that a trio of state-court opinions support their view of how BSA immunity should work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Fidelity, for its part, thinks that plaintiffs are wrong across the board (repeating what they argued below). Courts of appeals, Fidelity writes, regularly hold \"that a district court\" must \"appl[y] the law of its own Circuit to federal questions (such as whether BSA immunity applies to Fidelity), including in cases transferred from another Circuit.\" So, Fidelity continues,\n   <em>\n    Stoutt\n   </em>\n   applies and gives \"a financial institution ... BSA immunity even if it files a[n] SAR that is 'wholly unfounded'\" (the interior quotation is from\n   <em>\n    Stoutt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9322505\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/320/26/\">\n    320 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   31 ). On the public-policy front, Fidelity writes that \"[u]nqualified BSA immunity\" is key to the SAR regime - to create an atmosphere that encourages financial institutions to report dishonest-looking activities without the fear of reprisals in civil lawsuits. And finally, Fidelity protests that\n   the state-court cases plaintiffs champion cannot trump our\n   <em>\n    Stoutt\n   </em>\n   opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    The Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We review the judge's dismissal decision with fresh eyes, knowing that she could grant Fidelity's BSA-immunity-based dismissal motion only if, after taking the complaint's well-pleaded facts as true and drawing every reasonable inference in plaintiffs' favor,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schatz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723950\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/50/#p55\">\n    669 F.3d at 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the facts establishing Fidelity's immunity \"are clear on the face of ... plaintiff[s'] pleading[ ],\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Medina-Padilla\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    U.S. Aviation Underwriters, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146046\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/815/83/#p85\">\n    815 F.3d 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 85 (1st Cir. 2016) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DeGrandis\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Children's Hosp.

Unfortunately for plaintiffs, however, we - like Fidelity - side with the district judge on this issue.

To bring a little more clarity to the matter, we note that a \"short position\" - mentioned in the short-squeeze definition - is a technique used by some investors. As a leading treatise explains:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n    A \"short sale\" is ... any sale of a security which the seller does not own or any sale which is consummated by the delivery of a security borrowed by, or for the account of, the seller. Short selling can be a logical trading strategy for a trader who believes that the price of shares is likely to decline over the near-term. To sell short, the trader typically borrows the shares from a broker who obtains them either from its own reserves or from an external source. The trader then sells the borrowed shares in the open market. At this point, the trader has an \"open short position\" in the stock. At some point in the future, the trader \"covers\" the short position by purchasing an identical number of shares and returning them to the lender. [If,] as the trader hopes, the share price declines, the trader earns a profit equal to the difference between the price at which she sold short and the price at which she purchased the shares back to cover the short position (not taking into account fees or commissions).

Nothing approaching that scenario happened here. Plaintiffs suggest that Fidelity kept the BSA-immunity theory under wraps for later use in the transferee court. Yet, on this record, that is pure speculation - really, it is worse than that, since the record (don't forget) shows Fidelity invoked BSA immunity in the very same motion in which it alternatively argued for a transfer. Plus plaintiffs cite no authority (nor can we think of any) embracing their view that a litigant in Fidelity's shoes cannot later move to dismiss a case after securing a \u00a7 1404(a) transfer.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    The version of the BSA that applied in\n    <em>\n     Stoutt\n    </em>\n    is slightly different from the one that applies now.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9230933\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/23/#p33\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 29 n.3.
