He resigned from the DOI in June 2014. Natofsky, who suffers from a hearing disability, brought this action against the City of New York and three former high-ranking employees at the DOI alleging violations of Section 504 of Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (the \"Rehabilitation Act\"), codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) - (d), and state and city law. Natofsky claims that, during his tenure at the DOI, he experienced several adverse employment actions because of his hearing disability, including his demotion. He also claims that the DOI failed to accommodate his disability and retaliated against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The district court held that no reasonable jury could conclude that Natofsky had experienced any adverse employment action \"solely by reason of\" his disability and further held that Natofsky failed to establish a failure-to-accommodate or retaliation claim. Accordingly, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We hold that a plaintiff alleging an employment discrimination claim under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act must show that the plaintiff's disability was a but-for cause of the employer's action, not the sole cause. We conclude, however, that Natofsky failed to demonstrate that the adverse employment decisions he experienced would not have been made but for his disability. Thus, the district court's award of summary judgment to Defendants is\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   , albeit on different grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The facts are summarized as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Natofsky's Disability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Natofsky suffered nerve damage as an infant, leaving him with a lasting and severe hearing impairment. He wears hearing aids and, to fully understand what someone is saying, has to focus intently on the speaker and read lips. He also speaks imperfectly and more slowly than the average person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The DOI Hires Natofsky\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The DOI hired Natofsky in December 2012 as the Director of Human Resources and Budget with a starting salary of $ 125,000. His direct supervisor was Shaheen Ulon, the then Deputy Commissioner for Administration. When the DOI hired Natofsky, Rose Gill Hearn was the Commissioner of the DOI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In November 2013, Bill de Blasio was elected mayor of New York City. Shortly before the de Blasio administration came into office, Natofsky received two awards: one for \"going above and beyond\" in his job performance and one for a good record of performance. On December 31, 2013, Natofsky also received a memo from Hearn informing him that the DOI was increasing his salary by $ 4,000 for good performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At the end of 2013, as a result of the mayoral transition, Hearn left the DOI. In February 2014, Mark Peters assumed the role of Commissioner. He appointed Susan Pogoda as the DOI's Chief of Staff and Deputy Commissioner for Agency Operations. Natofsky's supervisor, Ulon, remained in place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Ulon's Treatment of Natofsky\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Natofsky testified that when he started at the DOI, he informed Ulon that he had a severe hearing impairment and, consequently, might have trouble hearing her. He also told her that she would have to face him when speaking and that background noise made hearing more difficult for him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Although the first three months of Natofsky's employment passed without significant incident, in or about March 2013, Ulon asked Natofsky to follow up on e-mails more quickly. Natofsky replied that he could not respond to emails as promptly as Ulon wanted because he had to put \"extraordinary effort into listening\" to a speaker during meetings and, thus, could not multitask while listening in meetings. He also suggested that \"if someone has an extremely urgent or time sensitive issue, he or she contact [a secretary] so that she can alert me.\" Ulon and Natofsky had no further discussions on the topic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In June 2013, Ulon requested that Natofsky arrive at work between 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m., as opposed to between 8:00 a.m. and 8:30 a.m., which was when Natofsky usually arrived. She also requested he submit fewer leave requests, although the requests could be for longer periods of time. Natofsky contacted Hearn to object to Ulon's requests; he explained that an early arrival allowed him to catch up on emails that he could not respond to while in meetings, and that Ulon was not understanding of his hearing needs. Hearn organized a meeting with Ulon and Natofsky to discuss Natofsky's concerns, after which Ulon withdrew her demands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On March 10, 2014, after Hearn's resignation and during Peters's and Pogoda's tenures, Ulon wrote Natofsky a counseling memorandum addressing his performance deficiencies. She asked him \"to carefully review and edit the work of [his] staff on routine HR assignments, including the new employee welcome letters and job postings\" as there had been \"numerous, repeated grammatical/typographical and other errors on this type of correspondence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In April 2014, Pogoda informed Ulon that the DOI was eliminating Ulon's position. Pogoda offered Ulon a job with a reduced salary in the newly created New York Police Department Office of the Inspector General, but Ulon declined and resigned on May 1, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On her last day, Ulon provided Natofsky with a written evaluation of his work performance from January 2, 2012 to December 31, 2013. She rated his overall performance a two out of five and gave him a \"needs improvement\" rating in seven of fourteen categories. She stated, among other complaints, that \"tasks have not been completed in a timely manner\" and \"[e]mail responsiveness needs improvement.\" On May 8, 2014, Natofsky appealed his evaluation to Pogoda, which she denied on September 11, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Pogoda and Peters's Treatment of Natofsky\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Pogoda met Natofsky for the first time on February 21, 2014. According to Natofsky, Pogoda kept staring at his ears and observing him while he spoke. Natofsky testified that, on or about March 6, 2014, he told Pogoda about his hearing disability and that, in response, she shook her head and rolled her eyes at him. Natofsky further testified that throughout March and April 2014, Pogoda was noticeably impatient when speaking to him and told him that he needed to speak more clearly and quickly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In March 2014, Peters had at least one meeting with Pogoda, Ulon, and Natofsky in which Peters asked about the number of\n   additional people he could hire based on the budget. Ulon and Natofsky did not know the answer, prompting Peters to express his frustration with them to Pogoda. On March 5, 2014, Pogoda emailed a DOI Associate Commissioner that \"Shaheen [Ulon] and Richard [Natofsky] are clueless.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In May 2014, Pogoda wrote Natofsky informing him that he would be demoted to Associate Staff Analyst, and that his salary would be decreased to $ 68,466. Natofsky's position was temporarily assumed by two non-disabled employees: Edgardo Rivera, the new Assistant Commissioner for Administration, and Shayvonne Nathaniel, the new Director of Administration for the Office of the Inspector General. Peters testified that he made the decision to demote Natofsky, although he discussed it with Pogoda.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Retaliation and Natofsky's Resignation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Natofsky wrote an email to both Peters and Pogoda on May 28, 2014, protesting their decision to demote him. On June 6, 2014, Pogoda informed Natofsky that he would be moved from his private office to a cubicle. The cubicle was in a high-traffic, high-volume area, and had been used previously by Natofsky's secretary. Natofsky alerted Rivera to the loud volume, and Natofsky was subsequently moved to a different location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On June 18, 2014, Natofsky appealed his demotion to the Deputy Commissioner for Administration in the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (the \"DCAS\"), stating that he \"was given no justifiable reason as to why [his] salary was so drastically cut,\" and that his demotion was \"illegitimate and contrary to law.\" On June 23, 2014, DCAS wrote to Rivera regarding Natofsky's nearly fifty percent pay cut: \"In general, managers should not lose more than 20% of their salary when they are reassigned to a lower managerial level or to their permanent leave line.\" However, DCAS noted that a twenty percent cut from $ 125,000 -- Natofsky's prior salary -- would result in a salary above the maximum allowed for an Associate Staff Analyst, Natofsky's new position. DCAS thus ordered Natofsky's salary be raised from $ 68,466 to $ 88,649 -- the maximum permitted for Natofsky's new title. Natofsky's salary was readjusted one month later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In December 2014, Natofsky resigned from the DOI and began working as an Operations and Budget Administrator at the New York City Department of Transportation with a salary of $ 100,437.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    F. The District Court's Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Natofsky filed the complaint in this action on July 22, 2014, alleging that the City of New York, Pogoda, Ulon, and Peters violated the Rehabilitation Act by discriminating against Natofsky on the basis of his disability, by failing to accommodate his hearing impairment, and by retaliating against him when he complained about their discriminatory actions. He brought similar claims under state and local law, although he also premised those claims on age discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Following discovery, Defendants moved for summary judgment, which, on August 8, 2017, the district court granted. Addressing Natofsky's employment discrimination claims, the district court held that (1) Ulon's request that Natofsky adjust his work hours and vacation time was not an adverse employment action; (2) Natofsky failed to show that Ulon gave her negative performance review \"solely because of Natofsky's disability,\" (3) Natofsky failed to demonstrate that Peters demoted Natofsky for any discriminatory reason, and (4) Pogoda's purported discriminatory animus\n   could not be imputed to Peters. The district court also held that Natofsky had failed to establish a failure-to-accommodate or retaliation claim under the Rehabilitation Act. The district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Natofsky's state and city law claims as it had dismissed all of the claims over which it had original jurisdiction. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    I. MOTION TO SUPPLEMENT THE RECORD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As a preliminary matter, Natofsky has moved pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 10(e)(2) to supplement the record to include deposition testimony that he failed to present to the district court. Specifically, he seeks to include additional transcript pages from Pogoda's and Peters's depositions in an attempt to show that Pogoda, along with Peters, had the authority to demote Natofsky. Rule 10(e)(2) only permits a party to supplement the record when that party omitted material evidence \"by error or accident.\" Fed. R. App. P. 10(e)(2). As we have previously stated, \" Rule 10(e) is not a device for presenting evidence to this Court that was not before the trial judge.\"\n   <em>\n    Eng v. New York Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=199%20F.3d%201322\">\n    199 F.3d 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 1999). Natofsky admits that he did not omit the deposition testimony he now seeks to include because of error or mistake. Thus, his motion to supplement the record must be denied. Defendants' cross-motion to strike Natofsky's supplementary materials and the portions of his brief that refer to those materials is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    II. MERITS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Natofsky contests the district court's award of summary judgment to Defendants. We review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   a grant of summary judgment, \"construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor.\"\n   <em>\n    McElwee v. Cty. of Orange\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3638628\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/700/635/#p640\">\n    700 F.3d 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 640 (2d Cir. 2012). A moving party is entitled to summary judgment where the record reveals \"no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A factual dispute is genuine \"if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    477 U.S. 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 248,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    91 L.Ed.2d 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Employment Discrimination Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Rehabilitation Act's Causation Standard for Employment Discrimination Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The district court dismissed Natofsky's employment discrimination claims, in part, because Natofsky could not demonstrate that impermissible bias was \"the\n   <em>\n    sole\n   </em>\n   reason\" for any of the adverse employment actions he experienced.\n   <em>\n    Natofsky v. City of New York\n   </em>\n   , No. 14 CIV. 5498 (NRB),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203670037\">\n    2017 WL 3670037\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 8, 2017). On appeal, Natofsky argues that the district court erred in relying on a sole-cause standard because the Rehabilitation Act makes a distinction between employment discrimination claims, which require courts to adopt the more lenient causation standard used in the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"the ADA\"), and other types of discrimination claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Rehabilitation Act provides that no individual shall be subject to discrimination in any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance \"\n   <em>\n    solely by reason\n   </em>\n   of her or his disability.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added). This language differs from the ADA, which makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an individual \"\n   <em>\n    on the basis of\n   </em>\n   disability.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012112\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added). Although the two acts appear to have different causation standards, Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act in 1992 to add a provision which states that \"[t]he standards used to determine whether this section has been violated in a complaint alleging employment discrimination ... shall be the standards applied under title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Whether \u00a7 794(d) requires courts to use the ADA's causation standard for claims alleging employment discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act is an issue of first impression in this Circuit. The two principal cases cited by Defendants are not dispositive. In\n   <em>\n    Sedor v. Frank\n   </em>\n   , we affirmed the dismissal of a plaintiff's Rehabilitation Act employment discrimination claim because the plaintiff failed to show that his disability was \"the only cause of the discharge-triggering conduct.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416545\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/42/741/#p746\">\n    42 F.3d 741\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 746 (2d Cir. 1994). In\n   <em>\n    Borkowski v. Valley Central School District\n   </em>\n   , we also accepted the premise that to avoid summary judgment a plaintiff must \"introduce evidence sufficient to permit a factfinder to conclude that she was denied tenure solely because of her disabilities.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414204\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/63/131/#p143\">\n    63 F.3d 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 143 (2d Cir. 1995). In both\n   <em>\n    Sedor\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Borkowski\n   </em>\n   , however, the parties accepted that a plaintiff had to demonstrate that any adverse employment action was taken \"solely\" because of the plaintiff's disability. Neither party raised, and this Circuit never addressed, the issue of whether \u00a7 794(d) altered the causation standard for employment discrimination claims brought under the Rehabilitation Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   We now hold that when a plaintiff alleges an employment discrimination claim under the Rehabilitation Act, the causation standard that applies is the same one that would govern a complaint alleging employment discrimination under the ADA. The text of the statute, \u00a7 794(d), requires applying the ADA causation standard to employment discrimination claims asserted under the Rehabilitation Act. It is an established canon of construction that a specific provision \"controls over one of more general application.\"\n   <em>\n    Gozlon-Peretz v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6227711\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/395/#p407\">\n    498 U.S. 395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 407,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6227711\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/395/#p407\">\n    111 S.Ct. 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6227711\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/395/#p407\">\n    112 L.Ed.2d 919\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991). Subsection 794(d) is, in our opinion, more specific than \u00a7 794(a) and, therefore, displaces the causation standard expressed in \u00a7 794(a) in the employment discrimination context. In other words, \u00a7 794(a) establishes a general causation standard that applies to most discrimination claims brought under the Rehabilitation Act,\n   <em>\n    see e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reg'l Econ. Cmty. Action Program v. City of Middletown,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9408122\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/294/35/\">\n    294 F.3d 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2002) (applying the \"solely by reason of\" causation language to a housing discrimination case),\n   <em>\n    superseded by statute on other grounds\n   </em>\n   , ADA Amendments of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-325,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20Stat.%203553\">\n    122 Stat. 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but \u00a7 749(d) removes employment discrimination claims from the application of \u00a7 794(a)'s general causation standard and mandates the application of the ADA's causation standard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The other cases cited by Defendants in defense of their position do not persuade us that our reading of the statute should be otherwise.\n   <em>\n    Parker v. Columbia Pictures Industries\n   </em>\n   was an employment discrimination case brought under the ADA, and any discussion of the Rehabilitation Act was\n   <em>\n    dicta\n   </em>\n   .\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11469130\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/326/#p337\">\n    204 F.3d 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 337 (2d Cir. 2000).\n   <em>\n    Henrietta D. v. Bloomberg\n   </em>\n   was a case based on the defendants' failure to provide plaintiffs with public benefits, not an employment discrimination case.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9111346\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/331/261/#p272\">\n    331 F.3d 261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 272 (2d Cir. 2003). Thus, any discussion of differences between the ADA and Rehabilitation Act in that case is irrelevant here. In\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Board of Education of Fallsburgh Central School District\n   </em>\n   , we stated that the Rehabilitation Act does not permit mixed-motive suits.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9124353\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/63/46/#p48\">\n    63 F. App'x 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 48 (2d Cir. 2003). This is not the same as stating that the causation standard of the Rehabilitation Act for employment discrimination claims is a \"solely by reason of\" standard. Finally, Defendants rely on\n   <em>\n    Lewis v.

Neither the Supreme Court nor this Circuit, however, has addressed whether the same theory would apply to statutes requiring plaintiffs to demonstrate that discriminatory intent was the but-for cause of an adverse employment action.

Defendants never responded on appeal to Natofsky's application of Cat's Paw liability to the Rehabilitation Act, and, as a consequence, Defendants have waived any objection to proceeding under this theory. We will therefore assume that Natofsky can pursue a Cat's Paw theory and, thus, any discriminatory intent harbored by Pogoda can be imputed to Peters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Liability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Even assuming Pogoda's discriminatory intent can be imputed to Peters, Natofsky failed to present the district court with evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude that, but for his hearing disability, Natofsky would not have been demoted. There was ample evidence that Pogoda and Peters had reason to (and did) think that Natofsky's performance was deficient and demoted him on that basis. First, Pogoda noted in March 2014 her view that Natofsky was \"clueless.\" Second, that same month, Natofsky failed to provide Peters with information regarding staffing and budgeting at the DOI, two areas under Natofsky's purview. Third, there was a new administration in office that was restructuring the department in which Natofsky worked. Defendants presented evidence that other employees had been asked to leave or were transferred from their positions, including Natofsky's immediate supervisor, Ulon. We conclude that \"construing the evidence in the light most favorable\" to Natofsky and \"drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor,\" no reasonable juror could conclude that Natofsky would have retained his position but for his disability.\n   <em>\n    McElwee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3638628\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/700/635/#p640\">\n    700 F.3d at 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   We also note that, drawing all inferences in Natofsky's favor, no reasonable factfinder could conclude that the explanation of poor performance proffered by Pogoda and Peters was pretextual. Pogoda's March 2014 email calling Natofsky \"clueless,\" Ulon's negative performance review on or about May 1, 2014, and Natofsky's failure to answer Peters's staffing and budgetary inquiries are contemporaneous evidence of Natofsky's poor performance. That a prior administration had praised Natofsky's work is not enough to establish that the new administration could not have concluded that he was underperforming.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Viola v.

Claims Based on Ulon's Conduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Natofsky also argues that Ulon's denial of his preferred work hours and vacation time, as well as the negative performance review she gave him, constitute adverse employment actions, and that those actions would not have occurred but for Ulon's discriminatory intent. For the reasons set forth below, we agree with the district court's decision to grant summary judgment to Defendants on these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   First, fatal to Natofsky's claims is his failure to provide evidence of Ulon's discriminatory intent. Natofsky points to Ulon's complaints about his timeliness in responding to emails as evidence of discriminatory intent. He attributes any delay in responding to emails a result of his inability to reply to emails during meetings, which he was unable to do because of his hearing disability. Natofsky, however, points to no evidence that Ulon's critique of his email responsiveness was based specifically\n   on Natofsky's failure to respond to emails during meetings, as opposed to a more general critique of his timeliness in responding to emails. Therefore, criticism of his email practices provides no basis to conclude that Ulon had discriminatory intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Second, Ulon's initial demands that Natofsky change his work hours and vacation time did not adversely affect him because she dropped her demands after meeting with Hearn and Natofsky. Furthermore, it is unlikely that these workplace changes, had they even occurred, would count as actionable adverse actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis v. New York City Dep't of Educ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358124\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/231/#p235\">\n    804 F.3d 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 235 (2d Cir. 2015) (for an employer's action to be \"materially adverse with respect to the terms and conditions of employment,\" it must be \"more disruptive than a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities\" (internal quotation marks omitted));\n   <em>\n    see e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Kaur v.

In addition, there is no evidence that either Pogoda or Peters relied upon Ulon's review in deciding to demote Natofsky, and a negative performance review, without any showing of a negative ramification, cannot constitute an adverse employment action.\n   <em>\n    Fairbrother v.

As previously stated, there is no evidence that Ulon was referring to Natofsky's inability to respond to emails during meetings in her performance review. Nor as noted earlier is there any evidence that Pogoda or Peters considered Ulon's review when they decided to demote Natofsky.

He argues that Ulon wrote the March 10, 2014 counseling memo and May 1, 2014 negative performance review in retaliation for Natofsky's decision to complain about Ulon to Hearn. He argues that the protected activity -- the decision to speak to Hearn -- was followed closely by Ulon's adverse employment actions. This argument, however, must fail because Ulon's actions occurred in 2014, almost a year after the meeting with Hearn -- too long a period of time for a jury to be able to infer a causal connection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harrison v.

App'x 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 41 (2d Cir. 2011) (concluding a period of \"several months\" between when a plaintiff engaged in a protected activity and when he suffered an adverse employment action was too long to support the inference of a causal connection). Natofsky argues that Ulon stalled in retaliating against him because she was waiting until Hearn left the DOI. Natofsky, however, provides no evidence for this assertion, and, therefore, summary judgment was appropriate for his claim of retaliation based on Ulon's conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Natofsky next argues that Pogoda and Peters retaliated against him for his decision to appeal Ulon's negative performance review on May 8, 2014 by demoting him. This claim fails for two reasons. First, appealing a negative performance\n   review is not a protected activity that can give rise to a retaliation claim. \"Protected activity\" is \"action taken to protest or oppose statutorily prohibited discrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    Cruz v. Coach Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"917939\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/202/560/#p566\">\n    202 F.3d 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 566 (2d Cir. 2000),\n   <em>\n    superseded on other grounds by\n   </em>\n   N.Y.C. Local L. No. 85. The record shows that Natofsky was not protesting discrimination in his appeal but offering a defense of why he may have been slow in responding to emails. Second, the record reveals that the decision to reorganize the department and demote Natofsky was made in March or April 2014, in advance of Ulon's performance review and Natofsky's decision to appeal that review. Thus, Natofsky's demotion could not have been in retaliation for his appeal of Ulon's performance review. The district court properly awarded Defendants summary judgment on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Natofsky's final retaliation claim relating to the challenges he made to his demotion cannot survive summary judgment because those challenges also do not constitute protected activity. Natofsky challenged his demotion first by sending the May 28, 2014 email to Peters and Pogoda, and then by appealing to DCAS on June 18, 2014. Neither gave any specific indication that Natofsky was protesting discrimination. Natofsky's May 28, 2014 email and DCAS appeal stated that his demotion was \"illegitimate and contrary to law.\" This statement is too general to indicate that Natofsky was protesting his demotion as discriminatory and, therefore, cannot sustain a retaliation claim.\n   <em>\n    Lucio v.

It could have changed the ADA's causation standard with the 2008 Amendments, but it did not do so. \"[W]e have recognized that Congress' failure to disturb a consistent judicial interpretation of a statute may provide some indication that Congress at least acquiesces in, and apparently affirms, that interpretation.\"\n   <em>\n    Monessen Sw.

The fact that Congress amended the ADA to reject an interpretation of the ADA that was not aligned with Congress's intent demonstrates that it likely would have done so for the ADA's causation standard if the courts, in applying the motivating-factor standard, were applying the wrong standard. Its decision not to amend the ADA indicates its at least implicit acceptance of the motivating-factor standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Third, the language of the ADA confirms that the motivating-factor standard still applies.

No. 101-485, pt. 3, at 48 (1990),\n   <em>\n    as reprinted in\n   </em>\n   1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 445, 471. Therefore, \"[b]y retaining the cross-reference to [T]itle VII, the Committee's intent [wa]s that the remedies of [T]itle VII, currently and\n   <em>\n    as amended in the future\n   </em>\n   , will be applicable to persons with disabilities.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3885643\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/681/312/#p315\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3885643\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/681/312/#p315\">\n    681 F.3d at 322-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Clay, J., dissenting) (explaining why the ADA's legislative history supports applying a motivating-factor standard).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   For those reasons, I believe the ADA's causation standard continues to be the motivating-factor standard. Because the Rehabilitation Act incorporates the ADA's causation standard, the motivating-factor standard applies to Natofsky's claims. Under the motivating-factor standard, Natofsky \"must show only that disability played a motivating role\" in defendants' decision to take adverse employment action; Natofsky \"need not demonstrate that disability was the sole cause of the adverse employment action.\"\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11469130\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/326/#p337\">\n    204 F.3d at 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Here, Natofsky has put forth evidence that Pogoda and Ulon were at least motivated in part by Natofsky's disability. First, Natofsky presented evidence that Pogoda -- whose discriminatory intent can be imputed to Peters,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vasquez v. Empress Ambulance Serv., Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4353416\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/835/267/#p272\">\n    835 F.3d 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 272-73 (2d Cir. 2016) (applying cat's paw theory of liability to a claim evaluated under the mixed-motive causation standard) -- fixated on the physical markers of his hearing disability, shook her head in disgust and rolled her eyes after Natofsky told her about his hearing disability, demanded he speak faster, and otherwise ridiculed him for his speech. Second, as evidence of Ulon's discriminatory animus, Natofsky presented evidence of two conversations during which his disability was discussed: his exchange with Ulon about email responsiveness and Hearn's conversation with Ulon regarding Natofsky's hours and vacation request. There was other evidence as well, including inexplicably harsh treatment: when new management came in, Natofsky quickly fell from a highly compensated, highly-evaluated supervisor to a poorly-evaluated generalist making just over half his prior salary and confined to what had been his former assistant's cubicle. \"[C]onstruing the evidence in the light most favorable\" to Natofsky and \"drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor,\" a reasonable juror could conclude that Natofsky's disability was a motivating factor in the adverse employment actions against him and that the reasons stated by Pogoda, Peters, and Ulon were pretextual.\n   <em>\n    McElwee v. Cty. of Orange\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3638628\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/700/635/#p640\">\n    700 F.3d 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 640 (2d Cir. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Accordingly, I would vacate the district court's award of summary judgment dismissing Natofsky's discrimination and failure-to-accommodate claims and remand for those claims to be considered under the correct legal standard, and I respectfully dissent to that extent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    In relevant part, \u00a7 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) provides that where an individual proves a violation of \u00a7 2000e-2(m) (\"an unlawful employment practice is established when the complaining party demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice\"), the relief is limited if the \"respondent demonstrates that the respondent would have taken the same action in the absence of the motivating factor.\"\n    <em>\n     But see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Lewis\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3885643\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/681/312/#p315\">\n     681 F.3d at 320\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (explaining that \"\u00a7 2000e-5 does not direct judges to apply the substantive motivating factor standard from \u00a7 2000e-2(m) ; it permits them only to provide a remedy for plaintiffs who prove a violation under section 2000e-2(m),\" which \"says nothing about disability status\" (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
