Because this court concludes that a prisoner bringing a successive \u00a7 2255 petition must show that it is \"more likely than not\" that the sentencing court relied on the residual clause to prove that his claim \"relies on\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , the district court's judgment is AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Following a jury trial in 2008, Petitioner Glen B. Clay, federal prisoner #09299-043, was convicted of violating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1) for being a felon in possession of a firearm. That conviction ordinarily carries a maximum sentence of ten years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). However, both the superseding indictment and the presentence report (\"PSR\") indicated that Clay was punishable under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"), which imposes a 15-year minimum sentence on defendants who have at least three prior convictions for \"violent felonies\" or for \"serious drug offenses\" when the underlying crimes were committed on different occasions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). During sentencing, Clay's counsel conceded that the ACCA applied. Thereafter, the sentencing court adopted the PSR's recommendations and applied the ACCA sentencing enhancement, sentencing Clay to 235 months' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Clay timely appealed both his conviction and sentence, but he did not challenge the ACCA sentencing enhancement on direct appeal or in his initial habeas petition. Clay's acceptance of the ACCA's applicability evaporated, however, after the Supreme Court issued its decision in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. United States\n   </em>\n   and held that \"imposing an increased sentence under the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act violates the Constitution's guarantee of due process.\" --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/#p2563\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2563,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/#p2563\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). Claiming that the sentencing court relied on the residual clause to impose his ACCA-enhanced sentence, Clay sought permission to file a successive \u00a7 2255 habeas petition in light of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   . This court granted him permission in 2016, reasoning that because \"[t]he record before us contains no documentation of Clay's predicate offenses,\" there is a \"possibility that he was sentenced under the residual clause.\" In so doing, this court cautioned that its \"grant of authorization [was] tentative in that the district court must dismiss the \u00a7 2255 motion without reaching the merits if it determines that Clay has failed to make the showing required to file such a motion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Clay filed his successive \u00a7 2255 habeas petition in district court. At bottom, Clay alleged that the sentencing court \"only relied on the now invalid 'residual clause' to establish that [his] prior state court convictions supported an enhanced sentence\" under the ACCA. Clay's petition acknowledged that the record did not include any documents relating to his underlying state-court convictions which proved that the sentencing court relied on the residual clause. Accordingly, Clay asked the district court to obtain \"appropriate adjudicative records\" during the process of evaluating his petition to determine \"whether any of Clay's convictions qualify as violent felonies under the ACCA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The district court denied Clay's successive petition without obtaining the requisite documents. First, the district court held that it lacked jurisdiction over Clay's successive petition because Clay \"has not\n   demonstrated that the court relied on the residual clause in sentencing him\" and therefore \"has not shown that his case falls within the rule announced in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   .\" Second, in the alternative, the district court held that Clay \"failed to show that he is entitled to relief on the merits\" because his prior convictions qualify as \"violent felonies\" under the enumerated offenses clause of the ACCA, which means that any error from the sentencing court's reliance on the residual clause is harmless. In its order denying Clay's successive petition, the district court also denied a certificate of appealability (\"COA\"). Clay then sought a COA before this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This court granted Clay a COA to challenge the district court's denial of his successive \u00a7 2255 petition. The COA was granted on two issues, which parallel the district court's alternate holdings: (1) \"whether a prisoner seeking the district court's authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion raising a\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim must establish that he was sentenced under the residual clause to show that the claim relies on\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   \"; and (2) \"whether any\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   error at sentencing was harmless because Clay's 1982 house burglaries constituted enumerated burglary under the ACCA.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"In challenges to district court decisions under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we measure findings of fact against the clearly erroneous standard and questions of law\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Although both documents report that Clay was eligible for an ACCA sentencing enhancement, neither document identifies which of Clay's prior convictions were used to make that determination or\n   which definitional clauses of the ACCA were used to define those convictions as \"violent felonies.\" Moreover, because Clay's counsel conceded at his hearing that the ACCA applied, there was no occasion for the sentencing court to clarify how the requisite \"violent felonies\" were tabulated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   For the sentencing court to have lawfully imposed the ACCA sentencing enhancement, it would have needed to determine that at least three of Clay's prior convictions were for \"violent felonies\" under the ACCA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1). Because Clay's armed robbery and aggravated assault convictions stemmed from the same incident, they would have counted together as only one ACCA-qualifying offense. Therefore, the sentencing court must have determined that at least two of Clay's six burglary convictions were \"violent felonies.\" Neither the district court nor the parties allege that Clay's convictions for \"business burglary\" were \"violent felonies.\" The question reduces to whether at least two of Clay's convictions for \"house burglary\" were correctly considered \"violent felonies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Clay argues that the only way the sentencing court could have counted his \"house burglary\" convictions as \"violent felonies\" is for the sentencing court to have relied on the now-unconstitutional residual clause.

However, if the state statute of conviction \"define[s] burglary more broadly,\n   <em>\n    e.g\n   </em>\n   ., by eliminating the requirement that the entry be unlawful, or by including places, such as automobiles and vending\n   machines, other than buildings,\" the conviction generally will not qualify.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 599-602,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p580\">\n    110 S.Ct. at 2158-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In this case, the district court found (and the government argues on appeal) that Clay's \"house burglary\" convictions were for violating Mississippi Code Annotated \u00a7 97-17-19 (1972), which criminalized \"breaking and entering any dwelling house, in the day or night, with intent to commit a crime.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Course v.

Because that statute includes \"the basic elements of unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime,\" the district court concluded under the categorical approach that Clay's convictions for \"house burglary\" were enumerated \"violent felonies\" under the ACCA.\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p580\">\n    495 U.S. at 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p580\">\n    110 S.Ct. at 2158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the district court reasoned, \"even if the [sentencing] court relied on the residual clause ... Clay's sentence was properly enhanced under the ACCA and thus, he has suffered no prejudice from any\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   error.\" On these grounds, the district court denied Clay's successive \u00a7 2255 petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Clay disputes this result on three bases. His first two arguments challenge the district court's analysis under the categorical approach, insisting (for various reasons) that \u00a7 97-17-19 does not comport with \"generic burglary\" under the ACCA. This court finds those arguments unavailing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Clay's third argument, however, is more compelling and requires this court to resolve the first issue identified in the COA-namely, the degree to which a prisoner must prove that he was sentenced under the residual clause before he is entitled to bring a successive \u00a7 2255 petition raising a\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In his third argument, Clay contends that it is impossible for this court to determine whether his prior convictions were for enumerated felonies under the categorical approach because, at the time of his convictions, the Mississippi Code Annotated had multiple statutes criminalizing the burglary of a house and neither the superseding\n   indictment, PSR, nor sentencing court indicated which of those statutes he was convicted of violating. Consequently, although Mississippi Code Annotated \u00a7 97-17-19 (1972) may comport with the definition of \"generic burglary,\" it is not clear that Clay was convicted of violating \u00a7 97-17-19. Instead, his \"house burglary\" convictions could have been for violating Mississippi Code Annotated \u00a7 97-17-21 (1972) (\"Burglary: Inhabited Dwelling\"); \u00a7 97-17-23 (1972) (\"Burglary: Inhabited Dwelling-Breaking in at Night While Armed With Deadly Weapon\"); \u00a7 97-17-25 (1972) (\"Burglary: Breaking Out of Dwelling\"); \u00a7 97-17-27 (1972) (\"Burglary: Breaking Inner Door of Dwelling at Night\"); or \u00a7 97-17-29 (1972) (\"Burglary: Breaking Inner Door of Dwelling by One Lawfully in House\"). Not all of these statutes comport with the definition of \"generic burglary\" in the enumerated offenses clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 97-17-25 (criminalizing unlawful exit of a dwelling house after committing a crime therein, with no mention of \"unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in\" that house \"with intent to commit a crime\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Without conviction records, this court cannot conclusively determine which statute(s) Clay was convicted of violating-and, accordingly, whether his prior convictions for \"house burglary\" qualified as \"violent felonies\" under the ACCA's enumerated offenses clause. Therefore, this court cannot rule out the possibility that the sentencing court relied solely on the residual clause to impose Clay's ACCA-enhanced sentence. In the face of this ambiguity, Clay asks this court to reverse the district court and vacate his enhanced sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In making this argument, Clay returns this court to our prior discussion of the appropriate standard of proof. On the record before this court, Clay has shown that the sentencing court \"may have\" relied on the residual clause to enhance his sentence. Therefore, if this court adopts the standard articulated by the Fourth, and Ninth Circuits, Clay will have sustained his burden of proof and the district court will have had jurisdiction over his successive \u00a7 2255 petition. However, Clay has not shown that the sentencing court \"more likely than not\" relied on the residual clause. Mississippi Code Annotated \u00a7 97-17-19 (1972) appears to have been the primary statute criminalizing \"house burglary\" in 1982-as indicated in part by its title: \"Burglary: Breaking and Entering Dwelling\"-which makes it just as likely that the district court correctly identified \u00a7 97-17-19 as the statute of conviction as that it incorrectly identified it. Moreover, the PSR's descriptions of Clay's \"house burglary\" convictions suggest that \u00a7 97-17-19 was the likely statute of conviction, and Clay has pointed to nothing in the record indicating otherwise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wiese\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517758\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/896/720/#p723\">\n    896 F.3d at 725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (declaring that this court may look to the PSR \"[i]n determining potential reliance on the residual clause by the sentencing court\"). Therefore, if this court adopts the standard articulated by the First, Third, Sixth, Eighth, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits, Clay will have failed to prove that his successive \u00a7 2255 petition relies on\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and the district court will have lacked jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Cf\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266600\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1215/#p1221\">\n    871 F.3d at 1224-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that if \"it is unclear from the record whether the sentencing court had relied on the residual clause,\" the prisoner-who bears the burden of proof-\"loses\") (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Faced with a situation where the standard of proof makes a difference to the outcome,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   this court sides with the\n   majority of circuits and holds that a prisoner seeking the district court's authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 petition raising a\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim must show that it was more likely than not that he was sentenced under the residual clause.

(citing\n    <em>\n     United States v.

May 10, 2018) (emphasis omitted)). Clay appears to argue that, because this court held in 2017 that the current Mississippi burglary statute is broader than \"generic burglary,\" his convictions under a now-superseded burglary statute cannot be enumerated felonies under the ACCA. (citing\n    <em>\n     United States v. Johnson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5750074\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/477/182/#p183\">\n     477 F.

As a result, it is irrelevant that this court-in a 2017 unpublished opinion-held that the 1992-version of Mississippi's burglary statute is broader than the generic definition.
