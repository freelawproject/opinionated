We hold that it may not. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In March 2012, 8Speed8, Inc. was incorporated in the state of Nevada. Appellant Vibe Micro, Inc. is a 50% owner of 8Speed8's voting stock. Appellee SIG Capital, Inc. is a creditor of 8Speed8 and owns 20 million contingent shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On December 13, 2013, SIG filed the involuntary bankruptcy petition at the center of this dispute. 8Speed8 never appeared in the bankruptcy action. Instead, on January 10, 2014, Vibe Micro filed a motion to dismiss the bankruptcy. Vibe Micro also asked for costs, fees, and actual and punitive damages under \u00a7 303(i). The bankruptcy court held a hearing August 28, 2014. At the hearing, SIG conceded that dismissal was appropriate. The bankruptcy court agreed but denied Vibe Micro's request for statutory attorney's fees and damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The court concluded that Vibe Micro did not have standing under \u00a7 301(i). The district court affirmed that decision, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We review the bankruptcy court's interpretation of bankruptcy statutes de novo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sofris v.

Specifically, we examined two interpretations of standing to seek \u00a7 303(i) damages: Either the presence of the phrase \"in favor of the debtor\" in \u00a7 303(i)(1) (regarding costs and attorney's fees) limits standing to collect all \u00a7 303(i) damages to the debtor, or the omission of that phrase from \u00a7 303(i)(2) (regarding other damages for bad faith filings) allows persons other than the debtor to collect damages for bad faith filings, but not costs and attorney's fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"887907,1594179\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/430/1083/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"887907,1594179\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/430/1083/\">\n    at 1093\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In evaluating those competing interpretations, we considered legislative history, relevant caselaw, and public policy to determine the proper reading of the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"887907,1594179\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/430/1083/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Barstow v.

With those factors in mind, we concluded that \u00a7 303(i) limits standing to recover statutory damages resulting from an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding to the debtor. Those same factors compel a similar result here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   First, the relevant House and Senate Reports suggest that only the debtor has standing to seek \u00a7 303(i) damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.R.Rep.

Appellant's attempts to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Miles\n   </em>\n   on its facts are unavailing. Appellant notes that, in\n   <em>\n    Miles\n   </em>\n   , the debtor actually appeared in the involuntary proceedings, but in contrast, 8Speed8 never appeared in this case. Although true, Appellant's distinction does not require disparate treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Appellants would have this court believe they are mere martyrs, standing up for the interests of 8Speed8 when no one else would. But, as valiant as Vibe Micro's intentions may have been, they were unnecessary. The Code has within its sections a\n   remedy for cases like this: Section 305 gives the bankruptcy court the power to dismiss an involuntary petition sua sponte. \"The court, after notice and a hearing, may dismiss a case ... at any time if ... the interests of creditors and the debtor would be better served by such ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20305\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Accident Claims Determination Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6500220\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/146/64/#p67\">\n    146 B.R. 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 67-68 (Bankr.

S.D.N.Y. 1992) (dismissing an involuntary petition after finding that the petition was filed by a corporate shareholder to gain leverage over another shareholder). Accordingly, Vibe Micro's appearance in this case was just as voluntary as was the appearance of the third parties in\n   <em>\n    Miles\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Third, reading \u00a7 303(i) to permit only the debtor to seek damages is consistent with its purpose and the policy interests underlying it. Section 303(i) is intended to alleviate the consequences that involuntary proceedings impose on the debtor. Those consequences include \"loss of credit standing, inability to transfer assets and carry on business affairs, and public embarrassment.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Reid\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"18593,6125036\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/773/945/\">\n    773 F.2d 945\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 946 (7th Cir. 1985). A third party, who intervenes freely in an involuntary action, does not face those same consequences. Even if it did, \u00a7 303(i) would still not\n   <em>\n    guarantee\n   </em>\n   costs, fees, or damages. An award under \u00a7 303(i) -which states that the court \"may\" award costs, fees, or damages-is not mandatory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Susman v.

The Majority finds that this is the case even when, as here, the debtor never appeared in the involuntary bankruptcy action, was prevented from appearing by its deadlocked governance, and the third party who appeared on behalf of the debtor successfully defended the involuntary bankruptcy. This rule, according to the Majority, is absolute, regardless of how closely related the third party is to the debtor, and even though the third party only seeks an award in favor of the debtor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because\n   <em>\n    Miles\n   </em>\n   never went so far, and\n   because I believe the Majority's rule is inconsistent with both the relevant statutory text and the policies underlying the Bankruptcy Act, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Appellant Vibe Micro, Inc. owned 50% of the debtor 8Speed8's vested voting shares. Appellee SIG, LLC owned contingent shares in 8Speed8, which had not vested at the time of the involuntary bankruptcy petition. 8Speed8's board of directors reflected its collective ownership, with a director appointed from each of the owners, including SIG. Any action taken on behalf of the company required a two-thirds majority of the directors or the shareholders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On December 13, 2013, SIG filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition against 8Speed8. According to Vibe Micro, both SIG and Luxor Entertainment, Inc.-the other 50% shareholder-intended to liquidate 8Speed8 contrary to Vibe Micro's position and inconsistent with its interests. Since \"no one else could or would appear,\" Vibe Micro filed a motion to dismiss on behalf of 8Speed8, which the bankruptcy court granted. Vibe Micro also sought, on behalf of the debtor, 1) costs or a reasonable attorney's fee, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(1) ; and 2) \"damages proximately caused by\" what it claimed was the bad faith filing of the petition, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(2).

SIG admitted that 8Speed8 was essentially non-functional because of the shareholders' disputes: \"[T]here was a breakdown. There was a lack of communication. There was a shareholder meeting called that was-that not all the shareholders wanted to attend.\" Any action on behalf of 8Speed8 required a two-thirds majority, either of the board (which included SIG) or of the shareholders\n   (which were split 50-50). There is no indication that a vote of any kind ever took place. Under these circumstances, it is likely that Vibe Micro was the only party willing or able to defend 8Speed8 against involuntary bankruptcy, as it has asserted. The bankruptcy court should have at least determined whether Vibe Micro was correct in its assertion that, but for its actions, the debtor's interests would have gone wholly unrepresented and undefended. If Vibe Micro was truly the only party willing and able to act for 8Speed8, it should have been allowed to seek fees and damages under \u00a7 303(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The cases cited by the Majority do not support its rule.\n   <em>\n    In re Mike Hammer Productions, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , which the Majority cites for the proposition that \"Congress intended only the debtor to have standing to seek damages,\" Maj.

Vibe Micro is not such an independent third party-it was acting as a 50% shareholder during a corporate governance breakdown. Vibe Micro has always asserted that no other entity was willing to defend 8Speed8, and Vibe Micro claimed fees and damages, not after the fact and not for itself, as in\n   <em>\n    Miles\n   </em>\n   , but in the bankruptcy proceeding and for the debtor, as part of its motion to dismiss filed on the debtor's behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Miles\n   </em>\n   primarily dealt with the meaning of \u00a7 303(i)(2), which allows for \"damages against any petitioner\" proximately caused by the bad faith filing of an involuntary petition.\n   <em>\n    Miles\n   </em>\n   found that the language in \u00a7 303(i)(1) -that fees and costs could only be awarded \"in favor of the debtor\"-should be read into \u00a7 303(i)(2).\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"887907,1594179\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/430/1083/\">\n    430 F.3d at 1093-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Moreover, reading the words \"in favor of the debtor\" into \u00a7 303(i)(2), as\n   <em>\n    Miles\n   </em>\n   does, would seem to support, rather than defeat, the claim made here by Vibe Micro. And,\n   <em>\n    Miles\n   </em>\n   certainly should not be read to bar a non-debtor who successfully obtains dismissal of a petition from obtaining \"judgment ... in favor of the debtor for ...

I cannot agree with the Majority's determination that Vibe Micro lacks standing to seek fees and damages that would be awarded to the debtor, regardless of the debtor's ability to defend itself in the bankruptcy action, and notwithstanding that Vibe Micro actually obtained a dismissal on behalf of the debtor.
