Chapman's decision not to re-appoint Mark F. McCaffrey as a deputy sheriff in Loudoun County, Virginia. In response, McCaffrey sued Sheriff Chapman, the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County and Loudoun County (collectively \"Appellees\"). McCaffrey alleges that Sheriff Chapman did not re-appoint him because he supported Sheriff Chapman's political opponent during the re-election campaign. McCaffrey claims that Sheriff Chapman's failure to re-appoint him for his political disloyalty violated his First Amendment rights to freedom of political association and speech. The district court found that the\n   <em>\n    Elrod\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Branti\n   </em>\n   doctrine, which permits public officials to fire certain employees for their support of a political opponent, precludes McCaffrey's First Amendment claims. Therefore, the district court dismissed McCaffrey's complaint. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A sheriff has the power, under Virginia law, to appoint deputy sheriffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appointments of deputy sheriffs technically expire at the end of a sheriff's four-year term, even if the sheriff is re-elected. In practice, deputy sheriffs are routinely re-appointed after each election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   McCaffrey started working in the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office (\"LCSO\") in 2005.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2008, he began working as a major crimes detective serving as a lead detective in complex, high-profile cases. McCaffrey supported Sheriff Chapman when he first ran for sheriff in 2011. However, when Sheriff Chapman ran for re-election in 2015, McCaffrey supported his opponent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   McCaffrey placed a sign in his yard in support of Sheriff Chapman's opponent and served as a delegate to the Republican convention in which the Republican candidate for sheriff was chosen. McCaffrey also participated as an outside advisor in the screening of local candidates for potential endorsement by the Board of Directors of the local chapter of the Virginia Police Benevolent Association. McCaffrey did not speak publicly about the election. He did not wear campaign apparel or accessories. He did not use his LCSO position in support of Sheriff Chapman's opponent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Sheriff Chapman viewed McCaffrey's support of his opponent as disloyal. McCaffrey's colleagues warned McCaffrey\n   that there would be consequences for his disloyalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After Sheriff Chapman won re-election, McCaffrey received a letter informing him that his appointment as a deputy sheriff would not be renewed. In addition to not reappointing McCaffrey, Sheriff Chapman lowered McCaffrey's score on his final performance evaluation to prevent McCaffrey from receiving a bonus. Sheriff Chapman also interfered with McCaffrey's opportunity to be considered for a law enforcement position sponsored by the LCSO and a nearby municipal police department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In response to Sheriff Chapman's actions, McCaffrey filed a complaint against Appellees in Virginia state court. McCaffrey alleged that Sheriff Chapman's decision not to re-appoint him violated his First Amendment rights to freedom of political association and speech under both the United States and the Virginia Constitution. Appellees removed the case to federal court based on federal question jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Appellees then moved to dismiss McCaffrey's complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Appellees asserted that Sheriff Chapman's decision not to re-appoint McCaffrey fell squarely within an exception to the First Amendment known as the\n   <em>\n    Elrod\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Branti\n   </em>\n   exception. As described more fully below, the\n   <em>\n    Elrod\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Branti\n   </em>\n   exception, when applicable, allows public officials to terminate public employees for supporting a political opponent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After oral argument, the district court found that the\n   <em>\n    Elrod\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Branti\n   </em>\n   exception applied and dismissed McCaffrey's complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   McCaffrey appealed the order of the dismissal.

In\n   <em>\n    Elrod\n   </em>\n   , a plurality of the Supreme Court established the general rule that dismissing public employees for political affiliation violates their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights by limiting their political belief and association. However, the Supreme Court simultaneously carved out a narrow exception to this general rule prohibiting patronage dismissals. A government official does not violate a public employee's First Amendment rights when the employee is dismissed for political association if the employee holds a policymaking position.\n   <em>\n    Elrod\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6176896\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/427/347/\">\n    427 U.S. at 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6176896\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/427/347/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 2673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The North Carolina legislature has declared that the offices of sheriff and deputy sheriff are of special concern and prescribed a mandatory procedure for filling a sheriff vacancy.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Under North Carolina law, the sheriff may not delegate his duties but is able to appoint deputies to assist him.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . For those appointed deputies, the sheriff is liable for their misbehavior.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Because a sheriff is liable for his deputies' actions, the legislature created deputies as at-will employees \"who 'shall serve at the pleasure of the appointing officer.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1164 (quoting N.C.

In\n   <em>\n    Bland\n   </em>\n   , three of the plaintiffs were uniformed jailers with the title of deputy sheriff.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 377.

In\n   <em>\n    Bland\n   </em>\n   , the jailers' authority was more circumscribed, and their training was more concentrated on matters of custodial care and supervision than the deputy sheriffs in\n   <em>\n    Jenkins\n   </em>\n   . Additionally, the jailers in\n   <em>\n    Bland\n   </em>\n   did not have arrest power, did not take the core law enforcement course and were not out in the county engaging in law enforcement activities on behalf of the sheriff.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 379.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Likewise, in\n   <em>\n    Knight v.

This Court found that a jailer's duties were \"essentially custodial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 551. As a result, this Court held that the\n   <em>\n    Elrod\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Branti\n   </em>\n   exception did not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Our precedent, when considered together, provides the framework for our\n   <em>\n    Elrod\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Branti\n   </em>\n   analysis. We first look to the electorate's approval of the policies on which the sheriff ran and the duties and responsibilities of the deputy sheriff in implementing those policies and priorities. We then examine the law of Virginia concerning the relationship between sheriffs and their deputies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Using this framework, we now turn to the facts of this case. Sheriff Chapman won an election for sheriff after espousing positions on how the LCSO should be run. As we have said before, \"[e]lections mean something. Majorities bestow mandates.\"\n   <em>\n    Borzilleri v. Mosby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263836\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/187/#p192\">\n    874 F.3d 187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 192 (4th Cir. 2017). Thus, Sheriff Chapman should be entitled, and indeed\n   <em>\n    Jenkins\n   </em>\n   provides that he has a duty, to carry out the policies the voters approved in the election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Next, the allegations in McCaffrey's complaint indicate his duties and responsibilities involved carrying out Sheriff's Chapman's policies and priorities. McCaffrey was a sworn deputy sheriff. He was a lead investigator of high-profile crimes including rape, robbery and homicide investigations. McCaffrey received the Loudoun County Investigator of the Month Award three times and was part of the \"Team of the Month\" three times. In 2015, McCaffrey was recognized for closing violent crime cases at a rate that significantly exceeded the national average. McCaffrey also received the Victim Services award from the Loudoun County Commonwealth Attorney's office. Like the deputy sheriffs in\n   <em>\n    Jenkins\n   </em>\n   and unlike the deputies in\n   <em>\n    Bland\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   , McCaffrey engaged in law enforcement functions on behalf of the sheriff. Under our precedent, a deputy sheriff with these duties and responsibilities falls within the\n   <em>\n    Elrod\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Branti\n   </em>\n   exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As this Court has made clear, a sworn deputy sheriff like McCaffrey had a special role in carrying out the law enforcement policies, goals and priorities on which Sheriff Chapman campaigned and prevailed.\n   <em>\n    Jenkins,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"199864\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/119/1156/#p1164\">\n    119 F.3d at 1162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Sheriff Chapman was entitled to carry out the policies on which he ran and won with deputy sheriffs who did not oppose his re-election. To repeat what this Court said in\n   <em>\n    Jenkins\n   </em>\n   , \"we do not believe it was ever contemplated that a sheriff must attempt to implement his policies and perform his duties through deputies who have expressed clear opposition to him.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1165.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   McCaffrey's complaint illustrates the rationale behind the\n   <em>\n    Elrod\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Branti\n   </em>\n   exception. An entire section of the complaint reads as a political attack ad against Sheriff Chapman. McCaffrey attacks Sheriff Chapman's character by accusing him of questionable fund raising, expenditures and hiring practices. McCaffrey alleges that Sheriff Chapman's treatment of employees was abusive and malicious and that Sheriff Chapman acted unprofessionally. McCaffrey also accuses Sheriff Chapman of mismanagement in the operations of the LCSO. Requiring a sheriff to employ deputies who have displayed the level of hostility portrayed in this complaint could reasonably impede a sheriff's obligation to his electorate to implement the platform on which he campaigned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   This does not mean that law enforcement responsibilities are or should be handled in a political manner. That, of course, should never be the case. Instead, our decision is based on the reality, recognized in\n   <em>\n    Jenkins\n   </em>\n   , that sheriffs do and should carry out the policies, goals and priorities on which they ran.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"199864\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/119/1156/#p1164\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"199864\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/119/1156/#p1164\">\n    at 1162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Sheriffs, by virtue of their executive roles, do not set policy in the same way as those performing legislative roles. But, in attempting to faithfully enforce the law, they must make policy-oriented decisions about the allocation of manpower and financial resources. A deputy sheriff necessarily carries out the sheriff's policies, goals and priorities which were approved by the electorate in a political election.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1162-63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Virginia law concerning the roles of sheriffs and their deputies confirms that deputies performing law enforcement functions have a policymaking role. Virginia's legislature passed laws specific to the role of the sheriff as a constitutional, elected officer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Va. Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.2-1609 - 15.2-1625 (1997). Virginia law prescribes a mandatory procedure for filling a vacancy in the sheriff's office.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Va. Code \u00a7 15.2-1600. Virginia law also specifies that sheriffs may appoint deputies to \"discharge any of the official duties of their principal during his continuance in office....\" Va. Code \u00a7 15.2-1603. It further mandates that deputies \"before entering upon the duties of his office, shall take and prescribe the oath. ...\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Virginia law also provides that \"any such deputy may be removed from office by his principal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Additionally, a sheriff in Virginia is civilly and criminally liable for the acts of his deputy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whited v. Fields\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3646860\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/581/1444/#p1455\">\n    581 F.Supp. 1444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1455 (W.D. Va. 1984) (finding that \"not only is the sheriff liable civilly for the acts of his deputy in Virginia, but he also is liable criminally and can be fined for the conduct of his deputy\"). Similar to North Carolina law discussed in\n   <em>\n    Jenkins\n   </em>\n   , the law of Virginia supports the conclusion that a sworn deputy sheriff is the type of employee to whom the\n   <em>\n    Elrod\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Branti\n   </em>\n   exception applies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Before concluding our\n   <em>\n    Elrod\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Branti\n   </em>\n   analysis, we address McCaffrey's argument that the complaint, at a minimum, states a plausible claim for relief. Specifically, McCaffrey alleges in the complaint that he was not a policymaker for the LCSO, was not a spokesman for the LCSO, and did not represent the sheriff or speak on his behalf. McCaffrey further alleges that he was far down the chain of command under Sheriff Chapman's para-military structure that governed the LCSO's 600 deputy sheriff force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Since we are reviewing an order granting a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, we accept these allegations as true. However, these allegations do not save the complaint. In determining whether the deputy sheriff's duties and responsibilities fall within the\n   <em>\n    Elrod\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Branti\n   </em>\n   exception,\n   <em>\n    Jenkins\n   </em>\n   instructs that\n   we look to whether McCaffrey was a deputy sheriff \"actually sworn to engage in law enforcement activities on behalf of the sheriff.\"\n   <em>\n    Jenkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"199864\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/119/1156/#p1164\">\n    119 F.3d at 1166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the allegations of the complaint leave no doubt that he was a deputy sheriff engaged in law enforcement activities and was not performing \"custodial\" duties like the deputies in\n   <em>\n    Bland\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   . Therefore, even accepting the allegations to which McCaffrey points as true, the\n   <em>\n    Elrod\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Branti\n   </em>\n   exception applies to McCaffrey and the allegations of the complaint do not assert a plausible claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   McCaffrey also argues that his allegations about Sheriff Chapman's post-termination downward adjustment of McCaffrey's evaluation scores and interference with McCaffrey's efforts to obtain other employment removes this case from our precedent. However, those allegations are not material to the\n   <em>\n    Elrod\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Branti\n   </em>\n   analysis. Such conduct might support a state law claim such as interference with prospective contractual relationship or other similar theories. But we must look to the nature of the deputy sheriff's duties, not the way in which he was terminated. Therefore, the post-termination allegations are of no import here. Even accepting these post-termination allegations as true, we find that the\n   <em>\n    Elrod\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Branti\n   </em>\n   exception applies and McCaffrey has failed to state a claim that his First Amendment rights were violated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Last, we turn to the\n   <em>\n    Pickering\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Connick\n   </em>\n   doctrine.

And because of the strict hierarchy in Sheriff Chapman's office, as well as the levels of approval and screening incorporated therein, McCaffrey merely performed routine investigative tasks and lacked any \"broad policy setting power.\" Although those responsibilities involved \"some discretion,\" discretion does not alone make a deputy a \"policymaker,\" for which political allegiance is an appropriate job requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bland v.

In 2015 - the year that McCaffrey was terminated because of politics - he received the \"Loudoun County Investigator of the Month Award\" three times, and also was part of a team designated as \"Team of the Month\" on three occasions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 12. And it was not just his coworkers at the sheriff's office who recognized McCaffrey's good work; the local commonwealth's attorney awarded McCaffrey the \"Victim Services Award\" in 2014.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3647943\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/566/381/#p386\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Those commendations show McCaffrey's effectiveness, which was also illustrated by his case closure rate that greatly exceeded the national average.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3647943\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/566/381/#p386\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But McCaffrey's stellar work does not establish that he possessed the broad discretion that would remove his First Amendment protections and render him subject to the\n   <em>\n    Elrod\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Branti\n   </em>\n   exception. A law enforcement officer can excel in his duties without becoming a\n   policymaker. Indeed, it would be odd to permit a law officer to be fired for political reasons because of his success. If anything, the commendations for good work received by McCaffrey show that he performed his duties as a deputy sheriff without exceeding his authority, responded appropriately to his supervisors, and adhered to their orders. On the other hand, McCaffrey's awards fail to show that \"there is a rational connection between shared [political] ideology and job performance.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531409\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/916/134/\">\n    916 F.2d at 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Finally, the statutory provisions governing Virginia law enforcement support the conclusion that the\n   <em>\n    Elrod\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Branti\n   </em>\n   exception does not apply here. As we have recognized, \"whether state law prohibits politically-based hiring for a particular position is relevant to whether political [allegiance] is necessary for effective job performance.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fields\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3647943\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/566/381/#p386\">\n    566 F.3d at 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).

Code Ann. \u00a7 15.2-1512.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D). Virginia law also provides that a deputy sheriff may not be prohibited from \"voting\"; \"expressing opinions, privately or publicly, on political subjects and candidates\"; \"displaying a political picture, sign, sticker, badge, or button\"; \"participating in the activities of ... a political candidate or campaign\"; or \"attending or participating in a political convention.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2015.2-1512.2\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 15.2-1512.2(B)-(C).

I have serious doubts as to whether that analysis was too general, and whether it should have focused more on deputies with the job responsibilities of the plaintiffs. Here, that would mean looking at boots-on-the-ground investigators of violent crimes like McCaffrey. I question whether such a deputy can ever make decisions that leave room for political disagreement, as we should always adhere to the principle that \"[p]olitics should not be an active ingredient of good law enforcement.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Mitchell v.
