While we hope this will be her last such encounter, her serial dilatory, vexatious, and unprofessional litigation practices lead us to affirm the district court's orders. In addition, Nora's frivolous motion practice\n   and legal arguments in these appeals lead us to lift the suspension of our previous monetary sanction against Nora.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Proceedings in multiple venues are relevant to these appeals, including each level of the Wisconsin state court system, two Chapter 13 petitions in federal bankruptcy court, and two bankruptcy appeals in the district court. Because the procedural history is pertinent to resolving Nora's appeals, we detail it below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Wisconsin Foreclosure Action\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Steven and Sondra Lisse refinanced their home in 2006, taking out a new mortgage and signing a corresponding note. The Lisses fell behind on their payments, and an entity controlled by HSBC Bank USA, N.A. filed a foreclosure action in Dane County Circuit Court in 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Four years later, HSBC moved for summary judgment. In response, the Lisses asked the court for additional discovery that they hoped would demonstrate HSBC could not enforce its note. The court denied the Lisses' request and awarded HSBC summary judgment on its foreclosure claim. The Wisconsin Court of Appeals affirmed that decision.\n   <em>\n    HSBC Bank USA v.

Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Petitions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Approximately six weeks after the Wisconsin Court of Appeals' affirmance, Steven Lisse (by attorney Nora) filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in the Western District of Wisconsin. As a result, the Wisconsin Supreme Court extended the Lisses' deadline to petition for review of the foreclosure judgment. Order,\n   <em>\n    HSBC Bank USA v. Lisse\n   </em>\n   , No. 2015AP273 (Wis. Apr. 7, 2016).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The practical effect was to postpone HSBC's foreclosure on the Lisses' home as long as bankruptcy proceedings remained pending in federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Nora submitted a Chapter 13 plan for Steven Lisse that proposed the Lisses would make their monthly mortgage payments to Nora's trust account while the bankruptcy court conducted an adversary proceeding to identify the entity entitled to the money. HSBC objected, noting it already litigated its claim to judgment in the Wisconsin courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After the bankruptcy court held a confirmation hearing, it rejected Nora's proposed plan and\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   dismissed the case without leave to amend. The bankruptcy court concluded, \"[T]his clearly is an opportunity or this plan shows all the earmarks of being an effort to continue a fight, which could be made and was made in the state foreclosure action, in the Bankruptcy Court.\" Transcript of Final Hearing on Chapter 13 Plan at 51-52,\n   <em>\n    In re Steven Robert Lisse\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:16-10935 (Bankr.

The bankruptcy judge found the plan improper, citing\n   <em>\n    In re Schaitz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6121325,10534430\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/913/452/\">\n    913 F.2d 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 1990), \"because the purpose\n   for filing the plan is not to pay the creditor but to thwart paying the creditor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 52. Nora filed an appeal to the district court on behalf of Steven Lisse, challenging HSBC's standing, arguing HSBC's note was a forgery, and accusing HSBC's counsel of fraud on the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Five days after the bankruptcy court dismissed Steven Lisse's petition, Nora filed a separate Chapter 13 petition on behalf of his wife, Sondra Lisse. This again extended the Lisses' deadline in the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Order,\n   <em>\n    HSBC Bank USA v. Lisse\n   </em>\n   , No. 2015AP273 (Wis. July 28, 2016). Nora's proposed Chapter 13 plan for Sondra Lisse was similar to the one the bankruptcy court had just rejected in Steven Lisse's case. HSBC moved to dismiss the petition for lack of good faith, arguing Nora filed it with the sole intent to delay the final disposition of the Wisconsin foreclosure action. HSBC also sought relief from the automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Nora responded by moving for sanctions, claiming HSBC's\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   and preclusion arguments were frivolous and accusing HSBC's counsel of \"completely desecrating the integrity of these proceedings.\" Motion for Noncompliance with Discovery at 10, No. 3:16-12556-cjf (Bankr. W.D. Wis. Dec. 7, 2016), ECF No. 59. The bankruptcy court rejected Nora's sanctions arguments entirely.\n   <em>\n    In re Sondra Kay Lisse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269838\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/813/#p819\">\n    567 B.R. 813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 819 (Bankr. W.D. Wis. 2017) (finding \"no basis\" to grant the motion). It also lifted the automatic stay, noting the Wisconsin foreclosure judgment precluded Nora's arguments that HSBC's note was forged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After these procedural rulings, Nora filed three appeals to the district court and moved to voluntarily dismiss Sondra Lisse's petition pending resolution of the appeals, which the district court granted. With both bankruptcy cases dismissed (although on appeal), the Lisses filed their petition for review with the Wisconsin Supreme Court-13 months after the Wisconsin Court of Appeals affirmed the foreclosure judgment. Petition for Review,\n   <em>\n    HSBC Bank USA v. Lisse\n   </em>\n   , No. 2015AP273 (Wis. Mar. 23, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Bankruptcy Appeals to the District Court\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Nora began Steven Lisse's bankruptcy appeal by filing a document accusing HSBC and its counsel (by name) of federal crimes, including bankruptcy fraud under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Next, she asked the district court to order HSBC to \"conventionally file\" its original note with the clerk of court, as evidence of \"criminal misconduct.\" Shortly thereafter, Nora moved to stay the deadline for Steven Lisse's merits brief, citing HSBC's purportedly \"ambiguous and contradictory\" record designations. Then, in a motion requesting summary reversal, Nora again accused HSBC and its counsel of perpetrating a fraud on the courts by presenting forged documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Following this initial burst of activity, Steven Lisse's appeal lay dormant for almost a year. Finally, on August 23, 2017, HSBC requested dismissal for failure to prosecute. This prompted the district court to set an October 2, 2017 deadline for Nora's opening brief on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Nora filed a motion to stay the appeal ten days later, citing the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a physician's recommendation\n   that Nora take a leave from practicing law. Despite expressing some skepticism as to Nora's motives-noting her \"history of frivolous and dilatory tactics\" and efforts to \"drag[ ] out the briefing on the merits by satellite skirmishes\"-the district court granted a three-month stay. Order,\n   <em>\n    Lisse v. HSBC Bank USA\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:16-00617-wmc (W.D. Wis. Sept. 21, 2017), ECF No. 42. It did, however, stress that \"[n]o further extensions will be granted to Attorney Nora absent new, extraordinary circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Nora later testified that she continued to practice law for other clients in other matters during the three-month stay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The day after the district court stayed Steven Lisse's bankruptcy appeal, the Wisconsin Supreme Court denied the Lisses' petition to review the foreclosure judgment.\n   <em>\n    HSBCBank USA v.

As a result, in December 2017, HSBC began moving forward with a foreclosure sale in Dane County Circuit Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   With respect to Sondra Lisse's appeal, on December 5, 2017, the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court's rulings.\n   <em>\n    Lisse v.

Wis. Dec. 5, 2017). It held that the preclusive effect of the Wisconsin foreclosure judgment defeated Nora's challenges to the note's authenticity and provided HSBC with standing to object to Sondra Lisse's proposed Chapter 13 plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. Also, the district court concluded the \"appeal, like the bankruptcy litigation, plainly lacks merit and was wastefully presented.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nora asked the district court to reconsider, but the district court declined.\n   <em>\n    Lisse v.

Sondra Lisse did not appeal the district court's rulings to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After the stay expired in Steven Lisse's appeal-and on the eve of Nora's deadline to file an opening brief-the Lisses returned to Dane County Circuit Court to file a flurry of motions seeking to postpone the foreclosure sale.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The day before her opening brief was due, Nora moved for another stay pending resolution of her clients' state-court motions. The district court denied Nora's eleventh-hour request, finding \"the debtor's sole purpose appears to be to delay an inevitable foreclosure through every legal artifice available both in state and federal court.\" Order,\n   <em>\n    Lisse v. HSBC Bank USA\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:16-cv-00617-wmc (W.D. Wis. Jan. 18, 2018), ECF No. 46. Characterizing Nora's litigation maneuvers as \"plainly seek[ing] to continue to postpone [the state-court foreclosure action]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   through collateral, tag-team attacks in federal court brought separately by husband and wife,\" the district court stated it would \"no longer be complicit in these transparent efforts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. It refused to stay Steven Lisse's bankruptcy appeal further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The following day, instead of filing an opening brief, Nora moved to voluntarily dismiss Steven Lisse's appeal-more than 16 months after she filed it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D. Sanctions in the District Court\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The district court dismissed Steven Lisse's appeal, but it did not stop there. Due to her \"pattern of sharp practice,\" the district court ordered Nora to show cause \"why she should not be sanctioned for her frivolous, or at best vexatious, appeal.\" Order,\n   <em>\n    Lisse v. HSBC Bank USA\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:16-cv-00617-wmc (W.D. Wis. Jan. 22, 2018), ECF No. 49. A week later, Nora asked the district court to vacate its show cause order, alleging that the order violated due process and that the district court had pre-judged the merits of imposing sanctions. The district court scheduled an evidentiary hearing before a three-judge panel consisting of Chief District Judge Peterson, District Judge Conley, and Chief Bankruptcy Judge Furay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Nora, now represented by her own counsel, filed an answer seeking to \"quash\" the show cause order, alleging a lack of notice of the \"charges\" against her, objecting to Judge Conley's participation at the hearing, and challenging the constitutional authority of Chief Bankruptcy Judge Furay to participate. The district court provided Nora with a 13-page \"supplemental notice\" identifying the bases for the order to show cause. Nora's lawyer followed up with a \"rejoinder,\" objecting to the lack of separate \"counts\" and arguing the court could not conduct its own attorney discipline proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The district court held a 90-minute hearing on the show cause order and issued its opinion on March 20, 2018. It grouped Nora's misconduct into three categories: \"(1) inappropriately pursuing relief in federal court; (2) dilatory litigation conduct, including numerous, last-minute requests for lengthy extensions; and (3) filing multiple cases or appeals then failing to consolidate or join them.\" Opinion and Order at 8,\n   <em>\n    Lisse v. HSBC Bank USA\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:16-cv-00617-wmc (W.D. Wis. Mar. 20, 2018), ECF No. 88. The court decided, \"Nora's advocacy has crossed the line of professional conduct too many times to be tolerated or ignored any longer.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. The district court fined Nora $2,500 and suspended her from appearing in new matters in the Western District for six months, although it stayed those sanctions if and until Nora submitted another improper filing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Meanwhile, HSBC had filed a motion for $3,675 in costs and attorneys' fees under both FED.

Classifying the appeal as \"frivolous,\" the district court held Steven Lisse and Nora \"jointly and severally liable for $1,837.50.\" Opinion and Order at 4, 8,\n   <em>\n    Lisse v. HSBC Bank USA\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:16-cv-00617-wmc (W.D. Wis. Mar. 22, 2018), ECF No. 89. This monetary sanction was in addition to the suspended fine discussed above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   About a week later, the Wisconsin Supreme Court issued a decision in disciplinary proceedings against Nora-for conduct not connected with this litigation-revoking her law license for at least one year.\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings against Nora\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12554901\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/909/155/\">\n    909 N.W.2d at 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On April 13, 2018, pursuant to W.D. Wis.

We pushed the deadline back to September 14, 2018, but when that date arrived, Nora again filed a noncompliant extension motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although we again extended Nora's deadline to September 19, 2018, she failed to meet it and filed her opening brief late.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Nora also repeatedly filed documents styled as \"Requests for Judicial Notice,\" asking this court to take judicial notice of various documents filed in other cases (affidavits, deposition transcripts, court orders). After two orders denying Nora's requests, on Nora's third attempt Judge Easterbrook (as motions judge) published an opinion explaining why the requests were procedurally improper.\n   <em>\n    In re Appeals of Nora\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518795\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/905/495/#p497\">\n    905 F.3d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 497 (7th Cir. 2018) (\"The right place to propose judicial notice, once a case is in a court of appeals, is in a brief.... There's no need to engage in motions practice, require the attention of additional appellate judges, and defer briefing.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   When HSBC submitted its response, Nora moved to strike portions of its brief and supplemental appendix. Nora argued HSBC's citation of documents from the Wisconsin foreclosure action and Sondra Lisse's bankruptcy case-some of which had been filed by Nora as exhibits in Steven Lisse's bankruptcy appeal-made it \"unreasonably difficult, if not impossible,\" for her to file a timely reply. Nora also asked this court to stay the appeal until we ruled on her motions to strike. The court denied Nora's motions as \"frivolous,\" sanctioning her by docking 2,000 words from the limit for her reply. Although our order stated-in no uncertain terms-that \"no motion for further time (or additional words) will be entertained,\" the next day Nora filed a motion for reconsideration asking the court \"to restore her full word count limitation ... and to allow [Nora] sufficient time to file her Reply Brief....\" Motion for Reconsideration of November 20, 2018 Procedural Order at 11. We denied that motion too.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   After the completion of merits briefing, HSBC moved for damages and costs under FED. R. APP. P. 38, arguing Nora's appeals are frivolous. We ordered Nora to respond to the motion, and she (not to be outdone) requested sanctions against HSBC. Finally, failing to heed this court's earlier directives, Nora filed yet another request for judicial notice, which this court denied again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Nora appeals two separate rulings by the district court, although her briefs meld them together. First, Nora challenges the district court's March 22, 2018 sanctions order holding her and Steven Lisse jointly and severally liable to HSBC for $1,837.50 under FED. R. BANKR. P. 8020 and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

She similarly contends the district court lacked jurisdiction to sanction her due to this alleged Article III defect. Nora is wrong on both counts.

As discussed above, the plan Nora filed on behalf of Steven Lisse (and then again for Sondra Lisse) improperly attempted to use an adversarial proceeding to relitigate the merits of a foreclosure judgment HSBC had already obtained in Wisconsin state court (with HSBC receiving no payments in the interim). Any reasonably careful attorney-let alone an attorney with Nora's familiarity with bankruptcy court-would have known that this type of conduct would not be tolerated.\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519101\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/908/1075/#p1082\">\n    908 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1082 ;\n   <em>\n    cf\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Carr v.

For example, in Steven Lisse's appeal in the district court, Nora filed three motions to stay the proceedings. This strategy produced a 16-month delay before the district court refused any further extensions, at which point Nora moved to voluntarily dismiss the appeal without filing an opening brief. Such litigation behavior-even if one assumes pure motives-constitutes objective bad faith warranting sanctions under \u00a7 1927.

First, on March 20, 2018, the district court fined Nora $2,500 and suspended her right to practice in the Western District for six months, although it stayed the penalties until Nora committed another violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Ten days later, however, the Wisconsin Supreme Court suspended Nora's law license for one year.\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings against Nora\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12554901\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/909/155/\">\n    909 N.W.2d at 167-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, on April 13, 2018, the district court issued another order suspending Nora's right to practice based on W.D. Wis. LR 83.5(E). That local rule automatically imposes reciprocal discipline when another jurisdiction does so, although it permits the attorney to apply \"for modification or vacation of the [district court's] discipline.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Although Nora appeals the district court's April 13, 2018 disciplinary order separately from its March 22, 2018 order awarding HSBC its damages and costs\n   under FED.
