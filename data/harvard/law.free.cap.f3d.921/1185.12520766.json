The Bureau issued two plans: the Steens Mountain Travel Management Plan (\"Travel Plan\") and the Steens Mountain Comprehensive Recreation Plan (\"Recreation Plan\"). Plaintiff Oregon Natural Desert Association (\"ONDA\") challenged the Recreation Plan, and the Interior Board of Land Appeals' (\"Board\") approval of the Travel Plan, under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (\"NEPA\"), the Federal Land Policy Management Act of 1976 (\"FLPMA\"), and the Steens Mountain Cooperative Management and Protection Act of 2000 (\"Steens Act\"). Harney County intervened to defend the Board's approval of the Travel Plan, but also cross-claimed against the Bureau to challenge the Recreation Plan as arbitrary and capricious. The district court upheld both agency actions. Reviewing de novo,\n   <em>\n    San Luis &amp; Delta-Mendota Water Auth. v.

The County responded to the revised EA months before the Bureau issued the final Recreation Plan decision and Finding of No Significant Impact (\"FONSI\") in April 2015. The County cannot explain how the Bureau's purported failure to consult the Advisory Council more extensively \"caused the agency not to be fully aware of the environmental consequences of the proposed action, thereby precluding informed decisionmaking and public participation, or otherwise materially affected the substance of the agency's decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Idaho Wool Growers Ass'n v.

The Steens Act prohibits the use of motorized vehicles \"off road,\" but also authorizes the use of motorized vehicles on \"roads and trails,\" without defining those terms. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 460nnn-22(b)(1). The Board reconciled this seeming contradiction \"by concluding that since the statute clearly meant to allow [the Bureau] to designate roads and trails as open to motorized travel, the prohibition against motorized off-road travel logically can only mean that motorized travel that\n   <em>\n    does not occur on either a road or a trail\n   </em>\n   is prohibited.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the Steens Act does not use the term \"route,\" the Board used that more generic term throughout its decisions to encompass \"roads and trails.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In its 2009 decision on the Travel Plan, the Board decided that there exists \"inherent incongruity in determining that routes are 'obscure,' or difficult or impossible to identify on the ground, and concluding that opening them to motorized use is consistent with the Steens Act.\" In other words, the Board determined that a route that is \"difficult or impossible to identify on the ground\" is neither a road nor a trail under the Steens Act. The Board thus reversed the Bureau's decision to allow motorized travel on 36 miles of Obscure Routes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   But in its 2014 remand decision on the Travel Plan, the Board reversed course and sua sponte overturned its own decision to close the Obscure Routes.

Indeed, the Bureau acknowledged that it included some routes in the inventory even though its staff could not find those routes on the ground. Despite that lack of information, the Travel Plan EA authorized most routes for \"Level 2\" maintenance, which involves mechanically grading a route and \"brushing\" (removing) roadside vegetation. Such \"routine\" maintenance can dramatically change a lightly used route and its surroundings. Thus, without understanding the actual condition of the routes on the ground, the Bureau could not properly assess the environmental impact of allowing motorized travel on more than 500 miles of routes, or of carrying out mechanical maintenance on those routes.

Whatever the forms' contents, the Bureau created them years\n    <em>\n     after\n    </em>\n    it released the Travel Plan EA and FONSI in 2007. Thus, the public never saw the forms and never had an opportunity to comment on them, \"frustrating NEPA's goal of allowing the public the opportunity to play a role in the decisionmaking process.\"\n    <em>\n     Great Basin\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177591\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/844/1095/#p1101\">\n     844 F.3d at 1104\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    That said, we disagree with the Bureau and the County that an EIS is unnecessary because the Travel Plan simply maintained the \"status quo.\" Not so. The Travel Plan added about 70 miles of motorized routes to the transportation network in the Steens Mountain Area and closed 1.23 miles of routes to motorized access. By contrast, \"status quo\" cases involve the \"mere continued operation of a facility.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Burbank Anti-Noise Grp. v.
