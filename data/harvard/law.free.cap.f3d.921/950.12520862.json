He sued under Title VII, claiming racial discrimination and a hostile work environment. Sovereign Staffing moved for summary judgment based on timeliness and a failure to prove discrimination or a hostile work environment. The district court agreed with both grounds and awarded summary judgment to Sovereign Staffing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   We affirm. Though Sovereign Staffing urged summary judgment in district court based on timeliness, Mr. Spratling failed to respond to this part of the motion. This failure constituted a forfeiture.\n   <em>\n    See Richison v. Ernest Grp., Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4094416\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/634/1123/#p1128\">\n    634 F.3d 1123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1128 (10th Cir. 2011) (Gorsuch, J.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Without an argument from Spratling, the district court addressed timeliness and ruled in part that the suit had been untimely.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020003-16\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 20003-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (providing 90 days for a claimant to sue under Title VII after getting a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC). Though Mr. Spratling challenges parts of the ruling, he failed to address timeliness in his initial appeal brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   He did address timeliness in his appellate reply brief. But even there, Mr. Spratling did not urge plain error, so we decline to consider his new argument on timeliness.\n   <em>\n    See Richison,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4094416\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/634/1123/#p1128\">\n    634 F.3d at 1131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the failure to argue for plain error and its application on appeal [] marks the end of the road for an argument for reversal not first presented to the district court\");\n   <em>\n    see also Bronson v.
