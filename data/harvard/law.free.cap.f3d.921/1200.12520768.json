This means KGPF participants will never lose the principal they invest or the interest they earn, which is credited daily to their accounts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413601\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/238/#p241\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The KGPF was one of 29 investment options the Farmer's Rice Cooperative Plan's fiduciaries chose to offer participants like Mr. Teets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Great-West's management of the KGPF and the Credited Interest Rate\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Great-West deposits the money that participants have invested in the KGPF into its general account. That account, in turn, is invested in fixed-income instruments such as treasury bonds, corporate bonds, and mortgage-backed securities. Great-West employs a self-described \"conservative investment strategy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 157, 173. Its investments earn lower interest rates than some higher-risk instruments or funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Money invested in the KGPF earns interest at the \"Credited Interest Rate\" (the \"Credited Rate\"). Under the contracts it executes with employer plans, Great-West sets the Credited Rate quarterly, announcing the new rate at least two business days before the start of each quarter. Its contract with Mr. Teets's Plan provides, \"Interest earned on the Key Guaranteed Portfolio Fund value is compounded daily to the effective annual interest rate. The interest rate to be credited to the Group Contractholder [the Plan] will be determined by [Great-West] prior to the last day of the previous calendar quarter.\" Aplt. App., Vol. I at 129. \"The effective annual interest rate will never be less than 0%.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Great-West retains as revenue the difference between the total yield on the\n   KGPF's monetary instruments and the Credited Rate, also known as the \"margin\" or the \"spread.\" Some portion of the margin goes toward Great-West's operating costs. Great-West publicly discloses an administrative fee of .89 percent, but claims that figure does not capture all the costs associated with maintaining the KGPF. Great-West retains as profit whatever portion of the margin exceeds its costs. The parties dispute the total KGPF-associated profit Great-West has earned, but all agree that as of 2016 it was greater than $120 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Credited Rate dropped from 3.55 percent before the financial crisis in 2008 to 1.10 percent in 2016. During that time, the Credited Rate increased only once, in 2013. At the same time, Great-West's margin remained relatively constant, between approximately two and three percent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Exiting the KGPF\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plans may terminate their relationship with Great-West based on changes to the Credited Rate. If they do, Great-West \"reserves the right to defer payment\" of participants' KGPF money back to the plan-presumably to reinvest with another provider-\"not longer than 12 months.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . There is no evidence Great-West has ever exercised the option to impose that waiting period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Participants who have placed their money in the KGPF may withdraw their principal and accrued interest at any time without paying a fee. Great-West does, however, prohibit plans offering the KGPF from also offering any other stable value funds, money market funds, or certain bond funds-in other words, products with comparable risk profiles.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   C.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Mr. Teets sued Great-West in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado on behalf of all employee benefit plan participants who had invested in the KGPF since 2008, as well as those participants' beneficiaries.

His first two claims alleged Great-West had violated ERISA's fiduciary duty provisions. First, Mr. Teets claimed that\n   Great-West had breached its general duty of loyalty under \u00a7 404 by (1) setting the Credited Rate for its own benefit rather than for the plans' and participants' benefit, (2) setting the Credited Rate artificially low and retaining the difference as profit, and (3) charging excessive fees. Second, he claimed that Great-West, again acting in its fiduciary capacity, had engaged in a prohibited transaction under \u00a7 406(b) by \"deal[ing] with the assets of the plan in [its] own interest or for [its] own account.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201106\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As a prerequisite to bring both of these claims, Mr. Teets alleged that Great-West is an ERISA fiduciary because it exercises authority or control over the quarterly Credited Rate and, by extension, controls its compensation. The district court limited its review of these two fiduciary duty claims by addressing only this prerequisite-that is, whether Mr. Teets had sufficiently established Great-West's fiduciary status. Because the court found that Great-West was not a fiduciary, it did not address whether Great-West had breached any fiduciary obligations. Great-West's fiduciary status is thus the focus of our review of Mr. Teets's fiduciary duty claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Mr. Teets's third claim, raised in the alternative, was based on Great-West's having non-fiduciary status. He alleged that Great-West was a non-fiduciary party in interest to a non-exempt prohibited transaction under \u00a7 406(a) insofar as it had used plan assets for its own benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   On all three claims, Mr. Teets sought declaratory and injunctive relief and \"other appropriate equitable relief,\" including restitution and an accounting for profits. Aplt. App., Vol. I at 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   2.\n   <strong>\n    Summary Judgment Ruling\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   After discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The district court denied Mr. Teets's motion and granted summary judgment for Great-West. It disposed of Mr. Teets's first two claims at the same time, concluding that Great-West was not acting as a fiduciary of the Plan or its participants. It held that Great-West's contractual power to choose the Credited Rate did not render it a fiduciary under ERISA because participants could \"veto\" the chosen rate by withdrawing their money from the KGPF.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201106\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201106\">\n    at 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As to Great-West's ability to set its own compensation, the court held that Great-West did not have control over its compensation and thus was not a fiduciary because the ultimate amount it earned depended on participants' electing to keep their money in the KGPF each quarter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The district court also granted summary judgment on Mr. Teets's third claim, concluding that Great-West was not liable as a non-fiduciary party in interest because Mr. Teets had failed to establish a genuine dispute as to whether Great-West had \"actual or constructive knowledge of the circumstances that rendered the transaction unlawful.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201106\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201106\">\n    at 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Salomon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413601\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/238/#p241\">\n    530 U.S. at 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413601\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/238/#p241\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

The court discussed this issue separately as it concerned plans and participants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   First, as to Great-West's ability to bind plans to its Credited Rate decisions, the district court rejected Mr. Teets's argument that plans cannot readily withdraw from the KGPF because Great-West has a right to impose a waiting period of up to one year. The court stated, \"This is not an argument that the Court can consider in the present posture. The Contract does not\n   <em>\n    mandate\n   </em>\n   a one-year waiting period, so\n   whether it would actually be imposed in any particular instance is speculative.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 99.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Second, as to individual participants' ability to reject the Credited Rate, the district court concluded that participants do have a \"real ability\" to reject Great-West's choice of the Credited Rate by withdrawing their funds from the KGPF without fee or penalty.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although it had \"given serious thought to\" the argument that participants cannot easily withdraw from the KGPF because Great-West prohibits plans from offering other comparable investment products, the court concluded that imposing a fiduciary duty on that basis would \"introduce[ ] a host of other considerations individual to each participant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a result, it would be \"too attenuated\" to say that a given participant could not reject the Credited Rate each quarter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Control over compensation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The district court also concluded Great-West is not a fiduciary as to setting its compensation. Although it acknowledged that a service provider's control over compensation factors can give rise to fiduciary obligations, the court said this principle \"has only been applied in cases where the alleged fiduciary has some form of direct contractual authority to establish its fees and other administrative charges, or has authority to approve or disapprove the transactions from which it collects a fee.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 100.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The court also reasoned that Great-West does not have control over its compensation because, even though it could use the Credited Rate to \"influence its possible margins,\" the ultimate amount it earns depends on whether participants elect to keep their money in the KGPF each quarter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 101.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   3.\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Mr. Teets argues that Great-West's ability to set the Credited Rate renders it an ERISA fiduciary because neither the Plan nor its participants can reject changes to the Credited Rate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   He focuses on Great-West's (1) contractual right to impose a 12-month waiting period on withdrawing plans and (2) prohibition on plans' offering comparable investment options to participants. We conclude that Mr. Teets has not adduced sufficient evidence to create an issue of material fact as to whether either of the foregoing has prevented plans or participants from rejecting a change in the Credited Rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Mr. Teets separately argues that Great-West's control over the Credited Rate gives it control over its compensation and thereby renders it an ERISA fiduciary. We conclude that because Great-West does not have unilateral authority or control over the Credited Rate, it also lacks such control over its compensation. We therefore affirm the district court's summary judgment ruling that Great-West is not a functional fiduciary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Change to the Credited Rate\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The contract between the Plan and Great-West does not set a Credited Rate\n   or prescribe a Credited Rate formula. Instead, it authorizes Great-West to set the Credited Rate on a quarterly basis without input from the Plan or its participants. Accordingly, the Credited Rate is not the product of an arm's-length negotiation, and Great-West's fiduciary status therefore depends on whether the Plan or its participants can reject a change in the Credited Rate.

But in this case, a plan's attempt to terminate its KGPF contract in response to a change in the Credited Rate does not trigger the waiting period. Great-West must exercise its option to impose it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   We are not aware of any case finding fiduciary status under \u00a7 3(21)(A) of ERISA based on a service provider's unexercised contractual option to restrict or penalize withdrawal. But even if a potential restriction or penalty could make Great-West a fiduciary, it cannot do so in\n   this case. This is so because Mr. Teets not only has provided no evidence that Great-West has ever imposed the waiting period on a plan's withdrawal, he has provided no evidence that even the potential of Great-West's imposing a waiting period has affected any plan's choice to continue with or withdraw from the KGPF contract. More than 3,000 plans have terminated the KGPF as a plan offering during the class period. Mr. Teets has not provided a single example showing the potential waiting period has deterred any of the 13,000 plans represented by participants in the class from withdrawing from the KGPF. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    CBOE\n   </em>\n   , there is no evidence a plan has actually been or is likely to be locked in to a Credited Rate for up to 12 months.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1874638\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/713/254/#p260\">\n    713 F.2d at 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

When Great-West moved for summary judgment contesting fiduciary status, it argued that \"[t]he evidence shows that\" when it changes the Credited Rate, \"participants, not Great-West, have the 'final say' on whether any Credited Interest Rate will apply to their investments in the [KGPF].\" Aplt. App., Vol. II at 176. Great-West contended that this was so because participants who have invested in the KGPF \"can reject any new Credited Interest Rate by transferring their accounts out of the [KGPF] at any point, without penalty.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1874638\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/713/254/#p260\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 151, 282-83.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response,\n   Mr. Teets made two arguments, both unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   First, he disagreed that Great-West's fiduciary status may turn on whether participants can freely withdraw from the KGPF.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   He repeats this contention on appeal: \"participants' ability to 'accept' or 'reject' Great-West's Credited Rate decision is legally irrelevant.\" Aplt. Reply Br. at 9. It is not clear to us why Mr. Teets would take this position, but if this were his only argument and we have understood it properly, he would have effectively conceded that participants' ability to leave the KGPF, impeded or unimpeded, has no effect on whether Great-West is a fiduciary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Second, Mr. Teets argued, alternatively, in his opposition to summary judgment, that Great-West is a fiduciary because \"Great-West precludes plans from offering alternative low-risk investments alongside the KGPF\" and therefore participants are not free to leave. Aplt. App., Vol. II at 301. He noted that when his Plan contracted with Great-West, it agreed that no stable value fund-effectively, no fund with a similar risk profile-would be offered that is comparable to the KGPF.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 292-93, 301. As a result, \"participants who divest from the KGPF in response to a change in Credited Rate are forced to alter the risk profile of their retirement accounts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 301. It follows, he asserted, that Great-West is a fiduciary as to setting the Credited Rate.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Mr. Teets's opposition to summary judgment on this alternative ground lacked supporting law or facts. He has not cited, and we have not found, a case in which a court has deemed a service provider to be a fiduciary based on participants' lack of alternative investment options, or on anything other than imposing a penalty or fee for withdrawal. Moreover, Mr. Teets has not cited, and we have not found, a case finding fiduciary status based solely on restrictions on participants' ability to leave a fund.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Even if the ability of participants to reject service provider actions is relevant to the fiduciary status, Mr. Teets failed to provide factual support to counter Great-West's assertion in district court that participants can freely transfer their money out of the KGPF.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 176. He pointed only to Great-West's policy against competing funds. He adduced no evidence that this policy forced participants to accept a Credited Rate or that they felt effectively locked in to the KGPF.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CBOE\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1874638\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/713/254/#p260\">\n    713 F.2d at 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Like the 12-month waiting period's potential effect on plans, the restriction on\n   competing investment options may impede participants from exiting the KGPF. But as with the waiting period, Mr. Teets offered no evidence that the competing fund provision has affected any of the 270,000 participants' decisions to stay with or leave the KGPF. Mr. Teets has not even alleged that the competing fund provision has affected his own choice about participation in the KGPF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   In sum, in response to Great-West's contention that it should receive summary judgment because the plan participants are free to leave the KGPF after a change in the Credited Rate, Mr. Teets said (1) the participants' freedom to leave the KGPF is not relevant to fiduciary status and (2) if it were, Great-West is a fiduciary because the limit on competing funds restricted participants' ability to leave. The first point seems to concede the issue to Great-West. On the second, Mr. Teets failed to provide legal support or \" 'set forth specific facts' from which a rational trier of fact could find\" in his favor.\n   <em>\n    Libertarian Party of N.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047193\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/506/1303/#p1309\">\n    506 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1309 (citing\n   <em>\n    Celotex\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p322\">\n    477 U.S. at 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p322\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Summary judgment on the issue of Great-West's authority or control over the Credited Rate was proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Control over compensation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Mr. Teets's failure to show Great-West has authority or control over the Credited Rate means he cannot show Great-West has authority or control over its compensation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Great-West argues, and Mr. Teets does not contest, that its compensation is a function not only of the Credited Rate, but also of \"(1) the willingness of plans and participants to accept the Credited Interest Rates that Great-West offers; and (2) the performance of the volatile financial markets in which Great-West invests its general account.\" Aplee. Br. at 31. Of these variables, Mr. Teets contends Great-West has control over the Credited Rate. He acknowledges any control Great-West has over its compensation \"will always be cabined by external realities and limitations like the market's actual performance. ... And plans and participants entering and leaving the [KGPF] will have some impact on the total amount of Great-West's compensation.\" Aplt. Br. at 26 n.7.

As we have already discussed, Mr. Teets has not shown that Great-West has discretion over the Credited Rate.

As stated above, the fact that equity courts at common law could award a particular remedy does not mean the remedy is necessarily equitable for purposes of ERISA. Rather, \"legal remedies-even legal remedies that a court of equity could sometimes award-are not 'equitable relief' under \u00a7 502(a)(3).\"\n   <em>\n    Montanile\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601264,12601263\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/651/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Mr. Teets relies on authorities that discuss what remedies an equity court could award for a breach of trust, not whether those remedies are legal or equitable in nature.

This assertion, however, skips a critical step to establish appropriate equitable relief under \u00a7 502(a)(3)-namely, identifying the property that Great-West has commingled with its other assets. He has not specified the assets he alleges were commingled with Great-West's general account to generate the profits he seeks to disgorge, which is fatal to his claim under \u00a7 502(a)(3).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Unisys Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4054332\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/579/220/#p238\">\n    579 F.3d at 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that because \"plaintiffs [were] unable to identify 'money or property ... belonging in good conscience' to them and clearly 'trace[able] to particular funds or property in the defendant's possession,' they [could not] recover profits from [defendants] as a form of equitable relief.\" (second and third alterations in original) (citation omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Knudson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108127\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/204/#p206\">\n    534 U.S. at 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108127\" index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/204/#p206\">\n    122 S.Ct. 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   )).

Because Mr. Teets has not provided evidence that contractual restrictions on withdrawal from the KGPF actually constrained plans or participants, Great-West does not act as an ERISA fiduciary when it sets the KGPF's Credited Rate each quarter. As a result, it also lacks sufficient authority or control over its compensation to render it a fiduciary. As to liability as a party in interest, Great-West was entitled to summary judgment because Mr. Teets failed in the district court to carry his burden of showing that the relief he sought was equitable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-204\">\n    We refer to the relevant portions of ERISA by the section number of the Act.

In its motion for summary judgment, Great-West did not argue that Mr. Teets lacked evidence that he or other participants had felt restricted or that they would have invested in alternative low-risk funds but for Great-West's non-compete policy. Great-West instead urged\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-192\">\n   \u2022 the absence of a contractual provision that prohibited the offering of competitive funds (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Appellant's App'x, vol. II, at 353) and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-193\">\n   \u2022 a marketplace theory of nonliability (that plan sponsors-not Great-West-are responsible for choosing the funds to offer) (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 155).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   Thus, I would not fault Mr. Teets for failing to present evidence on how the non-compete policy had affected participants' behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Great-West does not incur a fiduciary duty based on the plan sponsor's decision to offer the KGPF even if the plan sponsor's decision would have prevented the offering of competitive funds.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   I would instead affirm the grant of summary judgment based on Great-West's marketplace theory of nonliability. In advancing this theory, Great-West argued that although it could decide on the terms that it would be \"willing to offer an investment product, it [could not] compel the plan to accept the investment option on those terms over alternatives available in the marketplace.\" Appellant's App'x, vol. II, at 160. As a result, Great-West contended that it could not incur a fiduciary duty for a plan sponsor's decision to offer the KGPF rather than competing funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   I agree with Great-West. As alleged by Mr. Teets, the policy serves only to prevent plan sponsors from offering the KGPF if competing funds are also offered;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the alleged policy does not affect the availability of Great-West's general investment platform if the plan sponsor had chosen to offer competing funds in lieu of the KGPF. So if plan sponsors decide that the KGPF is uncompetitive because of its credited interest rate or the non-compete policy, plan sponsors can freely replace the KGPF with other comparable investment options.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Mr. Teets responds that Great-West acts as a fiduciary because he cannot personally choose between the KGPF and other competing low-risk funds. But this response blames Great-West for the decision-making of Mr. Teets's plan sponsor. Plan sponsors need not offer participants (1) multiple funds in the same asset class or (2) any stable-value fund.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Mr. Teets's theory assumes that plan sponsors would choose to offer competing funds in the absence of the alleged policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Even if this theory were otherwise valid, Mr. Teets has not alleged that his plan\n   sponsor would make this choice. Great-West urged summary judgment by asserting that plan sponsors are solely responsible for choosing appropriate portfolios and that Mr. Teets's plan sponsor had selected the funds based on \"independent recommendation and/or evaluation.\" Appellant's App'x, vol. II, at 155. In response, Mr. Teets contended that his plan sponsor couldn't offer competing funds alongside the KGPF, but this contention does not address whether his plan sponsor wanted to offer competitors' funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   Mr. Teets assumes that plan sponsors would act as he wishes; but plan sponsors are not parties, and Mr. Teets points to no evidence that Great-West influences plan sponsors' selection of investments. Mr. Teets has thus failed to set forth specific facts contesting Great-West's argument for summary judgment based on a marketplace theory of nonliability.\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"283\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p322\">\n    477 U.S. at 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"284\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p322\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   Mr. Teets instead complains that his plan sponsor offered the KGPF by itself rather than include other competitive funds. But Great-West cannot become a fiduciary based on the plan sponsor's selection of investment options. I would thus reject Mr. Teets's effort to pin fiduciary status on Great-West's conditioning of its offer to the plan sponsor.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-245\">\n    The majority also notes that Mr. Teets can point to no case \"in which a court has deemed a service provider to be a fiduciary based on participants' lack of alternative investment options, or on anything other than imposing a penalty or fee for withdrawal.\" Maj. Op. at 1219. I too have found no such case. But I also have not found any cases rejecting participant choice as a theory of liability. So this appears to be a question of first impression. The absence of case law on this theory suggests only that it is novel, not that it should be rejected.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-246\">\n    Although the record does not reveal the origin of the non-compete policy, Mr. Teets has not alleged that Great-West imposes the policy without the plan sponsors' knowledge and consent.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-247\">\n    In a regulation interpreting ERISA, the Department of Labor defines plan sponsors' responsibility to offer at least three investment options with \"materially different risk and return characteristics\" that \"enable the participant or beneficiary by choosing among them to achieve a portfolio with aggregate risk and return characteristics at any point within the range normally appropriate for the participant or beneficiary.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"285\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202550\">\n     29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2550\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .404c-1(b)(3)(i)(B).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
