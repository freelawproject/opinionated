Steve Lusardi wanted to swim with his wife, who had disabilities after a series of strokes and needed pool therapy to recover. But they lived at A Country Place, and its Condominium Association had adopted rules segregating use of the communal pool by sex. By 2016 over two-thirds of all swimming hours throughout the week were sex-segregated. After they were fined for violating this policy, Curto and the Lusardis sued, alleging violations of the federal Fair Housing Act (sometimes referred to as the \"FHA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203601\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   ., and New Jersey state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The District Court granted summary judgment to the Condominium Association because, in its words, \"the gender-segregated schedule applies to men and women equally.\"\n   <em>\n    Curto v.

We disagree. On the facts before us, the pool schedule discriminates against women in violation of the FHA. We need not determine whether sex-segregated swimming hours necessarily violate the FHA, or whether a sufficiently limited and more even-handed schedule might be justifiable, because the schedule actually adopted by the Condominium Association is plainly unequal in its allotment of favorable swimming times. Thus we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   A Country Place Condominium Association, Inc. is a \"55 and over\" age-restricted condominium association located in Lakewood, New Jersey. Lakewood has a large and growing Orthodox Jewish population, and so does A Country Place; by 2016, when the events in this litigation took place, approximately two-thirds of its residents were Orthodox.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   One of the amenities at A Country Place is its community pool, which reopened in 2011 after being closed for renovations. It is maintained using funds from the $215 monthly maintenance fee paid by each of the community residents. After the pool reopened, the Condominium Association adopted rules for pool use creating certain hours when only members of a single sex were allowed to swim. This was done to accommodate the Orthodox principle of\n   <em>\n    tznius\n   </em>\n   , or modesty, according to which it is improper for men and women to see each other in a state of undress-including bathing attire. This principle-according to Fagye Engleman, the Association's representative in this litigation-means that the Orthodox residents cannot comfortably\n   swim at a time when members of the opposite sex might be present at the pool.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Prior to 2016 the schedules provided for only a handful of sex-segregated swimming hours throughout the week, but as the Orthodox membership at A Country Place increased, the Association increased the number of sex-segregated hours. Thus in 2016 the Association's Board of Directors adopted a new schedule with greatly increased segregated swimming hours:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Under this schedule, a total of 31.75 hours each week were defined as \"men's swim,\" when women were prohibited from using the pool; 34.25 hours were defined as \"women's swim,\" when men were prohibited. Only 25 hours were open to people of all genders. Excluding Saturday, which was left open for mixed-gender swimming because Orthodox residents would not go swimming on the Jewish Sabbath, only 12 hours during the other six days of the week were available for integrated swimming. Of note, a large majority of the hours in the evening were set aside for men, including the period from 6:45 p.m. onward every day of the week (except Saturday) and the entire period from 4:00 p.m. onward on Friday. As for Friday afternoons, Engleman testified this was done because women are at home preparing for the Sabbath during that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the controversy with the plaintiffs began, the Association adopted a modified schedule:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The only significant change was expanding the \"adult residents only\" period of \"ladies' swim.\" Only the 6:00 to 6:45 p.m. period on Sunday, which went from \"ladies' swim\" to \"men's swim,\" was allocated to a different gender than under the initial 2016 schedule. Thus this revised schedule provided for 56 hours of segregated hours (32.5 hours for men and 33.5 hours for women), along with the same 12 hours of integrated swimming Sunday through Friday.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff Marie Curto owns a unit at A Country Place,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and stated in the complaint that one of the reasons she chose to live there was to go swimming with her family. Plaintiffs Steve and Diana Lusardi are a married couple who also own a unit in the residential facility. They stated in the complaint that one reason they moved back to the residential facility (where they had lived previously) was to use the pool together. Diana Lusardi suffered two strokes in 2013, which resulted in physical disabilities, and she wished to engage in pool therapy with her husband.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 15, 2016, a resident at A Country Place notified the Board that Curto had been swimming during a men's swim period. The next day the Board held a meeting on the issue, at which Steve Lusardi read a statement explaining why he wanted to use the pool with his wife and challenging the pool schedule as discriminatory. In the following weeks, the plaintiffs continued to use the pool in violation of the posted schedule and were fined $50 each by the Board. The plaintiffs engaged in much back-and-forth with the Board about the validity of these fines, but to no avail. They ultimately filed a complaint alleging violations of the Fair Housing Act as well as several New Jersey state laws regarding both discrimination and the rules for condominium associations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After discovery, both parties moved for summary judgment. The District Court granted the Condominium Association's motion on the plaintiffs' Fair Housing Act claim and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims that remained. The Court's analysis of the FHA claim ran only two paragraphs and rested on its view that \"the gender-segregated schedule applies to men and women equally.\"\n   <em>\n    Curto v.

The Condominium Association argues that its pool schedule is not discriminatory because it was not motivated by malice toward either sex. But in\n   <em>\n    Wind Gap\n   </em>\n   we expressly held that a showing of malice is not required \"where a plaintiff demonstrates that the challenged action involves disparate treatment through explicit facial discrimination.... Rather, the focus is on the explicit terms of the discrimination.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Looking to the express terms of the pool policy, the Association emphasizes that it allows for roughly equal swimming time for both men and women in the aggregate. But this is not enough to save the pool schedule, which discriminates in its allotment of different times to men and women in addition to employing sex as its criterion. Under the most recent version of the schedule, women are able to swim for only 3.5 hours after 5:00 p.m. on weeknights, compared to 16.5 hours for men. The schedule also assigns to men the entire period from 4:00 p.m. onward on Friday afternoons. Women with regular-hour jobs thus have little access to the pool during the work week, and the schedule\n   appears to reflect particular assumptions about the roles of men and women.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Thus we determine that the Association has waived any possible RFRA defense to the plaintiffs' FHA claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Even had the Association asserted a RFRA defense, it would lack associational standing to assert the religious free exercise rights of its Orthodox Jewish members. To have associational standing, (1) individual members must have standing in their own right, (2) the interest asserted must be germane to the purpose of the organization, and (3) neither the claim nor the relief requested must require the participation of the individual members in the lawsuit.\n    <em>\n     Hunt v.

The first prong is easily met here, but the Condominium Association does not have a religious purpose. Moreover, religious beliefs are highly personal, and in a typical RFRA case the parties asserting a burden on their religion would provide personal testimony about their beliefs and the nature of the burden. Here we have only the Association's general assertions as to the beliefs of its Orthodox members.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    This is different from when a plaintiff relies on indirect evidence of discrimination. In those cases, a plaintiff must first make out a\n    <em>\n     prima facie\n    </em>\n    case of discrimination, which usually means showing circumstances supporting a plausible inference of discrimination.

We need not address that contention, and its potentially far-reaching implications, as this specific pool schedule is plainly discriminatory in its specifics. Thus we also need not consider the Association's argument that prohibiting single-sex swimming hours altogether would discriminate against the Orthodox Jewish residents and thereby itself violate the FHA. Moreover, as Judge Fuentes notes in his concurrence, the Association fails to substantiate its claim that eliminating segregated swimming hours would have a discriminatory effect on the Orthodox residents at A Country Place, as we do not know how many of the Orthodox community use the pool or how many would not use a mixed-sex pool because of religious objections.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Concurring Op. at 412-13.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurrence\">\n  <author id=\"p-27\">\n   FUENTES, Circuit Judge, concurring.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   For decades, our jurisprudence has denounced the very notion of \"separate, but equal\" policies. In\n   <em>\n    Brown v. Board of Education\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court recognized that \"the doctrine of 'separate but equal' has no place\" because separate facilities are \"inherently unequal.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court was even more explicit in\n   <em>\n    Loving v.

Our jurisprudence makes clear that facial discrimination does not become lawful merely because its burdens are felt by members of both sexes. We would have no problem concluding, for example, that a pool schedule that allocates two-thirds of its hours to swimming segregated by race and one-third of its hours to \"Integrated Swimming\" would be intolerable under the FHA. And the FHA's prohibition on discrimination does not distinguish between discrimination on the basis of sex and discrimination on the basis of race.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We have never considered whether there may be exceptions to the FHA's antidiscrimination provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our sister circuits that have considered the issue have determined that in certain circumstances, there may be legal justifications for facial discrimination under the FHA. The Sixth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits have concluded that facially discriminatory policies may be justified if a defendant can show that the policies benefit the protected class or respond to legitimate safety concerns.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Eighth Circuit uses a different standard, requiring defendants to demonstrate that the facially discriminatory policy \"was necessary to promote a governmental interest commensurate with the level of scrutiny afforded the class of people affected by the law under the equal protection clause.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   There are two reasons why we need not now determine whether to adopt one of the tests put forth by our sister circuits. First, as the majority opinion rightly concludes, in this case there is evidence of both facial discrimination and disparate treatment. The stark difference between men's swimming hours and women's swimming hours during weekday evenings is fatal to the pool schedule because it perpetuates stereotypes about the relative likelihood of men and women to be working during those hours. The Condominium Association attempted to justify the disparity by pointing to the deposition testimony of Ms. Engleman, who stated that on Friday afternoons, women are home preparing for the Shabbat holiday. The testimony is\n   equivocal as to whether preparation for Shabbat is a religious mandate or a cultural practice that could be rooted in gender stereotypes about the role of women in homemaking. If it is the latter, of course, it cannot justify the discriminatory treatment of women. \"[G]eneralizations about 'the way women are,' [and] estimates of what is appropriate for\n   <em>\n    most women\n   </em>\n   , no longer justify denying opportunity to women....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even if Ms. Engleman were explaining a religious requirement, her reasoning cannot justify the disparity between men's hours and women's hours on Mondays through Thursdays.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Second, regardless of the test we adopted, the Condominium Association's justifications would fail. Although the Association defends its discrimination on the basis of the religious concerns of its Orthodox Jewish members,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   it did not argue that its discriminatory schedule was justified under any recognized exception to the FHA's antidiscrimination provision.

The Association instead argued that if it did not discriminate on the basis of sex, it would be discriminating against its Orthodox Jewish population because they would be unable to use the swimming pool due to religious modesty laws. But there is no evidence in the record of the number of Orthodox Jewish residents who use the pool, and no evidence of the number of Orthodox Jewish pool users who would be unable to use a mixed-sex pool due to religious objections.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the very least, at the summary judgment stage, the Condominium Association was required to put forward more than speculation about the effects of integrating the swimming pool.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In sum, I join the majority decision to reverse the decision of the District Court not only because of the pool schedule's disparate treatment of women, but also because it is\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   facially discriminatory in violation of the FHA.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11301409\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/347/483/\">\n     347 U.S. 483\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 495,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11301409\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/347/483/\">\n     74 S.Ct. 686\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=98%20L.%20Ed.%20873\">\n     98 L.Ed. 873\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1954).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167184\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/388/1/#p8\">\n     388 U.S. 1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 8,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167184\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/388/1/#p8\">\n     87 S.Ct. 1817\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167184\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/388/1/#p8\">\n     18 L.Ed.2d 1010\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1967).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    <em>\n     N.L.R.B. v.
