Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Kast is a California resident who owns and operates various business entities and websites. One such business is Atherton Trust, a real estate wealth management company. In 2010, an opportunity arose for Atherton Trust to be appointed by the State of California to manage the estates of disabled persons. Kast thought a revamped website would enhance Atherton Trust's prospects; so, he hired a website developer, Only Websites, to redevelop the site. Among other things, Kast \"agree[d] to provide content and other material ... throughout the development process.\" Kast's approval would be required on all work, \"including the design, development and finalization of the website.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   To facilitate development, Kast completed a questionnaire outlining his goals for the revamped website. Kast identified Wells Fargo Private Bank (\"Wells Fargo\") as one of Atherton Trust's competitors and highlighted certain features of Wells Fargo's website he found appealing. Kast also stated in emails that he wanted to mimic Wells Fargo's website. Further, Kast noted that he \"need[ed] to choose photos from options\" provided by Only Websites.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Kast closely managed the development process. For instance, after reviewing an early draft of the developmental website, Kast stated that he \"like[d] what [Only Websites did] with the home page layout.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On the other hand, Kast wanted the logo \"to be warmer like\" Wells Fargo's and the photos \"to be more casual like\" Wells Fargo's. Likewise, Kast later requested that Only Websites move the placement of Atherton Trust's logo and company name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Eventually, three photos from Wells Fargo's website-which were taken by Jim Erickson and licensed to Wells Fargo through his company, Erickson Productions, Inc.-were incorporated into Atherton Trust's developmental website.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neither Atherton Trust, Kast, nor Only Websites licensed the photos. Erickson discovered the infringement via Picscout, a \"software that tracks imagery online\" by running nightly internet-wide searches. In July 2011, Erickson demanded that Atherton Trust \"cease and desist infringing its copyright\" and pay damages. Kast promptly directed Only Websites to remove the photos, which was done the next morning, but refused to pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    a. The trial and the jury's verdict against Kast\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Erickson filed suit in the Central District of California, alleging direct, vicarious, and contributory copyright infringement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Erickson contended that the infringement was willful, and therefore subject to enhanced damages under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20504\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The case was transferred to the Northern District of California, where it proceeded to trial by consent before a magistrate judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Two divergent narratives emerged at trial. Erickson portrayed Kast as an opportunistic, cost-cutting businessperson who rushed completion of Atherton Trust's developmental website in an effort to generate additional income through state-appointed estate management. Erickson's counsel elicited testimony from Kast at trial that he first became aware that the photos in question were on Atherton Trust's website in January 2011, and the photos remained there until Kast received the July 2011 demand letter. Erickson claimed that including the unlicensed photos not only allowed Kast to continue pursuing the business opportunity he so desired, but also avoided the required developmental licensing fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Kast painted a different picture. He agreed \"the Atherton Trust website included unauthorized copies of [Erickson's] photos that were copied from\" Wells Fargo's website. But, according to Kast, Only Websites copied the photos without his consent. Kast also pointed to a provision in his contract with Only Websites, which stated that \"Client [Kast] is responsible for obtaining copyright releases and licenses on all photographs it sends to Provider. Limit of 2 photographs provided by Provider for every page except the home page.\" Kast testified he understood this provision to mean that \"[a]nything that I sent to them had to be licensed,\" but that \"if they provided the photos, [they] had to provide licensed photos.\" Similarly, Kast asserted that had he known he needed to license photos for the developmental site, he\n   would have done just that; in fact, he later and on his own licensed two stock photos for the site's \"live\" version. Separately, Kast argued he lacked control over Only Websites: Only Websites published the website without his consent and ignored multiple requests to replace the infringing photos. Finally, Kast contended that he did not reap a financial benefit from the infringing photos because \"[h]e made no money off the website\" and \"avoid[ing] a license fee\" is not a direct financial benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At the charging conference, the parties wrangled over the wording of the willfulness jury instruction. Erickson sought an instruction that Kast acted willfully if he knew he infringed Erickson's copyrights, acted with reckless disregard for Erickson's copyrights, or \"should have known\" his actions infringed Erickson's copyrights. Kast objected to the \"should have known\" prong, arguing that it set the standard \"much lower than recklessness.\" The district court agreed with Erickson and included the \"should have known\" prong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The jury found by special verdict that Kast vicariously and contributorily (but not directly) infringed Erickson's copyright on each of the photos and did so willfully. Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20504\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2), the jury awarded Erickson $ 150,000 in damages per photograph, for total damages of $ 450,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    b. The instant appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Kast timely appealed the district court's judgment against him. Kast initially briefed his case without the assistance of counsel. We appointed pro bono counsel to assist Kast with two of the issues he raised in his opening brief: (1) whether the avoidance of licensing fees constitutes a direct financial benefit for purposes of imposing vicarious copyright liability; and (2) whether a \"should have known\" willfulness instruction is proper under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20504\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). The parties submitted supplemental briefing on these issues, the former an issue of first impression in this circuit. We now consider whether to affirm (1) the jury's vicarious liability verdict, (2) the jury's contributory liability verdict, and (3) the jury's willfulness finding. We also address (4) some additional evidentiary and procedural matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"We review the district court's denial of a motion for directed verdict de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    Allstate Ins.

Erickson claims Kast received three \"direct financial benefits\" from Only Websites' infringement: (1) the photographs drew customers to purchase his services; (2) he avoided paying licensing fees to Erickson; and (3) he was able to \"rush\" the launch of his website.

If the infringing material is \"just an added benefit,\" rather than a draw, it does not confer a direct financial benefit on the website owner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9064453\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/357/1072/#p1079\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9064453\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/357/1072/#p1079\">\n    at 1078-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Erickson claims the photographs enhanced the general attractiveness of Kast's website to customers, and thereby \"drew\" visitors to purchase his services. Erickson argues that, because the whole purpose of the website was to advertise Kast's wealth management company, Kast had a direct financial interest in everything on the website that enhanced its appeal to potential customers. However, a financial benefit is not \"direct\" unless there is a \"causal relationship between the infringing activity and [the] financial benefit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Ellison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9064453\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/357/1072/#p1079\">\n    357 F.3d at 1079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Erickson does not contend that anyone visited Kast's website in order to view his photographs or purchased his services because they saw the photographs. The parties agree that no one visited the website or purchased anything after doing so. If Kast had a direct financial interest in every piece of content on this website that arguably made the website marginally more attractive or presentable, then the requirement of a causal link would be erased. Erickson does not argue the photographs were anything more, at best, than an \"added benefit\" to visitors of Kast's website, so the infringement did not confer a direct financial benefit on Kast as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9064453\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/357/1072/#p1079\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    b.

No other circuit appears to have addressed it, either.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We hold that it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As an initial matter, Erickson's avoidance of fees claim cannot be premised on any unlicensed use by Kast of Erickson's copyrighted photographs. That would result in direct liability, a theory the jury rejected.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    A&amp;M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11077046\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/239/1004/#p1013\">\n    239 F.3d 1004\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1013 (9th Cir. 2001) (\"[Direct] infringers violate at least one exclusive right granted to copyright holders under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20106\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\"). Additionally, to the extent Erickson suggests Kast owed licensing fees as a result of his vicarious infringement, his argument is plainly circular.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Instead, Erickson's argument must be that Kast received a direct financial benefit when Only Websites avoided Erickson's licensing fee. Only Websites surely owed Erickson a licensing fee, and saved money by failing to pay it, but the direct infringer's avoidance of fees alone cannot satisfy the requirement of a direct financial benefit to the vicarious infringer. Otherwise, the requirement of a direct financial benefit would be rendered meaningless, since-at least where, as here, licenses are for sale-a direct infringer necessarily saves money by failing to obtain a license.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Worldwide Church of God v. Phila. Church of God, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11196040\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/227/1110/#p1114\">\n    227 F.3d 1110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1114 (9th Cir. 2000) (\"The existence of a license creates an affirmative defense to a claim of copyright infringement.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Nor did Kast receive any other direct financial benefit as a result of Only Websites' failure to pay. In some circumstances, a direct infringer's avoidance of fees may prove financially advantageous to a vicarious infringer. For instance, Kast would have benefitted if Only Websites turned its lower costs from fee avoidance into lower prices for its website design services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Aimster Copyright Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1530199\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/334/643/#p654\">\n    334 F.3d 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 654 (7th Cir. 2003). But\n   this benefit would not be \"direct,\" since it would reach Kast only incidentally, via Only Websites' intervening decision to cut prices.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1530199\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/334/643/#p654\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (noting in dicta that a dance hall operator benefitted only indirectly from an orchestra's avoidance of licensing fees). In any event, Erickson never claimed that Only Websites and Kast were able to offer services more cheaply or quickly\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   Only Websites infringed Erickson's copyright.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Erickson's alternative theory that Only Websites avoided the licensing fee in its capacity as Kast's agent, such that Kast himself is liable for its failure to pay, is also unpersuasive. Kast employed Only Websites to develop the website, but the latter's decision to infringe Erickson's copyright would have exceeded the scope of any agency relationship that may have existed between them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7 2.02 cmt. h (illegal or tortious acts exceed the scope of an agency relationship).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Thus, Only Websites' avoidance of licensing fees did not confer a direct financial benefit on Kast as a matter of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    c. The \"rush\" completion of the website\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Finally, Erickson contends Kast received a direct financial benefit because the photographs enabled Kast to \"rush\" the launch of his website. Indeed, Kast conceded that he \"rushed\" the site out before it was finished in order to seek appointment to manage certain estates. But Kast received no money, clients, business inquiries, or website visitors by rushing the website's completion before removing Erickson's photos. Erickson never explained how using the photos allowed Kast to launch the website more quickly, or how the rushed launch enabled him to realize any profits at all. Thus, the alleged rush conferred no financial benefit on Kast at all and fails as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ellison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9064453\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/357/1072/#p1079\">\n    357 F.3d at 1079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The parties stipulated that Only Websites designed the infringing website, which \"included unauthorized copies of [Erickson's] Photos\" copied from Wells Fargo's website.

The problem for Erickson is that \"constructive knowledge\" is distinct from, and less culpable than, any of the mental states that support a finding of willfulness. Erickson cites extensively from non-binding, out-of-circuit, and district court authorities indicating that constructive knowledge can support a willfulness finding, but all are incompatible with our repeated requirement of actual knowledge, willful blindness, or recklessness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   We have never held merely negligent conduct to be willful, and we decline to do so now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    b.

While the evidence may have established that Kast was negligent, it is much less clear that it established recklessness, willful blindness, or actual knowledge.

Several of Kast's other actions also suggest\n   that he was not reckless with respect to Erickson's rights: he obtained licenses for the photos that he supplied to Only Websites, and promptly removed the infringing photos when Erickson asked. If the jury had been properly instructed, it might well have refused to find Kast willful on this record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   We are unpersuaded by Erickson's contention that the jury's contributory infringement verdict indicates that the jury would have found willfulness even without the \"should have known\" instruction. Erickson claims that a contributory infringer has \"knowledge\" of the direct infringer's conduct if he \"know[s] or ha[s] reason to know\" of the direct infringement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Louis Vuitton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836722\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/936/#p943\">\n    658 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   943 (citing\n   <em>\n    Napster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11077046\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/239/1004/#p1013\">\n    239 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1020 ). Erickson contends that, if Kast had \"knowledge\" for purposes of contributory infringement, then he had \"knowledge\" for purposes of the willfulness inquiry. However, a \"knew or had reason to know\" instruction could be satisfied by a negligence finding via its second prong, so the contributory infringement finding does not necessarily mean the jury would have found that Kast was actually aware of, or willfully blind or reckless with respect to, Only Websites' infringement. In any case,\n   <em>\n    Louis Vuitton\n   </em>\n   is inapposite because it addressed a contributory infringer with actual, rather than constructive, knowledge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 944.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Accordingly, we remand the issue of willfulness to the district court.

None are persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Kast claims he was an improper defendant because \"Erickson should have sued Atherton, not Kast.\" Even if Atherton Trust is also liable for the infringement, Kast would be jointly and severally liable, so he is a proper defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Range Road Music, Inc. v.

None of these alleged errors call for reversal. For instance, Erickson's questions regarding Kast's finances explored the ownership of various businesses and trusts, not his personal wealth. Because such questions arguably related to both vicarious liability and willfulness,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perfect 10, Inc. v.
