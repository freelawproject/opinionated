SMITH, Circuit Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant-Appellee State of California (California) enacted three laws expressly designed to protect its residents from federal immigration enforcement: AB 450, which requires employers to alert employees before federal immigration inspections; AB 103, which imposes inspection requirements on facilities that house civil immigration detainees; and SB 54, which limits the cooperation between state and local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities. Plaintiff-Appellant United States of America (the United States) challenged\n   these enactments under the Supremacy Clause and moved to enjoin their enforcement. The district court concluded that the United States was unlikely to succeed on the merits of many of its claims, and so denied in large part the motion for a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The district court did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that AB 450's employee-notice provisions neither burden the federal government nor conflict with federal activities, and that any obstruction caused by SB 54 is consistent with California's prerogatives under the Tenth Amendment and the anticommandeering rule. We therefore affirm the district court's denial of a preliminary injunction as to these laws. We also affirm the denial of a preliminary injunction as to those provisions of AB 103 that duplicate inspection requirements otherwise mandated under California law. But we conclude that one subsection of AB 103-codified at California Government Code section 12532(b)(1)(C) -discriminates against and impermissibly burdens the federal government, and so is unlawful under the doctrine of intergovernmental immunity. Because the district court relied on incorrect law in analyzing this provision, we reverse its preliminary injunction order in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The United States does not accurately distinguish between the doctrines of intergovernmental immunity and obstacle preemption.

Moreover, we note that California retains an historic-and, since the federal government's contracts with immigration detainee facilities explicitly contemplate the application of state regulations, undisputed-authority to regulate the conditions of detainees housed within its borders. By contrast, other than relying on general pronouncements that a Supremacy Clause violation alone constitutes sufficient harm to warrant an injunction, the United States did not present compelling evidence that AB 103 inspections conducted by the California Attorney General harmed facilities' detention operations. Rather, the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   evidence of AB 103's burdensome effect is conclusory assertions made by a DHS official in a declaration and deposition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neither he nor the United States provided any indication, even an estimate, of the actual costs imposed by AB 103 or the number of ICE officers forced to assist in the extra inspection efforts, or any quantification whatsoever of the enactment's burden.

We also AFFIRM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   the denial as to those provisions of AB 103 that duplicate preexisting inspection requirements.
