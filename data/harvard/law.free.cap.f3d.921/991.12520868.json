We now affirm the denial of Johnson's motion to suppress because the officer was entitled to seize the ammunition to protect himself and others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We review the facts adduced at the evidentiary hearings because they are critical to our resolution of this case. Dwight Williams, a police officer for the City of Opa-Locka, Florida, sat alone in his patrol car when a call came over his radio shortly after 4:00 a.m. on June 14, 2015. The call reported a burglary in progress at a nearby multi-family duplex and described the burglar as a black male wearing a white shirt. Officer Williams and another officer responded to the call. Officer Williams knew from experience that responding to a burglary can be dangerous because burglars are often armed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The officers arrived at the duplex and started to search for the suspected burglar. Officer Williams saw Paul Johnson, a black male wearing a white shirt standing near a fence in a dark alley at the back of the duplex. The officers asked Johnson to come toward them where they could \"see him a little better.\" Johnson complied, and as he walked toward them, another officer arrived on the scene. The officers ordered Johnson to lie on the ground and handcuffed him. Officer Williams then began frisking Johnson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   While patting down Johnson's pocket, Officer Williams felt something nylon covering \"a small, round, hard object\" that he immediately recognized as ammunition. He reached into Johnson's pocket and removed the round of ammunition and an empty nylon holster. The round belonged to a .380 caliber gun. Officer Williams was concerned; as he later testified, \"the round that was in [Johnson's] pocket and the holster led [him] to believe that there [wa]s a weapon that [the] round goes to and something goes into that holster.\" Based on his experience that burglaries often involve more than one perpetrator, he was also concerned that there was \"another person in an apartment [who] m[ight] come out with something.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As Officer Williams searched the area for a gun, Johnson told the other officers that he had been trying to wake up his girlfriend, who lived at the duplex, by\n   knocking loudly on her door. Johnson suggested that someone might have thought he was trying to break in. The officers tried to confirm Johnson's story, but his girlfriend would not answer their knock at her door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Meanwhile, Officer Williams found a hole in the fence close to where Johnson had been standing. Knowing that suspects \"throw[ ]\" away weapons \"a lot in Opa-Locka\" when they encounter the police, Officer Williams drove around the fence to see if a gun had been tossed on the other side. Sure enough, he found two pistols, one .380 caliber and the other .40 caliber, less than a foot from where the officers had first seen Johnson. Officer Williams checked the serial numbers on the pistols and determined that both had been reported as stolen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Johnson's girlfriend eventually opened her door for the officers. She confirmed that Johnson lived at the duplex with her and that he was trying to enter their home. The officers then arrested Johnson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The officers took Johnson to the police station, where he waived his rights to remain silent and to counsel,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miranda v. Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    384 U.S. 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    16 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966). Johnson confessed that he was holding the pistols for his brother and cousin, even though he had previously been convicted of a felony. A grand jury later indicted Johnson for being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Johnson moved to suppress the ammunition, the holster, and the pistols, along with any statements resulting from the frisk. Johnson argued that Officer Williams violated the Fourth Amendment by frisking him and by seizing the ammunition and holster. A magistrate judge held two evidentiary hearings on the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The officers who detained Johnson testified that Opa-Locka is a \"high-crime area\" that receives a \"high volume of calls\" involving \"bodily harm done to others\" and the use of firearms \"in [multiple] aspects of the crimes from burglaries to robberies to home invasions.\" The officers testified that, in their experience, burglaries in Opa-Locka often involve more than one perpetrator. According to Officer Williams, a reported burglary presents a dangerous situation for the officers because, \"when [the officers] arrive to the scene, [they] never know where the potential [suspect] may be, ... never know what [a suspect] has, [and] never know if [they] have any lighting to see the potential [suspect].\" Officer Williams testified that the officers detained Johnson \"because of the nature of the call and the current conditions\" at the scene and to \"make sure that no one else was on the premise with him.\" After the hearings, the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation concluding that Officer Williams did not violate the Fourth Amendment by frisking Johnson and removing the ammunition and holster from his pocket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The district court adopted the magistrate judge's report and recommendation and denied Johnson's motion to suppress. The district court ruled that the frisk was constitutional at its inception because \"Officer Williams had reasonable suspicion to believe that his safety or the safety of others was in danger.\" And it ruled that the removal of the ammunition and holster \"was a justified continuation of the initial frisk.\" The district court reasoned that \"[a]n officer's seizure of ammunition following a lawful frisk when investigating a possible violent crime, particularly when confronted with an unsecure scene, is sufficiently connected to officer safety not to run afoul of the Fourth Amendment.\" Johnson pleaded guilty but reserved his\n   right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A panel of this Court reversed.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516290\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/1313/\">\n    885 F.3d at 1324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The panel agreed that the frisk was constitutional at its inception because, \"[c]onsidering the totality of the facts, ... Officer Williams reasonably believed that his safety, or the safety of his fellow officers, was at risk.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516290\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/1313/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516290\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/1313/\">\n    at 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It held \"the presence of a single round of ammunition-without facts supporting the presence, or reasonable expectation of the presence, of a firearm-was insufficient to justify the seizure of the bullet and the holster.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516290\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/1313/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516290\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/1313/\">\n    at 1323-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We vacated the panel's opinion and ordered rehearing en banc. We instructed the parties to address one issue: whether Officer Williams was entitled, when he felt a round of ammunition in Johnson's pocket during a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk, to seize the ammunition and the holster.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Johnson compares ammunition to \"a pebble, marble, coin, gemstone, ball bearing, or rock of crack cocaine.\" But even Johnson acknowledges a crucial difference between those other objects and a round of live ammunition: the round of ammunition is designed to become a deadly projectile.

That result does not arise from an abandonment of the fact-bound inquiry prescribed by\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   , but instead reflects how a totality-of-the-circumstances test works when reviewing a stop and frisk. Correctly understood, the output of a totality-of-the-circumstances inquiry is\n   <em>\n    necessarily\n   </em>\n   a conditional legal principle: by deciding that particular circumstances mandate a particular result, a court adopts a principle that if materially similar circumstances obtain, the same result must follow. In other words, there is no either-or choice between formulating an abstract principle of law and applying a totality-of-the-circumstances test. Applying the latter yields the former, which is all that we have done to resolve this appeal. We have adopted the principle that if an officer conducts a lawful\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop and frisk in materially similar circumstances, then that officer is entitled to seize ammunition from the suspect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We have neither jettisoned\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   's totality-of-the-circumstances approach in favor of a categorical rule nor resolved a question that we did not ask the parties to address. In resolving the question we posed, we necessarily adopt a principle with potential application to future cases. But the principle is not\n   <em>\n    universally\n   </em>\n   applicable because it is tethered to the concrete factual circumstances of Johnson's stop and frisk. And we cannot indulge our dissenting colleague's call for an explanation of how \"courts will be able to reach any other conclusions in cases involving any ammunition, regardless of any other circumstances,\" Rosenbaum Dissenting Op. at 1016, because \"[w]e are not in the business of issuing advisory opinions ... that\n   merely opine on 'what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.' \"\n   <em>\n    Gagliardi v.

The majority enumerates a variety of factors that it says justified Officer Williams's determination that seizing the bullet was appropriate here: (1) it was 4:00 a.m.; (2) he was patrolling a \"high-crime area\"; (3) he had answered a call about a potentially violent residential burglary; (4) he encountered Johnson \"in a dark alley\"; and (5) \"the scene was not yet secure.\" Majority Op. at 998. That all seems perfectly sensible to me. And more than just sensible, given my understanding of\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   it also seems perfectly correct: In the light of the particular situation that he faced-or the dark of it, as the case may be-Officer Williams reasonably concluded that there was a sufficient threat to his (and others') safety to warrant confiscating the bullet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In fairness, though, the dissent also has a totality-of-the-circumstances story to tell. It highlights the following \"combination of facts\" known to Officer Williams before he frisked Johnson: \"(1) there had been no report or indication of a weapon or an accomplice at the scene; (2) at least two other armed officers had arrived at the scene; (3) Mr. Johnson had immediately, peacefully, and\n   <em>\n    at gunpoint\n   </em>\n   complied with the officers' commands; and (4) the officers had placed Mr. Johnson on the ground and handcuffed him.\" J. Pryor Dissenting Op. at 1028 (footnote call omitted). Speaking for myself, I find the dissent's laundry list somewhat less compelling than the majority's-it seems clear to me, for instance, that a handcuffed suspect can still threaten officer safety,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Sanders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10510691\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/994/200/#p209\">\n    994 F.2d 200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 209-10 (5th Cir. 1993) -but I certainly can't dismiss the dissent's assessment of the situation as ridiculous or groundless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   So even in this case-and even now, more than three years after the fact, from the cozy comfort of our respective judicial\n   chambers-we're having a healthy, good-faith debate about whether the \"totality of the circumstances\" warranted Officer Williams's seizure of the bullet. And although I find that the balance tips in Officer Williams's-and thus the majority's-favor, there are, I must admit, decent arguments on both sides. What I worry about is the next case-and the one after that, and the one after that-which will inevitably involve a different mix of variables. Let's take, for instance, \"time of day,\" which the majority emphasizes-Officer Williams responded to the call here in the wee hours, around 4:00 a.m. Majority Op. at 997-98. What if, instead, he had encountered Johnson in broad daylight in the middle of the afternoon? Same result? How about \"location of the scene\"?\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Opa-Locka is apparently a pretty tough neighborhood-a \"high-crime area.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . But what if we head 10 miles due south, straight down FL-953, to Coral Gables? (For our Alabama readers, think Mountain Brook or Vestavia Hills; for the Georgians, Milton or Sandy Springs.) Seizure still permissible? Now consider a few of the factors that the dissent brings to bear. By the time the bullet was seized, there were a total of three armed officers on the scene.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J. Pryor Dissenting Op. at 1026-27. But what if an officer confronts a suspect alone? Still a Fourth Amendment violation? The dissent also stresses that Johnson was handcuffed-and thus essentially incapable of retrieving and deploying the stashed ammo.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Different result if the suspect isn't yet securely restrained at the time the officer feels the bullet?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   You get my point. Even we judges-with the luxury of time for study and reflection-can't say for certain how we would crunch those factors in future cases. Where in the world does that leave responding officers? Policemen and women are tasked with the often-unenviable task of protecting the public safety, and in so doing they must make split-second judgments about how best to secure a scene or situation. I would rather not require them to work their way through a multi-factor Fourth Amendment balancing analysis in order to determine whether the decision to confiscate a bullet-a bullet!-will stand up to after-the-fact judicial second-guessing. I would prefer-and I believe Supreme Court precedent supports-a clear rule authorizing the seizure. The Court \"repeatedly has acknowledged,\" in all manner of cases, \"the difficulties created for courts, police, and citizens by an ad hoc, case-by-case definition of Fourth Amendment standards to be applied in differing factual circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Oliver v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195904\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/170/#p181\">\n    466 U.S. 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 181,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195904\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/170/#p181\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195904\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/170/#p181\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). Such totality-of-the-circumstances balancing, the Court has stressed, \"not only makes it difficult for the policeman to discern the scope of his authority\"-the thrust of my critique here-but \"also creates a danger that constitutional rights will be arbitrarily and inequitably enforced.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 181-82,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195904\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/170/#p181\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Now I recognize, of course, that in\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   the Supreme Court excused itself from \"develop[ing] at length\" the Fourth Amendment rules that govern the sorts of searches at issue here, saying that they could instead be worked out in \"the concrete factual circumstances of individual cases.\" 392 U.S. at 29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court, though, didn't leave\n   <em>\n    everything\n   </em>\n   in a state of totality-of-the-circumstances limbo. Instead, in the very same paragraph, the Court both clarified an overarching principle-namely, that protective searches must be justified by a concern for \"the protection of the police officer and others nearby\"-and then identified an illustrative list of items whose seizure would, as a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   matter, be deemed to serve that purpose: \"guns, knives, clubs, [and] other hidden instruments for the assault of the police officer.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . To be clear,\n   <em>\n    no one\n   </em>\n   thinks that when an officer conducting a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk identifies a \"gun\" he has to pause to brainstorm whether the particular circumstances in which he finds himself warrant a seizure; he can simply take it. Same for a \"knife\" or a \"club\"-take it. The question for me, therefore-since I'm the one advocating a clear rule to guide officer conduct-is whether a bullet fairly fits within\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   's catch-all category, \"other hidden instruments for the assault of the police officer.\" I think it does. An \"instrument\" is an \"object, device, or apparatus designed or used for a particular purpose or task.\"\n   <em>\n    Oxford English Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (online ed.) Simply as a matter of plain language, it doesn't seem to me too far a stretch to conclude that a bullet qualifies as an \"object\" that can be \"used\" to assault a police officer. And that seems to me all the more true given\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   's unmistakable focus on officer safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   So in the next \"bullet case,\" rather than asking-or worse, requiring the responding officer to ask-whether the neighborhood is sufficiently scary, the hour sufficiently late, the light sufficiently dim, and the suspect and scene sufficiently secure, I would simply hold that the Fourth Amendment permits the protective seizure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   BRANCH, Circuit Judge, joined by GRANT, Circuit Judge, concurring:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   I join the majority opinion in full. The Fourth Amendment certainly authorized Officer Williams to seize the ammunition from Paul Johnson, Jr.'s pocket. I agree with Judge Newsom's concurrence insofar as it recognizes that a bullet falls within the list of items that\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   authorized an officer to seize during a lawful frisk-\"guns, knives, clubs, [and] other hidden instruments for the assault of the police officer.\"\n   <em>\n    Terry v.

In a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk context, a bullet poses substantially the same risk that a gun does-that it will be used as part of a dangerous combination to assault the officer. An officer seizing a gun does not know whether that gun is loaded, yet no one would dispute that the seizure of a gun is lawful even if it turns out that the gun is unloaded.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, an officer seizing a bullet may not know in a particular instance whether there is a gun nearby or if he missed a gun in the frisk. Of course he would know that the bullet is not presently in a gun and must first be loaded into a gun but the risk remains largely the same. Therefore, an officer conducting a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk that is authorized by a reasonable belief that the suspect is armed is entitled to seize a bullet to the same extent he is entitled to seize a gun-regardless of the surrounding circumstances. It does not matter whether the frisk occurs in daylight hours or at night; nor does it matter if it occurs in high crime area or a relatively safe area of town. If an officer discovers a bullet during a frisk lawful under\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   , the officer is entitled to seize the bullet as it is an instrument of assault in all circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   One of the reasons we do not look to the surrounding circumstances in cases concerning the weapons listed in\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   is that, aside from removing the object, no precaution can eliminate the danger. For instance, the Supreme Court has rejected the argument that a suspect who is effectively under the control of the officers cannot gain access to weapons located nearby.\n   <em>\n    Michigan v.

Further, even the presence of multiple officers does not eliminate, though it may reduce, the risk that a suspect will obtain a gun and fire it at the officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Moreover, a bullet is an instrument of assault because its only purpose is to be used with a firearm. Like a gun, a bullet located during a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk poses an inherent risk to the safety of the officer and others nearby, and the police officer should not be required to assume such \"unnecessary risks in the performance of their duties.\"\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   , 392 U.S. at 23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For those reasons, having found a bullet pursuant to a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk, an\n   officer is permitted to seize it in the same manner as he would a gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   This is not to say that the Fourth Amendment provides no protection against the unreasonable seizure of a bullet. But those protections come at the initiation of the encounter when the officer must have reasonable suspicion of criminal activity in order to initiate the stop and a reasonable belief that the individual is armed and presently dangerous in order to conduct the pat down.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    at 24, 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is also not to say that the totality of the circumstances has no role in the\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   context, of course it does, but that role is limited to the initiation of the stop and frisk. After having made those determinations, an officer is authorized to remove a concealed object that he reasonably believes is a weapon or other instrument of assault based on the pat down. And because a bullet is an instrument of assault in the\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   context, it is reasonable under all circumstances for the officer to protect his safety and that of others nearby by removing the bullet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Because I conclude that a bullet falls in to the category of \"guns, knives, clubs, or other hidden instruments for the assault of the police officer,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    at 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and cannot logically be separated from a gun for\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   purposes, I would find that anytime an officer conducts a lawful\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk, the officer may seize any bullet located during the frisk.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-189\">\n    <em>\n     Cf., e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Georgia v.

Instead, the Majority Opinion takes a third route and adopts the new\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   rule on its own. That new rule may well be correct. Or it may not.

In Section II, I recount the many ways we could have avoided ruling on a question that was not before us, and I note the consequences of engaging in such a review. And in Section III, I explain that I do not opine on the question that actually was before us because the Majority Opinion's new rule makes that question moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   This section demonstrates that today's Majority Opinion necessarily renders ammunition always seizable in a proper\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   frisk. But before I get to that, I must acknowledge an awkward fact: the Majority\n   Opinion insists that it has not established such a new rule. So of course, any reader likely and understandably will approach my dissent with some skepticism. In fact, my colleagues' views gave me serious pause-as they should have-that perhaps I had misread the Majority Opinion. So I have spent a lot of time closely reviewing and re-reviewing the Majority Opinion. But every reading has led me to the same conclusion: the Majority Opinion necessarily establishes the new rule that ammunition is always seizable in a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk. And district courts that must apply the lessons from the Majority Opinion will not logically be able to ever reach the conclusion that ammunition is not seizable in a permissible\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk-no matter the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   One other note to keep in mind while considering the practical holding of today's Majority Opinion: the Majority Opinion easily could have avoided creating its new rule today that all ammunition is always seizable in a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk. All it would have had to do is include one additional sentence limiting the broad principles that otherwise necessarily flow from the Majority Opinion's reasoning. But the Majority Opinion has refused to do so. I hope readers will ask themselves why. In the meantime, though, in Part A of this section, I describe the problematic aspects of the Majority Opinion and explain the easy fix that would prevent us from issuing our new rule today that ammunition is always seizable in a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk. In Part B, I discuss the problems with a stealth holding like the one the Majority Opinion necessarily produces today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The difficulties the Majority Opinion's reasoning creates begin at the second paragraph on page 10 of the Majority Opinion (beginning \"As an essential part of a lethal weapon ...\") and continue through the top of page 12. They arise because, in and of itself, the reasoning in question dictates today's holding that Johnson's bullet was properly seized-without reference to any actual circumstances existing at the time officers seized Johnson's bullet. So that same reasoning that made Johnson's bullet seizable here necessarily requires the conclusion that ammunition is always seizable during a proper\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk. And under our prior-precedent rule, a holding that sneaks into our jurisprudence through the back door of reasoning is every bit as binding as one that openly announces its presence as it enters through the front door.\n   <em>\n    Smith v. GTE Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11172193\" index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/236/1292/#p1304\">\n    236 F.3d 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1304 (11th Cir. 2001) (\"The fact that the [prior panel of the Court] did not explicitly say 'there is no common and undivided interest in a class claim for punitive damages' does not undermine the clear reasoning and result of that decision nor does it vitiate the resulting rule.\"). So unfortunately, the Majority Opinion's refusal to expressly own its holding today that all ammunition is always seizable during a permissible\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk does not render the holding any less binding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In particular, to justify its determination that the ammunition here was seizable, the Majority Opinion reasons that when a bullet is present, so is a gun, \"because common sense and logic dictate that a bullet is often associated with a gun\" (the \"bullet-means-gun\" argument). Maj. Op. at 998 (citation, quotation marks, and alteration omitted). The Majority Opinion then goes on to opine that knowing the caliber of a bullet can be useful to determining the type of gun that might be present at the scene.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . For this reason, the Majority Opinion concludes, the bullet was seizable since \"Officer Williams had to find any gun to secure the scene and protect himself\n   and others.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . But there are two big problems with trying to glom this rationale onto the totality-of-the-circumstances test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   First, as the Majority Opinion implicitly concedes, this reasoning is based on hypothetical \"facts.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 998 (\"Officer Williams's removal of the ammunition\n   <em>\n    could have\n   </em>\n   informed him of what caliber or type of gun might be nearby.\") (emphasis added). Despite testifying at two separate evidentiary hearings, neither Officer Williams nor any other law-enforcement officer ever said that he or she sought to use or that he or she did in fact consult the caliber of the seized bullet to ascertain what type of gun might be lying around.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   So it is simply not accurate to suggest that Officer Williams seized the bullet to somehow aid him in identifying the \"caliber or type of gun\" for which he was looking.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11172193\" index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/236/1292/#p1304\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Consequently, the rationale that the ammunition was seizable so it could assist the officer in identifying and then locating a strewn weapon literally bears no relationship to the actual circumstances in Johnson's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Because it is divorced from the circumstances of this case, the bullet-means-gun rationale cannot even arguably be viewed as part of any alleged totality-of-the-circumstances rationale for seizing the bullet here. Rather, it supports adoption of a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   rule. Instead of evaluating \"the concrete factual circumstances that Officer Williams encountered,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10, the Opinion \"weighs\" an abstract fact that, while always true, was never actually considered here, under the guise of a circumstance-dependent test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   But a second problem also plagues the bullet-means-gun argument. By the Majority Opinion's reasoning, every piece of ammunition will always give rise to the deduction that \"a gun [is] in the vicinity,\" and every officer will always have to find any gun to secure the scene and protect himself and others. So if, as the Majority\n   Opinion asserts, a bullet means a gun is present, and knowing the caliber of the bullet is important to \"find[ing] any gun to secure the scene and protect [the officer] and others,\" in the absence of any limitation on these principles, the presence of a bullet and the corresponding need to know the caliber of it to assist in identifying the gun will always be sufficient, in and of themselves, to support seizure of the ammunition-regardless of any circumstances of the particular\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Nor is the bullet-means-gun argument the only one the Majority Opinion relies on that suffers from this problem. The Majority Opinion also justifies its determination that the bullet here was seizable on the ground that ammunition threatens the safety of officers and others because it is \"an essential part of a lethal weapon,\" and \"grave injury ... could [ ] be[ ] caused by ... ammunition if ... loaded into a gun\" (the \"intrinsic-danger\" argument).\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 10. But what bullet is that\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   true of?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   To be sure, the Majority Opinion mentions \"Johnson's ammunition\" and \"in these circumstances\" in discussing the intrinsic-danger argument.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   But the specified characteristics of ammunition on which the Majority Opinion actually relies in this argument are not unique to Johnson's single bullet. And even the most thorough of reviews reveals no effort whatsoever by the Majority Opinion to relate these general characteristics of all ammunition to the particular circumstances of Johnson's\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk. As a result, the Majority Opinion's camouflage cannot and does not limit the reasoning wearing it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Rather, these intrinsic-danger characteristics of Johnson's ammunition are\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   true of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   ammunition. So under the intrinsic-danger rationale, in the absence of any express limitation on the principle, all ammunition will always be seizable because, intrinsically, it always \"threatens the safety of officers and others.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. And because ammunition is seizable when it \"threatens the safety of officers and others,\" and all ammunition always threatens \"the safety of officers and others\" under the intrinsic-danger rationale, all ammunition is always seizable during a permissible\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk, without regard to any other considerations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   So all courts in this Circuit are now bound to uphold the seizure of ammunition during a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk-whether the officer seizes the ammunition on a crowded street in the highest-crime neighborhood just before dawn and while the suspect is wearing bulky clothing and is unsecured, or whether the officer seizes the ammunition on a sunny day at an empty beach while the suspect is secured and clad in nothing more than a bikini. And it is pure sophistry to suggest that courts will be able to reach any other conclusions in cases involving ammunition, regardless of any other circumstances. Perhaps that is why the Majority Opinion does not even attempt to explain how any other answer is possible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Nor is it any answer to this dilemma to simply note, as the Majority Opinion does, that to determine whether an officer may properly seize an item during a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk, we must \"consider[ ] the nature of that object.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. Of course, that is true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   But significantly, the inquiry we must conduct about the nature of the item under the totality-of-the-circumstances framework is whether the nature of the seized item created a threat to the safety of officers and others\n   <em>\n    under the particular circumstances the officer encountered\n   </em>\n   -not whether the nature of the item always poses a threat to the safety of officers and others. The latter is a question we could ask if we were deciding whether to scrap the totality-of-the-circumstances test as applied to ammunition, as the Newsom and Branch Opinions openly advocate doing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   In fact, the Branch Opinion-which expressly concludes that ammunition is always seizable during a proper\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk because \"a bullet is an instrument for the assault of the police officer,\" Branch Op. at 1008 (citation, internal quotation marks, and alteration omitted)-relies on the very same intrinsic-danger reasoning as the Majority Opinion to reach its conclusion. According to the Branch Opinion's reasoning, \"aside from removing [ammunition], no precaution can eliminate the danger\" ammunition poses, since a bullet's \"only purpose is to be used with a firearm,\" and \"a bullet located during a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk poses an inherent risk to the safety of the officers and the others nearby.\" Branch Op. at 1008. In other words, the Branch Opinion employs the intrinsic-danger rationale to expressly hold what the Majority Opinion implicitly (and necessarily) holds through the very same reasoning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The Majority Opinion easily could have avoided this problem and could have limited itself to holding only that the seizure of Johnson's ammunition was appropriate under the totality of the circumstances here, if it wanted to do so. All it needed to do is simply state that the bullet-means-gun and intrinsic-danger arguments, alone or in combination with only each other, are not enough, in and of themselves, to warrant seizure of ammunition during a permissible\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk. A single sentence would do that trick. That's it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   In fact, I expressly invited the Majority Opinion to do just that. And by this dissent, I renew my call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Tellingly, though, the Majority Opinion refuses to add any such language. We should ask ourselves why. If the Majority Opinion believes that the bullet-means-gun and intrinsic-danger arguments, alone or in combination with only each other, are not enough to warrant seizure of ammunition during a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop, why will it not just say so?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Because the Majority Opinion refuses to limit its reasoning today, under our prior-precedent rule, the Majority Opinion's bullet-means-gun and intrinsic-danger reasoning-which are applicable to all ammunition in all circumstances and not limited to the facts of Johnson's case-bind all courts in the Eleventh Circuit to rule ammunition always seizable during a proper\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Even the Branch Opinion implicitly recognizes as much. True, the Branch Opinion states that it \"join[s] the Majority Opinion in full.\" But significantly, that endorsement is qualified with two \"clarif[ications].\" Branch Opinion at 31. And those \"clarif[ications]\" preclude the Branch Opinion's analysis from supporting the Majority\n   Opinion's totality-of-the-circumstances alternative holding. In particular, the Branch Opinion necessarily qualifies its endorsement of the Majority Opinion with the following two \"clarif[ications]\": that \"(1) the totality of the circumstances analysis in\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   applies\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      only\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   when the officer is determining whether (a) to stop and (b) then to frisk the detained person; and (2) if the officer conducting the frisk complies with the scope of the search permitted by\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   and feels what the officer reasonably believes is a bullet, the officer\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      may in all circumstances seize it\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). In other words, the Branch Opinion expressly disavows the idea that the totality-of-the-circumstances test governs-or even applies in any way to-the question of whether ammunition may be seized during a permissible\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   So the Branch Opinion's \"clarif[ication]\"-that the totality-of-the-circumstances analysis does not govern whether ammunition is seizable during a permissible\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk because ammunition is always seizable during a permissible\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk, regardless of the circumstances-cannot peacefully coexist with the Majority Opinion's claimed sole holding-that Johnson's ammunition was properly seized under an analysis of the totality of the circumstances existing after the frisk had already been properly embarked upon and at the time Williams recognized a bullet was in Johnson's pocket. Either the totality-of-the-circumstances analysis governs whether ammunition is seizable during a permissible\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk, or it doesn't. And if it does, ammunition cannot then always be seizable during a proper\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk. Otherwise, employing the totality-of-the-circumstances analysis to ascertain whether seizure of ammunition is allowed during a given permissible\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk would be an utter waste of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Rather, if a totality-of-the-circumstances analysis governs, that necessarily means that in at least some circumstances, ammunition will not be seizable. So the Branch Opinion's \"clarif[ication]\" of the Majority Opinion that ammunition is always seizable during a proper\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk is not a \"clarif[ication]\" at all. Instead, it is necessarily an acknowledgment of the Branch Opinion's understanding that the Majority Opinion renders ammunition always seizable during a proper\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk, without regard to the totality-of-the-circumstances test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   What's more, two of the seven judges in the Majority signed the Branch Opinion, which endorses only the ammunition-is-always-seizable theory and necessarily repudiates the applicability of the totality-of-the-circumstances test to determining whether ammunition is seizable during a permissible\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk. And since the Majority Opinion has two holdings, including that ammunition is always seizable during a proper\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk, the only rationale receiving seven votes today is the Branch Opinion's rationale. It makes no difference that the Branch Opinion states that it \"join[s] the majority opinion in full\" because the Branch Opinion's \"clarif[ication]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   of the Majority Opinion necessarily means the Branch Opinion's concurrence in the Majority Opinion is qualified to endorse only the ammunition-is-always-seizable theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Plus, even if we could overlook the fact that the Branch Opinion's \"clarif[ications]\" of the Majority Opinion necessarily qualify its concurrence in the Majority Opinion to supporting only the ammunition-is-always-seizable holding, the Majority Opinion would have two alternative holdings: the narrow one it trumpets-that the bullet here was seizable under the totality of the circumstances-and the broad one it declines to expressly acknowledge-that all ammunition is always seizable in a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   And under those circumstances, make no mistake: as a practical matter, the Majority Opinion's stealth holding that ammunition is always seizable in a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk is the only holding that counts, regardless of whether the Majority Opinion openly admits that. Though alternative holdings are equally binding if they receive the support of a majority of judges considering the issue,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bravo v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4030519\" index=\"266\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/532/1154/#p1162\">\n    532 F.3d 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1162 (11th Cir. 2008), the ammunition-is-always-seizable holding necessarily will devour the totality-of-the-circumstances holding in every case. So if the two holdings produce different answers to the question of whether ammunition is seizable in a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk in any given case, the holding that the ammunition is always seizable will always demand the overall conclusion that the ammunition is seizable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Leon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"267\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/\">\n    468 U.S. 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"268\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"269\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/\">\n    82 L.Ed.2d 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984) (fruit of impermissible search admissible where officers reasonably believed in good faith that the search was valid).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The Majority Opinion has no answer to this problem. Instead, it invokes everyone from Chief Justice John Marshall to Bryan Garner for the truism that judicial decisions are limited to the facts of the case before the court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Majority Op. at 1002-03. But that does not respond to the problem here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Indeed, Garner's\n   <em>\n    The Law of Judicial Precedent\n   </em>\n   , which the Majority Opinion relies on,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 1002, explains that while a court decides only the case before it, \"the rationale that carries the force of precedent is that without which the judgment in the case could not have been given, and not the reasoning articulated by the court,\" Bryan A. Garner,\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    The Law of Judicial Precedent\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 6, at 83 (2016) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, our prior-precedent rule dictates an opinion's holding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Yet the Majority Opinion fails to account in any way for the prior-precedent rule, which today requires the conclusion that all ammunition is always seizable during a permissible\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk. In fact, the Majority Opinion does not even mention the prior-precedent rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   So in sum, the bullet-means-gun and intrinsic-danger rationales apply to all ammunition, regardless of any surrounding factual circumstances, and we have declared today that each of these rationales requires the conclusion that ammunition represents a threat to the safety of officers or others. Since a threat to the safety of officers or others always justifies the seizure of an item during a permissible\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk, in the absence of limiting principles, under our prior-precedent rule, the bullet-means-gun and intrinsic-danger rationales necessarily require all courts in this Circuit to now rule valid the seizure of ammunition during a proper\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk, without consideration of any surrounding circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The new rule we adopt may or may not ultimately be the right answer. But we should at least be forthright about what we are holding and about the consequences of today's decision. And we should ask for and consider the parties' positions in the process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   A reader may wonder what difference it makes whether we openly announce our holding that ammunition is always seizable if the holding is nonetheless ascertainable from our reasoning today? In my view, a lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   It matters because we are a United States Court, and forthrightness is our stock in trade. We have a duty to be open and honest with Johnson, officers, members of the public, and federal courts about the practical legal consequences of our decision today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   It matters because officers and members of the public who have not had reason to think about the practical legal consequences of the Majority Opinion's reasoning may be under the misimpression after today that ammunition is not always seizable in a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk. As a result, officers may (now unnecessarily) spend time weighing how dark it is or how much crime has been committed in a given locale before deciding whether to seize ammunition, potentially imperiling their safety if the Majority Opinion's rationale rendering all ammunition seizable is correct. And it matters to the privacy rights of the public who may (now mistakenly) believe that officers are not entitled to seize ammunition from their pockets in some scenarios.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   It matters because now busy courts in this Circuit will have to waste their time going through the motions of applying the totality-of-the-circumstances test to determine whether ammunition is seizable in a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk, only to ultimately have to hold in every single case that it is, regardless of the outcome of the totality-of-the-circumstances analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   It matters because if Johnson wishes to seek certiorari on the question of whether ammunition is, in fact, always seizable under\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   or whether instead ammunition is seizable only if the totality of the circumstances warrants it, he will have to spend several pages of his petition just proving that the Majority Opinion establishes this rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   It matters because if members of the public knew we were going to consider announcing a rule that ammunition is always seizable in a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk, some-such as advocacy organizations for civil rights, law-enforcement officers, and gun enthusiasts, as well as criminal-defense-attorney organizations-may have wished to have filed\n   <em>\n    amicus curiae\n   </em>\n   briefs to assist us in evaluating the legal advisability of that position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   And it matters because if, outside the strictures of our adversarial system, we are going to adopt a new rule no party advocated for, we have a duty to plainly state that that is what we are doing. And then we have a duty to explain why that extraordinary measure is necessary. If we can't, we should not adopt a new rule in this way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Perhaps the Majority Opinion does not expressly acknowledge its ammunition-is-always-seizable holding because we never asked the parties to brief the question it answers, neither party argued the ammunition-is-always-seizable position that the Majority Opinion's new rule adopts today, and the government expressly disavowed it during oral argument. In other words, we never subjected today's new rule to the adversarial process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Had we done so, we could have had more confidence in the Court's new rule. As Justice Gorsuch has explained, \"[N]ormally ... the crucible of adversarial testing is crucial to sound judicial decisionmaking.

And that is the case even more so when we determine the scope of a constitutional right while sitting en banc on rehearing. Indeed, \"[a]n en banc ... rehearing is not favored and ordinarily will not be ordered unless ... the proceeding involves a question of exceptional importance.\" Fed. R. App. P. 35(a)(2). When a case \"involves a question of exceptional importance,\" employing the powerful adversarial-testing tool is even more crucial to ensure we reach the best possible answer under the law.

In fact, it was entirely within our control to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   We are the ones who decide the question the parties must address for en banc rehearing. So we could have asked the parties to brief whether an officer may always seize ammunition when that officer immediately recognizes it during a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk or whether instead we must always apply\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   's totality-of-the-circumstances analysis to determine whether the seizure of ammunition is reasonable under the specific facts of a particular situation. But we did not ask that question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Left to their own devices, the parties argued over application of\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   's totality-of-the-circumstances test to the specific facts of this case-that is, whether Officer Williams's seizure of the single bullet was reasonable in light of the particular factual scenario that arose here. When we saw that neither party's briefing advocated for-or even addressed-a rule that would allow officers to always seize ammunition upon immediately recognizing it during a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk, we could have given the parties\n   a supplemental-briefing instruction requiring them to comment on the issue. But we did not do that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   We also could have appointed counsel to argue the position that no party chose to take: that an officer may always seize ammunition upon immediately recognizing it during a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk. To be sure, we have embraced the appointed-counsel procedure in the past when no party has adopted a particular side of a given issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    McCarthan v.

But we did not appoint counsel here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   And even after oral en banc arguments, when it became clear a majority of this Court decided that it was considering affirming on the basis of today's new rule, it was not too late to solicit the parties' opinions and appoint counsel if necessary. We reserve time in our annual schedule for at least three en banc sessions every year. Sometimes we use them all; sometimes we don't. But they are always available. So we easily could have reset the case for a new en banc rehearing to occur in January-just three months after the first one.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Then we could have directed the parties to brief the question the Court decides without their input (or approval) today. If no one took today's Majority's position, we could have appointed counsel to brief it. But we did not do that, either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Yet now, without the benefit of briefing on this rule by any party before the Court-or even a decision from the district court here mentioning this rule-and over the government's disavowal at oral argument of the rule we adopt, we embrace a brand new rule. And this rule isn't new to just us. This rule is new to federal appellate jurisprudence: in the fifty years since the Supreme Court issued\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   , no other Circuit has adopted or expressly rejected this rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, no other Circuit has even considered the precise question of whether an officer may always seize ammunition when that officer immediately recognizes it during a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk, or whether instead we must always apply\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   's totality-of-the-circumstances analysis to determine whether the seizure of ammunition is reasonable under the specific facts of a particular situation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   That makes subjecting the new rule to adversarial testing even more critical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   But instead, the Majority has skipped the adversarial testing and on its own created the rule we adopt today. I think adversarial testing is a pretty important part of our judicial process-and we easily could have done it here. My colleagues offer no reason for why it is appropriate to avoid adversarial testing in this case, and I am not aware of one, either. So I cannot join my colleagues in announcing the Court's new rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Instead of asking the parties to address whether ammunition is always seizable in a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk, without regard to the particular circumstances, we asked the parties to brief and argue whether the bullet here was reasonably seized under\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   's totality-of-the-circumstances framework.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   So the Majority's decision making all ammunition seizable under all conditions, without regard to the totality-of-the-circumstances test poses a dilemma: I can either (1) substantively analyze and opine on the advisability of a rule that we did not ask the parties to brief, that that they did not argue, and that the government expressly disavowed-and in an en banc case, no less; or (2) analyze how the totality-of-the-circumstances test applies to the ammunition here in light of the particular circumstances adduced through the evidentiary hearings-the (non-en banc worthy) question we did ask the parties to brief and they did argue-even though in this Circuit, as a result of the Majority Opinion's new rule, that test has now become forever moot as it relates to ammunition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   An important consequence arises from choosing which question to answer: the question reviewed limits the universe of answers we can reach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   For example, the first question-whether ammunition is always seizable in a proper\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk when the officer identifies ammunition-assumes that it may be possible under\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   for all ammunition as a class to be ruled seizable, without regard to any circumstances. As a result, the universe of potential answers to that question\n   includes the conclusion that all ammunition as a class is seizable under\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   , without regard to any circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   But that answer is not possible in the universe defined by the second question-whether the totality of the circumstances here made it permissible for Officer Williams to seize the bullet from Johnson's pocket at the time he so identified it. The second question, which requires application of the totality-of-the-circumstances framework, necessarily anticipates that items subject to it will not be seizable under at least some circumstances. Indeed, if a certain type of item subject to the totality-of-the-circumstances test were always seizable based solely on the nature of the item itself, the particular circumstances under which it was seized would never matter, and the test would be meaningless as applied to that type of item. So under the second question-the only one we asked the parties to answer-if a certain type of item (such as ammunition) is subject to the totality-of-the-circumstances test, it must not be seizable in at least some circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   The Majority's answer in this case-which creates the rule that ammunition is always seizable, regardless of the circumstances-does not fall within the universe of possible answers we ourselves created for this en banc proceeding when we asked the parties to brief the totality-of-the-circumstances question. That brings me back to my dilemma: I can substantively analyze a question that was never at issue in these en banc proceedings, or I can apply a now-meaningless test (as it relates to ammunition) that is not capable of coming to the Majority Opinion's ultimate answer-that ammunition is always seizable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   For the reasons I have explained in Section II, I am uncomfortable with the first course of action. I therefore respectfully decline to participate in it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   As for the second, since the Majority Opinion effectively banishes the totality-of-the-circumstances test (when it comes to ammunition) to the Eleventh Circuit's attic, applying that now-defunct test to the particular circumstances surrounding the seizure of the single bullet here is an exercise that can serve no practical purpose. It cannot determine the outcome of this case, and it cannot even arguably make points that future courts considering motions to suppress ammunition seized in\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisks might find helpful, since the test no longer matters as it pertains to ammunition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   The Majority Opinion criticizes this dissent for \"refus[ing] to answer the one question [posed to the parties] that a majority of this Court voted to decide en banc.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Maj. Op. at 1003. But notably, the question we asked the parties to brief and they in fact briefed sought resolution of the case by applying the totality-of-the-circumstances test to the specific facts here. Though the Majority Opinion claims to \"answer the very question the parties briefed and argued,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277796\" index=\"286\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/851/1076/#p1079\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , as I have explained,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   at Section I, the Majority Opinion's alternative ammunition-is-always-seizable holding-the only one that\n   matters since it extinguishes the vitality of the totality-of-the-circumstances test as applied to ammunition in this Circuit-applies the totality-of-the-circumstances test no more than this dissent does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Charades may be fun at parties, but not in judicial opinions where officer safety and privacy rights hang in the balance.

Our law must provide police officers with sufficient discretion, and room for mistakes, that they can keep themselves safe. But officer safety is not the only interest at play here. The people whom officers police and protect have a Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. This case stands at the crossroads of these two very compelling interests. It's a crossroads where courts often find themselves. For more than half a century, the Supreme Court, faced with resolving the tension between these two interests, has adhered to the principle that after conducting an investigatory stop of a person \"a law enforcement officer, for his own protection and safety, may conduct a patdown to find\n   <em>\n    weapons\n   </em>\n   that he reasonably believes or suspects are then in the possession of the person he has accosted.\"\n   <em>\n    Ybarra v.

In the early morning hours in Opa-Locka, Florida-a high-crime area-the local police department received a 911 call about a possible burglary in progress at a four-unit home. The 911 caller reported that a \"person [was] trying to get through the window of [a] neighbor's house,\" and the dispatcher relayed to\n   the police that the suspect was a black male wearing a white shirt. Doc. 22 at 6, 19.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Two officers, both of whom received the description of the person in question, arrived on the scene. There, they saw Mr. Johnson, a black male in a white shirt, coming from the back of the building where the reported incident had taken place. The officers drew their weapons, pointed them at Mr. Johnson, and ordered him to approach with his hands up. Mr. Johnson immediately complied. At this point, a third officer arrived. Officer Williams, who was one of the first two officers on the scene, told Mr. Johnson that he was being detained until the officers could \"figure things out.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33. Another officer ordered Mr. Johnson to the ground near the parking area at the front of the building, Mr. Johnson immediately complied, and then Officer Williams handcuffed him while the other officers trained their weapons on him. Officer Williams then frisked Mr. Johnson. To recap: during the frisk, Mr. Johnson was handcuffed, lying on the ground, and surrounded by three armed officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Officer Williams felt in Mr. Johnson's front pants pocket \"a nylon piece of material; and then, underneath it, a round, hard-like, oval-shaped object, which led [him] to believe it was ammunition.\" Doc. 30 at 6. He reached into Mr. Johnson's pocket and removed a black nylon pistol holster and a single round of .380 caliber ammunition. When asked whether there were any \"weapons or anything near that this ammunition and this holster goes to,\" Mr. Johnson said no. Doc. 22 at 10. The officers began sweeping the area for weapons that might have been thrown. At that point a fourth officer arrived and saw Mr. Johnson handcuffed on the ground, the bullet and holster lying next to him, and another officer standing over Mr. Johnson with his gun drawn.

The same is true of the fact that Mr. Johnson matched the vague description given by the 911 caller. But by the time Officer Williams reached his hand into Mr. Johnson's pocket, he had much more specific information than he did when the officers initiated the stop and frisk. Officer Williams found no firearm or other weapon on Mr. Johnson's person. And, critically, Mr. Johnson was completely restrained and fully compliant, and the officers had neither obtained any information about nor observed any other person on the scene, much less a suspected accomplice. So at the time of the bullet's seizure, the general contextual considerations upon which the majority opinion relies provided little if any support for a \"rational inference[ ]\" that a single bullet in Mr. Johnson's pocket would pose a danger.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   , 392 U.S. at 21, 27,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"310\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   For the bullet to amount to a threat, Mr. Johnson, lying on the ground with his hands handcuffed behind his back, would have had to escape his handcuffs like Houdini, retrieve the bullet from the front pocket of his pants, escape from custody with guns trained on him, and find a matching gun to use the bullet. Or, under the majority opinion's accomplice theory, Maj. Op. at 1001, under the same conditions Mr. Johnson would have had to escape the handcuffs, retrieve the bullet, and then throw the single bullet-in the dark-to an accomplice waiting with a matching unloaded gun or receive a gun from a hidden and unreported accomplice and load the gun with the single bullet.

Second, an officer who feels a bullet in a suspect's pocket can discern different facts than an officer who feels a gun.

And third, from the standpoint of safety-the\n   <em>\n    sine qua non\n   </em>\n   of\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   -it makes sense that we don't require officers to rely on the possibility that a gun in a person's pocket is not loaded.

There remains the possibility that the feel of the object, together with other suspicious circumstances, will amount to probable cause that the object is contraband or some other item subject to seizure, in which case there may be a further search based upon that probable cause.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
