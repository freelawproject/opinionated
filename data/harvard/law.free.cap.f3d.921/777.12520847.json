During an overnight flight from Tokyo, Japan to Los Angeles, California, Juan Pablo Price, a forty-six-year-old man, moved from his assigned seat to an open seat adjacent to that of a sleeping twenty-one-year-old female Japanese student, where he fondled her breast and slipped his hand into her underwear, touching her vagina. The jury convicted Price under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), finding that the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Price knowingly had sexual contact with the victim and that the sexual contact was without the victim's permission. Price appeals his conviction, contending that the government was also required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he subjectively knew that his victim did not consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   We reject Price's reading of the statute as contrary to its text, the structure of the statutory scheme and its very purpose in penalizing those who sexually prey upon victims on the seas or in the air within federal jurisdiction. Congress's purpose in enacting the Sexual Abuse Act of 1986 was to criminalize sexual contact by focusing on the defendant's conduct. If the government were required to prove that the defendant subjectively knew he lacked consent, as Price urges here, every accused sexual predator could defend his admitted sexual contact in the face of no objective sign of permission by asserting a supposed subjective belief that the victim was \"enjoying herself,\" a result directly contrary to the purpose of the 1986 Act. Even Price recognized, following his arrest, that \"it sure is going to be my job not to touch a woman\" whom he doesn't know and hasn't talked to. As the arresting officer responded to Price, \"in your forty something years, you should've already known that[ ].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Because unwanted sexual contact of the type Price engaged in-touching first, and arguing later that he \"thought\" the victim consented-is precisely what \u00a7 2244(b) criminalizes, we reject Price's claim of instructional error. We also conclude that the police had probable cause to arrest Price, that he was properly Mirandized, and that the district court acted within its discretion in refusing to read back to the jury portions of the victim's testimony. We therefore affirm Price's conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The objective facts are fairly undisputed. Price, then forty-six, was a passenger on the overnight flight from Tokyo, Japan to Los Angeles, California. A.M., a twenty-one-year-old college student, and her friend, Maki Fujita, were traveling on the same flight. After take-off, Price asked A.M. if he could move from his assigned seat to the unoccupied seat next to her, a seat where the video monitor was not working, explaining that his original seat had limited legroom. A.M. said \"okay.\" Price attempted to engage A.M. in conversation,\n   but A.M. could not speak English very well, and he eventually realized that she was not completely understanding what he was saying. A flight attendant, Hidemori Ejima, noticed that Price had changed his seat, and asked him why. When Price responded that he wanted more legroom, Ejima offered Price another seat with a working video monitor and three times more legroom. Price declined the offer-something Ejima had not seen before in his twenty-five years as a flight attendant. After food service, Ejima handed Fujita a note warning Fujita and A.M. to \"watch out\" for the person sitting next to them. A.M. interpreted the warning to mean that Price might try to steal her wallet or other belongings. She moved her purse and wallet deeper into her bag and fell asleep.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.M. woke up to Price touching the right side of her body, including her arm, hip, and leg. Thinking that Price was trying to steal the cell phone in her pocket, she moved the phone to inside the seat pocket and went back to sleep. When A.M. awoke again, Price was touching her breast. A.M. began panicking, but did not want to bother the people around her. She tried to avoid Price's touch by pulling the blankets up to her shoulder and crossing her arms in front of her. Undeterred, Price placed his blanket over both of them, covering his arms, and continued to touch her breast, first over her shirt and then under it. Price then moved his hand into A.M.'s jeans and underwear and touched her vagina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In a state of shock, panic, and fear, and looking for the words to tell Price to stop, A.M. twisted her body toward Fujita on her left, away from Price. Price hauled her back around with \"strong force\" and tried to pull her jeans down. At this point, Fujita woke up, and, seeing her awake, Price retreated to his seat. When Fujita asked A.M. if she was okay, A.M. responded that she was not and asked what she should do. Fujita told her to tell the flight attendant. A.M. did not have the English words to explain what happened, although she was able to ask for \"help.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Price's perception of the encounter differed from the others on the plane. He testified that while his hand was on the armrest, he felt A.M.'s hand touch his. Thinking that this could be an invitation, Price began to rub her hand. Price stated that they started holding and rubbing each other's hands. As he began moving his hands across A.M.'s body and to her breast area, he thought she was \"enjoying herself\" because she was arching her body, he could feel her heartbeat, her breathing was intense, and she was opening and closing her eyes. It was only when Price tried to move her face toward him and A.M. would not budge that Price thought something was wrong. At that point, Price noticed that Fujita was awake, and A.M. then got up. According to both A.M.'s and Price's accounts, no words were exchanged during this encounter. Price agrees A.M. did not verbally consent to his touching her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   While A.M. got up to tell the flight attendant what happened, Price wrote a note that he never ended up giving to A.M., which said, \"If a man touches you and you don't want him to always feel free to say No.\" The purser or lead chief flight attendant, Yosri Zidan, then obtained written statements from both Price and A.M. Price's story was that he changed seats because he wanted more legroom; he then fell asleep and awoke to find A.M. stroking his hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   While still in flight, the pilot sent a message to American Airlines employees at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) that read, \"WE NEED LAX POLICE TO MEET AIRPLANE [/] WE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   HAVE A MOLESTER/FONDLER ON BOARD.\" The LAX Police Department (LAXPD) then contacted the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), who in turn contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Special Agent David Gates (S.A. Gates) of the FBI instructed the sergeant at LAX to first investigate the incident to determine if he needed to respond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 18, 2015, after a federal grand jury indicted Price for abusive sexual contact under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), Price was formally arrested. Price filed a pre-trial motion to suppress evidence found in his bag and cell phone, and his statements to the LAXPD officers and to S.A. Gates, arguing that he was arrested without probable cause upon the flight's arrival at LAX and that he was questioned without being given\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings. The government and Price disputed the\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) jury instruction, based on the statute's use of the word \"knowingly.\" The district court ultimately selected the Ninth Circuit's Model Criminal Jury Instruction for \u00a7 2244(b) and the additional instruction proposed by Price that \"permission\" under \u00a7 2244(b) can be express or implied, \"that is[,] inferred from words or actions.\" The district court denied Price's request to instruct the jury that, in addition, the government must prove that Price \"knew the sexual contact was without A.M.'s permission.\" The district court reasoned \"that it is appropriate not to read into the statute that which it does not say it requires.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Price timely appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Whoever, in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States ... knowingly engages in sexual contact with another person without that other person's permission shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than two years, or both.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"Sexual contact\" is defined as \"the intentional touching, either directly or through the clothing, of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202246\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3). The Ninth Circuit's model instruction provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The defendant is charged in [Count _______ of] the indictment with abusive sexual contact in violation of Section 2244(b) of Title 18 of the United States Code.

In this case, \"sexual contact\" means [\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     specify statutory definition\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Manual of Model Criminal Jury Instructions \u00a7 8.180 (2010) (Ninth Cir. Jury Instructions Comm., amended 2015). The model instruction does not ask the jury to find that the defendant subjectively knew that he lacked the victim's permission. Price argues that the model instruction was given in error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Whether \"a jury instruction misstates elements of a statutory crime\" is an issue we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We have not yet addressed whether the term \"knowingly\" in \u00a7 2244(b) applies to the phrase \"without that other person's permission.\" As a matter of statutory interpretation, we generally consider the statute's language, purpose, history, and\n   past decisions and controlling law to determine whether the district court properly instructed the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

Examining the text of \u00a7 2244(b), we conclude that its most natural grammatical meaning is that the government must prove that the defendant knew he engaged in sexual contact, not that it prove that the defendant subjectively knew he lacked consent. The term \"knowingly\" modifies only the verb phrase \"engages in sexual contact with another person\" and does not modify the adverbial prepositional phrase \"without that other person's permission.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

To read \"knowingly\" to apply to the second element in \u00a7 2244(a) would both be grammatically unnatural and produce absurd results.

According to Price, because \u00a7 2241(d) and \u00a7 2243(d) expressly provide that \"the Government need not prove that the defendant knew\" the age of the minor, the absence of such a provision in \u00a7 2244(b) indicates that Congress intended that the government must prove that the defendant knew that sexual contact was without permission.

Thus, Congress's decision to expressly eliminate the mens rea requirements in \u00a7 2241 and \u00a7 2243 is not instructive of the proper interpretation of \u00a7 2244(b). Sections 2241 and 2243, with their harsh sentencing maximums, require the explicit statement that \"the Government need not prove that the defendant knew\" the age of the minor victim in order to overcome the strong presumption \"that Congress did not intend to eliminate a\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    Staples\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147026\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/600/#p605\">\n    511 U.S. at 618\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147026\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/600/#p605\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 2244(b) does not give rise to the same strong presumption because its violation bears a dramatically less severe consequence. Moreover, \u00a7 2243(c) provides that mistake about age can be a defense, making \u00a7 2243(d) necessary to clarify that knowledge of age is not an element. Therefore, Congress's decision not to explicitly eliminate the knowledge requirement in \u00a7 2244(b) is of no import. It would have been redundant to do so because it was already clear from the language of the statute itself, together with its relatively light penal consequence, that the government need not prove knowledge as to the second element.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Furthermore, Price's logic would produce absurd results in interpreting \u00a7 2244 as a whole. Subsection 2244(c) provides that, \"If the sexual contact that violates this section (other than subsection (a)(5)) is with an individual who has not attained the age of 12 years, the maximum term of imprisonment that may be imposed for the offense shall be twice that otherwise provided in this section.\" That the only mens rea requirement in \u00a7 2244(a) and (b) is the defendant's knowing engagement in sexual contact is only bolstered by \u00a7 2244(c)'s omission of any explicit provision that the\n   defendant need not know the person was under the age of twelve.

However, Price's questions were all directed towards clarifying whether or not he was actually under arrest.

Price mischaracterizes the record of the interview. S.A. Gates never threatened Price with his power to detain him unless he answered S.A. Gates's questions. It is evident from the record that S.A. Gates stated in a jocular manner that he could find a reason to arrest Price if Price wanted-a joke that elicited Price's laughter-and S.A. Gates explained that it was his expectation that Price would \"walk out of here\" that day. The interview does not reveal any sign of coercion: Price was not in handcuffs or otherwise physically restrained, and the FBI agents asked Price if he was doing okay and if he needed water or to use the bathroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to read back A.M.'s testimony when requested by the jury.

First, it cited the logistical difficulties in preparing a readback, and second, it\n   expressed concern that reading back A.M.'s testimony without also reading back Price's testimony would lead to an unfair focus on one part of the trial over others. We have determined that the district court's rationale is appropriate as a basis for declining a readback of testimony.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Medina Casteneda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4067779\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/511/1246/#p1249\">\n    511 F.3d at 1249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding no abuse of discretion in the district court's denial of the jury's request for a readback because of the concern that the jury would focus on \"one particular piece of evidence at the expense of other evidence\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In enacting the Sexual Abuse Act of 1986, of which\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) is a part, Congress sought to expand criminal culpability for sexual acts and contacts and facilitate prosecution of those crimes.

The statute, in other words, does not criminalize otherwise innocent sexual contact based on a fact-the lack of permission-unknown to the defendant. That the defendant knew he lacked permission may be proved by circumstantial evidence but, nevertheless, the defendant's subjective knowledge is an issue to be resolved by the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Accordingly, the district court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that such knowledge was necessary to convict Price under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

In\n   <em>\n    Bruguier\n   </em>\n   , the dissent identified three aspects of the text of \u00a7 2242(2) that, it argued, counseled against applying the\n   <em>\n    Flores-Figueroa\n   </em>\n   presumption: (1) \"[t]he requirement of 'knowingly' is ... set apart by two sets of interruptive punctuation\" from the element at issue, (2) the relevant elements in \u00a7 2242(2) are contained in a \"conditional 'if' clause,\" and (3) the relevant elements in \u00a7 2242(2) are contained in \"separate subsections describing the victim's condition.\"\n   <em>\n    Bruguier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3721206\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/735/754/#p761\">\n    735 F.3d at 775-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Murphy, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).

Innocent people do it all the time. The element in \u00a7 2244(b) requiring that the sexual contact be \"without [the] other person's permission\" is the actual linchpin of the offense. Therefore, if \u00a7 2244(b) requires a guilty mind, then the mens rea requirement must apply to the lack-of-permission element. The requirement that the defendant knew that he was engaging in sexual contact per se does nothing to separate innocent from criminal behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Nor does the requirement that the government prove that the sexual contact was\n   <em>\n    objectively\n   </em>\n   without the other person's permission obviate the need for a second mens rea requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lead Op. 785-86.

Several other provisions were also adopted as part of this same Act, including \u00a7 2242 (the statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    Bruguier\n   </em>\n   ), \u00a7 2241, and \u00a7 2243. Each of these sections addresses forms of sexual assault within certain extended federal jurisdictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Most important to our analysis in this case are \u00a7 2241(c) and \u00a7 2243(a), which deal with sexual acts that are criminal due to the other person's age. Section 2241(c) applies to anyone who, in certain extended federal jurisdictions, \"knowingly engages in a sexual act with another person who has not attained the age of 12 years,\" while \u00a7 2243(a) applies to anyone who, in certain extended federal jurisdictions, \"knowingly engages in a sexual act with another person who-(1) has attained the age of 12 years but has not attained the age of 16 years; and (2) is at least four years younger than the person so engaging.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   As the Eighth Circuit explained in exhaustive detail when comparing \u00a7 2242(2) to \u00a7 2241(c) and \u00a7 2243(a), the structure of the three provisions is very similar: each bars knowingly engaging in a sexual act when certain circumstances are also present. Section 2244(b), the statute in question here, follows the same structure as the other three sections, although it addresses sexual contact rather than sexual acts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The overall structure of these interrelated statutes reflects Congress's understanding that, unless expressly limited, the \"knowingly\" mens rea requirements would apply to all the elements of the offense and not to only the sexual act itself, or else Congress would not have included limits on the mens rea requirement in \u00a7 2241(d) and \u00a7 2243(d). This understanding is apparent not only from the text, but is also expressly stated in the legislative history. In explaining why \u00a7 2241(d) was included in the statute, for example, the House Report states that \"[a]bsent this provision, the government would have had to prove that the defendant knew that a victim was less than 12 years old, since the state of mind required for the conduct-knowing-is also required for the circumstance of the victim's age.\" H.R.

Section 2244(b), the lead opinion argues, does not give rise to the same strong presumption because of its less severe penalties. Lead Op. 785-86. The lead opinion also distinguished the Eighth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Bruguier\n   </em>\n   on those grounds because \u00a7 2242(2), the statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    Bruguier\n   </em>\n   , \"has a severe maximum penalty of life imprisonment, unlike \u00a7 2244(b).\" Lead Op. 788 n.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   But the lead opinion suggests that the presumption that \"some indication of congressional\n   intent, express or implied, is required to dispense with mens rea as an element of a crime,\"\n   <em>\n    Staples v.

If that were the rule, then courts would have to determine what constitutes a \"high penalty\" versus a \"low penalty\" in all these type of cases. Surely a defendant charged with a violation of \u00a7 2244(b), which carries a penalty of up to two years of imprisonment, would argue that a two-year term of imprisonment is a very high penalty for an offense where, according to the lead opinion, there is no mens rea required for the element of the offense that turns otherwise legal conduct into a crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The lead opinion also attempts to use the difference in penalties to suggest that requiring the government to prove that a defendant knew that he lacked permission to engage in sexual contact under \u00a7 2244(b) would produce an absurd result. Lead Op. 788-89. It notes that \u00a7 2244(c), which provides that \"[i]f the sexual contact that violates this section ... is with an individual who has not attained the age of 12 years, the maximum term of imprisonment that may be imposed for the offense shall be twice that otherwise provided in this section,\" does not contain any explicit provision disposing of a mens rea requirement regarding the victim's age. The lead opinion therefore argues that, under my reading of the statute, the government must prove that the defendant knew that the child was under 12 years old in order to obtain a \u00a7 2244(c) conviction. Because \u00a7 2244(c) has less severe penalties than \u00a7 2241(c) and \u00a7 2243(a), and because the latter two statutes explicitly eliminate a mens rea requirement regarding the victim's age, the lead opinion argues that Congress could not have intended to impose the extra mens rea requirement on defendants charged with violations of the less serious penalties under \u00a7 2244(c). Lead Op. 788-89.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   But the less severe penalties of \u00a7 2244(c) are explainable regardless of its mens rea requirement. This is because \u00a7 2244 criminalizes certain sexual\n   <em>\n    contact\n   </em>\n   , whereas \u00a7 2241 and \u00a7 2243 criminalize certain sexual\n   <em>\n    acts\n   </em>\n   . \"Sexual contact\" means \"the intentional touching, either directly or through the clothing, of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202246\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3).

The difference in penalties between \u00a7 2244(c), \u00a7 2241(c), and \u00a7 2243(a) is therefore warranted, and requiring the government to prove the defendant's\n   knowledge of the victim's age for a conviction under \u00a7 2244(c) but not under the other two statutes would not produce an absurd result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Finally, the lead opinion compares \u00a7 2244(a) and \u00a7 2244(b) in an attempt to demonstrate that the statutory scheme supports its conclusion. Both \u00a7 2244(a) and \u00a7 2244(b) require that the defendant \"knowingly\" have \"sexual contact\" plus one additional element. In \u00a7 2244(a), the additional element that the government must prove is that the sexual contact would be punishable by another delineated statute if the sexual contact had instead been a sexual act; in \u00a7 2244(b) -the statute under which Price was convicted-the additional element is a lack of permission. The lead opinion argues that because the government is not required to prove that the defendant knew that the second element of \u00a7 2244(a) -that the sexual contact he engaged in would have been punished by another law if the contact was a sexual act-was met, the government is also not required to prove that the defendant knew that the second element of \u00a7 2244(b) -a lack of permission-was met. Lead Op. 786-88.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   But that argument overlooks the longstanding distinction between knowledge of the underlying criminal law and knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense.

United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147026\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/600/#p605\">\n    511 U.S. 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 618-19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147026\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/600/#p605\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147026\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/600/#p605\">\n    128 L.Ed.2d 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994) (\"[W]here ... dispensing with mens rea would require the defendant to have knowledge only of traditionally lawful conduct, ... the usual presumption that a defendant must know the facts that make his conduct illegal should apply.\"). I therefore find the lead opinion's comparison of \u00a7 2244(a) and \u00a7 2244(b) unpersuasive, and conclude that the statutory scheme at hand requires that the \"knowingly\" mens rea requirement of \u00a7 2244(b) be applied to the lack-of-permission element of the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   In further support of its argument, the lead opinion highlights two statements from the House Report on the Sexual Abuse Act of 1986 bill. First, the lead opinion says that Congress expected that the Act would \"simplify law enforcement activities.\" Lead Op. 789 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 99-594, at 21 (1986)). But that statement has been taken out of context. The House Report does not indicate that Congress sought to achieve the goal of \"simplifying law enforcement activities\" by eliminating mens rea requirements from certain subsections of the statute. Instead, the Report says that the Act \"may simplify law enforcement activities\" by \"provid[ing] much more specific definitions of federal sexual abuse offenses ... [and] mak[ing] conforming amendments to a number of other statutes that currently refer to rape.\" H.R. Rep. No. 99-594, at 21. The Report says nothing about the mens rea issue in question here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The second statement from the House Report that the lead opinion relies on provides that \"[w]here the Committee believes it appropriate to the offense to require the prosecution to show that the conduct was engaged in without the victim's permission, such a requirement has explicitly been set\n   forth.\" Lead Op. 789 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 99-594, at 13 ). But that statement says nothing about\n   <em>\n    the defendant's knowledge\n   </em>\n   \"that the conduct was engaged in without the victim's permission.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.R. Rep. No. 99-594, at 13. And only two paragraphs later, the Report explains that proposed \u00a7 2243(d)\"sets forth a proof requirement concerning the defendant's state of mind [because t]he Committee does not ... believe a corroboration requirement is justified and has, therefore, intentionally not imposed such a requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. The Report, in contrast, says nothing about \"a proof requirement concerning the defendant's state of mind\" for \u00a7 2244(b). In fact, nothing in the hearings or reports on the Act suggests that any of the participants in its passage had any intention of making\n   <extracted-citation index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) a strict-liability offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Other parts of the legislative history actively undermine the lead opinion's interpretation of the statute. The House Report, for example, explains that \"[the Sexual Abuse Act of 1986 was] drafted employing the format, conventions and techniques used in drafting the Criminal Code Revision Act of 1980.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 13 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 96-1396 (1980)). One such convention was that, \"[t]he state of mind required for conduct will apply to circumstances and results unless otherwise specified. This rule makes it unnecessary to distinguish among the components of an offense (conduct, circumstances and results) in order to determine the applicable state of mind.\" H.R. Rep. No. 96-1396, at 34. The lead opinion's argument that \"knowingly\" applies only to the element of sexual contact, but not to the element of lack of permission, is contrary to this understanding that mens rea would apply equally to every element of the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Rather than confronting the stark difference between the provisions adopted as part of the same Act, the lead opinion instead attributes a broad intention to Congress's goal of modernizing sexual assault laws \"to focus on the defendant's conduct\" rather than the victim's state of mind. Lead Op. 781. But the goal of focusing on the defendant's conduct rather than the victim's state of mind does not support the lead opinion's position. Price asks us to hold that the government must prove that he knew he was engaging in sexual contact without A.M.'s permission. Reading the statute to include that requirement advances the goal that the government attributes to Congress: it focuses on the defendant's conduct rather than the victim's state of mind. Requiring the government to prove something about\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   's state of mind at the time of his offensive conduct does nothing to implicate the\n   <em>\n    victim\n   </em>\n   's state of mind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   As a final thought on this issue, I address the lead opinion's contention that \"[i]f the government were required to prove that the defendant subjectively knew he lacked consent, as Price urges here, every accused sexual predator could defend his admitted sexual contact in the face of no objective sign of permission by asserting a supposed subjective belief that the victim was 'enjoying herself.' \" Lead Op. 781. The government made a similar statement at oral argument, contending that a knowledge requirement would allow defendants to avoid conviction under this statute simply by \"get[ting] up on the stand and say[ing], 'Oh, I didn't know.' \" But the defendant's subjective knowledge is and always has been an extremely common requirement in criminal statutes, one that the government is almost always required to prove. It typically does this by circumstantial evidence and by asking the jury to reject what the government views as self-serving and incredible claims of innocence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The criminal system has hardly ground to a halt as a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   In sum, under the interpretive rule recognized in\n   <em>\n    Flores-Figueroa\n   </em>\n   , the plain text of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) applies the \"knowingly\" requirement to each element of the offense, including that the sexual contact be without the other person's permission. That interpretation is not rebutted by any special context; in fact, the context of the Sexual Abuse Act of 1986 strongly reaffirms the conclusion that \"knowingly\" applies to every element. I would therefore hold that the \"knowingly\" requirement applies to the element of the sexual contact being without the other person's permission. Section 2244(b)'s language and the context provided by the other related provisions compel this result. The legislative history and the weighty presumption against strict-liability offenses further support my conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Despite my disagreement with the lead opinion's analysis of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), I join its ultimate conclusion for a totally different reason-that the district court's error in relieving the government of its need to prove that Price subjectively knew he lacked A.M.'s permission to engage in sexual contact with her was harmless. \"An error in criminal jury instructions requires reversal unless there is no reasonable possibility that the error materially affected the verdict or, in other words, that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Pierre\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11091941\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/254/872/#p877\">\n    254 F.3d 872\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 877 (9th Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). In the district court's instructions to the jury, it defined \"permission\" as \"[t]he act of permitting, a license or liberty to do something, or authorization,\" explaining that permission can be express or implied, and explaining that implied permission \"means permission that is inferred from words or actions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Price conceded that A.M. never gave him\n   <em>\n    explicit\n   </em>\n   permission to touch her breasts or vagina. The only remaining question is whether there is any reasonable possibility that the jury could have found that Price subjectively believed he had A.M.'s\n   <em>\n    implicit\n   </em>\n   permission to engage in sexual contact with her. In light of the strong circumstantial evidence showing that Price had to have known that A.M. had not consented to his advances, the answer is no.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   By convicting Price, the jury determined that he in fact lacked both explicit and implicit permission to touch A.M.'s breasts and vagina. The jury therefore believed A.M.'s story of what occurred on the flight over Price's story. And according to that story, A.M. was asleep when Price began running his hand up and down her side and her leg. A sleeping person clearly gives no implicit permission to be touched. A.M. then moved her cell phone, thinking that Price might have been trying to steal it, and fell back asleep. She woke up once again when he began touching her breast. In response, A.M. put a blanket over her shoulder and crossed her arms in front of her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   These actions, if anything, negate any implicit permission to be touched. Yet Price continued to touch A.M.'s breast and then moved his hand down to her legs, first over her jeans and finally inside of them, touching her vagina. In a state of shock, panic, and fear, and in a final effort to ward off Price, she turned her body away from him and towards her friend Fujita. Despite A.M.'s negative reaction to Price's advances, she testified that he \"tried to move my body towards\" him \"[w]ith strong force\" and tried to pull her jeans down. A.M., moreover, never spoke to Price while he was touching her nor\n   even looked at him during their encounter. Under all of these circumstances, no reasonable juror could have found that Price subjectively believed that he had permission to touch A.M., especially once A.M. physically turned her back to him and towards her friend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Price's statements after the incident further support a finding that he knew he lacked permission to touch A.M. He said that he \"knew ... it was wrong\" to be \"engaging like this with somebody who is totally a stranger\" without first having had a \"proper conversation.\" Price also agreed with Special Agent Gates, the FBI agent who interviewed Price, that, at his age, he should have known that it was his \"job not to touch\" A.M. without her permission. And finally, when the customs officers searched Price's bags, they found a note that read: \"If a man touches you and you don't want him to always feel free to say no.\" Price said that he wrote the note to A.M. after she got up and left her seat, indicating that he knew A.M. had not given him permission to touch her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   I would therefore hold that the error in the district court's jury instructions was harmless because \"it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found the defendant guilty absent the error.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Anchrum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3503524\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/590/795/#p801\">\n    590 F.3d 795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 801 (9th Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). The government's evidence, which the jury had to believe in order to find Price guilty, overwhelmingly demonstrated that Price knew that he lacked permission to engage in sexual contact with A.M.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
