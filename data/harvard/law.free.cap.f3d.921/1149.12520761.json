U.S.S.G. supp. app. C amend. 788 (Nov. 1, 2014). Pursuant to Amendment 782, the quantity of actual methamphetamine that triggers the maximum base offense level of 38 moved from 1.5 kilograms to 4.5 kilograms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(a)(5), (c)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2011, the California Highway Patrol conducted a traffic stop of Emilio Huaracha Rodriguez, a suspected drug trafficker, in Sacramento County. A drug detection dog alerted to Rodriguez's vehicle, and a search revealed 11 pounds (roughly 4.9 kilograms or 4,989 grams) of methamphetamine. After a search of Rodriguez's vehicle, law enforcement officers obtained a search warrant for his apartment. There, the officers found an additional quantity of methamphetamine and various types of drug paraphernalia. Rodriguez was charged with one count of possession with intent to distribute over 500 grams of methamphetamine mixture or substance, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In January 2012, Rodriguez pleaded guilty pursuant to a written plea agreement. As the factual basis for his guilty plea, Rodriguez admitted to \"knowingly possess[ing] over 500 grams of a mixture or substance that contained a detectable amount of methamphetamine ... with the intent to deliver it to another person\" and further stipulated to the maximum base offense level of 38. The factual basis also specified that law enforcement seized 11 pounds of methamphetamine from Rodriguez's vehicle and that the methamphetamine \"was laboratory tested and found to contain over 1,500 grams of actual methamphetamine.\" At his plea colloquy, Rodriguez confirmed that \"each and every fact\" in the factual basis was \"true and correct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The PSR prepared for Rodriguez's sentencing stated that he \"possessed approximately 4.8 kilograms of methamphetamine (actual) in his vehicle\" and \"186 grams of a\n   mixture of methamphetamine at his residence.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the amount of methamphetamine mixture in his residence was a relatively small quantity, the PSR disregarded it for purposes of calculating his base offense level. On the basis of the quantity of methamphetamine in his vehicle alone, which \"involved 1.5 kilograms or more of methamphetamine (actual),\" the PSR recommended the highest base offense level for drug-related offenses, level 38. The PSR further determined that Rodriguez had a Category II criminal history,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1, and recommended a three-level reduction for accepting responsibility and cooperating with authorities. The PSR calculations yielded a total offense level of 35 and a Guidelines range of 188 to 235 months imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Rodriguez's sole objection to the PSR, lodged before sentencing, was that the PSR overstated his criminal history. Neither Rodriguez nor the government contested the PSR's findings regarding the quantity of methamphetamine attributable to Rodriguez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At sentencing, the judge concluded that the PSR did overstate Rodriguez's criminal history and so departed slightly from the recommended Guidelines range, imposing a sentence commensurate with a Category I criminal history.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b). Aside from that slight departure, the sentencing judge \"agree[d] with the justifications set forth in the [PSR].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rodriguez was sentenced to 168 months imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In May 2016, Rodriguez filed a pro se \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction motion. The motion was assigned to his original sentencing judge. The following year, with the assistance of later-appointed counsel, Rodriguez filed an amended motion for sentence reduction. Rodriguez seeks to reduce his base offense level from 38 to 36, the level corresponding to 1.5 kilograms of methamphetamine under Amendment 782, which after the three-level reduction from original sentencing would result in a total offense level of 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At Rodriguez's sentence reduction hearing in May 2017, the district court assumed that he had generally adopted the findings in Rodriguez's PSR at the original sentencing hearing. The government argued that the uncontested drug quantities used in the calculations in Rodriguez's PSR, 4.8 kilograms and 186 grams of methamphetamine, controlled. Consequently, the government maintained, Rodriguez was ineligible for sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), because the PSR's drug quantity would not lower Rodriguez's Guidelines range. Rodriguez argued to the contrary-that the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   finding at the original sentencing hearing was that he possessed\n   <em>\n    at least\n   </em>\n   1.5 kilograms of methamphetamine, which is not a finding as to a drug quantity that makes Rodriguez ineligible for sentence reduction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The district court accepted Rodriguez's argument, agreeing that it had not made a disqualifying drug quantity finding at the original sentencing by adopting the PSR's findings. The court concluded that Rodriguez\n   was eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction and reduced Rodriguez's sentence from 168 months to 151 months. In so ruling, the court did not engage in supplemental fact-finding to determine the drug quantity actually attributable to Rodriguez. The government's appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We review a district court's \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction decision for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

First, it contends that the uncontested drug quantities in Rodriguez's court-adopted PSR are binding drug quantity findings for purposes of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and that those quantities render Rodriguez ineligible for a sentence reduction. Second, the government maintains that the district court was required to determine whether Rodriguez is more likely than not responsible for a drug quantity that meets the new quantity threshold under Amendment 782. We address each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Relying on our decision in\n   <em>\n    Mercado-Moreno\n   </em>\n   , the government argues that the drug quantities in Rodriguez's PSR-4.8 kilograms of methamphetamine from his vehicle and 186 grams of methamphetamine mixture from his residence-were binding on the district court in considering Rodriguez's \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction motion. Based on this understanding, the government contends that Rodriguez is ineligible for a sentence reduction at the first step of the inquiry, as the PSR's drug quantities generate the same base offense level under Amendment 782 as previously, and thus would not have the effect of lowering his Guidelines range.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The government's reading of\n   <em>\n    Mercado-Moreno\n   </em>\n   is flawed. A close reading of that opinion compels the opposite conclusion. Under\n   <em>\n    Mercado-Moreno\n   </em>\n   , drug quantities in a generically adopted PSR are not binding on district courts in subsequent \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Mercado-Moreno was charged with one count of conspiring to manufacture and distribute 50 grams or more of methamphetamine, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), 846.\n   <em>\n    Mercado-Moreno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266567\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/942/#p948\">\n    869 F.3d at 950\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

A sentencing judge's generic adoption of a PSR (or an adoption of its justifications) does not fall into either category. We therefore decline, as\n   <em>\n    Mercado-Moreno\n   </em>\n   instructs, to transform statements of generic adoption of a PSR into binding, specific determinations as to particular drug quantities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Notably,\n   <em>\n    Mercado-Moreno\n   </em>\n   concluded that the government had not waived its argument for a higher drug quantity finding by failing to object at the original sentencing, because it did not have an incentive to prove a higher amount at the time and did not \"knowingly relinquish[ ] the unforeseeable necessity to argue a higher amount later on.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 959 n.9. Similarly, in many instances, the PSR's account of drug quantity will not affect the defendant's Guidelines range, providing little incentive to the defendant to contest the asserted amount or to the sentencing judge to focus on whether the PSR's asserted amount is accurate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The district court's ruling now before us reflects this dynamic. The district court apparently did not view the earlier generic adoption of the PSR as a ruling on the specific quantity of drugs Rodriguez possessed, presumably because it had no reason to focus on the precise quantity at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   To be clear, we do not suggest that judges are required at the original sentencing to make findings of drug quantity beyond what is required to determine the applicable Guidelines range at the time. To the contrary, sentencing judges may make general findings of drug quantity by adopting the PSRs. In some instances, such a general adoption of the findings will be preferable, particularly where a defendant admits to a general drug quantity\n   that meets the threshold for a Guidelines base offense level and any plausible specific finding would not alter that level. In that circumstance, any specific finding could be superfluous to the sentencing result.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is always possible, of course, that, as here, the Guidelines drug quantity threshold could be altered after the original sentencing. But there is no need routinely to anticipate that possibility-which may never come to pass-in the original sentencing proceeding. As we shall explain, supplemental fact-findings as part of any future \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings are available and suffice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Applying\n   <em>\n    Mercado-Moreno\n   </em>\n   to Rodriguez, we conclude that neither required circumstance for a binding determination occurred. The sentencing judge at the initial sentencing did not make a specific finding of drug quantity, and Rodriguez did not admit to a specific drug quantity beyond the quantity necessary to determine the appropriate Guidelines range.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Under\n   <em>\n    Mercado-Moreno\n   </em>\n   , the drug quantities in the court-adopted PSR-4.8 kilograms of methamphetamine and 186 grams of methamphetamine mixture-do not constitute specific drug quantity findings and so are not binding for purposes of applying \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Accordingly, there were no binding drug quantity findings or admissions of a specific quantity at Rodriguez's original sentencing that bound the district court at the later \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The government further contends that the district court should have determined whether the drug quantity attributable to Rodriguez satisfied the new drug quantity threshold for offense base level 38 under Amendment 782. On that point, we agree with the government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As we have explained, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) established a two-step inquiry for determining whether a defendant is entitled to a sentence reduction. The first step, which determines eligibility, requires the district court to determine whether the Amendment invoked has the \"effect of lowering the defendant's applicable [G]uideline[s] range.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). This step necessarily requires a finding of the drug quantity attributable to the defendant sufficient to \"determine whether the defendant is more likely than not responsible for the new quantity threshold under\n   the retroactive Guidelines amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Mercado-Moreno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266567\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/942/#p948\">\n    869 F.3d at 957\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Without such a finding, there is no way for a district court to determine whether the amendment would lower the defendant's Guidelines range.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   If the district court at the original sentencing did not make a specific drug quantity finding, as we have concluded in this situation here, the proper course is for the district court to engage in supplemental fact-finding to determine whether the defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . At that stage, as\n   <em>\n    Mercado-Moreno\n   </em>\n   explained, the district court\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   take into account the drug quantity attributed to the defendant in a court-adopted PSR, as well as the trial and sentencing transcripts.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Here, the district court concluded that no specific findings of drug quantity had been made at the original sentencing. But then, instead of conducting supplemental fact-finding and determining whether the drug quantity attributable to Rodriguez meets the new quantity threshold for the Guidelines range, the district court simply granted Rodriguez's \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction motion. The district court erred in doing so. It was required first to determine whether Rodriguez was more likely than not responsible for a drug quantity that meets Amendment 782's quantity threshold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   We\n   <strong>\n    REVERSE\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    REMAND\n   </strong>\n   for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2) is being challenged in a number of pending cases,\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     United States v.

And, because Amendment 782 would have lowered the defendant's base offense level only if the quantity of actual methamphetamine attributable to the defendant was less than 4.5 kilograms, it was necessary for the district court to make supplemental findings as to the quantity of manufactured methamphetamine before it could decide whether the defendant was eligible for a sentence reduction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266567\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/942/#p948\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 958-59 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. supp. app. C, amend. 782 (Nov. 1, 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In this case, the record shows that the sentencing court made a specific finding regarding the total quantity of methamphetamine for which Rodriguez was responsible. The district court reviewed the presentence investigation report (\"PSR\") prepared by the probation department prior\n   to sentencing Rodriguez. Paragraph 11 of the PSR calculated Rodriguez's base offense level under the Guidelines. It provided in part,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   the defendant possessed approximately 4.8 kilograms of methamphetamine (actual) in his vehicle. He also had 186 grams of a mixture of methamphetamine at his residence. While the overall conspiracy involved much larger quantities of methamphetamine, the defendant's relevant conduct is limited to these amounts. USSG 2D1.1(c)(1) establishes a base offense level of 38, the highest available under USSG 2D1.1, if the offense involved 1.5 kilograms or more of methamphetamine (actual). Since the defendant possessed 4.8 kilograms of methamphetamine (actual) in his vehicle, the 186 grams of methamphetamine mixture is of such a small quantity that it will not be included, as it will not affect the guideline computation. A base offense level of 38 is recommended.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   At sentencing, neither Rodriguez nor the government objected to the drug quantities listed in the PSR. The judge stated that he \"agree[d] with the justifications set forth in the presentence report\" and adopted the PSR's recommended base offense level. The PSR's only justification for its base offense level was that Rodriguez \"possessed approximately 4.8 kilograms of methamphetamine (actual).\" By explicitly relying upon the PSR's justification, the sentencing judge necessarily determined that Rodriguez was responsible for the 4.8 kilograms of methamphetamine (actual) before imposing the original sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Thus, when subsequently considering Rodriguez's eligibility for a sentencing reduction, I believe the district court was bound to use the 4.8 kilograms. And, because this still triggers the maximum base offense level of 38, Amendment 782 does not lower Rodriguez's Guideline range and he is ineligible for a sentence reduction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. supp. app. C, amend. 782 (Nov. 1, 2014);\n   <em>\n    Mercado-Moreno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266567\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/942/#p948\">\n    869 F.3d at 957\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
