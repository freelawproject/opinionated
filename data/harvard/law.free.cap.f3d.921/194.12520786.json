The district court denied their motion, however, concluding that \"special circumstances\" justified the denial of fees because the County Board, even though responsible for enforcing the unconstitutional law, had no hand in enacting the law and did not defend it during the litigation. The court reasoned that because the County Board was an \"innocent\" or \"non-responsible\" party and the Citizens should have sued the State of North Carolina, any award assessed against the County Board would be \"unjust.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Citizens filed this appeal, arguing that the district court erred in denying their motion based on the County Board's \"innocence\" or \"non-responsibility.\" The Citizens point out that they were the prevailing party, having succeeded in demonstrating that the redistricting law was unconstitutional and in obtaining full relief with the entry of a permanent injunction prohibiting the County Board's enforcement of the law. They argue that under established precedent, a party enjoined from enforcing an unconstitutional law, even if it did not enact or defend the law, is legally responsible for attorney's fees under \u00a7 1988 and \u00a7 10310(e).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Indep.

Accordingly, we reverse the district court's order denying the Citizens' motion for attorney's fees, expert fees, and costs and remand for the determination of an appropriate fee award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The City of Greensboro and eight of its voting Citizens\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n   commenced this action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , challenging the constitutionality of a state-enacted local law - 2015 N.C. Session Law 138 (\"the Redistricting Act\") - that (1) changed\n   Greensboro's City Council from three at-large and five single-district members to eight single-district members; (2) drew the boundaries of the eight new districts; and (3) prohibited City Council or citizen-led referendums or initiatives from altering the structure of the City's government. The plaintiffs named the Guilford County Board of Elections as the defendant, as the County Board was responsible for conducting municipal elections in Greensboro and had the duty of enforcing the Redistricting Act, making it a necessary party to any action challenging enforcement of the Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wright v.

In their complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that the Redistricting Act violated the Equal Protection Clause and sought a permanent injunction against its enforcement. They did not, however, name the North Carolina General Assembly and the North Carolina Attorney General as defendants, believing them to be immune under the Eleventh Amendment, but those state representatives had notice of the action and chose not to intervene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A month after this action was commenced, several Greensboro residents filed a motion to intervene as defendants to support the Redistricting Act, and the district court granted their motion. Several months later, these defendant-intervenors filed a motion to dismiss the action for failure to join necessary parties or, in the alternative, to require that those parties be joined, contending that the State of North Carolina, the North Carolina State Board of Elections, the State Board's Executive Director, and the Governor were all necessary parties. Both the City of Greensboro and the Citizens opposed the motion, arguing that all of the parties sought to be joined were immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment and that none were necessary for the relief sought. The County Board took no position on the motion. The district court denied the motion, concluding that \"while some of these persons and entities might well be proper parties ... none [were] necessary parties.\" The defendant-intervenors subsequently filed a motion to withdraw from the litigation, and the court granted their motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following a bench trial, during which the County Board took no position on the constitutionality of the Redistricting Act, the district court found that the Act violated the Equal Protection Clause and, by order dated April 13, 2017, permanently enjoined the County Board from enforcing it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As prevailing parties, the eight Citizens, but not the City of Greensboro, then filed a motion under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010310\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) for an award of attorney's fees, expert fees, and costs.

They note that the district court found as its reasons for the denial of fees (1) that the County Board was an \"innocent party\" and was \"not responsible\" for enacting the Redistricting Act, did not defend it, and participated minimally in the litigation and (2) that the Citizens chose to sue only the County Board and not the State or its\n   representatives.

The Citizens also contend that the fact that they sued only the County Board and not the State has no \"bearing on whether they are entitled to fees.\" For these reasons, they argue that the district court's opinion is an outlier decision, standing apart from the \"near-unanimous precedent[s]\" on the subject, and therefore should be reversed for abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In its Memorandum Opinion and Order denying the Citizens a fee award, the district court observed that the North Carolina General Assembly, not the County Board, enacted the unconstitutional Redistricting Act. It reasoned therefore that because the blame for the Act's unconstitutionality lay with the State, the Citizens' fees should be paid by the State, not the County Board. Although the court recognized that the state defendants would possibly enjoy sovereign immunity, it noted that such immunity is \"an affirmative defense that [could] be waived.\" The court ultimately concluded that \"an award of attorney's fees against a defendant who was not responsible and did not defend the act would, in these circumstances, provide a perverse incentive to plaintiffs to avoid suing responsible entities in favor of a non-responsible entity, especially if that entity is unlikely to contest relief.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In reaching this conclusion, however, the district court seemed to have doubts about denying the Citizens their fees, suggesting that both parties were entitled to win on the motion and that the court was therefore presented with \"a dilemma\" on how to rule. While it recognized that if it denied the Citizens' motion, their counsel would \"not receive compensation ordinarily authorized by federal law, despite vindicating constitutional rights,\" it nonetheless decided to \"leav[e] the individual [Citizens] to bear their own costs\" as the \"lesser of these two unjust results.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As an initial matter, it is of little or no import that the County Board was not involved in enacting the Redistricting Act. The relevant facts are that the County Board\n   <em>\n    was charged with enforcing the Act\n   </em>\n   and that the Citizens\n   <em>\n    obtained full relief\n   </em>\n   against the County Board. Suits seeking injunctions against enforcement entities are the standard means by which laws are challenged on constitutional grounds. As the Supreme Court has noted, \"[f]ee awards\n   <em>\n    against enforcement officials\n   </em>\n   are run-of-the-mill occurrences, even though, on occasion, had a state legislature acted or reacted in a different or more timely manner, there would have been no need for a lawsuit or for an injunction.\"\n   <em>\n    Supreme Court of Va. v.

This district court, acting in line with the text of this statute as well as precedent, concluded that awarding fees would work a greater injustice than not awarding fees under these special circumstances. Though I may not have reached the same conclusion, I must still respect the district judge's finding. For that reason, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Plaintiffs stress that as a factual matter judges rarely deny attorney's fees in these cases.

While\n    <em>\n     Chastang\n    </em>\n    certainly acknowledged the relevance of the timing of the plan's amendment to comply with the law going forward, the amendment did nothing to eliminate the need for the lawsuit to recover past damages. Along with the defendant's good faith and prompt amendment to the unconstitutional plan, we found something \"more\" that justified denying fees. We noted that the defendant company (1) did not violate the law when it first established the retirement plan, (2) had no \"unrestricted right\" to amend the plan, (3) acted \"with reasonable dispatch as soon as a murky area of the law was clarified,\" (4) \"unintentional[ly]\" violated the law, (5) \"had no pecuniary interest in the fund,\" meaning it \"had no economic incentive\" to violate the law, and (6) \"more importantly, it had no right unilaterally to alter the schedule of benefits for participants in the plan.\"\n    <em>\n     Chastang\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1034973\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/541/1040/\">\n     541 F.2d at 1045\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
