Because the Arkansas Supreme Court previously had upheld a robbery conviction \"where there was no threat of force and no actual injury,\" this court held that \"the degree of physical force required to commit robbery in Arkansas\" does not rise \"to the level of physical force required to establish a crime of violence for ACCA purposes.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Eason\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340009\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/633/\">\n    829 F.3d at 641-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Eason\n   </em>\n   does not control the analysis here where the question concerns the enumerated clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a). Stovall's reasoning conflates the issues of (1) whether a conviction is a violent felony under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e), with (2) whether a conviction is an enumerated offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2. The inquiry here is not whether the conviction involved the threat or use of \"violent force,\" but rather whether the conviction is one for theft involving \"immediate danger.\" The terms \"violent force\" and \"immediate danger\" are not synonymous.
