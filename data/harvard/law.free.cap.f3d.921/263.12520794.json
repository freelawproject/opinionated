Neither stepped foot in the United States, and they argue that the conspiracy crime does not have an extraterritorial reach. We conclude that Appellants are correct - at least with respect to conspiracy to\n   <em>\n    possess\n   </em>\n   with intent to distribute because the underlying crime is not extraterritorial. But an appraisal of the evidence indicates the error is harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We also reject Appellants' challenges to the district court's evidentiary rulings and remand to the district court for an evidentiary hearing on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We first encounter Appellants' argument that the conspiracy crime - without regard to the substantive crimes upon which the conspiracy is based - is not extraterritorial. The conspiracy provision states: \"Any person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in this subchapter shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20963\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Appellants brandish the long-held presumption that United States crimes do not have extraterritorial reach unless Congress provides a \"clear indication\" that such is intended.\n   <em>\n    Morrison v. Nat'l Austl. Bank Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455280,3644388\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/247/\">\n    561 U.S. 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 255,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455280,3644388\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/247/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455280,3644388\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/247/\">\n    177 L.Ed.2d 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). And it is correct that Congress did not specifically state that this conspiracy provision was extraterritorial. However, the conspiracy language and the substantive offenses were included in the same statute dealing with a common subject matter, the import and export of drugs. Although in a recent case dealing with a charge of conspiracy to commit piracy, we regarded the general federal conspiracy statute - not related to the subject of piracy - as lacking an adequate indication of extraterritoriality,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ali\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4050544,3664134\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/718/929/\">\n    718 F.3d 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 935-36 (D.C. Cir. 2013), in a subsequent case, we reiterated\n   <em>\n    Ali\n   </em>\n   's recognition that \"[g]enerally, the extraterritorial reach of [the] ancillary offense ... is coterminous with that of the underlying criminal statute.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Cir. 2015) (alterations in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ali\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4050544,3664134\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/718/929/\">\n    718 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   939 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Ballestas\n   </em>\n   , we distinguished\n   <em>\n    Ali\n   </em>\n   's treatment of conspiracy to commit piracy by emphasizing that a conspiracy to distribute drugs on board a United States vessel was in the same act, dealing with the same subject, as the underlying offense, which undeniably was extraterritorial. That was sufficient indication that Congress intended the conspiracy offense to be extraterritorial as well. The same analysis applies here - at least with respect to one of the substantive offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Now, we turn to the extraterritoriality of the substantive offenses in our case. The statute, in which Congress focused,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , on drug crimes in connection with airplanes, states: \"It shall be unlawful for any United States citizen on board any aircraft, or any person on board an aircraft owned by a United States citizen or registered in the United States, to - (1) manufacture or distribute a controlled substance or listed chemical; or (2) possess a controlled substance or listed chemical with intent to distribute.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20959\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Congress explicitly addressed the extraterritorial reach of these crimes in the very next provision, \u00a7 959(c) : \"Acts committed outside territorial jurisdiction of United States ... [.] This section is intended to reach acts of\n   <em>\n    manufacture\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    distribution\n   </em>\n   committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\" (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Here is the anomaly. Distribution and manufacture clearly have extraterritorial reach, so therefore a conspiracy to engage in either, according to our precedent, is extraterritorial as well. But the omission of the third crime, possession with intent to distribute, from the extraterritoriality provision could not be a more striking illustration of the interpretive maxim\n   <em>\n    expressio unius est exclusio alterius\n   </em>\n   . It certainly appears that Congress did not intend possession with intent to distribute to be extraterritorial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   To be sure, two of our sister circuits, in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Lawrence\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4077291\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/727/386/\">\n    727 F.3d 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2013) and\n   <em>\n    United States v. Epskamp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4351543\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/832/154/\">\n    832 F.3d 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2016), and our district court, in a previous opinion,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Bodye\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345722\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/172/15/\">\n    172 F.Supp.3d 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.D.C. 2016), concluded that, notwithstanding the language of the statute, Congress could not have intended to treat possession with intent to distribute only domestically. The distinction in \u00a7 959(c) is attributed to inadvertence or poor drafting (the possession provision was placed in the statute later) because our fellow judges could not imagine any reason for the separate treatment of possession. All three courts emphasized that possession with intent to distribute domestically was already illegal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The government reiterates reasoning drawn from these opinions. It attempts to create ambiguity where, in our view, none exists. The government argues that the words \"acts of\" before \"manufacture or distribution\" in \u00a7 959(c) suggest an intent to include in the word \"acts\" \"possession with intent to distribute\" because possession is an act antecedent to distribution. We think that is an unlikely reading - that the \"acts\" of distribution would include myriad preceding acts. It is also\n   asserted that the words \"[t]his section\" at the beginning of \u00a7 959(c) somehow imply that the whole section is extraterritorial. That is even less likely. As to the claim of superfluousness, we have previously said \"[u]nlike two provisions within a single statute, we need not construe separate statutes to avoid redundancy.\"\n   <em>\n    Bennett v. Islamic Republic of Iran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3554258,3775030\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/618/19/\">\n    618 F.3d 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 23 (D.C. Cir. 2010).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Finally, it is claimed that the venue wording supports the government's interpretation. That sentence of \u00a7 959(c) states: \"Any person who violates this section shall be tried in the United States district court at the point of entry\n   <em>\n    where such person enters the United States,\n   </em>\n   or in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added)\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   The reference to a district court \"at the point of entry\" certainly suggests extraterritoriality. But a reasonable reading of the sentence is that the point of entry and District of Columbia references apply only to the two extraterritorial crimes in the immediately preceding sentence, while the general federal venue rule and statute ( Fed. R. Crim. P. 18 ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203237\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) continue to apply to possession with intent to distribute - just as they continue to apply to manufacture and distribution when those crimes are committed domestically. This understanding may, at first glance, seem to be in tension with some of the wording. As the concurrence notes, the provision does refer to \"this section,\" which includes possession. But since the venue provision initially applied only to manufacture and distribution, it seems a reasonable reading of the statute that the venue sentence applies only to those extraterritorial crimes - and possession was not included because it can be tried in the relevant domestic location.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20959\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1970).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We simply do not understand our colleague's concern that our interpretation of the venue provision is not \"workable.\" She is troubled about a scenario in which possession with intent to distribute would be tried separately from distribution. Conc. Op. at 274. But she overlooks the crux of our opinion. In our view, the conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute charge at issue here is not a crime at all (because the acts charged occurred extraterritorially). Therefore, we do not see a problem in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Nor do we see a serious hypothetical problem under our reading of the statute. The venue provision, as we understand it, applies to manufacture and distribution committed abroad, the subject matter of the immediately preceding sentence. This special venue provision is necessary for extraterritorial crimes. But, as we noted, the statute makes manufacture and distribution in connection with aircraft a domestic offense as well. Obviously, in that event, the venue would be dictated by the general venue statute. Bear in mind \u00a7 959(c) does not say, as our colleague apparently believes it does: \"This section is intended to reach\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   acts ... committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Any person who violates this section shall\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   be tried in the United States district court at the point of entry where such person enters the United States, or in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We think an alternative understanding of venue might be based on the language of the general venue provision, which applies \"[e]xcept as otherwise expressly provided by enactment of Congress.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203237\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Fifth Circuit has held that the language of the venue provision here, despite the use of seemingly mandatory \"shall,\" does not explicitly establish exclusivity.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Zabaneh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1773251\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/837/1249/#p1256\">\n    837 F.2d 1249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1256 (5th Cir. 1988).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In any event, we conclude that it is unlikely that congressional draftsmen would draft a provision explicitly providing for extraterritoriality only with respect to acts of manufacture and distribution, strikingly omitting the crime of possession with intent to distribute, yet somehow intending extraterritoriality to apply to all three acts. We do not think we can discount plain congressional language as somehow inadvertent or mistaken - particularly when we are dealing with the interpretation of a criminal statute where the doctrine of lenity is required even if the statute is ambiguous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Rather, as we have indicated above, we must apply the long-held presumption against extraterritoriality, which the Supreme Court has described as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Absent clearly expressed congressional intent to the contrary, federal laws will be construed to have only domestic application. The question is not whether we think \"Congress would have wanted\" a statute to apply to foreign conduct \"if it had thought of the situation before the court,\" but whether Congress has affirmatively and unmistakably instructed that the statute will do so. \"When a statute gives no clear indication of an extraterritorial application, it has none.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    RJR Nabisco, Inc. v.

That is why the presumption carries the day. Because \u00a7 959\"gives no clear indication of an extraterritorial application\" for possession with intent to distribute, we must conclude that \"it has none.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We determine, therefore, that the charge of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute was defective. Appellants argue that under these circumstances, their convictions must be reversed because it is impossible to determine whether the jury's verdict was based on a conspiracy to distribute or to possess with intent to distribute. The difficulty with Appellants' argument is that it is quite challenging to imagine any evidence that would be probative of a conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute that would not also be evidence\n   of a conspiracy to distribute. Indeed, when counsel for Appellant Knowles was asked at oral argument for even one example of evidence in the case that was directed to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute but not to conspiracy to distribute, he could not respond. Since no possible prejudice could have arisen from the asserted error, we conclude the error was harmless.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Skillingv.

Most notably, Thompson contends that evidence of his involvement in drug transactions, extrinsic to the charged conspiracy - to use U.S. registered planes from in or about May 2011 to December 12, 2012 - was admitted contrary to Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. That provision, as is well known, prohibits the use of evidence of another act - not the crime charged - to prove a person's bad character. The district court admitted evidence that Thompson was involved in drug transactions in the 1990's; that Thompson had a conversation in June 2011 regarding a possible purchase of cocaine; that in May 2011, Thompson had conversations about a shipment of cocaine from Venezuela to Honduras (not involving a U.S. registered plane); and that in May 2012, Thompson had a conversation with another member of the conspiracy regarding a sale of cocaine to a third person Thompson knew.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In evaluating the district court's decisions, both in response to the government's motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   and its charge to the jury, we must bear in mind that the court was careful to instruct the jury properly that it could not base conviction on other than indicted conduct. But 404(b) permits, as the district court instructed the jury, the use of evidence of drug shipments or transactions using non-aircraft means to show the similarity of prior crimes, a common plan or scheme, or to show defendant's\n   <em>\n    knowledge\n   </em>\n   of drug transactions and purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   To be sure, even if prior bad act evidence falls within the categories permitted by 404(b), it must not be unfairly prejudicial under Rule 403. But, in our view, the admission of most of this evidence was easily within the district court's discretion. We see one difficulty, however. We have held that when evidence of prior bad acts is introduced to show defendant's knowledge of the type of transactions, it cannot be stale,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Section 959(c) 's statement about the intended extraterritorial reach of \"[t]his section\" does not stop with that declaration.

Allowing venue alternatively in the District of Columbia as the seat of the federal government-and nowhere else-is consistent with that extraterritorial reach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The majority opinion suggests that the venue provision refers back only to the extraterritorial manufacture and distribution crimes. Maj. Op. at 267-68. But that is not what Section 959(c) says. The preceding sentence refers to \"acts of\" manufacture or distribution, and the venue provision expressly applies to \"[a]ny person\" who violates \"this section\"-any part of it.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Koons Buick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5956351\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/50/#p60\">\n    543 U.S. at 60-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5956351\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/50/#p60\">\n    125 S.Ct. 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Read as a whole, that naturally captures the possession with intent to distribute offense as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   And it has to include the possession offense to be workable. As this case illustrates, possession with the intent to distribute and distribution are commonly charged together, and the evidentiary proof may overlap extensively if not entirely (as it does in this case). Yet Congress surely did not intend its mandatory venue provision to force the government in a case under Section 959 to prosecute its distribution charge in one district court, and its possession with intent to distribute charge in another.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203237\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Fed.

LaFave et al.,\n   <em>\n    Criminal Procedure\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 16.1(f) (3d ed. 2007) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Given the unsavoriness of roping off the possession offense for distinct venue treatment, the majority opinion proposes as a \"reasonable reading\" of the statute that the court carve all three of Section 959(b) 's offenses-manufacture, distribution, and possession-out of the venue provision \"when those crimes are committed domestically.\" Maj. Op. at 267. But I am not at all sure what statutory text the majority opinion is \"reading\" when it takes that tack. Section 959(c) could not be clearer: \"Any person who violates\n   <em>\n    this section\n   </em>\n   \" \"\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   be\" tried in accordance with Section 959(c) 's venue provision. There is nothing ambiguous or caveated about that. Nor is there any textual hook for bifurcating Section 959(c) 's singular and comprehensive venue provision into two very different venue assignments. As strong as it is, the presumption against extraterritoriality is supposed to be a tool for construing, not emending, statutory text.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   * * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   All of that is a long way of saying that the arguments in favor of extraterritoriality are, in my view, quite strong. Which presumably is why the two other circuits to have addressed this question have held that Section 959(b)(2) 's possession with intent to distribute offense applies extraterritorially.\n   <em>\n    Epskamp\n   </em>\n   , 832 F.3d at 162 ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

That is because, for the reasons the majority opinion elsewhere explains (Maj. Op. at 268-69), Thompson and Knowles' convictions stand regardless. The error (if any) in charging the extraterritorial possession with intent to distribute conspiracy was harmless because the evidence of that conspiracy was entirely coextensive with the proof of a conspiracy to distribute, which was also charged in this case and falls within the jury's general verdict.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
