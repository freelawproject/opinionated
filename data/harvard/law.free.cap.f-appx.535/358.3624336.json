When a drug-sniffing dog alerted to the trunk, the officers searched Mr. Stevens, Mr. Geoffrion, and Plaintiffs\u2019 car. No contraband was found, and Plaintiffs drove away after having been detained for two hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-20\">Following this incident, Plaintiffs brought suit against several defendants in the Western District of Texas. Among the claims brought against the New Mexico and federal defendants for the allegedly intrusive and disruptive stop were claims under (1) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985, (2) Bivens v. <em>Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), and (3) the Federal Torts Claims Act. Plaintiffs also made unreasonable search and seizure allegations against the United States Forest Service, and \u201cfailure to train\u201d claims against the New Mexico defendants and all of the federal defendants except Joseph Hayes and Victor Morales.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-21\">Following the filing of various motions to dismiss by the defendants, the district court referred the matter to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A),(B). The magistrate judge wrote a thorough opinion in which he recommended that the district court grant the motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, lack of personal jurisdiction, improper venue, insufficient service of process, and failure to state a claim. The district court approved and accepted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>recommendations of the magistrate judge. Accordingly, the court entered final judgment dismissing Plaintiffs claims without prejudice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs sought reconsideration in a \u201cMotion for a New Trial\u201d that the district court construed as a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment. The district court denied the motion, and Plaintiffs appeal that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">On appeal, the Plaintiffs have not properly briefed their claims. \u201cFed.R.App.P. 28(a)(4) requires that the appellant\u2019s arguments contain the reasons he deserves the requested relief with citation to the authorities, statutes and parts of the record relied on.\u201d <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993) (internal quotations omitted). \u201cAlthough we liberally construe briefs of pro se appellants, we also require that arguments must be briefed to be preserved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Plaintiffs\u2019 conclusory briefing fails to address the denial of their Rule 59(e) motion, or the substantive reasons articulated by the magistrate judge and adopted by the district court for the dismissal of the suit. Aside from general references to the facts, there is no briefing relevant to dismissal of the New Mexico defendants. Further, although the brief for the federal defendants liberally interprets Plaintiffs\u2019 brief and crafts responses around five points, we do not find Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201carguments\u201d sufficiently explained in fact or law, nor do those arguments join issue in any meaningful way with the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation. Because the arguments are not adequately argued in Plaintiffs\u2019 briefs, they are deemed to be abandoned on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b382-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
