He also appeals his 151-month sentence, contending that the district court erred by including a two-level leadership enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) into his total offense level. We affirm his convictions and his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-21\">A grand jury indicted Webb and his cousin, Olajawonne Webb, on three counts. Count I charged them with conspiring to use, carry, and brandish a firearm during a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii). Count II charged them with armed bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) and (d). Count III charged them with using, carrying, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence, also in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (1) (A) (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Olajawonne pled guilty to Counts I and II and agreed to testify against Webb. Webb proceeded to trial, at which Olaja-wonne testified. The jury convicted Webb on Counts I and II and acquitted him on Count III.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">The U.S. Probation Office then prepared a presentence investigation report that calculated his total offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines at 32. That calculation included a two-level enhancement for being an organizer or leader of the criminal activity. Over Webb\u2019s objection, the district court agreed with the report and found Webb\u2019s total offense level to be 32, for which the advisory imprisonment range is 121 to 151 months. The court selected sentences of 151 months, to be served concurrently, for both counts of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">Webb makes two contentions on appeal: (A) that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction under either count because Olajawonne was not a credible witness; and (B) that the district court erred by including the two-level leadership enhancement into his total offense level, again because Olajawonne\u2019s testimony about Webb\u2019s role in the offenses was not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">We review the sufficiency of evidence supporting a criminal conviction de novo. <em>United States v. Frank, </em>599 F.3d 1221, 1233 (11th Cir.2010). We will uphold the conviction \u201cunless the jury could not have found the defendant guilty under any reasonable construction of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Chastain, </em>198 F.3d 1338, 1351 (11th Cir.1999). Accordingly, we view the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the government\u201d and we make \u201call reasonable inferences <em>and credibility choices </em>... in the government\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1324 (11th Cir.1997) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-11\">Webb\u2019s contention that the evidence is insufficient to support a conviction fails. Olajawonne testified that he and Webb robbed the bank named in the indictment on the date stated in the indictment. He also testified that Webb provided the gun used during the robbery. Olajawonne\u2019s testimony is direct evidence that Webb committed the offenses in Count I and Count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">Webb\u2019s contention depends on the assertion that Olajawonne\u2019s testimony was not credible because it is inconsistent with the testimony of several other witnesses, including Olajawonne\u2019s sister and stepbrother. Essentially, then, Webb asks us to review the jury\u2019s determination of Olaja-wonne\u2019s credibility in light of contradictory testimony. We will not do so. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>422 F.3d 1285, 1292 (11th Cir.2005) (rejecting an argument that certain of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses were not credible in light of inconsistent testimony from other witnesses because this court does not \u201crevisit the credibility determinations of the jury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-13\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-14\">A district court\u2019s application of a leadership enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B 1.1(c) is a factual finding, and we therefore review it for clear error. <em>United States v. Barrington, </em>648 F.3d 1178, 1200 (11th Cir.2011). We will not find clear error where the record supports the district court\u2019s finding. <em>United States v. Petrie, </em>302 F.3d 1280, 1290 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-15\">A leadership enhancement is appropriate under \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) if \u201cthe defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in any criminal activity\u201d that involved four or fewer participants and was not \u201cotherwise extensive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Here, the district court found that Webb \u201cplanned the armed bank robber[y]\u201d and \u201crecruited his cousin to participate.\u201d (Dkt. 93 at 2.) Webb argues again that this finding, which he believes is based only on Olajawonne\u2019s testimony, is contradicted by the testimony of Olajawonne\u2019s brother and stepbrother. But contradictions between witnesses\u2019 testimony, when each witness\u2019s testimony is plausible and not contradicted by extrinsic evidence, \u201ccan virtually never\u201d be a basis for clear error. <em>Hatt 65, LLC v. Kreitzberg, </em>658 F.3d 1243, 1250 (11th Cir.2011) (quoting <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 575, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1512, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)). It is the district court, not this court, that \u201cis best able to assess the credibility of the witnesses before [it] and thus the eviden-tiary content of their testimony.\u201d <em>In re Chalik, </em>748 F.2d 616, 619 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">Webb has pointed to neither an inherent implausibility nor any extrinsic contradictory evidence that would call Olajawonne\u2019s testimony into question. We therefore find no clear error in the district court\u2019s finding that Webb met the requirements for a leadership enhancement under \u00a7 3Bl.l(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">Webb\u2019s convictions and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
