After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">Under \u00a7 8582(c)(2), a district court may reduce the prison sentence \u201cof a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). The district court may grant a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion only \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A reduction is not consistent with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements if it is based on an amendment that does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">Where the amendment to the guidelines reduces the defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not change the sentencing range upon which the defendant\u2019s sentence was based, the district court is not authorized to grant the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 376 (11th Cir.2012). Thus, a defendant is not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction if the amendment does not actually lower the defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range because the defendant\u2019s sentence was based on the statutory mandatory minimum. <em>United States v. Mills, </em>613 F.3d 1070, 1077-78 (11th Cir.2010); <em>see also </em>\u201cU.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A).\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Here, the district court properly denied Ameda\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because Ameda\u2019s sentence was based on the ten-year statutory mandatory minimum in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">In 2007, Ameda was charged with conspiring with his brother to possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)(iii) and 846 (\u201cCount 1\u201d), and possessing with intent to distribute 5 grams or more of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(B)(iii) and \u00a7 2 (\u201cCount 2\u201d). Ameda pled guilty to Count 2 and entered an <em>Alford </em>plea as to Count 1, which carried a statutory mandatory minimum ten-year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">Ameda entered an <em>Alford </em>plea on Count 1 because, although he maintained he had not conspired with his brother, he knew that if he proceeded to trial, the government would file a \u00a7 851 notice, which would subject him to' a mandatory life sentence on Count 1, and he agreed that the government could prove he was guilty of Count 1 beyond a reasonable doubt. Ameda also indicated that he was unwilling to agree to the total amount of drugs involved in the conspiracy because not all of the lab reports had been finalized. The parties agreed that the district court would determine the drug amount after holding a \u201cmini-trial\u201d on the issue. The district court accepted Ameda\u2019s pleas and found him guilty of both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-13\">At his 2008 sentencing, Ameda did not dispute the amount of drugs attributed to him as relevant conduct, which included the 5.9 grams Ameda personally sold (the basis for Count 2) and an additional 53.6 grams Ameda\u2019s brother had sold (as part of the conspiracy charged in Count 1), for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>a total of 59.5 grams of a \u201cmixture or substance\u201d containing cocaine base. Ame-da also did not object to the Presentence Investigation Report\u2019s calculation of his base offense level at 30, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(a)(3) (2008), based on the total amount of crack cocaine involved or to the resulting advisory guidelines range of 130 to 162 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Instead, Ameda argued that the distinct court should use the weight of the actual cocaine base (43.8 grams), rather than the weight of the mixture (59.5 grams), so that Ameda would be subject to the five-year mandatory minimum in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii) rather than the ten-year mandatory minimum in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(iii). The district court rejected Ameda\u2019s argument and imposed the ten-year mandatory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Effective November 1, 2011, Amendment 750 lowered the base offense levels for particular crack cocaine quantities in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amends. 748, 750. If Amendment 750 had been in place when Ameda was sentenced, Ameda\u2019s offense level would have been 26, rather than 30. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(7) (involving at least 28 grams, but less than 112 grams, of cocaine base). Because Ameda\u2019s sentence was based on the ten-year mandatory minimum, however, Amendment 750 did not lower his sentencing range, the low end of which remains 120 months. Thus, the district court was not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce Ameda\u2019s sentence. <em>See Mills, </em>613 F.3d at 1078.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">Ameda contends that at sentencing the district court attributed to him only the 5.9 grams of crack cocaine he personally sold (which was the basis for Count 2), and thus he is subject to the five-year mandatory minimum in \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii) and not the ten-year mandatory minimum in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(iii). The record belies this claim. Ameda entered an <em>Alford </em>plea to Count 1 of the indictment, which charged a drug distribution conspiracy involving 50 grams or more of crack cocaine, in violation of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(iii). At sentencing, Ameda did not dispute the drug quantity attributed to him as relevant conduct except to argue that the actual weight rather than the mixture weight should be used. The sentencing court stated multiple times that it was required to impose the mandatory minimum ten-year sentence and that it was varying \u201cdownward from the low end of the guidelines [of 130 to 162 months] and ... imposing] the minimum mandatory.\u201d Although the sentencing court discussed the 5.9 grams of crack cocaine that were the basis for the substantive offense in Count 2, the sentencing court did not, as Ameda suggests, find that Ameda was responsible for only those 5.9 grams for sentencing purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">We further note that this Court already has concluded that Ameda\u2019s applicable mandatory minimum sentence was the ten-year mandatory minimum in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(iii). In an earlier 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion,' Ameda raised a similar challenge, couched as a due process claim, in which he argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that his \u201cmandatory minimum was not ten(10) years\u201d because the sentencing court had \u201cimpermissibly aggregated the drug amounts to reach the mandatory minimum threshold.\u201d The district court denied Ameda\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. In an order denying Ameda\u2019s request for a Certificate of Appealability, this Court stated that at his plea hearing, Ameda \u201cacknowledged that the government could prove that he had conspired to distribute 50 grams or more of crack cocaine, and that the mandatory minimum sentence for such an offense was 10 years.\u201d The Court further stressed that \u201calthough Ameda filed no objections to his presentence investigation report, the [sentencing] court allowed him to raise the issue of the appropriate amount of drugs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>at sentencing.\u201d The Court concluded that Ameda was not denied due process. <em>See Ameda v. United States, </em>No. 11-14441 (11th Cir. May 24, 2012) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">Axneda also argues that the district court: (1) constructively amended the indictment by accepting his <em>Alford </em>plea to Count 1; and (2) erred at the original sentencing by holding him responsible for 59.5 grams of crack cocaine as relevant conduct. These issues are outside the scope of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2693-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010) (concluding that the district court properly declined to address the defendant\u2019s claims of original sentencing errors because they were not affected by the guidelines amendment at issue and were \u201coutside the scope of the proceeding authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">For these reasons, the district court properly denied Ameda\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b901-9\">. \"We review <em>de novo </em>a district court's conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v.
