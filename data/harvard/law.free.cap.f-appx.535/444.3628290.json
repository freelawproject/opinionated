There is no dispute that Baranauskas\u2019s motion to reopen was not filed within 180 days after the order of removal. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). In that motion, Baranauskas sought equitable tolling based on alleged misinformation from an immigration consultant.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in construing Baranauskas\u2019s equitable-tolling argument as a request for the IJ to reopen the removal proceedings <em>sua sponte. See Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 216, 220 (5th Cir.2008). To the extent Bara-nauskas argues that the BIA erred in dismissing the appeal of the IJ\u2019s denial, the petition for review is DENIED. To the extent Baranauskas challenges the basis for the BIA\u2019s dismissal of his appeal from the IJ\u2019s refusal to reopen, the petition for review is DISMISSED for want of jurisdiction. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b469-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
