As to his sentences, Valdes contends that the district court did not comply with 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(b) because it did not ask him at sentencing whether he admitted the existence of the prior conviction used to enhance his sentences for the drug offenses. After review, we affirm Valdes\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-16\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b885-17\">We begin by setting forth the details of Valdes\u2019s arrest based on the evidence introduced at his trial. Valdes\u2019s convictions resulted from his participation in a plot to commit an armed robbery and steal between 10 and 15 kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-18\">A. June 23, 2011 Sting Operation and Arrest</p>\n<p id=\"b885-19\">In May 2011, Agent Erik Espinosa of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (\u201cATF\u201d) posed as a \u201cdisgruntled drug courier working for a Colombian drug organization.\u201d Agent Espi-nosa contacted Jorge Gonzalez-Zulueta because Agent Espinosa thought he \u201chad information about a crew of individuals committing armed home invasion type robberies in the [sjouth Florida region.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b885-20\">Agent Espinosa recruited Gonzalez-Zu-lueta to rob a \u201cstash house,\u201d telling him that the home would contain between 10 and 15 kilograms of cocaine. Two other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>individuals also agreed to participate in the robbery \u2014 Daniel Abreu-Jimenez and Antonio Hernandez-Galindo. After a fourth prospective robber dropped out of the conspiracy, Abreu-Jimenez recruited two more accomplices \u2014 defendant Valdes and Youany Olivera-Gareia. Abreu-Jimenez assured the undercover ATF agent that Valdes and Olivera-Gareia were competent robbers, stating that \u201cwe could tell them, \u2018Look, there\u2019s a bazooka in theref] and they will look for a tank for sure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">On June 23, 2011, ATF agents executed the sting operation. A confidential informant (\u201cCl\u201d), posing as Agent Espinosa\u2019s uncle, met the five would-be robbers\u2014 defendant Valdes and Gonzalez-Zulueta, Abreu-Jimenez, Hernandez-Galindo, and Olivera-Gareia \u2014 at a predetermined location. Traveling in two vehicles, the Cl directed the conspirators to a warehouse. The conspirators believed that they would meet Agent Espinosa there, and that he would then lead them to the stash house. When the group arrived at the warehouse, the Cl exited one of the vehicles, and entered the warehouse. Afterwards, law enforcement officers surrounded the two vehicles and arrested the five conspirators.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">After making the arrests, law enforcement officers seized two firearms and ammunition from the vehicle in which defendant Valdes had been a passenger. One of those weapons, a Glock .40 caliber pistol, belonged to Valdes.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">B.Indictment</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">On July 7, 2011, a federal grand jury in the Southern District of Florida returned an indictment naming as defendants each of the five participants in the June 23 sting operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">The indictment charged all five defendants with the following: (1) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846 (\u201ccount one\u201d); (2) attempt to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (\u201ccount two\u201d); (3) conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a) (\u201ccount three\u201d); (4) attempt to commit Hobbs Act robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951(a), 2 (\u201ccount four\u201d); and (5) using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence and a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), 2 (\u201ccount five\u201d). The indictment also charged Olivera-Gar-da and Valdes with possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (\u201ccount six\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">C. Co-Defendants\u2019 Guilty Pleas</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">Valdes\u2019s four co-defendants all pleaded guilty to counts one, three, and five. Each one did so pursuant to a plea agreement which required them to cooperate fully in ongoing prosecutions. In return, the government agreed to dismiss counts two and four.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-12\">D. Valdes\u2019s Pre-Trial Withdrawal of Guilty Plea</p>\n<p id=\"b886-13\">Like his co-defendants, Valdes also pleaded guilty to counts one, three, and five pursuant to a plea agreement. However, at a hearing on Valdes\u2019s attorney\u2019s motion to withdraw, Valdes made an oral motion to withdraw his guilty pleas. Valdes informed the district court that he had not fully understood what he was pleading guilty to and that he had \u201cpleaded guilty to something that [he is] not guilty of.\u201d The district court allowed Valdes to withdraw his guilty pleas and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>scheduled the case for trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\">E. Government\u2019s 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a) Notice</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">During a January 20, 2012 pre-trial hearing, the government informed the court that it intended to seek enhanced penalties for the drug offenses in counts one and two based on defendant Valdes\u2019s prior convictions. The government stated that it would file a notice under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 of its intent to seek such a penalty enhancement, and stated that the penalty enhancement \u201cwill subject the defendant to a 20-year mandatory minimum on the drugs, and then of course that\u2019s subject to a consecutive five-year sentence on the 924(c) charge.\u201d The government elaborated, \u201cI just want to state on the record so that the defendant is aware of this, so this doesn\u2019t become an issue later that he was not aware and not given the opportunity to plead pursuant to the filing of this enhancement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">The district court advised the government that it still needed to file the formal \u00a7 851(a) notice. The district court then turned to defendant Valdes and said, \u201cyou have heard the Assistant U.S. Attorney announce that she intends to file a pleading which would subject you to a minimum mandatory sentence of 20 years. Do you understand that, sir?\u201d Valdes answered, <em>\u201cYes.\u201d </em>Valdes also affirmed that he had discussed the issue with his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">The district court then engaged in the following exchange with Valdes and his attorney about his right to testify, the sentencing guidelines, his potential 20-year mandatory minimum sentence, and his potential 5-year consecutive sentence on his firearm charge for a total of 25 years\u2019 imprisonment. Because it is relevant to the issue of whether Valdes was given an opportunity to respond to the government\u2019s \u00a7 851(a) notice, we set the exchange forth in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-11\">THE COURT: All right. So have you discussed \u2014 well, there are a couple of things, Mr. Valdes. No. 1, you need to know that you do have the right to take the stand and testify in your own behalf. Your lawyer can provide you with advice, but you must make the final decision as to whether you will take the stand and testify or not. Do you understand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-12\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-13\">THE COURT: And occasionally I receive letters from defendants several years later on some occasions that they didn\u2019t understand the sentencing guidelines, and I want to make sure you have discussed those sentencing guidelines with your attorney. Mr. Rodriguez, have you discussed the application of the sentencing guidelines?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-14\">MR. RODRIGUEZ [Valdes\u2019s defense counsel]: I have, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-15\">THE COURT: And obviously he knows that he has a minimum mandatory term of 20 years if found guilty, that\u2019s the jury\u2019s decision, and then in addition to that, there is a five-year consecutive sentence if he\u2019s found guilty of the firearms offense, totaling 25 years. Have you discussed that issue with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-16\">MR. RODRIGUEZ: I have, Your Hon- or, but I\u2019d ask the Court to colloquy my client to make sure that he understood our conversation and that he\u2019s aware of the fact that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-17\">THE COURT: Well, we just explained to him \u2014 you told me that he understood that if the government files the enhancement, he\u2019s subject to a mandatory 20-year sentence. And in addition to that, Mr. Valdes, if you are found guilty of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>firearms count, you would be subject to an additional consecutive five-year sentence, for a total of 25 years. Do you understand, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-4\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-5\">THE COURT: Do you have any questions of me or is there anything you want to ask your lawyer in this regard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-6\">THE DEFENDANT: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">That same day, the government filed its notice pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(1). The government\u2019s notice specifically identified Valdes\u2019s 2007 Florida conviction for \u201cCannabis/Sell/Manufacture (Cultivate)/Delivery/Possession with Intent to Distribute.\u201d Because of this prior conviction, if the jury convicted Valdes of count one or two, then he would be subject to a mandatory minimum prison term of either 10 or 20 years, depending on what drug quantity the jury found.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">F. Government\u2019s Rule 404(b) Notice</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">The government also filed, before trial, a notice under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) of its intent to introduce evidence at trial of defendant Valdes\u2019s prior acts. The government\u2019s notice stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that Valdes and Olivera-Garcia had committed \u201cprior armed and unarmed home invasion robberies.\u201d It further stated that \u201cthe two together engaged in four separate marijuana grow house robberies, and during one, a shotgun was pointed at Ariel Valdes, who was armed with a pistol.\u201d The government contended that \u201c[s]uch evidence is admissible as evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) as proof of intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, or absence of mistake in the instant case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b888-11\">Valdes responded to the government\u2019s notice with a motion to exclude the proposed Rule 404(b) evidence, arguing that it was unreliable and unduly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-12\">During the same January 20, 2012 pretrial hearing, the district court took up the Rule 404(b) issue and announced that it would rule on the issue at the end of the government\u2019s case-in-chief, at which time it could \u201creally see what the facts are and understand how they relate in the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b888-13\">G. Valdes\u2019s \u201cMere Presence\u201d Defense at Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b888-14\">Valdes\u2019s three-day trial began on January 23, 2012. The ATF agent who initiated the sting operation, Agent Espinosa, was the government\u2019s first witness. During cross-examination of Agent Espinosa, Valdes\u2019s attorney revealed that one of Valdes\u2019s defenses was that Valdes was merely present at the warehouse that day and was not involved in the planned robbery. These questions, the district court concluded, opened the door to Rule 404(b) evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-15\">Specifically, during cross-examination, Valdes\u2019s attorney asked Agent Espinosa why ATF had not arrested an individual who had dropped out of the robbery plan before the evening of June 28. Agent Espinosa stated that this person, Perez, was not arrested because \u201c[h]e did not show up on the day of the arrest.\u201d Valdes\u2019s attorney then asked: \u201cSo if you showed up, you got arrested?\u201d Agent Es-pinosa answered, \u2018Tes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b888-16\">Later on during cross-examination, defendant Valdes\u2019s attorney returned to this point. He asked Agent Espinosa: \u201cAriel Valdes was arrested because he showed up that day, correct? Agent Espinosa answered: \u201cHe was taken into custody, yes.\u201d Valdes\u2019s attorney reiterated that Valdes had been arrested \u201c[bjecause he showed up.\u201d Agent Espinosa agreed with this statement, testifying: \u201cBecause he was there, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>H. Introduction of Rule 404(b) Evidence About Other Robberies</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">At end of the government\u2019s case-in-chief, the district court returned to the Rule 404(b) issue. The district court pointed out Valdes\u2019s attorney\u2019s questions of Agent Espinosa. Based on these questions, the district court stated, \u201cthe defense in part is, [\u2019]I was simply merely present. I had no knowledge of an upcoming robbery.f\u2019]\u201d Because Valdes was asserting this defense, the district court concluded that \u201cperhaps the Rule 404(b) evidence of other incidents would be relevant and ... should be allowed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">Valdes again objected to the admission of the Rule 404(b) evidence. He contended that it was Agent Espinosa who had first brought up the \u201cmere presence\u201d issue and that Vlades\u2019s attorney \u201cdidn\u2019t use the words \u2018mere presence.\u2019 \u201d The district court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">The government then called Olivera-Garda, Valdes\u2019s co-defendant, who testified about four home invasion robberies that he and Valdes had committed before the June 23 sting operation. Olivera-Gar-da stated that, approximately two years before June 23, 2011, he and Valdes committed a home invasion robbery in Cape Coral, Florida, during which they stole approximately seven pounds of marijuana. Valdes and Olivera-Garda also robbed a home in West Palm Beach, Florida, again stealing marijuana. Approximately a year and a half before their June 23, 2011 arrests, Valdes and Olivera-Garda committed another home invasion robbery in Eureka, Florida. During that robbery, they stole \u201cabout eight pounds\u201d of marijuana. They robbed a fourth house in Tampa, Florida; however they were unsuccessful in stealing marijuana during that robbery \u201c[bjecause there were people inside the house.\u201d Olivera-Garda testified that, during each of these robberies, either he or Valdes had a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">During cross-examination, Olivera-Gar-da could not remember the addresses of the houses that he and Valdes had robbed, or the specific dates on which the robberies had occurred. Olivera-Garda recalled that the Cape Coral house was white, but he did not remember the colors of the other houses. Olivera-Garda stated that he and Valdes had learned the locations of these drug houses by eavesdropping during public conversations in \u201ccafeteria bars\u201d and then installing tracking devices on the vehicles of strangers who talked about keeping marijuana. However, Olivera-Garda did not remember the specific bars or cafeterias where he and Valdes had gone to learn about robbery targets.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">I. Jury Instructions on Rule 404(b) Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">During the jury instructions, the district court called the jury\u2019s attention to the Rule 404(b) evidence. The district court reminded the jury that it had \u201cheard evidence of acts done by the defendant on other occasions that may be similar to acts the defendant is currently charged with.\u201d It instructed that the jury \u201cmust not consider any of this evidence to decide whether the defendant committed the acts charged now.\u201d However, the jury could \u201cconsider this evidence for other very limited purposes.\u201d The district court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-12\">If other evidence leads you to decide beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the acts charged, you may consider evidence of similar acts done on other occasions to decide whether the defendant had the state of mind or intent necessary for the crime charged, acted according to a plan or to prepare to commit a crime, or commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>ted the charged acts by accident or mistake.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">J. Verdict and Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">The jury found Valdes guilty on all six counts. Before sentencing, the probation office prepared a presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d). The PSI stated that Valdes was subject to a mandatory minimum of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment for counts one and two based on his having previously been convicted of a felony drug offense. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(ii). Valdes was also subject to a consecutive five-year sentence for the count five firearm offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i). Accordingly, Valdes\u2019s advisory guidelines range for counts one through four and six was the mandatory minimum 240 months\u2019 imprisonment. His guideline range for count five was a consecutive term of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b) (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">Valdes did not timely file objections to the PSI. However, at sentencing, Valdes\u2019s attorney advised the district court that Valdes wished to raise untimely objections. Valdes\u2019s attorney stated \u201c[Valdes is] telling me that I told him that if he went to trial and lost, he would get 17 years. He doesn\u2019t quite understand now why the PSR and the law says that he should be sentenced to a minimum mandatory of 25 years.\u201d The district court responded that, before trial, the government had stated, with Valdes present, that Valdes\u2019s guidelines range upon conviction would be 25 years. The government agreed, noting that it had \u201cdiscussed the impact of the 851 enhancement that the government was contemplating filing.\u201d The district court thus overruled that objection and a substantially identical objection, noting that it had gone \u201cthrough that issue very carefully with the defendant before he made the decision to withdraw his plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">Later on at the sentencing hearing, Valdes personally argued that he should receive a nine-year sentence, like the sentences his co-defendants had received. Valdes also argued that he \u201chad nothing to do ... whatsoever with those things.\u201d The district court responded that \u201cthe government announced that they were filing an enhancement which subjected you to substantially higher guidelines than your codefendants. They were not subject to that enhancement, because the government didn\u2019t file it in their case[s]. ' They did in your case when you elected to go trial, which is their right to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">The district court sentenced Valdes to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment on counts one through four and 120 months\u2019 imprisonment on count six, all to run concurrently. It imposed a consecutive 60-month sentence on count five, resulting in a total sentence of 300 months (which equals 25 years).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">Valdes timely appealed his convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b890-13\">A. Rule 404(b) Challenge to Convictions</p>\n<p id=\"b890-14\">On appeal, Valdes argues the district court erred by allowing Olivera-Garcia\u2019s testimony about his prior drug thefts. Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) forbids the admission of any evidence of prior bad acts \u201cto prove a person\u2019s character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 404(b)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>ever, the same evidence may be admitted for some other purpose, \u201csuch as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 404(b)(2). This Court has previously observed that \u201cRule 404(b) is a rule of inclusion,\u201d and relevant prior bad acts evidence \u201clike other relevant evidence, should not lightly be excluded when it is central to the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1280 (11th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Our test regarding the admissibility of prior bad acts evidence is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-6\">First, the evidence must be relevant to an issue other than the defendant\u2019s character; Second, the act must be established by sufficient proof to permit a jury finding that the defendant committed the extrinsic act; Third, the probative value of the evidence must not be substantially outweighed by its undue prejudice, and the evidence must meet the other requirements of Rule 403.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AskY\"><em>United States v. Matthews, </em>431 F.3d 1296, 1310-11 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In every conspiracy case, \u201ca not guilty plea renders the defendant\u2019s intent a material issue\u201d unless the defendant affirmatively makes it a non-issue. <em>Id. </em>at 1311 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">Applying this test here establishes that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it allowed Olivera-Garda to testify about Valdes\u2019s prior bad acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">As to the first prong, the evidence was relevant to an issue other than Valdes\u2019s character because he pleaded not guilty to two conspiracy offenses, and he did not affirmatively remove intent as an issue in the case. <em>See id. </em>More importantly, as the district court noted, Valdes affirmatively made intent an issue in the case by suggesting that he was arrested only because he was present during the sting operation, implying that he was not involved in the robbery plot. <em>See United States v. Delgado, </em>56 F.3d 1357, 1365 (11th Cir.1995) (affirming the introduction of pri- or bad acts evidence because the defendant \u201cpresented a \u2018mere presence\u2019 defense, forcing the government to prove his criminal intent so as to negate any innocent explanation for his presence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">Valdes contends that the prior bad acts evidence was not materially similar to the charged crimes because it involved burglaries and not robberies, in that people were not in the homes during any of the three successful thefts. This argument fails. First, Valdes did not make this robbery-burglary distinction before the district court, and we do not consider for the first time on appeal \u201carguments not raised squarely before the district court.\u201d <em>Bryant v. Jones, </em>575 F.3d 1281, 1308 (11th Cir.2009). In any event, we would reject this materially-similar argument. The fact that Valdes repeatedly stole drugs, while armed, was relevant to whether he had the requisite intent during the June 23 sting operation for the jury to convict him of the charged offenses. This is true regardless of what specific offenses that his prior bad acts might have constituted had he been prosecuted for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">Valdes also challenges the relevancy of the prior bad acts evidence on the ground that his earlier thefts involved \u201crelatively small quantities of marijuana,\u201d whereas the sting operation was supposed to in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>volve a large quantity of cocaine. That argument also lacks merit. <em>See United States v. Cochran, </em>683 F.3d 1314, 1321 (11th Cir.) (\u201cCochran ... contends that his 2004 offense ... was dissimilar because it involved different drugs. We cannot agree.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 492, 492, 184 L.Ed.2d 309 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">As to the second prong, the government was required to introduce \u201csufficient proof to enable a jury to find by a preponderance of the evidence that [Valdes] committed the act[s] in question.\u201d <em>See United States v. Edouard, </em>485 F.3d 1324, 1344 (11th Cir.2007). The government did so. Olivera-Garda testified that he was present with Valdes during each of the four prior robberies. We previously held that \u201cthe uncorroborated word of an accomplice provides a sufficient basis for concluding that the defendant committed the extrinsic acts admissible under Rule 404(b).\u201d <em>United States v. Dickerson, </em>248 F.3d 1036, 1047 (11th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). Moreover, Oliv-era-Garcia provided ample details about the prior offenses. Although there were specific details that Olivera-Garda could not recall, it was for the jury to determine whether Olivera-Garda was a credible witness. <em>See United States v. Dothard, </em>666 F.2d 498, 502 (11th Cir.1982) (\u201c[T]he question of whether a defendant actually committed a prior extrinsic act is a jury question, unless the court is convinced that the jury could not reasonably find that the defendant committed the alleged prior act.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">Turning to the third prong, Federal Rule of Evidence 403 provides that a \u201ccourt may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of ... unfair prejudice.\u201d Fed. R.Evid. 403. Exclusion under Rule 403 \u201cis <em>an. </em>extraordinary remedy, which should only be used sparingly, and the balance should be struck in favor of admissibility.\u201d <em>Edouard, </em>485 F.3d at 1344 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). No Rule 403 violation occurred in Valdes\u2019s case. Evidence that Valdes previously had used guns to steal drugs was highly probative in determining whether Valdes intended to participate in the charged conspiracy to use guns to steal drugs. As for Valdes\u2019s claim of prejudice, this Court has noted that \u201cextrinsic drug offenses do not tend to incite a jury to an irrational decision.\u201d <em>Delgado, </em>56 F.3d at 1366.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by allowing Olivera-Garda to testify about Valdes\u2019s earlier drug thefts.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-12\">B. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(b) Challenge to Sentences</p>\n<p id=\"b892-13\">Valdes challenges his concurrent 20-year mandatory minimum sentences on counts one and two.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Valdes was subject to that mandatory minimum because he had a prior felony drug conviction. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). For a district court \u201cto impose an enhanced sentence based on prior convictions, ... the government must comply with the procedural requirements of ... 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851.\u201d <em>United States v. Cespedes, </em>151 F.3d 1329, 1331 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-14\">Specifically, before trial (or before a defendant pleads guilty), the government must file and serve an information that states the previous convictions that the government intends to rely upon to seek a sentence enhancement. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(1). The government complied with \u00a7 851(a)(1) here.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>If the government files a \u00a7 851(a) information, and the defendant subsequently is convicted or pleads guilty, a district court must <em>\u201cafter </em>conviction but <em>before </em>pronouncement of sentence\u201d ask the defendant \u201cwhether he affirms or denies that he has been previously convicted as alleged in the information, and ... inform him that any challenge to a prior conviction which is not made before sentence is imposed may not thereafter be raised to attack the sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 851(b) (emphasis added). In Valdes\u2019s case, the district court, after his conviction, did not conduct the specific colloquy prescribed in \u00a7 851(b). Rather, the district court effectively did so before trial. Specifically, the district court explained to Valdes in detail that his sentence would be enhanced based on a prior conviction if the government filed its information and Valdes was convicted. Valdes stated that he understood this. After his conviction, the PSI described Valdes\u2019s same prior conviction that was in the \u00a7 851(a) notice. Importantly, at no point did Valdes object to facts in the government\u2019s \u00a7 851(a) information or the PSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Under our precedent, \u201cwhere \u00a7 851(a) is complied with and a defendant is properly apprised of the underlying convictions considered to enhance his sentence, substantial compliance with \u00a7 851(b) is sufficient.\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>642 F.3d 1383, 1340 (11th Cir.2011). In <em>James, </em>this Court affirmed an enhanced sentence under \u00a7 841(b), even though the district court had not strictly complied with \u00a7 851(b). <em>Id. </em>at 1343. The district court had \u201cenhanced James\u2019s sentence based on prior convictions clearly delineated and described in the \u00a7 851' notice (in full compliance with \u00a7 851(a)) and also in the PSI, to which the court specifically directed James\u2019s attention during the sentencing hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We therefore concluded that James had received \u201cample opportunity for any objection,\u201d which he had not made. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the district court\u2019s failure to perform the \u00a7 851(b) colloquy was harmless error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Here the same is true. Valdes \u201call but affirmed his prior conviction[ ].\u201d <em>See James, </em>642 F.3d at 1343 (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, \u201c[a]ny error in not specifically asking whether he affirmed or denied the conviction[] was harmless error.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">III.
