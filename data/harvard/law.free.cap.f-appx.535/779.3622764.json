Henley based on his second claim under the Black Lung Benefits Act. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 901. Cowin argues that the denial of Henley\u2019s first claim for benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>bars his second claim for benefits and that the decision to award Henley benefits based on Dr. Harsha Shantha\u2019s medical opinion was not supported by substantial evidence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>the decision of the Benefits Review Board. <em>U.S. Steel Mining Co. v. Dir., OWCP, </em>386 F.3d 977, 984 (11th Cir.2004). To the extent the Board affirms an award of benefits under the Act, that decision is \u201ceffectively cloak[ed] ... with the same deference\u201d owed to the decision of the administrative law judge. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cDecisions of the [administrative law judge] are renewable only as to whether they are in accordance with law and supported by substantial evidence in light of the entire record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Substantial evidence consists of \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The Board did not err by affirming the determination that Henley \u201csatisfied the threshold requirement for a [second] claim ... by showing a material change in [his] condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 990. The administrative law judge applied the one-element test we adopted in <em>U.S. Steel </em>and determined that Henley had failed to establish he suffered from pneumoconiosis when he filed his first claim for benefits in 1993, but that he had a material change of condition and suffered from the disease when he filed his second claim in 2002. Cowdn argues that the administrative law judge could not disturb the finding he made during Henley\u2019s first claim for benefits that Henley\u2019s lung condition was not caused by exposure to coal dust, but the administrative law judge could not take that earlier finding into account when evaluating Henley\u2019s second claim for benefits. The administrative law judge determined whether Henley had a \u201cmaterial change\u201d in his condition by comparing the evidence he presented in support of his second claim \u201cwith the conclusion! ] reached in the prior claim\u201d that he did not have pneumoconio-sis. <em>See id. </em>at 989 (emphasis omitted). Cowin also argues that res judicata barred Henley\u2019s second claim for benefits, but Henley sought in his second claim to prove that his health had changed since the denial of his first claim, not to relitigate the denial of that claim. <em>See id. </em>at 990.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">Substantial evidence supports the decision that Henley had legal pneumoco-niosis. Dr. Harsha Shantha, a board certified pulmonologist and Henley\u2019s treating physician, opined that Henley\u2019s symptoms were attributable to sarcoidosis and an obstructive impairment attributable to coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis, which is consistent with the definition of legal pneumoco-niosis. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201(a)(2), (b). Dr. Shantha determined that Henley had coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis based on objective medical evidence of his work and social history, which included exposure to coal and sand dust, but no exposure to cigarette smoke; Henley\u2019s clinical presentation; and a pulmonary function test. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 718.202(a)(4). The administrative law judge reasonably found Dr. Shan-tha\u2019s opinion more probative and well-reasoned than other, less definitive, diagnoses of pneumoconiosis by Dr. Ceso Ebeo, who failed to provide a pulmonary diagnosis; Dr. Donald Rasmussen, who relied on evidence not in the record; Dr. Randolph Forehand, who needed to eliminate tuberculosis and malignancy as possible diagnoses; and Dr. Jay Mehta, who gave an alternative diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">Cowin challenges the decision of the administrative law judge on four grounds, all of which fail. First, Cowin argues that Henley was not entitled to benefits be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>cause he had a negative lung biopsy, but negative biopsy evidence is not dispositive of a claim for benefits. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 718.106(c) (\u201cA negative biopsy is not conclusive evidence that the miner does not have pneumoconiosis.\u201d). Second, Cow-in argues that Henley was not entitled to benefits based on his CT scan in February 2002 showing sarcoidosis, but the administrative law judge found that the CT scan was counterweighed by a chest x-ray in December 2008 that two doctors read as showing pneumoconiosis, and we cannot disturb that finding. <em>See Taylor v. Ala. By-Products Corp., </em>862 F.2d 1529, 1581 n. 1 (11th Cir.1989) (\u201cWe do not question the weight accorded to the evidence by the ALJ, for such is not within our scope of review.\u201d). Third, Cowin argues that the administrative law judge misstated that Dr. Shantha did not rely on the CT scan evidence, but the administrative law judge explained that the doctor made a partial diagnosis of sarcoidosis based on the scan and then determined from the other objective medical evidence that Henley suffered from coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis. Fourth, Cowin argues that the administrative law judge \u201csummarily disregarded all of the evidence from [Henley\u2019s] prior claim,\u201d but the administrative law judge considered \u201cthe radiographic record in the earlier claim\u201d and reasonably determined that \u201cthe most recent chest x-rays [were] more relevant medical evidence on the condition of Mr. Henley\u2019s lungs\u201d and more consistent with the \u201clatent and progressive\u201d nature of pneumoconiosis. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201(c); <em>see also U.S. Steel, </em>386 F.3d at 990.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">We AFFIRM the decision to award benefits to Henley.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
