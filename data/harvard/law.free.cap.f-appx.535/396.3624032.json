He contends that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence for a crime of violence under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on his Texas conviction for indecency with a child under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 21.11(a)(1) and (d) (2003). His challenge is foreclosed by our decisions in <em>United States v. Cabecera Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d 541, 562 &amp; n. 28 (5th Cir.2013) (en banc), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(June 6, 2013)(No. 12-10695) and <em>United States v. Quiroga-Hernandez, </em>698 F.3d 227, 228 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-23\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b420-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
