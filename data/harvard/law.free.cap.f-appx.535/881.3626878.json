On appeal, Satku-nanathan argues: (1) the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not supported by law or by the record; (2) he demonstrated persecution on account of a protected ground and demonstrated he was entitled to CAT relief; and (3) the BIA failed to address his claim for asylum based on his status as a Tamil-failed-asylum-seeker.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review, we deny Sat-kunanathan\u2019s petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-13\">\n<em>I. Adverse Credibility Determination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b907-14\">Under the REAL ID Act of 2005, credibility determinations are based upon the totality of the circumstances, including: (1) the demeanor, candor, and responsiveness of the applicant; (2) the plausibility of the applicant\u2019s account; (3) the consistency between the applicant\u2019s written and oral statements; (4) the internal consistency of each statement; and (5) the consistency of the applicant\u2019s statements with other record evidence, including country reports. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). An adverse credibility determination may be based on inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and falsehoods that do not go to the \u201cheart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b907-15\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Satkunanathan voluntarily returned to Sri Lanka after reaching safety in India, and provided no reasonable explanation for his return. In addition, the record included a letter written to the justice of the peace in Sri Lanka by Satkunanathan\u2019s father, and Satkunanathan failed to provide an explanation for the letter\u2019s suspect timing. Moreover, Satkunanathan\u2019s claims focus on threats from the Karuna group, but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>letter failed to mention this group, and Satkunanathan failed to provide a consistent explanation for this discrepancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">\n<em>II. Asylum and CAT Relief</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">To establish eligibility for asylum relief, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a well-founded fear that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b). To establish entitlement to CAT relief, the applicant must establish that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if returned to the proposed country of removal, by or with the acquiescence of the government. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">Even putting aside the adverse credibility determination, the BIA did not err in denying Satkunanathan\u2019s claims for asylum and CAT relief. First, Satkunana-than failed to show that at least one central reason for the harms he suffered was based on a protected ground. With respect to the extortion by the Karuna and the individuals at the airport, the record indicated these individuals were interested in financial gain, not in targeting Satkuna-nathan based on his ethnicity or political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(i). With respect to his detainment by army authorities, Satkunanathan\u2019s testimony indicated he was detained because he did not have proper documentation, and Satkunanathan did not adequately demonstrate that the authorities persecuted him on the basis of an imputed political opinion. Second, Sat-kunanathan failed to show he would be targeted on account of a protected ground if he returned to Sri Lanka. Third, Satku-nanathan failed to present evidence that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured upon return to Sri Lanka, either by or with the acquiescence of the government. Accordingly, we deny Satkunana-than\u2019s petition with respect to these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">\n<em>III. Satkunanathan\u2019s Claim as a Tamil-Failed-Asylum-Seeker</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">Finally, Satkunanathan claims the IJ and BIA failed to adjudicate his claim for asylum and CAT relief on account of being a Tamil-failed-asylum-seeker. However, the IJ rejected Satkunanathan\u2019s assertions, and the BIA specifically referenced the IJ\u2019s conclusion that potential punishment for illegal departure would not qualify Satkunanathan for protection. In light of the BIA\u2019s conclusion that any potential punishment faced by Satkunana-than for illegal departure from Sri Lanka would not give rise to an asylum claim, as well as the detailed nature of the BIA\u2019s decision, the BIA gave reasoned consideration to Satkunanathan\u2019s claims. <em>See Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1374 (11th Cir.2006). Accordingly, we deny Satkunanathan\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b907-9\">. Satkunanathan also argues the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s refusal to consider evidence submitted after the imposed deadline. The BIA did not err in affirming the IJ's refusal to consider the late-submitted evidence because the IJ has discretion to set such deadlines and to exclude subsequently submitted evidence. <em>See Tang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>578 F.3d 1270, 1276 (11th Cir.2009): 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.31(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b907-10\">. Where the BIA issues its own opinion, we review only the BIA's decision. <em>Kueviakoe v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>567 F.3d 1301, 1304 (11th Cir.2009). To the extent the BIA\u2019s decision was based upon a legal determination, we review <em>de novo. D-Muhumed </em>v. <em>U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). The BIA\u2019s factual determinations, including credibility determinations, are reviewed under a substantial evidence standard, and we will affirm if the decision \"is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 817-18.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
