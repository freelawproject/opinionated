Rodriguez\u2019s sole contention on appeal in that he erroneously received a two-level firearm enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), at sentencing. At the sentencing hearing, a Drug Enforcement Agency agent testified that Rodriguez brandished a gun at his coconspirator\u2019s house and threatened to use it in retaliation for the theft of three kilograms of cocaine. Further, in Rodriguez\u2019s home, agents found three firearms, ammunition, a bulletproof vest, and a black trash bag containing drug paraphernalia, including vacuum-seal bags, rubber bands, and ledgers. Additionally, a gun was found in Rodriguez\u2019s minivan, the same van he used to purchase cocaine during the conspiracy. The district court found that the display at Rodriguez\u2019s coconspirator\u2019s house and the guns in Rodriguez\u2019s home supported the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Rodriguez contends there was insufficient evidence to show a connection between the firearms and the drug-trafficking conspiracy. He argues that he displayed the gun at his coconspirator\u2019s house simply to blow off steam, not to protect his drugs or threaten anyone, and that there is no nexus between the guns at his house and the conspiracy. No drugs were found at the house and he was never observed engaging in drug transactions at the home. Finally, Rodriguez denies that the bags, ledgers, and rubber bands found in his home were drug paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s findings of fact under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) for clear error, and the application of the Sentencing Guidelines to those facts de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Pham, </em>463 F.3d 1239, 1245 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). Under the clear error standard, we will not disturb the district court\u2019s factual findings unless \u201cour review of the record leaves us with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>335 F.3d 1314, 1319 (11th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Sentencing Guidelines provide that a defendant\u2019s offense level should be adjusted upward by two levels if the defendant used a dangerous weapon during the commission of a drug-trafficking offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). According to the application notes, \u201c[t]he enhancement should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n. 11(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">We have interpreted the Guideline and its application notes to mean that \u201c[t]o justify a firearms enhancement, the government must either [1] establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the firearm was present at the site of the charged conduct or [2] prove that the defendant possessed a firearm during conduct associated with the offense of conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Stallings, </em>463 F.3d 1218, 1220 (11th Cir.2006); <em>see United States v. Hunter, </em>172 F.3d 1307, 1308-10 (11th Cir.1999) (affirming district court\u2019s finding that a firearm discovered in defendant\u2019s home was conduct relevant to defendant\u2019s possession of narcotics with intent to distribute, based on evidence that drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>paraphernalia, including plastic baggies and transaction records, were also found in defendant\u2019s home, notwithstanding fact that no known drug sales took place at defendant\u2019s home). If the government succeeds in making that showing, the burden shifts to the defendant to show that a connection between the weapon and the offense was \u201cclearly improbable.\u201d <em>United States v. Audain, </em>254 F.3d 1286, 1289 (11th Cir.2001) (per curiam). That said, the fact that a drug offender possesses a firearm, standing alone, does not necessarily justify application of the firearms enhancement. <em>Stallings, </em>463 F.3d at 1221 (reversing enhancement for firearms found in defendant\u2019s home, explaining that the government failed to meet its burden because it \u201cprovided no evidence connecting the pistols found in [defendant\u2019s] home to his alleged drug activity\u201d and it \u201cnever addressed the possibility that the weapons belonged to any of the other adults residing in his home\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">We discern no clear error in the district court\u2019s application of the firearms enhancement in this case. Rodriguez\u2019s display of a gun at his conspirator\u2019s house, in addition to the three guns found at Rodriguez\u2019s home, show that Rodriguez possessed firearms \u201cduring conduct associated with the offense of conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1220. To begin, the district court found that Rodriguez brandished the gun at his coconspirator\u2019s house with an eye to protect his drug-dealing by threatening to use the weapon in retaliation against persons responsible for stealing his drugs. We see no reason to doubt that determination. Further, three guns and gun-related items, including a bullet-proof vest, were found in close proximity to drug paraphernalia (vacuum-seal bags, rubber bands, and ledgers) at Rodriguez\u2019s home, and there was ample evidence from which the district court could conclude that the paraphernalia found in the home was part of the same course of conduct (conspiracy and possession with intent to distribute narcotics) for which Rodriguez was ultimately charged and convicted. <em>See Hunter, </em>172 F.3d at 1309. Although Rodriguez disputed that the items in the trash bag at his home were drug paraphernalia, the district court did not credit his version of the facts, and the court\u2019s conclusion in that regard was not clearly erroneous. Because the government showed that the guns were in proximity to relevant offense conduct, Rodriguez bore the burden of showing that it was clearly improbable that the weapons were used in connection with the offense. <em>See Audain, </em>254 F.3d at 1289. Rodriguez failed to make that showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
