He asserts that the district court plainly erred in imposing a career offender enhancement under U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>\u00a7 4B1.1 because his prior Texas burglary of a habitation offenses were not crimes of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). He contends that the Texas offense is broader than generic burglary and, therefore, not \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), because Texas defines \u201cowner\u201d to include a person who has \u201ca greater right to possession of the property than the actor.\u201d Our precedent forecloses this argument. <em>See United States v. Morales-Mota, </em>704 F.3d 410, 412 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Also foreclosed is Alvarez-Soto\u2019s argument that, in light of <em>Flores-Figueroa v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 646, 129 S.Ct. 1886, 173 L.Ed.2d 853 (2009), the district court plainly erred in accepting his guilty plea without sufficient proof that he knew the type and quantity of the controlled substance involved. <em>See United States v. Betancourt, </em>586 F.3d 303, 308-09 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Alvarez-Soto concedes that his arguments are foreclosed and raises them to preserve them for further review. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affir-mance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time to file an appellate brief is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
