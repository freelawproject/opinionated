At sentencing, the District Court treated Conaway as a \u201ccareer offender\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, and imposed concurrent prison sentences of 292 months on Count 1<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 12 months on Count 2. In March 2008, Conaway moved the District Court to reduce his Count 1 sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), under Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines. The court denied his motion because he had been sentenced as a career offender on Count 1. He appeals the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">On appeal, Conaway argues that he was entitled to a sentence reduction despite the fact that he was sentenced as a career offender. He acknowledges our holding in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), that career offenders were not eligible for sentence reductions under analogous Amendment 706 because their sentences were \u201cbased on\u201d their career-offender status, but asserts that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), allows for the reduction of a sentence that is in any way based on a subsequently amended Guidelines sentence range. In his case, even though the court selected the career-offender offense level and not the offense level for cocaine-base offenses, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, he contends that his resulting sentence was based on the base offense level for cocaine base offenses because 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) required the court to consider the offense level for cocaine base offenses. He asks us to reconsider our previous determination in <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317 (11th Cir.2012), contending that Justice Sotomayor\u2019s narrow concurrence is the controlling part of the <em>Freeman </em>decision. Further, he argues that he was entitled to be resentenced directly under the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 237 (2010), which, he says, reduced his statutory sentence range of 5-to-40-years to 0-to-20-years and affected his sentence range as a career-offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-14\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and reviews the denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 792 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-15\">A district court may modify a sentence if the defendant \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence modification \u201cdoes not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). In addressing whether a defendant is eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction, a district court is to consider only the effect of the applicable Guidelines amendment, leaving <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations ... unchanged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 781-82 (emphasis in original). As such, even if a retroactive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>amendment would alter a defendant\u2019s offense level, he will be ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief if the amendment would \u201cnot have the effect of lowering [his] applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">To obtain a reduction in a term of imprisonment based on an amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines, the relevant amendment must be listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). Because they are listed in \u00a7 lBl.lO(c), Parts A and C of Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines may serve as the basis for a sentence reduction. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(c). Part A of Amendment 750 amended \u00a7 2D1.1 by revising the Drug Quantity Table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), and reducing offense levels associated with various' amounts of crack cocaine. U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 750, Pt. A, <em>cross referencing </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 748 (2011). Amendment 750 did not make any changes to \u00a7 4B1.1, the career-offender guideline. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 750. Amendment 750 was made retroactive by Amendment 759, effective November 1, 2011. <em>See id., </em>Amend. 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">When a defendant is sentenced as a career offender, his base offense level is determined under \u00a7 4B1.1, not the drug quantities set forth in \u00a7 2D1.1. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. In <em>Moore, </em>a pre-FSA case, we faced the question of whether defendants who were sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1 were eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief in light of Amendment 706, which, like Amendment 750, had lowered the base offense levels for certain quantities of crack cocaine under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1325-27. We held that the defendants did not qualify for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because Amendment 706 had no effect on their guideline ranges, which were calculated under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>Id. </em>at 1327-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">In <em>Freeman, </em>the Supreme Court decided a case involving a plea agreement under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C), in which the defendant entered a plea agreement that recommended a particular sentence. <em>Freeman, </em>564 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2690. A four justice plurality concluded that \u201c \u00a7 3582(c)(2) modification proceedings should be available to permit the district court to revisit a prior sentence to whatever extent the sentencing range in question was a relevant part of the analytic framework the judge used to determine the sentence or to approve the agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2692-93. In a concurrence, Justice Sotomayor concluded that sentences imposed pursuant to a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement are based on the plea agreement itself and not the applicable Guidelines sentence range. <em>Id. </em>at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2696. However, Justice Soto-mayor concluded that \u201cwhen a [Rule 11(c)(1)(C) ] agreement expressly uses a Guidelines sentencing range to establish the term of imprisonment, and that range is subsequently lowered by the Commission, the defendant is eligible for sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2698.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-15\">In <em>Lawson, </em>we held that the offense level and Guidelines sentence range for career offenders were not lowered by Amendment 750. <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321. We specifically addressed <em>Freeman\u2019s </em>impact on <em>Moore </em>and held that <em>Moore </em>remained binding precedent. <em>Id. </em>We stated that, \u201c[u]nder <em>Marks </em>[v. <em>United States, </em>430 U.S. 188, 97 S.Ct. 990, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977) ], Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurring opinion can be viewed as the holding in <em>Freeman,\u201d </em>but we determined that \u201ceven if the plurality opinion contained the holding, <em>Freeman </em>would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>overrule <em>Moore.\u201d Id. </em>at 1321 n. 2. We concluded that <em>Freeman </em>was not \u201cclearly on point\u201d as to the issue addressed in <em>Moore </em>regarding the eligibility of career offenders for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief based on the retroactive lowering of crack cocaine base offense levels. <em>Id. </em>at 1321 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\">On August 3, 2010, Congress enacted the FSA, which increased the amounts of crack cocaine required to trigger the higher statutory-maximum sentences and the mandatory minimum sentences in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1). Pub.L. No. 111-120, 124 Stat. 2372 (2010). Under the FSA, the 10-year mandatory minimum and the life statutory maximum apply to offenses involving 280 grams or more of crack cocaine, and the 5-year mandatory minimum and the 40-year statutory maximum apply to offenses involving 28 grams or more of crack cocaine, respectively. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (b)(1)(A)(iii), (b)(l)(B)(iii) (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">The Supreme Court has held that the FSA\u2019s lower statutory penalties apply to a defendant who committed his offense before, but was sentenced after, the FSA\u2019s enactment. <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>567 U.S. -, -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2326, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012). The Court observed that \u201capplication of the new minimums to pre-Act offenders sentenced after [the FSA\u2019s enactment] will create a new set of disparities,\u201d but explained that \u201cin federal sentencing the ordinary practice is to apply new penalties to defendants not yet sentenced, while withholding that change from defendants already sentenced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 132 S.Ct. at 2335. Therefore, the Court concluded, the \u201cnew disparity\u201d between \u201cthose pre-Act offenders already sentenced and those not yet sentenced as of [the FSA\u2019s enactment]\u201d was insufficient reason to exclude the yet-to-be-sentenced offenders from the lower statutory penalties. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\"><em>Dorsey </em>\u201ccarefully confined its application of the FSA to pre-Act offenders who were sentenced after the Act\u2019s effective date.\u201d <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 378 (11th Cir.2012). The changes in the FSA to the statutory sentences provide no foundation for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and do not permit a district court to reduce the sentence of a defendant sentenced before the FSA\u2019s effective date. <em>Id. </em>at 377-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">Here, the District Court did not err in denying Conaway\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Conaway\u2019s claim that Amendment 750\u2019s reduction of the base offense levels for cocaine base warranted him a sentence reduction is foreclosed by our holding in <em>Lawson </em>that Amendment 750 did not lower the Guidelines sentence range applicable to defendants sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B 1.1. His claim that he could be resentenced directly under the FSA lacked merit because the FSA\u2019s reduced statutory penalties did not apply to defendants, such as he, who were sentenced before its enactment. Further, the FSA is a statutory amendment enacted by Congress, not a retroactive guideline amendment by the U.S. Sentencing Commission, and, thus, cannot serve as the basis for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b923-10\">.
