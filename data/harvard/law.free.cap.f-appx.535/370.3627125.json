The district court dismissed his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition as untimely. This court granted Smith a COA on the issue of \u201cwhether the district court erred in finding that Smith was not entitled to the benefit of the prison mailbox rule in connection with his direct review writ application to the state supreme court and thus, that his petition was [not timely] filed[.]\u201d <em>Smith v. Cain, </em>No. 12-30680 (5th Cir. Oct. 26, 2012). Our review is limited to issues for which a COA has been granted. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c); <em>United States v. Kimler, </em>150 F.3d 429, 430 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Lackey v. Johnson, </em>116 F.3d 149, 151-52 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Although pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); see <em>also </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a). Because Smith does not address the only issue upon which a COA was granted, he has abandoned that issue on appeal. <em>See Yohey </em>985 F.2d at 224-25. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b395-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
