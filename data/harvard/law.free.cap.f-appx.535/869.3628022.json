She suffered a fractured hip and pelvis, lacerations, and head trauma, and was unable to return to work for some time. As a result, she received worker\u2019s compensation benefits under the Federal Employees Compensation Act (\u201cFECA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8101-8152, from the Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs (\u201cOWCP\u201d). FECA compensates partially disabled employees so long as the disability persists, unless the employee refuses to work after the employer offers a suitable position. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 8106(a), (c). By December 2001, Hunter had recovered enough to return to the USPS in a part-time clerk position, supervised by Laura Newby, the Leeds Postmaster. Her workers\u2019 compensation was reduced accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-20\">In June 2002, Hunter\u2019s physical therapist evaluated her and determined she was \u201ccapable of sustaining light demand level work up to an eight hour day.\u201d This included lifting up to 20 pounds, frequent sitting, standing, kneeling, climbing steps, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>and walking, as well as occasional stooping, repetitive squatting, and repetitive trunk rotation. Accordingly, the therapist recommended Hunter return to work with accommodations for the restrictions he identified. In August, Hunter\u2019s physician agreed with these findings and concluded that Hunter could return to work full-time so long as the USPS accounted for her limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">In October 2002, Newby extended Hunter a \u201cLimited Duty Job Offer\u201d for a clerk position working eight hours per day, which Hunter accepted. Meanwhile, a USPS injury compensation manager worked with Newby to make accommodations to bring Hunter\u2019s original mail-carrier position within her restrictions. The two decided such accommodations were practicable and, in June 2003, the USPS extended Hunter a \u201cPermanent Job Accommodation,\u201d which would return her to her mail-carrier position but would include accommodations. Hunter refused the offer, and the OWCP ultimately deemed that offer \u2014 as well as a subsequent one that Hunter also rejected \u2014 inadequate because it failed to describe in sufficient detail the accommodations planned. At that point, the USPS placed Hunter on administrative leave. Then, in February 2004, Linda Hollis, another USPS employee who had served as a part-time clerk, was selected to serve as a permanent clerk. In June 2005, the USPS again offered Hunter permanent modified employment in her original mail-carrier position. This time, the OWCP reviewed the offer and deemed it suitable under FECA. Hunter, however, refused the offer once again. Because Hunter refused the offer, OWCP held a hearing and then terminated her FECA benefits. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8106(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">In October 2005, the USPS sent Hunter a notice to report to work. When Hunter did not report, the USPS sent her a notification of removal from employment dated December 15, 2005. Hunter contacted the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) on March 17, 2007. Her termination from the USPS became final on April 12, 2007. Four days later, Hunter submitted a formal EEO complaint, arguing she was discriminated against based on physical disability when she was \u201cissued a Notice of Removal for Failure to Maintain a Regular Work Schedule.\u201d The EEOC issued Hunter a right-to-sue letter on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">Hunter then filed her complaint in the district court, alleging the USPS discriminated against her in violation of the Rehabilitation Act by (1) \u201cremov[ing] her from her accommodated position due to her disability\u201d and \u201caward[ing the position] to a non-disabled comparator,\u201d Linda Hollis; and (2) terminating her due to her disability. The district court rendered summary judgment on these claims in favor of the USPS. This is Hunter\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Robinson v. Tyson Foods, Inc., </em>595 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir.2010). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). \u201cWe draw all factual inferences in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Shiver v. Chertoff, </em>549 F.3d 1342, 1343 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">\u201cThe [Rehabilitation] Act prohibits federal agencies from discriminating in employment against otherwise qualified individuals with a disability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1344 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe remedies, procedures, and rights of Title VII are available to plaintiffs filing complaints under the Rehabilitation Act.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b896-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>\u201cTo establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the [Rehabilitation] Act, an individual must show that (1) [s]he has a disability; (2) [s]he is otherwise qualified for the position; and (3) [s]he was subjected to unlawful discrimination as the result of [her] disability.\u201d <em>Sutton v. Lader, </em>185 F.3d 1203, 1207 (11th Cir.1999). Under the Rehabilitation Act, as under Title VII, \u201cfederal employees are required to initiate administrative review of any alleged discriminatory or retaliatory conduct with the appropriate agency within 45 days of the alleged discriminatory act,\u201d or, \u201c[w]hen the discriminatory act results in a personnel action, ... \u2018within 45 days of the effective date of the action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shiver, </em>549 F.3d at 1344 (quoting 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.105(a)(1)). When a plaintiff fails to initiate EEO contact within this period, her claim is generally barred for failure to exhaust remedies. <em>Id. </em>And although we apply equitable tolling rules to the deadlines, we toll them only sparingly, such as when a plaintiff has actively pursued remedies but filed a defective timely pleading or when she was induced or tricked by her employer\u2019s misconduct into allowing the deadline to pass. <em>Irwin v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>498 U.S. 89, 96, 111 S.Ct. 453, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Here, the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s administrative exhaustion requirement bars Hunter\u2019s claim that she was removed from her clerk position and replaced by Linda Hollis, a non-disabled employee. Hollis took over as a full-time clerk in February 2004, more than three years before Hunter initiated EEOC contact. And equitable tolling of the Act\u2019s 45-day time period for contact is not warranted in this case. There is no evidence in the record that the USPS induced or tricked Hunter into allowing the deadline to pass or that she otherwise tried to initiate contact. <em>See Irwin, </em>498 U.S. at 96, 111 S.Ct. 453. Instead, Hunter relies on the fact that the USPS \u201csent her home\u201d when she rejected its June 2003 offer and contends she should not be held responsible for learning what transpired at the post office while she was away. Without more, this is insufficient to permit us to toll the 45-day period. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, Hunter\u2019s claim that she was removed from her clerk position and replaced by a non-disabled comparator in violation of the Rehabilitation Act is barred from review.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">Hunter\u2019s other claim \u2014 that the USPS terminated her because of her disability in violation of the Rehabilitation Act \u2014 is the only one she exhausted. In rendering summary judgment in favor of the USPS, the district court concluded that Hunter failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the Act because she could not show she was disabled. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">A person is disabled within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act if \u201ca physical or mental impairment ... substantially limits one or more of the major life activities\u201d of that person. <em>Cash v. Smith, </em>231 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir.2000).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hunter bears the burden of \u201coffering evidence that the extent of the limitation\u201d caused by the impairment is substantial. <em>Greenberg v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., </em>498 F.3d 1258, 1264 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). She contends, with no evidentiary support, that she has substantial impairments in sleep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>ing, manual tasks, and her general quality of life, including her ability to garden and care for her grandchildren. These amorphous, unsupported assertions, however, are exactly the kind we have dismissed as insufficient in similar cases. <em>See id. </em>(affirming summary judgment when plaintiff put forth no <em>evidence </em>to support his assertions of disability); <em>see also Rossbach v. City of Miami, </em>371 F.3d 1354, 1358 (11th Cir.2004) (holding plaintiffs who claimed their ability to walk, sit, stand, and sleep was \u201cmoderately below average\u201d were not disabled). For this reason, the district court correctly rendered summary judgment in favor of the USPS on Hunter\u2019s claim that she was unlawfully terminated for her disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b894-13\">. The district court also granted summary judgment in favor of the USPS on Hunter's claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\u201d). Hunter has expressly abandoned that claim on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b896-6\">. The standard for determining whether a person is disabled under the Rehabilitation Act is the same as under the ADA. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 791(g). Congress amended that standard in 2008, but all of the relevant conduct in this case occurred prior to the amendments. We accordingly use the standards in place before those amendments\u2019 passage.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
