Riquenes procured 2,106 suspected oxycodone pills,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and two other co-conspirators arranged to sell them to a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) confidential informant. On appeal, Riquenes argues that: (1) his unsophisticated and limited role in the conspiracy merited a two-level minor role reduction to his offense level; and (2) his sentence, even though representing a 10-month downward variance from the advisory guideline range of 46 to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment, is substantively unreasonable. After a thorough review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">I. Minor Role Reduction</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">We review a district court\u2019s factual determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense for clear error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 938 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc); <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e) (\u201cThe court of appeals ... shall accept the findings of fact of the district court unless they are clearly erroneous ....\u201d). The proponent of the downward adjustment \u201calways bears the burden of proving a mitigating role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">A defendant who is a \u201cminor participant\u201d in a criminal offense receives a two-level reduction to his base offense level. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A minor participant is a participant who is \u201cless culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, cmt. n. 5; <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.2, cmt. n. 4 (explaining that a \u201cminimal participant\u201d is \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-11\">Although the district court\u2019s factual determination regarding a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is entitled to deference, it \u201cshould be informed by two principles discerned from the Guidelines: first, the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which [he] has been held accountable at sentencing, and, second, [his] role as compared to that of other participants in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940. With regard to the first principle, \u201cthe district court must measure the defendant\u2019s role against [his] relevant conduct, that is, the conduct for which [he] has been held accountable\u201d in calculating his base offense level. <em>United States v. Keen, </em>676 F.3d 981, 997 (11th Cir.) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 573, 184 L.Ed.2d 377 (2012). As for the second principle, the district court may make an assessment of relative culpability among the various participants in a criminal offense that were involved in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant. <em>See Keen, </em>676 F.3d at 997. Even if a defendant played a lesser role in the relevant criminal conduct, \u201cit is possible that none are minor or minimal participants,\u201d and so the district court \u201cmust determine that the defendant was less culpable than <em>most other participants </em>in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 944 (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-13\">Here, Riquenes did not carry his burden to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he was entitled to a minor role reduction to his offense level, and the district court\u2019s determination to the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>trary was not clearly erroneous. <em>See id. </em>at 938. In keeping with the first principle of <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>the district court looked to the extent that Riquenes was involved in the relevant conduct of his offense, and determined that the relevant conduct encompassed only the drugs with which Ri-quenes was personally involved. <em>See id. </em>at 940-42. Then, looking to the relative culpability of all of the participants and concluding that they were responsible for the same relevant conduct, the district court determined that it was ultimately Ri-quenes who found and negotiated with the oxycodone supplier \u2014 actions which constituted a significant degree of responsibility. Accordingly, the district court concluded that Riquenes was not less culpable than the other participants in the conspiracy. The district court had \u201cconsiderable discretion\u201d in making this factual determination, and we conclude that its decision was not clearly erroneous. <em>See id. </em>at 946.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">II. Substantive Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence using a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1165 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc). We will vacate a sentence \u201cif, but only if, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1190 (internal quotation marks omitted). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of showing it to be \u201cunreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Langston, </em>590 F.3d 1226, 1236 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">The district court must issue a punishment \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d of sentencing. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). These purposes include the need for a sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, to provide just punishment, to deter criminal conduct, and to protect the public from future criminal conduct. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2). Additional considerations include the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the applicable guideline range, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (4)(A), and (6). The \u201cweight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). We will not \u201cset aside a sentence merely because we would have decided that another one is more appropriate.... A district court\u2019s sentence need not be the most appropriate one, it need only be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1191 (citations omitted). \u201c[W]e ordinarily expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). The fact that a given sentence is lower than the statutory maximum may also be an indicator of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Valnor, </em>451 F.3d 744, 751-52 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">Riquenes has not carried his burden to show that his sentence, which represented a 10-month downward variance from the guideline range, was unreasonable, or that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190. The district court recognized its obligation to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and explicitly considered Riquenes\u2019s familial and economic situation, as well as his unsophisticated participation in an un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>sophisticated oxycodone scheme; on the other hand, the district court recognized the criminal severity of oxycodone distribution. The district court also noted that Riquenes had no criminal history and was unlikely to appear before it again on a similar offense, but that general deterrence principles favored a sentence exemplifying the significant consequences for drug offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">As for any sentencing disparity between Riquenes and his co-conspirators, Ri-quenes has not shown that the district court\u2019s refusal to impose a greater downward variance based on this factor is unreasonable. Similar to its analysis of the minor-role reduction issue, the district court stated that Riquenes\u2019s role was significant, and the court could reasonably have credited the government\u2019s assertion that the co-conspirator\u2019s role \u2014 which was one of mere introduction between the oxy-codone dealer and Riquenes \u2014 indeed merited a lighter sentence. The weighing of these \u00a7 3558(a) factors was committed to the district court\u2019s \u201csound discretion,\u201d and Riquenes has not shown that these conclu-' sions were unreasonable. <em>See Williams, </em>526 F.3d at 1322; <em>see also Langston, </em>590 F.3d at 1237. Additionally, Riquenes\u2019s sentence is below the guideline range and significantly below the statutory maximum term of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment, both of which are additional indicia of reasonableness. <em>See Hunt, </em>526 F.3d at 746; <em>Valnor, </em>451 F.3d at 751-52; <em>see also </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b811-8\">. Although Riquenes and his co-conspirators believed the pills to be oxycodone, the pills later tested negative for controlled substances.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
