He also challenges the district court\u2019s imposition of a 10-year period of ineligibility for federal benefits, arguing that his offense was not a distribution offense for purposes of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 862.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-21\">Garcia contends that his 235-month sentence is unreasonable and greater than necessary as measured by the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He asserts that the career offender Sentencing Guideline, U.S.S.G. 4B1.1, conflicts with \u00a7 3553(a)(1), which requires the sentencing court to consider the particular nature and circumstances of the offense and the defendant\u2019s personal history and characteristics and that his guidelines range overstated the seriousness of his offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-22\">The record reflects that the district court made an individualized determination at sentencing that a 235-month sentence was appropriate based on the facts presented and that the court considered Garcia\u2019s arguments for a lesser sentence, as well as the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Garcia fails to rebut the presumption of reasonableness accorded his below-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). Thus, he has not shown error, plain or otherwise, and his \u201cdisagreement with the propriety of the sentence imposed does not suffice to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to [his] sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-23\">Because Garcia did not object to the 10-year denial of federal benefits in the district court, review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Silva-De Hoyos, </em>702 F.3d 843, 848 (5th Cir.2012). To show plain error, Garcia must demonstrate that (1) there was an error, (2) it was clear or obvious, and (3) it affected his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes that showing, this court has the discretion to correct the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>error, but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Because Garcia\u2019s offense of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute was not an offense consisting of the distribution of controlled substances under \u00a7 862(a), the district court erred in imposing the 10-year ineligibility period, that error was plain, and it affected Garcia\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See Silva-De Hoyos, </em>702 F.3d at 849-50. Garcia, however, has not identified any federal benefit to which he is eligible or might be eligible to receive during the 10-year ineligibility period imposed by the district court. <em>See id. </em>at 850. Because the district court\u2019s error did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b421-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
