Hendrix\u2019s suit claims that the defendants discriminated between similarly situated inmates in awarding \u201cgain time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b828-10\">The district court dismissed Hendrix\u2019s claim for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). Of importance here, the district court found that Hendrix \u201cfail[ed] to state any facts ... that would make it appear even remotely plausible that the named defendants could be held liable ... under the controlling standards for supervisory liability.\u201d Hendrix timely filed a notice of appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-17\">We are also aware that Hendrix previously made a similar claim in state court in a Petition for Writ of Mandamus, which the state court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-19\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s sua sponte dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), viewing the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1159-60 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-20\">Section 1915 provides, in relevant part, that a court shall dismiss a prisoner\u2019s case at any time if the court determines that the action or appeal \u201cfails to state a claim on which relief may be granted.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). The language in this subsection \u201ctracks the language of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), and we will apply Rule 12(b)(6) standards in reviewing dismissals under section 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Farcass, </em>112 F.3d 1483, 1490 (11th Cir.1997). Thus, to survive \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), \u201ca complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quotation marks omitted). In civil rights cases, \u201c[m]ore than mere conclusory notice pleading is required.... A complaint will be dismissed as insufficient where the allegations it contains are vague and concluso-ry.\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>325 F.3d 1228, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>1235 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\"><em>\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-11\">After careful consideration, we conclude that the district court did not err in dismissing Hendrix\u2019s claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) because the complaint did not \u201ccontain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief\u2019 against the defendants, based on a theory of supervisory liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-12\">Supervisors can be held \u201cliable under ... \u00a7 1983, for the unconstitutional acts of [their] subordinates if [they] personally participated in the allegedly unconstitutional conduct or if there is a causal connection between [their] actions ... and the alleged constitutional deprivation.\u201d <em>Douglas v. Yates, </em>535 F.3d 1316, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation marks omitted). A plaintiff may establish a causal connection by showing that: (1) \u201ca history of widespread abuse puts the responsible supervisor on notice of the need to correct the alleged deprivation and he fail[ed] to do so\u201d; (2) \u201cthe supervisor\u2019s improper custom or policy le[d] to deliberate indifference to constitutional rights\u201d; or (3) \u201cfacts support an inference that the supervisor directed the subordinates to act unlawfully or knew that the subordinates would act unlawfully and failed to stop them from doing so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe standard by which a supervisor is held liable in her individual capacity for the actions of a subordinate is extremely rigorous.\u201d <em>Doe v. School Bd. of Broward County, Fla., </em>604 F.3d 1248, 1266 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-13\">Even if Hendrix\u2019s complaint is construed liberally, <em>see Tannenbaum, </em>148 F.3d at 1263, it was insufficient to support supervisory liability, <em>see Douglas, </em>535 F.3d at 1322. Hendrix\u2019s amended complaint alleges two potential grounds for supervisory liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">First, Hendrix attempts to establish a causal connection by arguing that the defendants were \u201con notice of the need to correct the alleged deprivation and [they] fail[ed] to do so.\u201d <em>See Douglas, </em>535 F.3d at 1322. Hendrix asserts that the defendants were on notice because they were aware of his administrative grievances and state court litigation. However, \u201c[t]he deprivations that constitute widespread abuse sufficient to notify the supervising official must be obvious, flagrant, rampant and of continued duration, rather than isolated occurrences.\u201d <em>Hartley v. Parnell, </em>193 F.3d 1263, 1269 (11th Cir.1999). And, as demonstrated by, for example, the outcome of the state court litigation, which determined that Hendrix\u2019s claims had no merit, there was not \u201cobvious, flagrant, [and] rampant\u201d abuse here, sufficient to support supervisory liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Second, Hendrix\u2019s complaint states there is \u201ca long standing policy, practice, and custom of treating similarly situated prisoners differently in this application of gain time.\u201d <em>See Douglas, </em>535 F.3d at 1322. However, Hendrix does not plead any specific facts to support this concluso-ry statement. Hendrix\u2019s \u201cvague and con-elusory\u201d statements are insufficient to support supervisory liability. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>325 F.3d at 1235 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b828-11\">. Hendrix raises two arguments on appeal. First, he argues that his complaint sufficiently stated a claim that his constitutional rights were violated because he was treated differently from similarly situated individuals. Second, he argues that the defendants could be held liable under the theory of supervisory liability. Because the issue of supervisory liability was central to the district court\u2019s decision and is determinative in this case, we need not consider Hendrix\u2019s first argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
