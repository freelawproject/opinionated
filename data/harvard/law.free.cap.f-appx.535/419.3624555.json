On appeal, he argues that the district court erred in treating his prior conviction for sexual assault of a child under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 22.011(a)(2) as a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), and as an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1326(b)(2), as defined by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A). Villa-nueva\u2019s arguments are foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d 541, 562-63 &amp; n. 28 (5th Cir.2013) (en banc), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(June 6, 2013)(No. 12-10695). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
