He argues that the defendants\u2019 prosecution of him for capital murder was malicious because they were allowed to elicit testimony from his wife, Lakentra Payne, in violation of Mississippi\u2019s spousal-privilege law; Lakentra\u2019s statements were coerced, because Alan Thompson threatened to take away her baby if she did not cooperate; Lakentra could not find the exact location of the victim\u2019s body; Thompson did not search for a gun, even though Lakentra told investigators where it was hidden; Payne was prosecuted because he had previously been acquitted for bank robbery in Marshall County; and he was acquitted of the murder charge. Payne maintains that, without Lakentra\u2019s testimony, there was no probable cause to prosecute him.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">We review the district court\u2019s ruling <em>de novo, </em>employing the same standard used by that court. <em>McFaul v. Valenzuela, </em>684 F.3d 564, 571 (5th Cir.2012). Federal law does not recognize an independent constitutional claim of malicious prosecution. <em>Cuadra v. Hous. Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>626 F.3d 808, 812-13 (5th Cir.2010); <em>Castellano v. Fragozo, </em>352 F.3d 939, 945 (5th Cir.2003) (en banc). The claimant must instead allege \u201cthat officials violated specific constitutional rights in connection with a malicious prosecution.\u201d <em>Cuadra, </em>626 F.3d at 812 (internal quotations marks and citation omitted); <em>Deville v. Marcante, </em>567 F.3d 156, 169 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">Payne\u2019s contention that the spousal privilege barred Lakentra\u2019s testimony and that, without her testimony, there was no probable cause to prosecute him is merit-less. That privilege did not apply, because Lakentra testified about events that occurred in the presence of the victim or as to controversies between them. <em>See Maiben v. State, </em>405 So.2d 87, 89-90 (Miss.1981); Car<em>penter v. State, </em>102 So.3d 290, 293-94 (Miss.App.2012). Additionally, there is no evidence that Thompson coerced Lakentra\u2019s testimony, and her testimony, which was corroborated in part by the discovery of the victim\u2019s remains, provided probable cause to prosecute. <em>Cuadra, </em>626 F.3d at 813. Finally, to the extent that Payne is raising a state-law claim concerning the spousal privilege, it is not cognizable under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Sw. Bell Tel., LP v. City of Hous., </em>529 F.3d 257, 260 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b468-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
