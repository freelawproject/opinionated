She alleged that, in response, OLOL retaliated against her by, among other things, reducing her pay and terminating her employment. The district court granted summary judgment for OLOL. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">I. Facts and Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Robinson began working for OLOL as a \u201cNurse Tech II\u201d in June 2008. Soon after, she became a \u201cSurgical Tech\u201d earning $20 per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Robinson received her nursing degree in December 2008. She secured a temporary nursing permit pending the results of her licensing exam, and, in January 2009, joined OLOL\u2019s operating room nurse internship program. She received a corresponding pay increase to $21.88 per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">After joining the internship program, Robinson learned that she did not pass the exam. OLOL reclassified her as a \u201cSurgical Tech,\u201d but continued to pay the same salary until February 2010.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Supervisor Holly Leonard met with Robinson for a counseling session on September 16, 2009. Leonard explained: that Robinson was often late to work; that she did not clock in or out appropriately; that she confused patients\u2019 specimens; and that she returned to work with a cut on her hand without appropriate clearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">Robinson proceeded to report to OLOL that she overheard a conversation between two white co-workers, one of whom was Mandy Wilson, in which Wilson referred to a black employee, Danielle Davis, as a \u201cn* * * * * b* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">An investigation followed. Wilson at first denied making racial, or otherwise derogatory, comments. However, she later admitted that \u201cshe probably did call [Davis] a \u2018b* * * *.\u2019 \u201d \u201c[B]ased on her lack of honesty ... in the beginning of the investigation,\u201d OLOL terminated Wilson in October 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-16\">Wilson continued to visit the OLOL campus after her termination. Following one visit, Robinson wrote to her supervisors that she was \u201cso afraid for [her] safety [due to Wilson\u2019s appearance],\u201d and that she was \u201cconstantly looking over [her] shoulder.\u201d In response, OLOL compliance officer Lisa Boston told Robinson that Wilson \u201cwould no longer be coming to the Surgery department and that all leaders in Surgery were aware that she should not return to the employee[-]only areas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-17\">Robinson called Boston on March 17, 2010 to report that Wilson again was on the \u2022 OLOL campus. On the same day, Boston received a phone call from Davis, who had been terminated the day before. Davis said that she \u201chad been called and texted by a friend who works at\u201d OLOL, and that the \u201cfriend\u201d had told her that Wilson \u201cwas back working in the OR.\u201d Boston asked Davis who sent her the text. Davis started to respond that it was \u201cSa,\u201d but \u201cthen caught herself [and] asked why [Boston] wanted to know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-18\">In a March 18, 2010 meeting, Boston asked Robinson whether she had sent text messages the day before to phone numbers purportedly belonging to Davis. Robinson replied that she did not recall Davis\u2019 number. Boston asked Robinson to produce her cell phone. Robinson responded that she was \u201cnot telling [Boston] anything.\u201d Boston \u201cexplained that [she] would have to recommend to Human Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>sources the termination of [Robinson\u2019s] employment because she refused to participate in the investigation.\u201d Robinson said \u201c[f]ine\u201d and \u201cwalked out of the room.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Melissa Guerin, a human resources employee, informed Robinson in a subsequent meeting that OLOL would not, in fact, end her employment. Instead, Guerin told Robinson that she would be given a \u201cDecision Day\u201d to \u201cdecide whether she would like to return to work and re-commit as a team player.\u201d Robinson \u201cstated that she wanted to remain a part of the team.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Robinson then went \u201cstraight to [Boston\u2019s] office to discuss the investigation [into Wilson\u2019s visit to the OLOL campus] with [Boston].\u201d Boston reported to OLOL management that Robinson acted in an \u201cinappropriate\u201d and \u201cunprofessional\u201d manner that \u201cwas not in keeping\u201d with OLOL standards. Citing her \u201cunprofessional behavior,\u201d OLOL terminated Robinson\u2019s employment on March 25, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Robinson filed suit against OLOL, alleging, among other things, that she-was retaliated against in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The district court granted summary judgment for OLOL, holding that Robinson did not establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation because she did not establish the requisite causal link between her report of the racial epithet and OLOL\u2019s reduction of her pay and termination of her employment. Alternatively, the district court found that Robinson did not show that OLOL\u2019s reasons for reducing her pay and terminating her employment were pretextual. Robinson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo </em>and apply the same standards as the district court. Summary judgment is proper if the pleadings and evidence show there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Hernandez v. Yellow Transp., Inc., </em>670 F.3d 644, 650 (5th Cir.) (internal citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 136, 184 L.Ed.2d 29 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-15\">III. Robinson\u2019s Retaliation Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b375-16\">\u201cA plaintiff establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation by showing (i) he engaged in a protected activity, (ii) an adverse employment action occurred, and (iii) there was a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-17\">A. \u201c[Robinson] engaged in a protected activity\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-18\">The district court found that Robinson \u201cengaged in a protected activity\u201d when she reported Wilson\u2019s racial epithet to OLOL on September 16, 2009. On appeal, Robinson suggests that, for the purpose of evaluating whether there was a \u201ccausal link between the protected activity and the adverse employment action,\u201d discussed below, she engaged in additional protected activities: filing a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) on December 16, 2009, and reporting various grievances to OLOL on January 28, 2010.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, Robinson does not maintain, and the record does not support, that she raised these arguments in district court. Indeed, in an exhibit attached to her complaint, under the heading <em>\u201cPrima Facie Case of Discrimination,\u201d </em>Robinson wrote that she \u201cengaged in protected activity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>under Title VII <em>by reporting the use of racially inappropriate comments in the work place.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Because \u201cthis court cannot decide disputed issues of material fact,\u201d and because Robinson did not \u201cset forth specific facts, by affidavits or otherwise, to show there is a genuine issue for trial\u201d as to whether she engaged in these additional protected activities, she waived these arguments on appeal. <em>Topalian v. Ehrman, </em>954 F.2d 1125, 1132 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">B. \u201can adverse employment action occurred\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Robinson alleged an assortment of grievances \u2014 for example, problems with \u201ccoworkers ... attempting to retaliate against her\u201d \u2014 that she contends qualify as adverse employment actions. The district court found that only the reduction in Robinson\u2019s pay and the termination of her employment qualified. On appeal, Robinson argues that the district court \u201cerred in looking at the context of the continuing complaints ... in a piecemeal fashion,\u201d and that, viewed in context, her various grievances amount to adverse employment actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">\u201cTo constitute prohibited retaliation, an employment action must be \u2018materially adverse,\u2019 one that would \u2018dissuade[] a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\u2019 The purpose of this objective standard is \u2018to separate significant from trivial harms\u2019 and \u2018filter out complaints attacking the ordinary tribulations of the workplace, such as the sporadic use of abusive language, gender-related jokes, and occasional teasing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stewart v. Miss. Transp. Comm\u2019n, </em>586 F.3d 321, 331 (5th Cir.2009) (alteration in original) (internal citation omitted) (quoting <em>Burlington N. &amp; S.F.R. Co. v. White, </em>548 U.S. 53, 68, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006)). Although \u201carguably adverse employment actions must be viewed in context,\u201d <em>McCoy v. City of Shreveport, </em>492 F.3d 551, 560 (5th Cir.2007) (per curiam), \u201c[a]n employee\u2019s decision to report discriminatory behavior cannot immunize that employee from those petty slights or minor annoyances that often take place at work and that all employees experience.\u201d <em>White, </em>548 U.S. at 68, 126 S.Ct. 2405. In other words, \u201cTitle VII ... does not set forth \u2018a general civility code for the American workplace.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., </em>523 U.S. 75, 80, 118 S.Ct. 998, 140 L.Ed.2d 201 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">Here, even viewed in context,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the alleged adverse employment actions do not reach the requisite level of materiality, <em>see Stewart, </em>586 F.3d at 331, to qualify as adverse employment actions. Robinson does not identify, and we could not find, cases in which conduct similar to her alleged grievances has amounted to an adverse employment action. For example, Robinson\u2019s allegation that her \u201ccoworkers [were] attempting to retaliate against her,\u201d apparently reduces to the fact that, once she reported the racial epithet, she was subject to \u201cstares, whispering, [and] employees not be[ing] cordial,\u201d resulting in a \u201chostile work environment.\u201d However, the complained-of conduct-for example, being reported because one of her earrings was exposed in the operating room-was not \u201csevere or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work envi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>ronment.\u201d <em>Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., </em>510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993); <em>see, e.g., Earle v. Aramark Corp., </em>247 Fed.Appx. 519, 524 (5th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (observing that \u201cdisciplinary write-ups\u201d and \u201cmicro-managing\u201d are not \u201cmaterially adverse employment actions\u201d); <em>Stingley v. Den-Mar, Inc., </em>347 Fed.Appx. 14, 19 (5th Cir.2009) (per cu-riam) (observing that an unsubstantiated \u201cbelief that [a co-worker] maliciously talked about [plaintiff] and caused others to treat her less cordially\u201d was \u201cinsufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether [plaintiff] suffered a materially adverse employment action\u201d). Robinson also suggests that OLOL endangered her safety, and showed indifference to her concerns, by continuing to allow Wilson on campus. However, Robinson does not explain how this amounts to an adverse employment action, let alone one that is material-particularly given that Robinson never interacted with Wilson, and that OLOL warned Wilson not to enter employee-only areas of the hospital. Accordingly, because \u201c[t]he allegedly retaliatory incidents of which [Robinson] complains are either unsupported by the record or so \u2018trivial\u2019 that they do not appear to be the sort of actions that would dissuade a reasonable employee from reporting discrimination,\u201d <em>Grice v. FMC Techs. Inc, </em>216 Fed.Appx. 401, 407 (5th Cir.2007) (per curiam), the district court did not err in finding that only the reduction in pay and termination of employment amounted to adverse employment actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">C. \u201cthere was a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse employment action\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Given our discussion above, whether there is a sufficient \u201ccausal link\u201d reduces to whether there is a close enough connection between Robinson\u2019s report of the racial epithet (\u201cthe protected activity\u201d) and the reduction in Robinson\u2019s pay and termination of her employment (\u201cthe adverse employment aetion[s]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">\u201cClose timing between an employee\u2019s protected activity and an adverse action against him may provide the \u2018causal connection\u2019 required to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation.\u201d <em>Swanson v. Gen. Servs. Admin., </em>110 F.3d 1180, 1188 (5th Cir.1997). \u201cHowever, we have made clear that \u2018the mere fact that some adverse action is taken <em>after </em>an employee engages in some protected activity will not <em>always </em>be enough for a <em>prima facie </em>case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Roberson v. Alltel Info. Servs., </em>373 F.3d 647, 655 (5th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Swanson, </em>110 F.3d at 1188 n. 3). Indeed, \u201c[t]he cases that accept mere temporal proximity between an employer\u2019s knowledge of protected activity and an adverse employment action as sufficient evidence of causality to establish a prima facie case uniformly hold that the temporal proximity must be \u2018very close.\u2019 \u201d <em>Clark Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, </em>532 U.S. 268, 273, 121 S.Ct. 1508, 149 L.Ed.2d 509 (2001). This court has observed that \u201ca time lapse of <em>up to </em>four months has been found sufficient to satisfy the causal connection for summary judgment purposes,\u201d <em>Evans v. City of Houston, </em>246 F.3d 344, 354 (5th Cir.2001) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted), whereas a time lapse of five months does not, without additional evidence of retaliation, establish causation. <em>See Raggs v. Miss. Power &amp; Light Co., </em>278 F.3d 463, 472 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Here, there is insufficient evidence of a connection between Robinson\u2019s report of the racial epithet and the reduction in her pay and termination of her employment to establish the requisite causal link. Almost five months elapsed between Robinson\u2019s September 16, 2009 report of the racial epithet and her February 14, 2010 reduction in pay. More than six months elapsed between her report of the epithet and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>March 25, 2010 termination of her employment. Five and six month gaps, respectively, between a protected activity and an adverse employment action, are not \u201cvery close\u201d for the purpose of establishing a causal link, <em>see Evans, </em>246 F.3d at 354; <em>Raggs, </em>278 F.3d at 472, and Robinson did not introduce additional evidence of causation. Accordingly, she did not establish the requisite causal link.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">In sum, because Robinson has not established a causal link between her report of the racial epithet and the reduction in her pay and termination of her employment, the district court correctly found that she did not allege a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">D. The Burden-Shifting Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Even assuming that Robinson established a <em>prima fade </em>case, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">\u201cIf the plaintiff successfully presents a <em>prima fade </em>case, the burden shifts to the employer to provide a \u2018legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the adverse employment action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hernandez, </em>670 F.3d at 657 (quoting <em>Long v. Eastfield Coll., </em>88 F.3d 300, 304-05 (5th Cir.1996)). \u201cIf the defendant presents evidence that supports that it acted properly, the fact-finder must decide whether retaliation was the but-for cause for the employer\u2019s action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[A] plaintiff may avoid summary judgment on \u2018but for\u2019 causation by demonstrating \u2018a conflict in substantial evidence on this ultimate issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 660 (quoting <em>Long, </em>88 F.3d at 308). \u201cEvidence is \u2018substantial\u2019 if it is of such quality and weight that reasonable and fair-minded men in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions.\u201d <em>Long, </em>88 F.3d at 308 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Here, OLOL has proffered legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for the adverse employment actions in question, and Robinson has not shown that retaliation was the but-for cause of the actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">First, OLOL explained that it reduced Robinson\u2019s pay because it noticed, while reviewing its budget, that her pay had not been lowered when, after not passing her licensing exam, she was reclassified as a \u201cSurgical Tech.\u201d Robinson argues that she never was overpaid because an OLOL email indicated that her pay \u201cwas equal to that of another surgical tech.\u201d However, as OLOL observes, the email states that Robinson was making \u201cthe same <em>and more </em>than 2 of [OLOL\u2019s] <em>most tenured </em>\u201d surgical techs. (Emphasis added.) Further, Robinson\u2019s argument that OLOL could have discovered the pay discrepancy before February 2010 is speculative, and, given OLOL\u2019s record evidence to the contrary, does not create a genuine issue of material fact. <em>See, e.g., S.E.C. v. Recile, </em>10 F.3d 1093, 1097 n. 15 (5th Cir.1993) (per curiam) (observing that a \u201cbald allegation of a factual dispute is insufficient, in itself, to create a genuine issue of material fact\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">Second, OLOL explained that it terminated Robinson because, after \u201cstat[ing] that she wanted to remain a part of the team,\u201d she acted in an \u201cinappropriate\u201d and \u201cunprofessional\u201d manner that \u201cwas not in keeping\u201d with OLOL standards. Although Robinson argues that \u201cthe District Court erred in reviewing a transcript and not listening to the tape\u201d of Robinson\u2019s allegedly inappropriate behavior, she does not challenge the accuracy of the transcript, only that it does not reflect the tone of her conversation with compliance officer Boston. Given the facts of this case, a dispute over the tone of this conversation does not, without more, amount to \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that retaliation was the \u201cbut for\u201d cause of Robinson\u2019s termination. <em>See Long, </em>88 F.3d at 308. Accordingly, Robin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>son did not introduce evidence, substantial or otherwise, to show that retaliation for reporting the racial epithet was the but-for cause of OLOL reducing her pay and terminating her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">In sum, even if Robinson established a <em>;prima facia </em>case of retaliation, summary judgment was appropriate because OLOL proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for reducing Robinson\u2019s pay and terminating her employment, and Robinson did not show that retaliation was instead the but-for cause of these actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">IY. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b373-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
