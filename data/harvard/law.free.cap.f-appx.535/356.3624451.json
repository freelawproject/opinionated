This court granted a certificate of appealability on the issue whether Brown\u2019s trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to conduct a reasonable pretrial investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-22\">We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>Summers v. Dretke, </em>431 F.3d 861, 868 (5th Cir.2005). Where, as here, the petitioner\u2019s claim has been adju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>dicated on the merits by the state court, the federal court\u2019s review of the state court\u2019s decision is deferential. <em>Id.; see </em>\u00a7 2254(d). Under \u00a7 2254(d), federal habe-as relief cannot be granted unless the state court\u2019s adjudication \u201ceither (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court ..., or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.\u201d <em>Summers, </em>431 F.3d at 868 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">To be entitled to relief on an ineffective assistance claim, Brown must show both deficient performance by counsel and resulting prejudice. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The state court was required to apply \u201ca strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. To demonstrate <em>Strickland </em>prejudice, Brown was required to show a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s deficiency, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Review of the state court\u2019s application of the <em>Strickland </em>standard is \u201cdoubly\u201d deferential when \u00a7 2254(d) applies. <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 770, 788, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011). \u201c[T]he question is not whether counsel\u2019s actions were reasonable. The question is whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied Strickland\u2019s deferential standard.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">Brown contends that the state court\u2019s denial of relief on his ineffective assistance claim was improper given the evidence adduced at an evidentiary hearing. Brown presented three eyewitnesses to the killing, who testified that the first shots were fired by someone in the crowd, rather than by Brown. The witnesses further averred that they had not been contacted by an attorney or by an investigator. The gist of Brown\u2019s claim is that his trial counsel performed deficiently by failing to conduct an investigation that would have found these eyewitnesses and that he suffered prejudice because their testimony would have resulted in a different outcome at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">\u201cAn attorney has a duty to independently investigate the charges against his client.\u201d <em>Bower v. Quarterman, </em>497 F.3d 459, 467 (5th Cir.2007). However, counsel\u2019s failure to hire an investigator, standing alone, is not indicative of ineffective assistance. <em>Id. </em>at 470. \u201cThe decision to hire an investigator is reviewed for reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">In the state habeas proceeding, Brown presented no evidence from his defense team regarding his counsel\u2019s pretrial investigation and representation. Brown provided no basis for the state habeas court to make an assessment of the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s pretrial investigation; he therefore failed to overcome the \u201cstrong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">Brown also claims that he was prejudiced by his trial counsel\u2019s failure to interview Alice Cook, III, Jamie Brock, and Elaine Dunn prior to trial. However, he provided no evidence showing that any of these witnesses would have given testimony favorable to his defense. Additionally, as to Cook and Brock, he failed to show that they would have testified at trial. His claim therefore fails as he has not made the requisite demonstration of prejudice. <em>See Alexander v. McCotter, </em>775 F.2d 595, 602 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b380-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
