Karki concedes that he is removable as charged. He argues that his mistreatment by Maoists rose to the level of persecution and was principally motivated by his association with the Royal Nepalese Army, and that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution in Nepal. We review the BIA\u2019s findings of fact for substantial evidence, and its conclusions of law <em>de novo. Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 594 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s denial of \u2022Karki\u2019s asylum claim on three independent grounds. First, the BIA held that the mistreatment alleged by Karki \u2014 specifically, that he was slapped on two occasions and threatened on three occasions \u2014 \u201cwas not sufficiently severe to constitute persecution.\u201d We agree. <em>See Tesfamichael v. Gonzales, </em>469 F.3d 109, 116 (5th Cir.2006) (noting that \u201cextreme conduct\u201d is required to establish persecution); <em>Eduard v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 182, 188 (5th Cir.2004) (holding that petitioner who was \u201cstruck in the head with a rock while walking to church\u201d and exposed to \u201cdenigration, harassment, and threats\u201d did not establish past persecution); <em>see also Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>46 Fed.Appx. 732 (5th Cir.2002) (per curiam) (holding that fines, slaps, punches, and kicks by agents of the Chinese government did not rise to the level of extreme conduct necessary to compel a finding of past persecution). Second, the BIA endorsed the factual finding of the IJ that Karki\u2019s mistreatment was not motivated by his \u201cpolitical opinion or any other protected characteristic.\u201d This finding is supported by substantial evidence. Although Karki\u2019s former membership in and support for the Royal Nepalese Army may qualify as a protected characteristic, <em>In re C-A-, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 951, 955 (B.I.A.2006), the record supports the BIA\u2019s finding that his mistreatment was motivated not by his association with the army, but by a desire to convince him to join the Maoist cause. Third, the BIA concurred with the IJ\u2019s determination that Karki \u201cdid not demonstrate that he has a well-founded fear of [future] persecution in Nepal.\u201d We perceive no error in the BIA\u2019s weighing of the <em>Chen </em>factors. <em>See Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1135-36 (5th Cir.2006). In sum, we conclude that the denial of Karki\u2019s application for asylum is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-14\">Karki\u2019s failure to satisfy the lower burden of proof necessary to obtain asylum prevents him from satisfying the higher burden of proof for withholding of removal. <em>See Majd v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 590, 595 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-15\">With respect to his CAT claim, Karki provided no evidence that he was tortured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>in the past, and his three unfortunate encounters with Maoists do not establish that it is more likely than not that he would be singled out by the government for torture if he returns to Nepal. <em>See Tamara-Gomez v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 343, 350-51 (5th Cir.2006) (\u201c[R]elief under the [CAT] requires a two part analysis \u2014 first, is it more likely than not that the alien will be tortured upon return to his homeland; and second, is there sufficient state action involved in that torture\u201d) (internal footnote omitted); <em>see also Alcantara v. Holder, </em>493 Fed.Appx. 511, 514-15 (5th Cir.2012) (per curiam) (holding that substantial evidence supported the BIA\u2019s determination that petitioner did not show that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured by state authorities upon his return to Mexico).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b409-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
