On appeal, he argues that: (1) he is entitled to a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction because, notwithstanding his status as a career offender, his total sentence was based on the crack-cocaine guideline, not the career-offender guideline; and (2) he is entitled to be resentenced under the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d), notwithstanding the fact that he was originally sentenced prior to the Act\u2019s enactment on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>August 3, 2010. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012). Section 3582(c)(2) provides that a court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence where the defendant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1). A sentence reduction is not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) where it does not have the effect of lowering a defendant\u2019s \u201capplicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">Before the FSA was enacted on August 3, 2010, distribution of 5 to 50 grams of crack cocaine triggered the application of a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years\u2019 imprisonment and a maximum sentence of 40 years\u2019 imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii) (2009); <em>see United States v. Gomes, </em>621 F.3d 1343, 1346 (11th Cir.2010). The FSA changed the crack-to-powder-cocaine ratio from 100-to-1 to about 18-to-1. <em>Gomes, </em>621 F.3d at 1346. Under the FSA, distribution of less than 28 grams of cocaine base carried no statutory minimum and a statutory maximum of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). In <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court held that the FSA\u2019s reduced statutory mandatory minimums apply to defendants who committed crack cocaine offenses before August 3, 2010, but were sentenced <em>after </em>the effective date of the FSA. 567 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2326, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012). Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines, made retroactively applicable by Amendment 759, made permanent an amendment revising the crack cocaine quantity tables listed in \u00a7 2D1.1(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750, Reason for Amend.; U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 748, Reason for Amend.; U.S.S.G-App. C, Amend. 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-11\">The offense level for a career offender is determined by the career-offender guideline, \u00a7 4Bl.l(b), rather than the drug quantity tables in \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). Where a defendant is sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1, his base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1 plays no role in the calculation of his guideline range. <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321. Accordingly, the district court is unauthorized to reduce the sentence of a defendant who was sentenced as a career offender, under \u00a7 4B1.1, based on a retroactive amendment to \u00a7 2D1.1, because such an amendment does not have the effect of lowering a defendant\u2019s guideline range. <em>Id.; United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-12\">In <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court held, in a plurality opinion, that a defendant who entered into a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement, which includes a binding sentencing recommendation, could, in certain circumstances, still qualify for a reduced sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if the sentence or sentencing range in the plea agreement was \u201cbased on\u201d the amended guideline range. 564 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 2690, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011). We later determined that neither the plurality opinion in <em>Freeman </em>nor Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurrence addressed defendants assigned a base offense level under one guideline section, but ultimately assigned a total offense level and guideline range under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321. Thus, <em>Freeman </em>did not overrule our prior holding that a career offender was not entitled to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief where his guideline range was not lowered by a ret<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>roactive amendment. <em>Id. </em>In other words, a career offender is not entitled to relief based on Amendment 750 and \u00a7 3582(c)(2), since his guideline range is based on \u00a7 4B1.1 and is not reduced by Amendment 750. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">In <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012), we held that the district court did not have the authority to grant the defendant, a career offender, a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because Amendment 750 had no effect on his initial guideline range or his guideline sentence. We also rejected the argument that the defendant was eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction under the FSA, concluding that the Act was not a guidelines amendment by the Sentencing Commission, but rather a statutory change by Congress. <em>Id. </em>We thus held that the FSA could not serve as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. <em>Id. </em>We further held that even if the defendant could bring a FSA claim in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, his claim would still fail because the FSA did not apply retroactively to the defendant\u2019s 2002 sentences. <em>Id. </em>We also distinguished the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dorsey, </em>because it did not suggest that the FSA\u2019s new mandatory m\u00ednimums should apply to defendants originally sentenced before the FSA\u2019s effective date. <em>Id. </em>at 377-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">In <em>United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 542 (11th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>No. 12-10828 (June 12, 2013), we reaffirmed that, in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, the FSA does not apply retroactively to a defendant sentenced before the Act\u2019s enactment. We also reaffirmed our conclusion, in <em>Berry, </em>that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dorsey </em>did not suggest that the FSA should apply to defendants who were sentenced long before the FSA\u2019s effective date. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">Here, the district court correctly denied Fulton\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because his guideline range was not lowered by Amendment 750. Fulton was initially assigned a base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, but his total offense level and resulting guideline range were based on \u00a7 4B1.1, not \u00a7 2D1.1, because he was a career offender. Therefore, Amendment 750 did not alter the sentencing range upon which Fulton\u2019s sentence was based. Moreover, we held in <em>Lawson </em>that neither the plurality opinion nor Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurrence in <em>Freeman </em>applies where a defendant was assigned a base offense level under one guideline section, but was ultimately sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1. We further held that <em>Freeman </em>did not abrogate our holding in <em>Moore </em>that a defendant sentenced as a career offender, under \u00a7 4B1.1, is not entitled to a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction where his guideline range was unaffected by a retroactive amendment. Accordingly, the district court correctly determined that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) did not authorize a reduction of Fulton\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">Additionally, <em>Berry </em>and <em>Hippolyte </em>foreclose Fulton\u2019s argument that he is eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction based on the FSA\u2019s lower mandatory minimum penalties. As we held in <em>Berry, </em>the FSA is not an amendment to the Guidelines by the Sentencing Commission, and, therefore, it cannot serve as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. Moreover, even assuming that Fulton could raise his FSA claim in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, his claim fails because he was originally sentenced in 2001. Since his sentence was imposed before the effective date of the FSA \u2014 August 3, 2010 \u2014 he cannot benefit from the FSA\u2019s lower statutory mandatory minimum provisions. Finally, contrary to Fulton\u2019s assertion on appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number><em>Dorsey </em>did not suggest that the FSA\u2019s new statutory penalties should apply to defendants who were sentenced before the FSA\u2019s effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
