The district court remanded the case based on the Police Department\u2019s untimely filing of its Notice of Removal. The Police Department contends that the district court lacked the authority to remand because it remanded the case for a procedural defect outside of the 30-day window prescribed by statute. After review, we reverse and remand to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"A5y\">\n<em>Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b796-24\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d), we generally lack jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s remand order when the remand is based on the grounds identified in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c). <em>New v. Sports &amp; Recreation, Inc., </em>114 F.3d 1092, 1095 (11th Cir.1997). Section 1447(c) of Title 28 provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>A motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be made within 30 days after the filing of the notice of removal under section 1446(a). If at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the case shall be remanded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">We have interpreted the statutory language to mean that a remand order is reviewable only if it is based on grounds other than \u201c(1) lack of district court subject matter jurisdiction; or (2) a <em>motion </em>to remand the case filed within 30 days of the notice of removal which is based upon a defect in the removal procedure.\u201d <em>Whole Health Chiropractic &amp; Wellness, Inc. v. Humana Med. Plan, Inc., </em>254 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>In re: Bethesda Mem\u2019l Hosp., Inc., </em>123 F.3d 1407, 1409 (11th Cir.1997)). However, we may review a remand based on a procedural defect when it is pursuant to an untimely motion to remand. <em>In re Bethesda Mem\u2019l Hosp., Inc., </em>123 F.3d at 1410.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">In order to determine the basis for the remand, we do not look for \u201cmagic words\u201d or a specific statement that the court relied on \u00a7 1447(c), but rather examine the actual basis for remand to determine if it was based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>New, </em>114 F.3d at 1096. \u201cThe untimeliness of removal is a procedural defect rather than a jurisdictional defect.\u201d <em>Advanced Bodycare Solutions, LLC v. Thione Int'l Inc., </em>524 F.3d 1235, 1237 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">In <em>In re Bethesda Memorial Hospital, Inc., </em>we addressed the question of remanding cases for procedural defects after 30 days of the notice of removal. 123 F.3d at 1410-11. Although that case involved a district court <em>sua sponte </em>remanding for a procedural defect after the 30-day time period had expired, we stated that the district court \u201cacted outside of its statutory authority by remanding for a procedural defect after thirty days of the notice of removal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1411. Moreover, the plain language of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c) states that, \u201c[a] motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction <em>must </em>be made within 30 days after the filing of the notice of removal under section 1446(a).\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">The district court\u2019s remand order indicates that it construed Whitfield\u2019s objections to the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation (R &amp; R) as a motion for remand. Whitfield\u2019s motion for remand was based on a procedural defect. <em>See Thione, </em>524 F.3d at 1237 n. 1. Because Whitfield filed his objections to the R &amp; R almost four months after the Police Department filed its notice of removal, his motion for remand was untimely because it was not within the 30-day window prescribed by \u00a7 1447(c). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c). As such, we have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s remand order as it was based on an untimely motion to remand for a procedural defect.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See In re Bethesda Mem\u2019l Hosp. Inc., </em>123 F.3d at 1410.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">\n<em>Review of Remand Order</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b797-12\"><em>We </em>review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s order remanding a case to state court. <em>Yusefzadeh v. Nelson, Mullins, Riley &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number><em>Scarborough, LLP, </em>365 F.3d 1244, 1245 (11th Cir.2004). As stated earlier, \u201c[a] motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be made within 30 days after the filing of the notice of removal under section 1446(a).\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Based on the plain language of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c), Whitfield was required to file a motion for remand based on the untimeliness of removal within 30 days of the Police Department filing its notice of removal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c). Given that Whitfield\u2019s objections to the R &amp; R were filed almost four months after the notice of removal, the district court erred in granting Whitfield\u2019s untimely motion for remand. <em>See id,.; see also Wilson v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>888 F.2d 779, 781 n. 1 (11th Cir.1989) (\u201cPetitioning for removal outside of the 30-day window constitutes a defect in removal procedure which may be waived by failure to timely file a motion for remand.\u201d). Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b797-7\">. Although the district court noted it may consider Whitfield\u2019s argument because the district court was obligated to consider its subject matter jurisdiction at any time, it is evident from the order that the actual basis for the district court\u2019s remand was the untimeliness of the Police Department's notice of removal. As Whitfield\u2019s complaint brings claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over his complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
