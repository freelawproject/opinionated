When the CBP attempted to stop appellant Vito Smith\u2019s vessel by activating its blue lights and siren, Smith refused to heave to and began making erratic and evasive maneuvers. Agents fired warning flares and then disabling rounds into one engine. Once boarded, agents discovered ten aliens with Smith. None of the eleven had permission to enter the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-12\">Smith now appeals his 37-month sentence, imposed at the low end of the guideline range after he pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to induce an alien to enter the United States, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv), (a)(I)(A)(v)(I). Smith argues that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court incorrectly calculated his advisory guideline range. Specifically, he asserts that the district court improperly relied on <em>United States v. McQueen, </em>670 F.3d 1168 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 225, 184 L.Ed.2d 116 (2012), to enhance his advisory guideline range by seven levels based on CBP\u2019s discharge of a firearm while attempting to stop his alien-smuggling vessel. Smith further argues that the district court\u2019s reliance on <em>McQueen </em>was in error because <em>McQueen </em>conflicts with <em>United States v. Clavijo, </em>165 F.3d 1341 (11th Cir.1999), and therefore was wrongly decided. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-16\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a \u201cdeferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The party challenging the sentence has the burden to establish that the sentence is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>626 F.3d 566, 573 (11th Cir.2010). In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we determine, first, whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>district court committed any \u201csignificant procedural error,\u201d and second, whether the sentence was \u201csubstantively reasonable under the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">We must consider several factors to determine if a sentence is procedurally reasonable, including, <em>inter alia, </em>whether the district court improperly calculated the guideline range. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. \u201cWith respect to sentencing guideline issues, this court reviews purely legal questions <em>de novo, </em>a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, and, in most cases, a district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts with due deference.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Lopez, </em>363 F.3d 1134, 1136-37 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Section 2L1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides the base offense level and the specific offense characteristics for smuggling unlawful aliens. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(a), (b). In relevant part, \u00a7 2Ll.l(b) provides that \u201c[i]f a firearm was discharged, increase by 6 levels, but if the resulting offense level is less than level 22, increase to level 22.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5)(A). Neither \u00a7 2L1.1 nor its Application Notes specify who must discharge the firearm. However, pursuant to \u00a7 lB1.3(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-8\">[Sjpecific offense characteristics ... shall be determined on the basis of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-9\">(1) (A) all acts and omissions committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused by the defendant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AzO\">(B) in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity (a criminal plan, scheme, endeavor, or enterprise undertaken by the defendant in concert with others, whether or not charged as a conspiracy), all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Adl\">that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-12\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(A)-(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-13\">The Application Notes to \u00a7 1B1.3 explain that \u201c[t]he requirement of reasonable foreseeability applies only in respect to the conduct ... of others under subsection (a)(1)(B). It does not apply to conduct that the defendant personally undertakes, aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, procures, or willfully causes; such conduct is addressed under subsection (a)(1)(A).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.3, cmt. n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-14\">Under the prior precedent rule, a panel of this Court is \u201cbound to follow a prior binding precedent unless and until it is overruled by this court en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). We have \u201ccategorically rejected] any exception to the prior panel precedent rule based upon a perceived defect in the prior panel\u2019s reasoning or analysis as it relates to the law in existence at that time,\u201d including an \u201coverlooked reason\u201d exception. <em>Smith v. GTE Corp., </em>236 F.3d 1292, 1303 (11th Cir.2001). However, when a later decision conflicts with an earlier opinion, we apply the \u201cearliest case\u201d rule, in which the panel \u201clook[s] to the line of authority containing the earliest case.\u201d <em>Morrison v. Amway Corp., </em>323 F.3d 920, 929 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation omitted). Therefore, we must assess whether <em>McQueen </em>and <em>Clavijo </em>in fact conflict with respect to their treatment of \u00a7 1B1. 3(a)(1)(A) and (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-15\">In <em>McQueen, </em>the defendant, who was smuggling aliens into the United States, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>attempted to flee when CBP interdicted his vessel off the U.S. coast. 670 F.3d at 1169. CBP used lights, sirens, and spotlights, and eventually fired two warning flares, four \u201cpepper balls,\u201d and two more warning flares before CBP officers boarded the still-moving vessel. The district court applied the firearm-discharge enhancement found at U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(5)(A). <em>Id. </em>We determined that under \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(l)(A), application of the enhancement was only proper if the defendant \u201ccommitted, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused\u201d the firearm discharge. <em>Id. </em>at 1170. We defined \u201cinduced\u201d as \u201cbrought about, produced, or caused,\u201d and held that we \u201cmust attribute to a defendant the acts or omissions of another that are brought about, produced, or caused by the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because CBP fired warning flares in response to McQueen\u2019s conduct, his actions induced the discharge of a firearm. <em>Id. </em>at 1171.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Previous to <em>McQueen, </em>in <em>Clavijo, </em>we held that, for purposes of safety-valve eligibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2, the defendant could not be held responsible for the reasonably foreseeable possession of a firearm by co-conspirators because \u00a7 5C1.2 specified that the defendant must have either possessed the firearm or \u201cinduce[d] another participant\u201d to possess the firearm, language which would have been unnecessary if \u00a7 5C1.2 contemplated the constructive possession described in \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(B). 165 F.3d at 1343. Moreover, the Application Notes to that section stated that the defendant was only accountable for his own conduct or for conduct that he \u201caided or abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused,\u201d language that tracked \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(A). Because of the plain language of \u00a7 5C1.2 and the use of language from \u00a7 1B1.2(a)(1)(A), we reasoned that \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(l)(B) \u2014 relating to \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d acts and omissions of others in furtherance of jointly undertaken criminal activity \u2014 was inapplicable to determinations of safety-valve eligibility because the Application Notes \u201cimplicitly rejected]\u201d that language by only using the language from \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(A). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">Smith\u2019s sentence was procedurally reasonable, and the district court did not err in imposing the firearm-discharge enhancement. Contrary to Smith\u2019s assertion, <em>McQueen </em>and <em>Clavijo </em>do not conflict. <em>McQueen </em>related to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1. 1(b)(5)(A) \u2014 the same provision used to determine Smith\u2019s enhancement \u2014 while <em>Cla-vijo </em>related to \u00a7 5C1.2. <em>McQueen, </em>670 F.3d at 1170; <em>Clavijo, </em>165 F.3d at 1343. Furthermore, <em>McQueen </em>defined \u201cinduced\u201d in the context of applying \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(A) to \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(5)(A), whereas <em>Clavijo </em>excluded application of \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(l)(B) to safety-valve eligibility based on language specific to that Guidelines section. <em>McQueen, </em>670 F.3d at 1170; <em>Clavijo, </em>165 F.3d at 1343. Smith\u2019s case, then, is clearly governed by our holding in <em>McQueen, </em>a holding which <em>Clavijo </em>does not call into doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">Smith\u2019s argument that <em>McQueen\u2019s </em>use of the \u201creasonable foreseeability\u201d standard should not bind subsequent panels because the parties assumed that it was the correct standard is also meritless. Even if <em>McQueen </em>did apply a \u201creasonable foreseeability\u201d standard, we have rejected an \u201coverlooked reason\u201d exception to the prior precedent rule. <em>GTE Corp., </em>236 F.3d at 1303.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">Thus, the district court did not err by increasing Smith\u2019s offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5)(A) based on CBP\u2019s discharge of a firearm. Smith \u201cbrought about, produced, or caused\u201d CBP\u2019s discharge by using erratic and evasive maneuvers when CBP used its lights, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>sirens, warning flares, and disabling shots to stop his vessel. <em>See McQueen, </em>670 F.3d at 1169-70. Accordingly, we affirm Smith\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
