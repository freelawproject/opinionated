Y. 626), when the court denied the existence of such a right of action. The question is again presented by the defendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of a complaint now before us wherein the plaintiff, an unemancipated minor, demands from his father and the estate of his deceased mother damages for personal injuries which are said to have been sustained through the mother\u2019s fault. It is alleged that while the infant plaintiff was a passenger in an automobile owned by his father and driven by his mother with his father\u2019s consent, he sustained personal injuries due to his mother\u2019s negligence. There are also allegations that the death of the plaintiff\u2019s mother, which occurred three days after the plaintiff was injured, was due to injuries suffered by her in the accident which befell them both.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">The appellant recognizes the rule of the <em>Sorrentino </em>case <em>(supra). </em>He suggests, however, that our more recent ruling in <em>Rozell </em>v. <em>Rozell </em>(281 N. Y. 106, 108) \u2014 where a recovery for tortious injuries suffered by an unemancipated minor was upheld against his unemancipated sister \u2014 may have foreshadowed such a change in the policy of the court as will validate the complaint now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">In the <em>Rozell </em>case <em>(supra) </em>it was said (Rippey, J., p. 109): <em>\u201c </em>Persons who are not members of the family when injured through the tortious negligence of minors may recover damages against them by way of compensation for injuries sustained. * * * No logical reason nor reported authority exists to indicate that the rule of liability should be changed when brothers and sisters are involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">In the case now before us, unlike the problem in the <em>Rozell </em>case, we deal with that natural kinship between parent and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>child which involves legal duties peculiar to that relationship, and as to which both reason and authority dictate our adherence to the rule of the <em>Sorrentino </em>case <em>(supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The law requires of parents that they provide care, maintenance and guidance for their unemancipated minor child. To that end they are entitled to his custody. Such duties and rights may be enforced by legal process. Thus has the law recognized in the family something more than a social unit, something more practical than a spiritual concept. It has sanctioned the family relationship \u2014 particularly the relationship of parent and child \u2014 as the basis for regulating those reciprocal obligations between parent and child which may be the subject of legal enforcement. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"AuY\">In the process of rearing a child and the fulfillment of the legal duties of care, maintenance and guidance, the conduct of the parents toward the child is of necessity affected by the parental relation. We know that family unity is not created by law. But, as we have seen, the law does not fail to recognize family unity as a factor in human conduct and relationship. As to the child- \u2014 -what he may expect from his parents and\u2019 what he owes to them as a matter of filial duty differ widely from his rights and duties in his relations to those not <em>in loco parentis. </em>As to the parents \u2014 the law which imposes upon them the duty to support and discipline a minor child, and to prescribe a course of conduct designed to promote his health, education and recreation, accords to the parents a wide discretion. In the exercise of that discretion and the performance of duties imposed by law through no choice by the parents, they are held to no higher standard of care than the measure of their own physical, mental and financial abilities to provide for the well-being of their child. Lack of means, physical weakness or mental incapacity may cause parents to tolerate conditions in the family home which are unsafe and which might afford a basis for liability to one coming to the premises as an invitee or licensee. Not yet, however, have our courts granted an unemancipated child \u2014 whom the law decrees to be a member of that household \u2014 the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>right to hold his parents in damages for unintended personal injuries resulting from such conditions. Indeed, if within the wide scope of daily experiences common to the upbringing of a child a parent may be subjected to a suit for damages for each failure to exercise care commensurate with the risk \u2014 for each injury caused by inattention, unwise choice or even selfishness \u2014 a new and heavy burden will be added to parenthood.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Take for example the instant case: we may assume that the infant plaintiff\u2019s presence in his father\u2019s automobile, then driven by his mother, was not unrelated to the fact that he was the child of the owner and driver of the car; nor was his presence unrelated to the natural and legal duty of his parents to furnish him with care and with opportunities for recreation. True, he was a passenger but he was there, not as an invitee but as a member of the family, entitled to his parents\u2019 care. As in the constant succession of daily experiences which were shared in their family life the child\u2019s position as a passenger in the automobile was inextricably related to his position as a member of that family, so the parents\u2019 duties, as the owner of the car and as the operator, were inextricably related to their natural and legal duties toward their unemancipated child.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">In the absence of statutory sanction, we are not prepared, in cases where wilful misconduct by the parent is not a factor, to inject the disruptive risk of tort liability between parents and their unemancipated children, in which relationship both parents and children \u2014 by nature and by law \u2014 have reciprocal duties to perform which still make for family unity.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">There remains for consideration the appellant\u2019s claim that, as to his deceased mother, he is an emancipated minor, and that accordingly there is no legal restriction against a suit in his behalf against her estate. The question whether the infant plaintiff had a cause of action against his parents must be determined as of April 16, 1939, on which date, it is alleged, he suffered the injuries for which he seeks recovery. It was on that date that his cause of action, if any, arose. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number><em>(Schmidt </em>v. <em>Merchants Despatch Transportation Co., </em>270 N. Y. 287, 300; <em>Reingold </em>v. <em>Reingold, </em>115 N. J. L. 532.) However, on that date, according to the complaint herein, both his father and his mother were living \u2014 his mother\u2019s death having occurred on April 19, 1939. It follows that on the date when the infant plaintiff\u2019s alleged cause of action arose he was unemancipated. We have already indicated our conclusion to be that an unemancipated minor child has no right of action against his parents for non-wilful injuries caused by their acts which, if done by others, might constitute a breach of legal duty. It follows that the death of the infant plaintiff\u2019s mother subsequent to the date of his injuries will not serve to validate a cause of action in his behalf against her estate. (Cf. <em>Lasecki </em>v. <em>Kalara, </em>235 Wis. 645.)</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.'</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Lehman, Ch.
