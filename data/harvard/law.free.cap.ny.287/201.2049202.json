It is sufficient to warrant a conviction if corroborating circumstances are shown which, when considered in connection with the confession are sufficient to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt in the minds of the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">This was a correct statement of the applicable doctrine. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jaehne, </em>103 N. Y. 182, 199, 200.) At the request of the defendant\u2019s counsel, the trial judge supplemented his \u2022charge as follows: \u201c I have been requested to charge and do charge that where the People attempt to prove a fact or facts by circumstantial evidence, these circumstances must themselves be established by direct proof and not left to rest upon inferences or other circumstances. I have been requested to charge and do charge that where the People seek to prove a fact by circumstantial evidence, such fact must clearly and necessarily flow from the circumstances alleged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">In refusing further to instruct the jury as to the rules which regulate appraisal of the probative value of circumstantial evidence, the judge remarked that \u201c this is not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>circumstantial evidence case.\u201d Of this inadvertent misstatement the defendant now predicates error.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Talcing the charge as a whole we cannot believe that the jury were misled by the phrase last quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The judgment of conviction should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Lehman, Ch.
