The following case was made by a demurrer t\u00a9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>evidence in the county court of Amherst. Sam was born in the county of Augusta, about the year 1788, the slave of Mary Teas, a native of that county, then residing there. Mary Teas, removed to North-Carolina about 1790, where she resided and Sam with her, three years. In 1793 she returned to Virginia, bringing Sam with her; and not complying with the requisitions of the statute of Virginia of 1792. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> She continued in Virginia until the year 1811; when she sold Sam to Barnett.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-3\">A deposition taken in the cause, was objected to, because the commission was not directed to Justices of the Peace, nor did the persons taking it, describe themselves as such. The county court gave judgment for the plaintiff on the demurrer to evidence; the judgment was affirmed on appeal to the Superior court of law; and an appeal was taken to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b241-4\">The case was argued by <em>Wickham, </em>for the appellant, and <em>Leigh </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-5\">The case of Murray <em>v. </em>M\u2018Carty,<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> was mentioned by a Judge; which on examination, seemed conclusive on the merits; and there was judgment against the pauper.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b241-7\"> <em>Rev, of 1792. </em>p. 103.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"Af26\"> <em>2 Munf. </em>393.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b241-6\">Roane, Judge.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"ACnL\">The court is of opinion, that Mrs. Teas, under whom the appellant claims, having never renounced her character of citizen of Virginia; nor acquired that of a citizen of North-Carolina; is not embraced by the first part of the proviso of <em>\u00a7 </em>4. ch. 103. (pa. 186. of <em>Pleasants' </em>edition of the laws,) under the decision of this court in the case of Murray <em>v. </em>M\u2018Carty; so as to deprive a slave purchased by her in another state, after the passing of that act and brought into this commonwealth, of the right of freedom, enuring to him under the 2d \u00a7 thereof: but the appellee in this case having been atthe time of the commencement of this act, actually owned by the said Mrs. Teas, his right to freedom is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>barred by that circumstance, under the provision as to citizens of the commonwealth, contained in the last part of the said proviso] and this <em>a fortiori, </em>as the said Mrs. Teas had owned the appellee as a slave in Virginia, and carried him with her into the state of Nortli-Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Under this opinion against the appellee, on the merits, it is unnecessary, however plain, to inquire into the sufficiency of the depositions excepted to in the proceedings: but if that deposition ought to have been rejected, it shews more strongly, that the judgment in Ms favor is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Both judgments are to be reversed and entered for the appellant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Ac8\"> Brooke absent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
