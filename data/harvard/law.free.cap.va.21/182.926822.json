Qtoere : Whether under any circumstances, the deputy sheriff could maintain a suit against the justices of a county for their failure to lay the levy ; and it seems he could not.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-5\">This was a suit in equity brought in November 1858, <em>** </em>by Jacob V. Fulkerson against the justices of Lee county, and was afterwards removed to the Circuit court of Wythe.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-9\">The plaintiff in his hill states that by an act of Assembly, passed in 1888, the County court of Lee was authorized to borrow money for certain purposes, and that under this act the County court of Lee, in May 1839, borrowed of Col. John Preston four thousand, dollars, of which $1,000, with the interest, was to be paid yearly out of the county levy ; the last payment falling due in 1843. That for the years 1840 and 1841 Isham Hubbard was the high sheriff\", and farmed the shrievalty to the plaintiff\" and one Claiborne Anderson. That Z. S. Gibson succeeded Hubbard, and ho also farmed the shrievalty to the plaintiff and Anderson ; but that Gibson died in 1842, and the plaintiff continued to act as deputy until the expiration of the term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-11\">Ho further states that Preston not having been paid promptly the amount due him, his assignee moved the court for a judgment against Hubbard, the late high sheriff, and the personal representatives of Gibson, for the alleged failures on their part to collect and pay over the levies made in the years 1840-\u201941 and \u201942, for the satisfaction of his claim ; that to these proceedings the plaintiff was not a party ; hut he distinctly told the parties moved against, that he had as deputy aforesaid, during the years 1840-41 and \u201942 collected and paid over all the levies for these years, and w7as not in arrear. Whether they made defence against said motion he does not know, but judgments were obtained against them for $-and costs. (The bill is blank as to dates and sums.) That afterwards, Hubbard and Gibson\u2019s representatives moved against the plaiutiff and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Anderson, deputies as aforesaid, and their securities, for failures on their part to collect and pay over said levies, it was proposed by the counsel for the plaintiffs in the motions, that the plaintiff and Anderson should each COQfe8B a judgment for the amount of the supposed default, upon condition that the whole subject matter should be referred to two persons named, far examination and settlement; that \u2022 executions should not issue ' on said judgments until these gentlemen reported ; and that then the executions should issue against the plaintiff and Anderson for whatever amount, if any, that they might be found in arrear ; the execution against each party to be for his arrearages. To this the plaintiff objected, alleging that he was not in arrear ; but upon being advised by his counsel, that if he accounted for his liabilities he would not be prejudiced by the judgment, and that it would be \u00e1 speedy mode of settlement, he, in deference to his counsel, waived his objections and let the judgment go. That a day was1 fixed for going into the settlement, and the plaintiff' then and there laid his papers before the referees ; but Anderson was not, ready, and the settlement was adjourned to a subsequent day, when plaintiff again appeared, but Anderson again procured a continuance. That the referees had proceeded with the settlement so far as to satisfy them that the plaintiff' was not in arrear; but because of Anderson\u2019s failure to settle they were not then prepared to 'report; and before the third meeting the administrators of Gibson and Hubbard sued out executions against the plaintiff' and Anderson. That the plaintiff and his sureties applied for and obtained injunctions to these judgments ; Hubbard and Gibson\u2019-s administrators answered the bills ; and an account was ordered, which was taken by commissioner M. H. B. Lane, and the plaintiff was reported to be in arrear on account of county levies $-. To this report the plaintiff filed exceptions ; but upon the hearing the court overruled the exceptions, and dismissed the bills. From <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>these decrees, the plaintiff took an appeal to the Supreme court of appeals ; and that court affirmed the decree so far as it dismissed the bills as to Hubbard\u2019s and Gibson\u2019s administrators ; but reversed it as to the residue thereof; and sent the causes back with directions to consolidate them and to recommit the report with directions to settle the accounts as between the plaintiff and Anderson. That when the causes went back, they were consolidated and the account was ordered, which was taken by commissioner Crockett; and to it, there were no exceptions. By this report, plaintiff insisted it appeared that at the time of the judgments rendered against him and Anderson, he was in advance to the county upon the said levies -$461.17 ; and that of a levy made in 1844 to cover the deficiencies of the previous levies, he received but \u25a0$888.71; which still left a balance due him of $77.46. He says in that case the justices of Lee county were not parties and no decree could be made against them, and . when it came on to be heard it was stricken from the \u2022docket. That he was not a party to the motions against the high sheriffs ; and he was prevented by the agreement before stated, from defending the motions against himself. He charges, that he not only has been compelled to pay the debt of Lee county to the amount of $2,788.99 ; but he had paid another sum of $600 towards the Preston judgment, which had not been allowed to him in Crockett\u2019s report. He calls upon the justices to answer ; prays that he may be subrogated to the rights of Preston ; and that an accouut may be directed to ascertain his liabilities as deputy sheriff for the county levies aforesaid, and further to ascertain what amount, if any, he has paid to the creditors of said county beyond his liability in the premises ; that he may have a decree against the justices of the county of Lee for the \u2022amount so overpaid by him, and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-11\">The plaintiff filed with his bill the decrees of the Court of appeals referred to by him, and the subsequent pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>ceedinga in those causes, including Crockett\u2019s report ft\u2019om which it appeared that as between himself and. the latter was debtor to the plaintiff upon the-adjustment of the accounts between them in the sum of' |gg g0. an\u00bf ou the final hearing of the cause on the-8 th of May 1855, there was a decree in his favor for that sum ; and the causes were stricken from the docket. It appeared also that Preston\u2019s motion against.the high sheriff' was on the 18th of March 1845 ;. and the decrees-of the Court of appeals were on the 26th of July 1858.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-4\">The justices of Lee county appeared, and demurred to the bill; but the demurrer was overruled ; and they then answered. They say that very lew of the present, justices were justices of the county in any of the years: mentioned in the bill, and the defendants are consequently less able to explain and answer so satisfactorily the matters in the bill alleged than the justices iu those days would have done ; and that as to many of the facts stated in the bill they have no knowledge. They admit the law, the borrowing of the money by the county from Preston, the high sheriffs and deputies as stated, and that Preston\u2019s assignee recovered the judgments against the high sheriff Hubbard and Gibson\u2019s adm\u2019r in 1845 ; and they say it appears that these parties moved against the plaintiff and Anderson, their deputies, for the amount of said judgments, and after some delay procured judgments against each for the sum they were; respectively in arrear. That these judgments were enjoined by the plaintiff on the allegation that the judgment creditors had violated some understanding or-promise made by them at the time these judgments were-obtained, and on the further allegation that he was in-no default as deputy, as aforesaid. That when these* causes came on to bo heard, M. D. B. Lane was. appointed a commissioner to ascertain the liability of the plaintiff' to Hubbard and Gibson\u2019s administrator .* and' by his report, of which they exhibit a copy, it appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>that the plaintiff was indebted, on the 8th of April 1846, in the sum of $1,505.92 ; and on the return of this report the injunctions were dissolved and the bills dismissed ; and upon appeal this decree was affirmed as to Hubbard and Gibson\u2019s administrator ; but, as Anderson was a party in the suits, the decrees as to him were reversed, and the causes were sent back to have the accounts between him and the plaintiff adjusted. And this action uf the Supreme court of appeals the defendants insist should preclude the plaintiff from further investigation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-4\">The defendants refer to Crockett\u2019s report, which they say was settled on an improper principle, as between the deputies and their principals, allowing them large sums which they had paid for interest and damages, as appears by Lane\u2019s report; which shows that on this account the high sheriff's had been required to pay, and had recovered from the plaintiff*, $1,505.92, and from Anderson $182.85. That it is true that there was a deficiency in the levies for 1840, \u201941 and \u201942 ; but in the year 1844 there was an extra sum levied and appropriated to the ' benefit of the sheriffs for those years, to reimburse them for any sums which they had paid out of their own funds on account of said deficit. That Crockett\u2019s account was taken to adjust the accounts between-the plaintiff' and Anderson ; and the defendants were not parties to the suit. They submit that the county of Lee has only to adjust accounts with, her high sheriffs, and can take no notice of any transactions between co-deputies or deputies with the high sheriff*; they deny that the county is indebted to Hubbard, or Gibson\u2019s administrator, or the plaintiff, on account of the alleged deficiencies of the county levies aforesaid; they deny the right of the plaintiff*, by subrogation or otherwise, to anything on account of payments alleged by him to have been made, for the county ; and they especially deny that he paid anything to Preston on account of said loan, for which a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>levy was not made, except in the nature of interest, damages and costs incurred through his delinquency, as And they rely upon the staleness of the claim and the statute of limitations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-4\">qqie acooimtB were referred to a commissioner, who made a report, by which he ascertained that Fulkerson had, up to the time of this report, overpaid on account of the county levies of 1840, \u201941 and \u201942, $2,475.68. In this report, of which all the items of credit but one are taken from Lane\u2019s report, the commissioner disallows an item, $383.97, with which Lane charges the plaintiff as received from the levy of 1844,' and he does not charge the. plaintiff' with any part of that levy. And he credited the plaintiff\u2019 with .the amount he had paid for interest, damages and costs which had been disallowed by Lane. The only other credit allowed the plaintiff is an item of $609.94. The defendants excepted to the report, 1st, for omitting the charge of $383.97, which the plaintiff in his bill admitted he had received ; 2d, for not charging him with $1,023.48, the amount of the levy of 1844, which they say was levied in the name of the plaintiff to cover the deficiencies in the former levies ; 3d, and for allowing the crfedit of $609.94, which they insisted was credited in Lane\u2019s report; it appearing there, as they insisted, in two credits making up that precise sum ; commissioner Lane stating in his report, that with the exception of two items claimed by Anderson, amounting to $61, which were disallowed, he remembers no objections made by either party to the mode of the statement or the items contained therein; 4th, and further, that though.the commissioner, even upon his own statement of the account, reports the plaintiff in arrear at the time of the motion against the high sheriff's to the amount of $533.48, he omits to charge him with the interest, costs and damages, or any part thereof, that accrued in consequence of these and subsequent motions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-5\">The cause came o.n to be heard on the 8th of Novem-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Der 1888, when the court sustained the first and fourth exceptions, but overruled the second and third ;. and fixing the amount of the error in the fourth exception at $175, made a decree in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of $2,475.68, with interest on different parts thereof from the time the commissioner reported they were due, subject to a credit for the two sums of $383.71 and $175, with interest from the time they should have been charged in the account.

The \u25a0 complainant offered no proof in support of his bill; no depositions were taken, or exhibits filed by him, except the account and report therewith, directed by the decree of the Court of appeals, of the transactions between complaiuant and his co-defendant, Anderson. These exhibits, whatever they may tend to prove, are not competent evidence against the county of Lee, or the defendants representing said county, neither they nor the high sheriffs were parties to the suit in which that account was taken, when the decree wras rendered directing such account; nor were they in aov manner interested in the subject matter of controversy as it then existed. The answer denying all the material allegations of the bill, and the latter being wholly unsustained, the court ought to have dismissed it at the hearing. This cannot be questioned unless it can be maintained that a court of equity may decree an account for the purpose of furnish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>ing evidence in support of the allegations of a hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">This court has repeatedly decided that an account should not be ordered in any case, unless shown to be proper and neeessarryby the pleadiugs and proofs in the cause. '</p>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">But conceding to the complainant the benefit of every fact appearing in the record, it is clear he is not entitled to any relief in a court of equity or elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-14\">The motion in the name of the justices of the county of Lee, for the benefit of Preston, against Hubbard and the representatives of Gibson, the high sheriffs, was made in March 1845. This motion was based upon the delinquency of complainant'and his co-defendant Anderson in failing to collect and account for the levies of 1840, 1841 and 1842. Complainant was informed of the pendency of that motion, its object and the grounds upon which it was'based. He was fully aw'are then, of the groundlessness of the charge against him; for he told his principals (as he asserts,) that he, as deputy, had collected and paid over all the levies for the years mentioned. Why then did he not defend this motion? It was in effect his suit instituted in consequence of his default as deputy sheriff\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-15\">If he was not in arrear ; if, as he now claims, the object was to coerce from him the payment of large sums for levies never made, the facts were susceptible of the clearest and most convincing proof by a simple examination of the records of the county. The high sheriff's could not he presumed to know anything of the transactions, or the state of the accounts, and were, therefore, in no condition to make a successful defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-16\">Judment having been rendered against Hubbard and the representatives of Gibson, upon this motion, they moved for judgment in a like amoimt, against complainant and Anderson, his co-deputy. Hpon this motion, complainant confessed judgment. He avers that he was induced to do so by the representations of his counsel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>-and the promises of the adverse party, that he would he \u25a0held responsible so far only as he was actually in arrear. There is not in the record a scintilla of evidence to sustain these allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">It is difficult to perceive what defence he cOuld have made. In the proceeding by the high sheriff against him, it was not incumbent upon the former to do more than produce the record of the judgment showing he \u25a0had been subjected to liability in consequeuce of the default of complainant as his deputy; and so soon as it was established that complainant was informed of the motion against his principal, and tailed to defend it, he would have been estopped to deny his delinquency or his liabilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Executions being sued out upon the judgment against complainant, he applied for and obtained an injunction from the Circuit court of Lee, stating the circumstances under which he had confessed the judgment, and alleging that so far from being in arrear to the county he was actually in advance of the levies made by the County . \u2022court. In the progress of this suit, an 'account ivas taken, showing that complainant was in arrear the sum of \u2022\u00a71,505, upon the levies of 1840, 1841 and 1842, after allowing him all the'credits' claimed to the date of the .account. The commisssioner states that no objections were made by either party to .the mode adopted in stating the account or to the items therein contained. It is true that complainant excepted to the account at the hearing; but his exceptions were overruled and the report confirmed ; his injunction dissolved and the bill dismissed by the Circuit court of Lee county. Upon an appeal to the Court of appeals, that decree was in the year 1858\u2019, affirmed so far as it affected the matters in controversy between complainant and his principals, the high sheriffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Under these circumstances, if the complainant has any claim to the relief he asks, it can only be upon the ground that there was error in the judgment against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>high sheriff, error in the judgment against Him, error in the decree dissolving his injunction, and error in the -decree of the Court of appeals. The hill is simply am appeal for relief, to a court of equity, from the judgmenj. 0p a courj\u00a1 0f common law of competent jurisdietion ; without an averment or proof of fraud, mistake, surprise, or other circumstances to justify the interposition-of a court of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"AfP\">But throwing out of view these considerations, there are strong reasons for believing that no injustice has been done the complainant. The amount paid by him. after thb date of Commissioner Lane\u2019s report, in discharge of the judgment against his principals was $1,711.23 ; but it is to be borne in mind that this sum included interest, damages, and costs,' for which complainant alone \u2022 was responsible. Taking; into the estimate the reported balance of $1,505, as found by Commissioner Lane, and the additional levy made in 1844 of $1,023.48, of which it is clear that complainant received the benefit, and with only part of which he was ever charged, it appears that. he had in his hands- funds of the county more than amply sufficient to meet the judgments recovered against, his principals.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Complainant\u2019s .payments were made in 1847. Whatever cause of action he may have had against the-county of Lee arose in that year. lie is content, however, to wait nearly eleven years before instituting his \u2022 <em>suit; </em>until the justices who were most familiar'with the transaction had retired from the bench, and the difficul-' ties of ascertaining the true state of accounts were- ' greatly increased by the loss of papers and the death of witnesses. It seems to. me that the statute of limitation, if not the staleness of the demand, presents ail insuperable obstacle to a recovery in this' case* if there were no other difficulties to be encountered.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">It is insisted, however; that complainant, having satisfied the judgment in Preston\u2019s favor, is entitled to be-substituted to all the rights- and remedies of the latter.. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>This pretension has scarcely a claim to serious consideration. Substitution is a remedy afforded by courts of equity to the surety, upon paying the debt of his principal. Complainant was not a surety for the county of Lee. He held in his hands funds belonging to the county, for which his principal was held liable; and latter, to the extent of that liability, had the right to resort to complainant for indemnity. It will not be gravely maintained that complainant, upon satisfying a judgment based upon his own delinquency, could thereupon recover the amount from the party for whose benefit the judgment was recovered. The statement of the proposition carries with it its refutation.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Upon the whole it is very questionable whether there is any such relation between complainant and the county of Lee as would enable him to maintain a suit against the latter. The statute authorizes motions in the name of the county, and under certaiu circumstances, in the name of creditors against the high sheriff\u2019, for a failure to collect and pay over the levies ; but no such motion can be made against the deputy. He is not responsible to the county or to its creditor ; he is neither an officer nor an agent of the county; there is no privity between them. Whatever transactions the deputy may have with the county must be in the name of his principal; whatever remedy he would assert against it, must be also in the name of his principal. Any other rule would produce endless confusion, and impose upon counties liabilities incompatible with public interests, and the whole spirit and scope of our legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Dor these reasons, I am of opinion the decree of the court below should be reversed, and a decree now rendered dismissing the bill with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The other judges concurred in the opinion of <em>Staples, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
