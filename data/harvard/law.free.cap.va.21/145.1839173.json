And the court did instruct, the Jury, that the evidence of the demandants, if it proved any title, proved it belonged to some of them as tenants in common with others of the demandants, and that they could not recover in this joint action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-12\">The Jury under the instruction of the, court found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>tlie tenant had more mere right to hold, than the demand-ant to demand, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AqR\">The court gave judgment that the tenant hold the tenement to him and his heirs, free, quit and discharged of the said demandants and their heirs, forever.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-5\">On the day after judgment was given, but before signing the order, the death of Elizabeth Tidball one of the demandants was suggested to have happened before the commencement of the term. Thp fact being admitted, the demandants\u2019 counsel insisted the whole writ should abate. The court decided the writ should abate as to the deceased demandant only, and judgment was entered against the survivors and their heirs, but not against Elizabeth Tidball. The demandants\u2019 counsel excepted and appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b154-6\">The cause was argued by <em>Stanard, Tucker </em>and <em>Gilmer </em>for the appellants, and by <em>Wickham </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b154-7\">For the appellants it was contended,</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-8\">That tenancy in common, at common law was plead - able only in abatement, and could not be pleaded in bar or given in evidence on the general issue. For whatever defeats the particular action but does not conclude the party for ever, should be pleaded in abatement.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> Some, things are pleadable,in bar or abatement, as in replevin <em>\u201c </em>property in a stranger\u201d or in any action \u00ab outlawry for felony\u201d- or <em>\u201c </em>alien enemy.\u201d But it is a rule without exception, that nothing can be pleaded in bar which goes to the capacity in which plaintiffs sue, when the defect pleaded is remediable by another writ.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-9\">Tenancy in common has every badge of a plea in abatement: it does not deny the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action but objects to the. form of it: it does not negative his right, but asserts it: it is a defect remediable, by another writ. The law therefore compels the defendant to plead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>it in abatement, and if he go to trial without doing so, he waives the objection.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AlY\">The writ of right forms no exception to these priuciples. The <em>dictum </em>in Brook\u2019s abridgment, 48, that nothing can be specially pleaded in writs of right, but collateral warranty, means <em>nothing, </em>in bar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-5\">The evil to be remedied by the statute<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> was, that the tenant by views, vouchers, essoins, and imparlances, protracted the cause. The act took away all these, and allowed no excuse to the tenant but <em>non summons: </em>and enacted, that if the tenant after one imparlance did not plead <em>nontenure, </em>or in abatement, and then if the plea was overruled, the mise should be joined on'the mere right. He is then, to plead matter of abatement, in abatement. But the construction contended for on the other side dispenses with the plea altogether: if it be evidence on the mise, why require it to be pleaded? If evidence without being pleaded, why not after it is pleaded and overruled? Besides, a plea in abatement must be sworn <em>to; </em>here there is no oath, no notice, and that on atrial of the mere right, without regard to technical formalities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-6\">Next it was enacted, that any thing may be given in evidence on the mise joined upon the mere right, which might have been specially pleaded. The object of the statute was the simplification of the remedy, and it is imperative that all matters of defence shall be given in evidence and not pleaded: but it means as Brook meant, matter in bar; and matter in abatement is not available at all after the mise is joined.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-7\">Green v. Liter<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> was decided on this ground. And Hyers v. Green <footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> so confidently relied on by the other side, is not in conflict with this doctrine. That was <em>non-tenure </em>of the whole, which was always a good plea in <em>bar</em><footnotemark><em>(f)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>but tenancy in common never was a plea in bar. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Again, in Hyers <em>v. </em>Green, the verdict negatived the plea of nontenure, here the verdict affirms the tenancy in com-mom</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8b\">But supposing the statute allow matter of abatement tobe given in evidence on the mise joined upon the right, it surely does not require the judgment to be in bar. This verdict is found under instruction of the court, and is no more than a special verdict fiuding the fact, that the defendants are tenants in common. The judgment therefore that the tenants hold &amp;c. is erroneous, for it should be that the writ be qu ashed.<footnotemark>(g)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-5\">But Mrs. TidbalPs death abated the whole writ. This is clear. <footnotemark>(h)</footnotemark> So in real actions,<footnotemark>(i)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-6\">It is said there is no reason for abating the whole writ, because survivors can at least defend themselves. That is not the criterion, Can possession be given according to the writ? Where several persons sue jointly for divisible property, they must recover all, or none, or some part. If they recover none, the death of one of the plaintiffs makes no difference; but if the survivors re.cover all, what becomes of the part of the deceased? if they recover part, what part? for the separate parts of each can be assigned only by partition. But the case is too clear, on the death of one of the demandants to be pressed.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b154-10\"><em> Ba. ab. </em>\"Abatement\u201d (N.) 4 <em>T.
