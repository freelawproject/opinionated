Dawson, the master of the said vessel, for the purpose of being forwarded to the plaintiff at Georgetown, in the district of Columbia, and the defendant knowing the premises, <em>falsely </em>pretending that the said plaintiff, together with a certain Renner, was indebted to him in a large suns of money, for which he had no remedy but by subjecting the said barley to an attachment from the Superior court of Chancery of Fredericksburg, did, on, &amp;c. sue forth from the office of the said court of chancery a subpoena to attach the goods and effects of the plaintiff and of the said Renner in the hands of the said Dawson, master of the said vessel, which subpoena was served on Dawson, and he thereby compelled to keep and withhold the barley from the plaintiff for a long time, during which it was spoiled and became of no value, and was wholly lost to the plaintiff; and afterwards, to wit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>\u00ae\"c\u2018 sa^ suit was dismissed by the defendant as appears by the record &amp;c. \u201c wherefore the said plaintiff says, that by reason of <em>the said unjust and improper suing forth ^Le sa^ attachment without good cause therefor </em>and the consequent attachment and detention of the said barley, in the hands of the said Dawson, he has been greatly injured and hath sustained damage\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-5\">\u25a0 The defendant pleaded \u201c not guilty\u201d and also pleaded specially.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-6\">That on the 19th October 1814, and long before, the plaintiff and.a certain Daniel Renner, trading under the firm of Raynard and Bussard, were indebted to the defendant in the sum of $793 04, which debt was contracted in Georgetown, in the district of Columbia: and that the plaintiff and Renner on the 19th October 1814, and before and ever since resided without the commonwealth of Virginia, to wit, in Georgetown, in the district of Columbia, and being so out of the commonwealth and the said Dawson having in his possession the said barley belonging to the plaintiff, the defendant sued out his subpoena to summon the said plaintiff and Renner and Anthony Buck and M. Dawson to appear &amp;c. and the.said subpoena was endorsed by the defendant\u2019s counsel with the words \u201c to attach the effects of the defendants Renner and Bussard, in the hands of the other defendants Buck and Dawson, so that they do not dispose of them until the further order of court,\u201d which subpoena was served on the said Dawson, of which the plaintiff had notice, and the defendant avers the said bill to have been filed for the pui-pose of recovering the $793 04 aforesaid, and of attaching the effects of Renner and Bussard in the hands of Buck and Dawson, for the payment of the said demand. And the defendant, on the 19th January 1815, by the judgment of the circuit court of the district of Columbia, held in the city of Washington, to wit, at the county of Spottsylvania, recovered against the plaintiff and Renner the sum of $1600 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>$17 <em>57 </em>costs, to be discharged by the payment of $793 04 with interest &amp;c. which said judgment was for the same debt aforesaid, and the plaintiff afterwards, to wit, on &amp;c. dismissed his said bill in chancery, <em>absque hoe, </em>the deft, sued out no other bill in chancery &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-3\">To this plea, there was a general demurrer, on which demurrer a joinder. The court gave judgment for the demurrant, and a jury was sworn to try the general issue, which was found for the plaintiff and $1148 09 damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-4\">At the trial, Marshall\u2019s counsel filed a bill of exceptions, setting forth at large the record of the proceedings on the attachment in Chancery, the indorsement on the subpoena signed by Marshall\u2019s counsel in Chancery, in the words before mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-5\">The bill states, that Dawson and Buck the garnishees 4\u2018have on their hands a parcel of barley belonging to Renner and Bussard (or if the partnership be dissolved) to Bussard one of the film\u201d and prays it may be attached &amp;c. upon which, Marshall\u2019s counsel moved the court to instruct the Jury, that Dawson the garnishee was not bound by the indorsement on the subpoena to retain the property in his hands if it belonged to Bussard <em>solely. </em>This instruction the court refused to give, Marshall excepted and appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b19-6\"><em>\u25a0Leigh, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-7\">The declaration is fatally defective in not stating, that the attachment was sued out, \u201c <em>maliciously and without, probable 'cause,\u201d </em>or by equivalent words. At first he had thought those words, by the English practice, necessary only in actions for malicious prosecution; but farther consideration convinced him, that even in the English courts, they were equally indispensable in actions of this kind.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-8\">But however it may be in England, the point is already settled in Virginia; in the case of <em>Young v. Gre</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number><em>gory </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this court held, that <em>justifiable </em>was not equivalent to <em>probable cause; </em>and in Kirtley <em>v. </em>Deck<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> it was decided, that the words <em>false mid malicious </em>were insufficient, hut there must also be added, <em>without probable cause. </em>In the present case therefore, the words \u201c <em>without good cause,\u201d </em>are surely no better, than <em>without justifiable </em>cause; indeed, they are not so strong; and a declaration charging the suit to be without justifiable cause, has already been decided to be vicious. But in Kirtly <em>v. </em>Deck the court was of opinion, that both <em>malice </em>and the want of <em>probable cause </em>must concur, and here there is no allegation of malice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-3\">Again, the special plea of the defendant sets forth, that the defendant had a large claim on Renner and Bussard, partners, &amp;c. and finding property in Virginia belonging to that firm, the defendant had sued out his attachment, the indorsement on which, was the act of Marshall\u2019s counsel. Now the demurrer to this plea admits the truth of the plea, and so there is a good cause for suing out the attachment admitted upon record.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-4\">The fact of the indorsement being the act of the counsel, excludes the idea of there being malice in Marshall.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-5\">And the indorsement on the subpoena, did not require the garnishee to retain any property, which was not the joint property of Bussard and Renner; and therefore, Marshall was not liable to Bussard, for any damage resulting to him, from the seizure and detention of property belonging to Bussard <em>solely.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b20-6\">\n<em>Stanard contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-7\">Denied that special actions on circumstances like these, were governed by the same principles, which control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>suits for malicious prosecution; and therefore, the authoriti.es applicable to such cases, could not govern this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-4\">In this case the declaration and plea must be taken together, and it is a rule of pleading, that when the matter of the plea is incorporated into the declaration, and a good cause of action is made out between them, the plaintiff\u2019s action may be sustained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-5\">The English cases are generally brought for the <em>want of probable </em>cause, and not as this is, because there is already another action pending; but where a party is twice arrested for the same matter, it is in itself good cause of action, whether there be probable cause or not, for either of the actions separately, <footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-6\">But the declaration in this case is sufficient of itself. The English cases shew <em>malice </em>and <em>want of probable cause </em>are not the only words which will give cause of action; but that any equivalent words will support the declaration. Here, the plaintiff says the defendant <em>falsely pretended he had claim\u201d </em>See. and that suing out the attachment was \u201cunjust, <em>improper and without good cause,\u201d' </em>f'itcumsiances from which malice will be implied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-8\">As to the fact of the indorsement being signed by counsel, it is necessarily the act of the party.\u2014whether done by the counsel or the clerk, as it is the act of the party to demand hail, tho? the indorsement be by the clerk.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b21-9\"><em>Leigh </em>replied.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-10\">Georgetown is as foreign to Virginia, so far as this question is affected, as London or Calcutta, and there can be no question, but that the pendency of a suit in a foreign country will not deprive a creditor of his opportunity of attaching the property of his debtor wherever he may find it. One may well sue even in the same country, both in Chancery and in a court of common law. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>C0,lr^ Chancery can only compel the plaintiff to elect one of the two tribunals.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApG\">The reference to 8 Went. 310, is to a case where the was paid before the <em>latitat </em>was sued out, and there was neither good, nor probable cause for the action.\u2014 The authority then by no means proves, that bringing two suits for the same cause, is of itself actionable.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b20-8\"> 3 <em>Call. </em>446.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b20-9\"> 2 <em>Mun. </em>10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b20-10\"> 2 <em>Will. </em>302. 2 <em>Esp.

Deck<footnotemark>(f)</footnotemark> are decisive to shew, that the declaration in this action ought to aver, both malice, and the want of probable cause, either expressly or by equipollent expressions. There are no such expressions in the declaration before us; it is therefore, radically defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-8\">It is alledged by the appellee\u2019s counsel, that the plea being demurred to is admitted, and aids the declaration so far as to make the <em>gravamen </em>of the action consist in the appellee\u2019s being doubly vexed for the same cause.\u2014 Without stopping to inquire whether the plea has this effect or not, that plea does not shew, that at tire time of the institution of this action, the suit in the county of Washington in the district of Columbia, had been commenced. It only avers, that the plaintiff got a Judgment in that court, for the same debt on the 19th January 1815, in an action, which may have been commenced after the institution of this suit. This objection is also decisive against the declaration, considered in this last point of view.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-9\">We are of opinion to reverse the Judgment, and enter it for the appellee, on account of the insufficiency of the declaration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b22-10\"><em> </em>Brooke absent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(e)\">\n<p id=\"b22-11\"> 3 <em>Call. </em>446.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(f)\">\n<p id=\"b22-12\"> 2 <em>Mun. </em>10.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
