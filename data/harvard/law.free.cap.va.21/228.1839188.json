One Beeson became appearance bail, and defended the suit. The writ was returnable to June rules, when the declaration was filed; and Beeson prayed an imparlance. July rules, rule to plead. August, the defendants pleaded <em>\u2018 </em>payment;\u2019 to which plea, there w'as a general replication; and Beeson joined issue. Beeson afterwards became special bail; but the pleadings not being set aside, the case went on against him as appearance bail. At the trial, he moved the court, to suffer him to amend the rules, by setting aside the proceedings subsequent to the replication; and proved, that the issue was joined by the clerk without his consent, and against his wish; the court however refused the order moved for, and Beeson excepted to the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b237-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number><em>Tucker </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AP1N\">The English practice is, for the plaintiff to add the <em>similiter </em>to his replication, for the defendants; the defendant has then a certain number of days to strike it out, and demur; or to <em>go </em>to trial on the issue thus made up. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> The law of Yirginia differs from that of England, only in allowing a longer time for the defendant to make his election, it allows him one month.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-5\">In this case the exercise of the right is very material; for had it been allowed, the appellant must have had judgment in his favor. The declaration would have been bad on demurrer, for it appears upon its face, that there are plaintiffs beside M'Rea, who are not named, a defect fatal on demurrer.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> The replication is also bad, for it states that the plaintiff replied generally. The plea of payment also, concluded with a verification, which tendered no issue, and the <em>similiter </em>was improperly added.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-7\">It is no answer to say the verdict cures the error, for it was wrong to take any verdict; and a verdict improperly taken can cure nothing.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b237-8\"><em>Nicholas </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIfQ\">The entry of special bail discharged the appearance bail from the record. And the special bail had no right to make the objection: for giving special bail does not set aside the office judgment against the principal. He also relied on the error being cured by the verdict.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b237-9\">\n<em>Tucker</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWP\">held that an office judgment against principal and bail, could be set aside by either, only by giving bail and pleading to issue, <footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> And if the appearance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>bail give special bail, and defend the suit, new pleadings must be made up by the defendant.<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> And so Beeson had a right to make the objection.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b237-10\"><em> </em>1 <em>Chit.

The judgment is therefore reversed with costs, and the cause is to he remanded to the rules of the said Superior court, to be proceeded in from the replication, pursuant to the principles now declared.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
