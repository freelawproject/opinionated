said defendants executed the <em>bond </em>aforesaid, as the said Preston\u2019s sureties; and of the sums <em>received by him during his last term of office </em>aforesaid; and that the said Baker is not entitled to recover the said deficit of $83,099,30, of the <em>said defendants </em>in this motion and action, <em>on the issues joined, </em>on the ground that the keeping of the said books <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>of the treasury department, by the said John Preston, during his said last term of office, in the manner herein before stated, was an <em>election </em>by the said John Preston, to hold the money so appearing by the books to he due to the commonwealth, in his <em>official </em>character of treasurer for his said last term of office, (as contended by the said Baker\u2019s counsel,) <em>if it roas in fact eloigned from the treasury during the year </em>1818; unless it appeared, that the said money was actually applied to <em>public

the extinguishment of the said debt due by the said Preston to the commonwealth, on account of the several sums so withdrawn from the treasury, and applied to his own use <em>previous </em>to the

The judgment as to* John Preston was, that the plaintiff take nothing <em>non ob* veredicto; </em>and that the plaintiff take nothing by Ms motion against the other defendants,. but that they go helice without day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A_sB\">The appeal was from this judgment, and now the cause was opened by</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b256-6\"><em>Nicholas </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-7\">The 2d plea ought not to have been admitted by the general court, because it was a repetition of the matter of the first plea in another form. The first was a general plea of conditions performed; and the condition of the bond was, that John Preston should \u201c faithfully account for all monies and other things which should come to his hands in virtue of his office, &amp;c.\u201d The 2d plea avers, that only a given sum came to the hands of Preston in virtue of his office, and that lie had faithfully accounted for it; and had performed all other articles, &amp;c. It is true the statute allows defendants to plead as many several matters as they may think necessary for their defence. <footnotemark><em>(e)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>But these are not several matters, they are the same matter. And it has never been held under the statute, that a defendant shall be allowed to plead specially, a matter put in issue by the plea of the general issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-8\">2d. Should the certified copy of the deed have been admitted in evidence?</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-9\">It is objected to this deed that it is a copy; and the reason for dissallowing copies generally is, that offering them in evidence raises a presumption, that there is something in the original' unfavorable to the party offering the copy. But even a copy is evidence when there is no fair presumption from the circumstances, that there i\u00ab <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>any better evidence of tlie facts to be proved. [For this lie cited Phil. <em>Evid.</em><footnotemark><em>(f)</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>It has moreover long been the usage of the country, to admit certified office copies of deeds as equivalent to the original.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATC\">We proved that the original deed was delivered to Francis Preston, a defendant, and notice was given him to produce it. The late law requiring conveyances of lands, to be recorded in each county in which any part of the lands lie, has made it difficult for parties to know, where to apply for the original; we traced the deed to the possession of F. Preston, a party to the cause; and notice to him to produce it, should let in the secondary proof, even if the copy was inadmissible as primary evidence, which he contended it was. For it is said, one cannot plead <em>non estfactum </em>to an enrolled deed.<footnotemark>(g)</footnotemark> And in the case of Whitacre <em>v. </em>M\u2018Xlhaney,<footnotemark>(h)</footnotemark> this court held, that a copy of a copy was inadmissible; strongly implying, that a copy of an original was good evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-4\">This deed was very important evidence, because it was made to indemnify against loss, the defendants to this motion; and recited, that a default of the treasurer had recently happened, which recital stops the Treasurer from denying either the fact of the default, or the date at which it happened.<footnotemark>(i)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-5\">If it be said the sureties are no parties to this deed; I answer, that it is made, for their benefit, and to a considerable extent has been carried into effect to their exoneration. But if they were not parties, they are at least privies, and boiind by the deed as if they had executed it: and if neither parties nor privies, the admissions of Preston are binding on his sureties. Tlie deed then should have been admitted in evidence, and the purpose for which it was to have been used being important to the appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>^ie judgment of the court rejecting the deed, should be reversed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ab8\">The principal questions still remain to he. discussed, namety\u2019 whether any parol evidence should be received to falsify the treasury books; and whether the manner of I{eeP\u2018nS those books did not amount to an admission by the Treasurer, that he held the sum called for by the books in his official character; and was an election to hold the sum previously due in his official character, as Treasurer for the year 1819.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-6\">It is admitted on all sides, that the hooks of the treasury for several years shewed the balances claimed ought to have been in the hands of the Treasurer; the annual reports of the Treasurer founded on the books reiterated the same assertion. If the Treasurer be now permitted to contradict the hooks, and shew that for whole years they were altogether false, and fraudulently kept, there is no security for the safe keeping of the finances of the country.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-7\">Public books of every description are of very high authority. Entries in the books of corporations, banking, and turnpike companies, are received as of the greatest weight; and public documents like these, are conclusive of the facts contained in them.<footnotemark>(k)</footnotemark> That it was the intention of the legislature that these hooks should preclude all inquiry <em>aliunde </em>as <em>to </em>the transactions in the treasury, is manifest from the particular provisions of the act organizing the financial department of the government.<footnotemark>(l)</footnotemark> By a statute of the British parliament, commissioners are appointed for stating debts due between officers of the army, &amp;c., and it has been decided, that the acts of the commissioners are conclusive upon the parties; and no evidence can be received to contradict their certificate.<footnotemark>(m)</footnotemark> Here the counsel cited the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>of the Commonwealth v. Baynton,<footnotemark>(n)</footnotemark> as applicable to the present.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-3\">Preston then cannot deny, that he held the balances which from the books it appeared ought to have been on hand; and if he cannot, neither can his sureties who are hound by all his acts, and concluded by whatever estops him. Even in criminal cases, the admission of one person often binds another,<footnotemark>(o)</footnotemark> and in civil proceedings the cases in which the admissions of one party bind another are numerous.<footnotemark>(p)</footnotemark> These defendants had or ought to have had from their principal, information of the actual state of the treasury when they executed the bond; and it is too late now to object the want of such information.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-4\">The misapplication of the $146,000 in 1818, relied on by the defendants to shew the default occurred before they signed the bond, cannot help them; for though Preston deposited this sum in bank to his individual credit, it was throughout part of the public treasure; the manner of the deposit could not divest tire Commonwealth of its title to the property. Besides, it no where appears when this sum so deposited was exhausted; it may have been in fact applied by Preston to his individual purposes in 1819, and if so, it was a default in that year, and the case is made out against the defendants even on their own principles. Ills admission by the books, and the reports that the balance claimed was on hand in January 1819, is proof that this sum was not in fact diverted from the public treasure in 1818. Though this sum was deposited to his individual credit, he may have applied it to public uses, and if he did, it must be considered as public money throughout; the place where he kept it, and the mode of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>the deposit cannot alter the character in which he held, it.<footnotemark>(q)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIV\">The same objections apply to the evidence adduced to s^lew? that there had been constant defaults to a greater amount than the sum claimed, for several previous years.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMx\">Treasurer Baker had certainly a right to apply the sum paid over by Preston, to the extinguishment of the debt due by Preston\u2019s default, whenever it happened, and thus leave- the deficiency to be paid at the time of Preston\u2019s resignation. If it he said that the money belonged to the Commonwealth and not to Preston; I reply, that Preston shows his intention that the money shall be so applied by his deed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b260-5\"><em>Staiiard </em>for the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-6\">Considered the point of the admission of the second plea as renounced by the counsel who had preceded him; he having offered neither argument nor authority against its propriety. It is the common case of a brief plea stating the general defence, <em>with </em>another plea setting forth the matter of defence specifically., It will be observed too, that the pleas were not addressed to the favor of the court; it was the first time the parties had an opportunity to plead; they appeared promptly, and offered without delay these matters in their defence. Had there been any thing in either plea unusual or inadmissible, the Commonwealth should have demurred; it would have been without precedent to have rejected a plea in itself proper, in this early stage of the proceeding, on a mere motion. But these pleas would have been proper, and should have been received by the court, whenever, and however offered. The court will never reject a plea on motion, unless it be an insufficient plea, and addressed to its favor; or the plea itself be unnecessarily prolix. As <em>to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>lilis last objection, it surely will not be made to the present plea, after the case mentioned in <em>Chiity\u2019s Pleadings, </em>of a declaration containing 480 counts, which was objected to for prolixity, and the objection was overruled the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aee\">3d. The copy of the deed could have been admitted only on the ground of its being receivable as primary evidence; or as secondary evidence, after notice to produce the original. By notice, is always understood, reasonable notice; and if the deed be in the hands of a third person, its production can he coerced in no other maimer than by a <em>subpoena duces tecum. </em>Even if this deed had been in F. Preston\u2019s possession, it must have been at his house in Washington county, for he proves he had it not with him: and the reasonableness of notice to produce a paper three hundred miles distant, after the Jury is sworn, is not to be debated. Indeed the offer of counsel to continue the cause, to give time for the production of the deed, is a concession, that there is not sufficient time to produce it on the trial. They ask for time to prepare their case, but surely this concession that they are not prepared, cannot stand in the place of preparation; their acknowledgment that they have given an insufficient notice, cannot cure the defect. Allow counsel this latitude, and they will dispense with the necessity of notice in every case. They have only to give notice after the Jury is sworn, and insist that the party shall produce the paper, or go to trial on the copy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-4\">But the counsel failed in the first step toward making this notice of any avail; they did not prove that F. Preston had possession of the deed, and he proves explicitly that he had it not. The notice therefore, was wholly insufficient to let in the copy as secondary evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-5\">Was it allowable as equivalent to the original?</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-6\">This mode of authenticating deeds does not make the \u2022copy evidence of the contents of the deed. The counsel who has opened the case, has urged no reason for such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>opinion, nor has lie shewn it by authority. He has relied on the usage of the country, but no practice short of a uniform and unquestioned course of adjudications, can a^er the law; and there is no such usage on this subject, In the case of Tompkics <em>v. </em>Bownman<footnotemark>(r)</footnotemark> the practice of Sheriff\u2019s <em>toties quoties </em>for failing to return executions, had been uniformly acquiesced in for thirty years; and this court, so far from respecting the usage, made its very universality the ground for the interference of a court of equity, and decided against the legality of the practice. The case of the Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Fairfax,<footnotemark>(s)</footnotemark> was also decided against the practice of the country, which was insisted on in argument. And the only authority which has been referred to,<footnotemark>(t)</footnotemark> went upon the ground of the deed being ancient, and accompanied by possession; a principle which was never controverted. Every case decided in England prior to the statute of 10th Anne, which expressly makes enrolled copies evidence, was either on notice, or the deed was ancient and accompanied by possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-4\">There is a large class of cases very liable to produce confusion on this subject, in which it has been held, that the enrolment may be received to prove the execution of the deed in place of the subscribing witnesses; but in none of them has the enrolled copy been held to prove the contents of the deed, except under the statute. One cannot plead <em>non est factum </em>to an enrolled bond, because the enrolment proves the execution; but that will <em>not let in the </em>copy to prove the contents: the original must be produced, and if this were a bond, there would be no doubt that the copy would be rejected: and our statute has no provision for receiving the copy in evidence, it stands then on the same ground with a bond.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>The leading case in the English books on the subject, is Smartle \"o. Williams<footnotemark>(u)</footnotemark> That case is erroneously reported, as is shewn by Judge Bum,br,\u2019<footnotemark>(v)</footnotemark> and in fact it was decided altogether on the antiquity of the deed.<footnotemark>(w)</footnotemark> For the memorial of a recent deed is clearly inadmissible testi mony. <footnotemark><em>(x)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXd\">The only purpose of an enrolment at common law, was to dispense with proof of the execution. And so impossible was it for a party to prove the contents of a deed by an enrolled copy, that if one lost the original, all right to the subject was gone, for lie could not declare, on a lost deed, and aver that fact to excuse the pro\u00bb fert.<footnotemark>(y)</footnotemark> And the passages referred to in Philips\u2019 Evidence, prove nothing more, than that the enrolment dispenses with proof of the execution by the subscribing witnesses.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-6\">But however authenticated, this deed cannot be evidence against these defendants, because they are no par\u00bb ties to it; the Commonwealth is the third party; it is for her benefit, and surely she cannot make evidence to operate to the prejudice of the sureties. All privity, all connection between Preston and his sureties ceased, on the expiration of the bond, which, and which alone had united them. This court has repeatedly decided, that the declarations and acknowledgments of the partner of a mercantile firm cannot bind other partners, when made after the partnership is dissolved.<footnotemark>(z)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-7\">The deed if admitted could have had no possible effect on the Jury. For the bill of exceptions admits the fact of the default in the treasurer, and the date at which it happened can only be vaguely inferred from the deed; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>tlie very time at which it took place, is expressly admitted to have been proved by the bill of exceptions. And it has often been determined in this court, that a eiA should not be reversed, for an error which could not have altered the result of the case.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7Nu\">S(i. ^t has been said, that the money in the treasury at the time of Treasurer Baker\u2019s election passed to him in virtue of his office; and he liad a right to apply it as a payment by John Preston, to the extinguishment of any sums due by Preston to the Commonwealth. But the sureties were bound only by the wrongful diversion of the public money. It cannot be pretended, that the sums fairly delivered over to his successor were wrongfully diverted. This was not Preston\u2019s money but that of the Commonwealth; how then, could Baker apply this particular money to the extinguishment of Preston\u2019s debt more than any other monies of the Commonwealth? If it was Preston\u2019s money, it would have been assets in the' hands of his executor, and what would be thought of an execution levied on money in the public fisc, to pay his private debt?</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-5\">If this be the law, the Commonwealth has an easy method of making good the defaults of all her officers:, only appoint them Treasurers, or to some office where large sums of money are received; wait until great public payments have been made, and then seize the treasure, to extinguish past delinquences, and proceed against the sureties, for all the sums thus forcibly and treacherously laid hold of.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-6\">4th. I come now to the last question, and the only one of real importance in the case, the conclusiveness of the treasury books. In discussing it, I shall advert to the plea alleging that the first bond was the only one authorized by law to be taken, only for the purpose, of drawing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>from the other side consequences and principles which necessarily follow, from denying that the first bond is the only one which is binding. To prove their case in this part of the argument, they arc compelled to maintain, that every bond of the Treasurer is limited in its operation to the year in which it is given: that the liability of the sureties is the samo, as if a different man, was elected Treasurer and different persons became sureties every year. We must too, consider this case as if a sufficient bond, with ample security had been taken every year, for the omission of the commonwealth to take bonds in other years, cannot operate to the disadvantage of these defendants. Then the question on which set of sureties the loss shall fall, is one between the sureties of different years only; to the commonwealth it is immaterial, for she is supposed to be amply secured against the loss, happen when it may; to Preston it is of no importance, for he is equally liable whenever the default occurred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-3\">The issues between the parties were, what was the amount of money actually in the treasury when the bond of January 1819 was executed; what sums came to Preston\u2019s hands as Treasurer between that date, and his resignation; and what was disbursed in public expenditures. And the objection in the court below, was to the. evidence by which the defendants sustained their defence. This was admitted to be the matter in issue, while it was held that the defendants were precluded from giving any evidence on the subject; precluded, because the treasury books are conclusive to shew what sum was in fact in the treasury; and being conclusive, no evidence shall be received to contradict them. Agreed; let the books be conclusive to shew what money was in fact in the treavsury; then if they are conclusive in January 1819, they must be equally so in January 1820, and if they be, there is no default in the Treasurer to this day; his books <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>s^ewe&lt;^ the money was in the treasury at the day of his resignation, as clearly as they could shew it, when he and the sureties executed the bond. They must betaken as conclusive throughout or not at all; always, or never, Counsel on the other side make them time or false to suit their convenience,</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Avb\">I say that before a Jury there is no evidence in itself necessarily conclusive; there is no evidence known to the law which you may not contradict, except in the case of estoppel: In every such case, the estoppel must be pleaded, even if it be. matter of record. Even a judgment between the same parties on the matter in controversy must be pleaded by way of estoppel; and if they go to trial on the general issue, the judgment is not conclusive, but only evidence to be weighed by the Jury, and they may find against the former verdict and judgment.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> In the case before us, the very matter in issue was. were the accounts kept by the Treasurer correct? to say that these defendants cannot prove them to be incorrect, is directly to deny them the right of being heard in their defence: they have a right to plead matter which discharges them, but no right to prove it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AcG\">The bond is prospective in its terms, and its obligation, as understood by all parties at the time. Yet the construction on the other side, makes one bond extinguish all the preceding bonds; and imposes on sureties who bound themselves to make good any deficiency happening in the year during which they were sureties, the burthen of all deficiencies past, present, and to come, until another bond should be executed. Suppose this issue had been made up between the sureties of 1818 and 1819, could the sureties of 1818 rely on the subsequent bond as an extinguishment, and thus discharge themselves from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>deficiency admitted to have happened in 1818? or suppose the commonwealth had made this motion on the bond of 1818, could the sureties have urged in their defence, that a bond w as taken for the subsequent year, and therefore they were discharged? Yet the sureties of both years cannot be liable for the same default, and if a motion could be sustained against the sureties in the year in which the wrong was done, it is clear that it could not against those of a subsequent year, who undertook to indemnify against future losses only. If these defendants be liable at all, they were on the instant they executed the bond, before the ink with which they signed it was dry; before the key of the treasury was delivered to John Preston, the commonwealth might have recovered from these defendants the whole amount of his past peculation; thousands of dollars which he had plundered before they ever saw him, w ould thus he made to come to his hands in virtue of his office, after their execution of this fatal bond. Little has been offered by way of argument to support this doctrine at once novel, and repugnant to every sense of justice, and every principle of reason. And as to authority, after winter\u2019s search through the volumes of law without number, only two cases have been mentioned as bearing at all upon tlie question. And truly one would think that those two cases had been cited rather in anticipation of their being used as authorities for us, than from any expectation they can avail the counsel on the other side. In the case of Ingraham <em>v, </em>Maine Bank,<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> Chief Justice <em>Parker </em>expressly limits the right of the bank to recover against the sureties, to misconduct happening after the execution of the bond, a principle which we have never controverted. In that case, the money was misapplied by the Cashier for whose good conduct the bond was conditioned, after the execution of the Bond, and before the removal of the Cashier: The case might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>an authority 011 a mo^on against the sureties of 1818, and so far is a case, against the counsel who has used it on this motion. The commonwealth <em>v. </em>Baynton,<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> was []ie 0ther case referred to by the counsel who has opened , , \u201e , _ , . the cause: and the court expressly directed the jury, to con^inc ^ie responsibility of the sureties to the <em>deficit occurring </em>during the year ensuing the date of the bond, a case directly in point against every position urged on the other side.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b268-11\">Robertson, Attorney General, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-12\">The admission of the 2d plea was contrary to the usual practice, for whatever could have been proved under the second, would have been equally available under the first plea. Pleading the same matter over, tends to prolixity and confusion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaG\">2d. The certified copy of the deed recorded on the acknowledgment of the party, was admissible evidence. This was the law of England prior to the statute of Anne.<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> Lord <em>Holt </em>says in the case referred <em>to </em>in Comberback, that the inrolment being on the acknowledgment <em>of the </em>party cannot be denied. The statute of Anne was enacted, to obviate a technical objection in pleading. Before its passage, whenever a deed was used to defeat an estate set up, the deed was pleaded with a profert,<footnotemark>(f)</footnotemark> and the original was necessary. The statute dispensed with the profert of the original, and allowed the copy in its stead.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-15\">Generally, where an officer is charged by law with the safe keeping of public papers and documents, copies certified by him are evidence: thus in cases of the poll at an election.<footnotemark>(g)</footnotemark> In Rowletts <em>v. </em>Daniel, already cited, a copy was admitted without proving the original lost. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>There are many analogous cases in support of the princ\u00a1p\u00ede.<footnotemark>(h)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2o\">This copy should have been admitted on the circumstances under which it wras offered, it is a sworn copy, <em>1 </em>* recorded on the acknowledgment o\u00ed the grantor, and the original was traced to F. Preston, who acted under it, who had notice to produce it, who was offered time for its production, and who would give no explicit answer as to what course he would pursue. His conduct was calculated to ensnare his adversary, and courts of justice will not sanction such proceedings: it waived the necessity of notice. Then he could not say whether the original was in existence, and the copy was admissible on the ground that the original was lost.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-8\">It is urged that the deed could be of no avail because executed after the privity between Preston and his sureties ceased, and the cases of acknowledgments by partners after the connection is dissolved have been cited.

The argument requires that the court should weigh the effect of evidence which is the province of the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-10\">3d. Treasurer Baker had a right to apply the money paid over by Preston to the extinguishment of any previous debt due by Preston. I admit that the money in the treasury vaults passed to Baker in virtue of his office, but that in the banks was Preston\u2019s money; it would have passed to his personal representatives on his death. If not, the commonwealth might follow the specific money into whatever hands it might come. On general principles, Preston and these sureties must pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>llP deficiency as it stood when he was Sailed to account and failed, <footnotemark><em>(k)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>And Preston having' taken a receipt from his successor for the money on hand, without directing the manner of applying it, Baker may apply it to the discharge of any debt due by Preston to the commonwealth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGv\">4th. Preston and his sureties cannot falsify the books, and annual reports of the treasurer; they are conclusive to shew that when made, the sums they allege to be on hand, are so in fact. We are told that there is no evidence in itself conclusive of any thing; that there is no estoppel in law, without its being pleaded. I had supposed the contrai\u2019y: one cannot allege his own turpitude; a tenant cannot deny his lessor\u2019s title; one cohabiting with a woman in an action for necessaries furnished her, cannot deny that she is his wife. The cases cited to prove that there can be no estoppel without being pleaded, shew only, that one may waive an estoppel, as he may any other advantage. Shelton <em>v. </em>Barbour,<footnotemark>(l)</footnotemark> and Pegram <em>v. </em>Isabell <em>,</em><footnotemark><em>(m)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>were cases in which the <em>pa rtf </em>was held to be stopped from denying a particular fact, because particular evidence offered of it, was conclusive, and yet the estoppel was not pleaded. How could the treasury books be pleaded as an estoppel? it was impossible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-5\">That our argument would make each bond extinguish all given in the preceding years, is not a fair deduction from our principle; for we hold the proof shews the default happened in the year the bond was executed on which this motion was made. And the case I have cited from Leach proves, that in law the default is considered to have happened when the party fails to account. And whenever the default happened, Preston when he rendered his accounts in January 1819 and executed this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>bond, made his election to abide by the books and his report; and his sureties are equally bound with him to stand to the election. He cannot now allege that they are false, and that he practised a fraud; if he cannot, neither can his sureties: no evidence is admissible as to one, which would not be for the other. That his reports, and books conclude him, the case of Moody <em>v. </em>Thrustun,<footnotemark>(n)</footnotemark> unequivocally proves: there it was not allowed to contradict the certificate of the army commissioners.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b271-4\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-5\">Before I enter on the consideration of the admissibility of the office copy of the deed, I beg to reca\u00ed to the attention of the court, the circumstances under which it was offered. It was a deed executed by John Preston after the expiration of his office: it does not recite whew, the default in the treasurer occurred, but only that it was apprehended, that loss might accrue to the sureties by some default recently incurred: the commonwealth itself, and not the sureties, is the immediate <em>cestui que trust; </em>it is executed by Preston and wife only, not by the sureties; recorded on acknowledgment, before Justices, by Preston and wife; never as to the sureties recorded any where, and not \u00f3nc of them is proved ever to have claimed any benefit under it. Under these circumstances I say, that the original itself would have been no evidence against these defendants, on the issue joined. For all privity had ceased between Preston and his sureties; and Rootes <em>v. Wellford, </em><footnotemark><em>(o)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and Shelton <em>v. </em>Cocke, Crawford &amp; Co. <footnotemark><em>(p)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>prove, that the privity may cease even between principals; and that when once dissolved, no act of one party can be of any force as to the other. I shall not stop to inquire whether this princi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>pie so often recognised and reiterated by this court, be contradicted by the cases referred to by the Attorney General in Gallison and Taunton. It is not in the power \u00b0^he C0U1\u2019ts whose decisions are l\u2019elied on, to reverse principles so well established, and on the best reasons this court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APj2\">This deed contains no recital which could possibly prejudice the sureties, and if it had, it could not be used against them, for the recital in a deed can be used only against the party making <em>it.</em><footnotemark><em>(q)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It is the sealing and delivery which constitute the deed, and it was not in the power of Preston or the commonwealth, to make these defendants parties or privies to any transactions between them, without their concurrence. If Preston had confessed a judgment for the whole amount claimed, will any one pretend his sureties would have been hound by his confession of judgment? No, they are bound by the bond alone, and for acts within the penalty of the bond, done while its condition was in force.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-7\">We are reminded that the trustees acted under this deed. Be it so; they were not trustees of these defendants, but of Preston; and if he could not prejudice his sureties by acts done after the privity ceased, neither can his trustees or agents. The money which it is said one of the defendants has received from the trust fund, does not appear on this record to have been so received, nor that he knew from whence it came; and if all this had appeared, a surety who got the money would have been morally justifiable, and legally entitled to hold it: a chancellor would have protected his possession. The deed shews, that the sureties did not know in what year the default happened; alarmed at the unexpected detection of the dishonesty of their principal, they endeavoured to make themselves safe, by securing to the commonwealth the payment of the deficiency whenever it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number><em>Might </em>have happened; and this precaution of common prudence is converted into evidence of their knowledge of the time when the pecidation was committed. They have attempted to protect themselves from ruin, an(l that very act shall destroy them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMU\">If the original would have been admissible evidence, it then becomes a question, whether this copy was. The general rule is admitted to be, that the best evidence of the fact to be proved, shall alone be received, <footnotemark>(r)</footnotemark> And the copy is the best, because the original was lost, says the attorney. What proof is there of this fact? F. Preston was not entitled to the custody of this paper; he had received it but for a moment, with the very purpose of delivering it to another; he had not possession of it, when the notice was given, he had no reason to believe it was lost, he does not assert it, but tiie contrary; and yet the copy is to he received because the original no longer existed, or could not he procured. Before a deed is presumed to he lost, some inquiry must be made after it, of those entitled to the possession. In this case, the clerks of the counties where the land lay, were the proper persons to whom to apply; and a <em>subpoena duces tecum </em>to whoever of them had it, would have produced it. Suppose however, F. Preston had possession of the deed, the notice to produce it must be reasonable. Was notice after the jury wms sworn, requiring the production of a paper three hundred miles off reasonable? The counsel however oifered to continue the cause, and wait for its production; offered to whom? to the opposite counsel. If they were unprepared in their case, they should have asked a continuance as matter of right and justice; they cannot complain in this court, that either the parties or the counsel below, would not accept a proposition disadvantageous to them. They could not require of F. Preston the concession of any legal right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>* k,10W that in England, the <em>inspexiums </em>of the clerk makes the copy of equal validity, even in evidence with tiie original. But it is by the express provision of the Matute of Anne. The cases to which we have been referr\u00e9d in <em>Gilbert</em><footnotemark><em>(s)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and Coke,<footnotemark>(t)</footnotemark> are only illustrations \u00b0f the different kinds of inrolment, they do not prove that the copy of an inrolled deed was admissible evidence of its contents. And those in Styles,<footnotemark>(u)</footnotemark> and <em>Keble </em>were of ancient deeds, which is altogether on a different principle from that now under discussion. The case of Smartle <em>v. </em>Williams so much relied on, was also an ancient deed; one recorded on the acknowledgment of the grantor, which could not therefore be altered as this might, between the acknowledgment and inrolment; and Judge <em>Butter </em>doubts the authority of that case, as will be. seen by the passage in his <em>Nisi Prim </em>already referred to. The deed in question, was acknowledged before justices in the country, and may have been altered after it was acknowledged, and before it was recorded; the clerk therefore cannot certify that it is a true copy of the deed, as it was acknowledged. Suppose on the production of the original, all the material part was interlined, or interpolated, in another hand, and it could he proved, that it was added after the certificate of acknowledgment; could it be pretended that the certified copy would prove the execution of a deed, which is expressly shewn never to have been executed? What is as good evidence as another matter, is a subject of sound reason and discretion; and it is clear, that the original is better evidence than the certified copy, because it shews any alteration made upon its face.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AU68\">I have said Smartle <em>v. </em>Williams, was the case of an ancient deed; the case as reported in <em>Levinz</em><footnotemark><em>(v)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>shews it was 35' or 6 years old, and Justice <em>Bayley </em>mentions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>that circumstance in the case of Tinkler <em>v. </em>Walpole, <footnotemark>(w)</footnotemark> Tiiat ancient deeds are admitted on a wholly different principle is proved by the cases cited in <em>Bacon\u2019s abridge menl.</em><footnotemark><em>(x)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>T'lie case in Styles was decided on this principle; so was that of Rowletts <em>v. </em>Daniel in this court; and Lee <em>v. </em>Tapscolt <footnotemark><em>(y)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>long before. But taking the law to be as laid down by <em>Gilbert, </em>the copy is still inadmissible in Virginia, because the deed does not derive its efficacy from the inrohnent. In England by the statute of Hen. VIO., the estate does not pass without inrohnent; and <em>Gilbert </em>says, \u201cwhere the deed needs inrohnent &amp;c.\u201d By our laws though deeds not recorded, are void as to creditors and subsequent purchasers without notice, they are valid between the parties and pass the whole estate on delivery, whether recorded or not. <em>Gilbert </em>says too, that an officer being appointed to take care of deeds, to preserve and authenticate them, his certified copies are admissible evidence. Our law gives no power to the clerk to certify copies, nor lias it attached any weight to his certificate. The word <em>\u201crecord\u201d </em>in our act, means no more than that the clerk shall register the deed; it does not when registered make it matter of record, in the sense in which records are spoken of as conclusive. The case from Vernon mentioned by the Attorney General, as cited in <em>Viner, </em>was of a lost deed, which has no bearing on this case. The act of Anno under which copies are admitted in England, has never been incorporated into our code. Nor have we any analogous acts, but those allowing copies of patents certified by the Register, and of wills certified by the clerks (who cannot deliver out the original,) to be given in evidence, and to be used for every purpose as of equal validity with the original.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>The practice of the country which has been urged for admitting the copy, is nothing but a rule of convenience adopted by counsel, the dispute in almost every case, being as to the genuineness of the deed, but its legal effect. The practice wherever the question has been ma(^e within my knowledge, lias been to reject the copy, if it was otherwise, one of the important duties of this court, is to correct and reform illegal and erroneous practices. Tompkies <em>v. </em>Downman was a decision made for the very purpose of correcting a universal error in practice. And practice can no more abrogate the laws of evidence than any other part of our jurisprudence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-4\">This deed is certified by but one clerk, and to make the case analogous to the doctrine of <em>Gilbert </em>as expounded on the other side, the copy is not admissible until the original has been recorded by the clerk of each county in which any portion of the land lies.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A19\">The argument on the propriety of admitting the 2d plea is not given, because the point seemed virtually abandoned by the opposite counsel, as the 3d plea was surrendered by the appellee\u2019s counsel, who cited Stuart <em>V. </em>Lee<footnotemark>(z)</footnotemark> as the precedent on which it was framed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKC\">2d. I come now to the principal point on the merits of the cause: are the books and reports of the late Treasurer conclusive, to shew the default occurred in 1819? The decision of this question, will aifect only the $83,000 claimed to be due on the books, and not the other sums which arc charged to Preston and his Sureties on other evidence. The case stated shews, that there was on every day for many months preceding the execution of this bond, a greater deficiency in the treasury, than the whole amount claimed on this motion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-7\">First, are Preston\u2019s books prior to the execution of this bond, conclusive against these defendants to prove any \u25a0thing whatever? The hooks do not profe.ss to shew what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Vas in the treasury, or what ought to have been in it, at the time of the execution of the bond, but on the 1st day of October preceding it. The books then could not shew any embezzlement made between October 1818, and Jan. 1819. The doctrine maintained on the other side might establish a privity between Preston and these sureties before they ever saw or heard of him, and had ho been many years in office, even before they were horn.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-5\">The reports of the committees of the legislature are known by the rules of legislative bodies never 1o he concurred in by either house. And if they were, there is no principle of evidence on which they could be held conclusive. It is said they are part of the <em>res gestas; </em>but between whom? not between these defendants and any body. In all the passages referred to in <em>Philips, </em>and <em>Gilbert, </em>on the conclusiveness of public documents, there is but one case in which any of them are held to be conclusive of any tiling. That is the registry of a ship, which by Act of Parliament, as in this country by Act of Congress, are conclusive of want of title, in all persons not named in the register. Even there, it is not conclusive of title. The resolution of a legislative body, is conclusive when properly authenticated, that such a resolution has passed,- but it is not conclusive of any fact asserted in it. If it were conclusive, the resolution in this case would prove beyond contradiction, that there was no default in Preston, and ho would be discharged. It is not conclusive as to Preston himself, for it is not a record, neither is it under seal. It is only parol evidence, and there is no parol evidence which may not he contradicted.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-6\">Admit for the sake of argument, that the books and reports are conclusive: they can be so only of what they assert, and not of that which they do not assert. They acknowledge then, that there ought to have been a given. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>balance in the hands of the Treasurer when the bond was' executed. They no where profess that the balance was in fact in his hands. Against Preston, they might be conclusive of the fact to the Jury; but that would be for the Jury to decide.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ae3\">The question is not between Baker and Preston, but Preston\u2019s sureties, who stand on quite different ground from him; he has made default, but his failure to defend himself, cannot prejudice them. Whether Preston knew his default or not, cannot injure the defendants. He had every motive of interest, of honour, and of shame, to conceal the fact, of the embezzlement. Whatever efforts he might make to do so, could not change the liabilities of the sureties, nor alter the date at which the default actually occurred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-8\">We are told, that the law has prescribed the method of keeping these books, and that we ought not to be allowed to falsify them. We do not falsify them; they do not purport to shew the money actually in the treasury, but only the balance which ought to have been there. We wish to prove that the balance which ought to have been there, in fact was not, The books then may be true,, and our evidence true also: there is then no falsification, The mode of keeping the books prescribed by the act, renders it impossible that the embezzlement should appear on their face. The Treasurer can neither enter a debit, nor a credit, without the auditor\u2019s warrant, or a special act of assembly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-9\">I repeat, that there is no evidence conclusive of any thing, unless it be pleaded as an estoppel: and estoppels are odious in law. Yes, we are told that there are estoppel <em>in pais. </em>True. But they must be pleaded; and if they be offered as evidence without being pleaded as estoppels, not only may they be contradicted, but Juries may find against them. But if Preston had entered on these books eiso much money embezzled in 1819\u201d either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>the Commonwealth, or he, or his sureties might shew it was an untrue entry, on this issue. For an estoppel must he pleaded, and must conclude with demanding judgment whether the party shall be permitted to deny the matter pleaded.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> The cases of cohabitation, &amp;c., mentioned by the Attorney General, prove nothing more than that when a party has fully made out his case in a court of justice, the other side shall not deny the law applicable to the facts. We learn from Lord <em>Coke, </em>that every estoppel must he reciprocal,<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> and here it is not pretended that the Commonwealth is estopped from contradicting these hooks.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-3\">The case principally relied on hy the other side, to prove the conclusiveness of the treasury hooks, is Moody v. Thruston.<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> That was a settlement of claims by the army commissioners appointed under a statute for the purpose of adjusting such disputes, and stands in every respect, on the same foundation with the judgment of a court,* as the certificate of our commissioners on preemption rights, does under our land law. And this court has held such certificate to he conclusive even on infants, from the provisions of the statute. But arc Pres - ton\u2019s entries the records of a court?</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-4\">The law of evidence consists of a number of rules founded in reason, and designed to ascertain the truth. This is the first attempt that ever was made, to set up title to property on the single ground of a rule of evidence, and it is in effect done, hy the Commonwealth; for the Commonwealth admits, these sureties arc not bound for this money by the letter or tenor of the bond, but in virtue of the nature of these books as matter of evidence, taken in conjunction with the bond. That Preston\u2019s manner of keeping these books was an election by him to hold the money which had been misapplied, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>his character of Treasurer. But an election to hold,. what was already gone, and what it was impossible lie-could hold, is to my mind unintelligible. The constqUences 0f this doctrine are too preposterous to be law. If by intendment of law the money shall be held to be in. *n ^ie treasury when the bond was executed, when it certainly is not there, then these sureties were bound for all past transgressions on the moment of signing\u2019 the bond, before Preston had done a single act in virtue of his office. The express obligation of the bond is altered and inverted, and \u00abmonies which shall come to his hands\u201d means, monies which came to his hands antjf have been passed away years ago.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahf\">The idea that the embezzlement is coinpletc only when the Treasurer fails to account, converts the Treasurer of Virginia into a farmer general of the revenue, and exposes the finances of the country to the casualities of individual solvency. The definition of embezzlement is derived from the Roman law,<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> and includes every case of a fraudulent or illegal withdrawal of the public treasure, by the officer to whose custody it is confided. Our statute of 1819 making it a felony, has defined it in the same manner. If the banks had totally failed, can it be pretended that the loss would have fallen on Preston? when he is expressly directed by law to deposit the pub-lie treasure in the banks.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AgT\">The doctrine of application is clearly laid down in Hill <em>v. </em>Southerland\u2019s Executor,<footnotemark>(f)</footnotemark> and is too well settled to need argument. The plaintiff cannot make the application at the trial, so as to affect the liability of the several sureties.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number><em>Wickham </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AeLb\">The first reason assigned for reversing the judgment is, that the 2d plea is the same with the first. Grant for the. sake of the argument, that they are identical; this court will not reverse a judgment because the same plea is twice copied into the record. It may have been error to admit it, but it was an error which prejudiced no one, and this court will not take notice of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-5\">2. The office copy of the deed should have been received in evidence,because it is the common usage of the country, we are told. I do not know who can better judge of the usages of our courts of justice, than the Judges of the general court; they have decided against this pretended usage. We all know how many usages are common in practice for the convenience of the profession, which are not in conformity to law. Gentlemen waive the law, but that by no means proves what the law is, for others who insist on their strict legal rights. It is every day\u2019s practice to allow Executors who have qualified in other states to sue and to recover judgments in Virginia, without producing their letters testamentary. Yet if any gentleman chose to call for them by oyer, they must be produced. Letters of Attorney are never called for, though they too may be demanded, and if demanded must be produced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-6\">I repeat, that the original deed would not have been admissible on the issue joined. The general court very properly rejected the deed without giving reasons for the judgment; it may have been because it was a copy, or because it was not legal evidence from some other principle. All privity had ceased between Preston and his sureties, and the cases already cited shew, that no act done by him could prejudice them. The doctrine was very fully discussed in the case of Shelton <em>v. </em>Cocke, Crawford &amp; Co.; was settled by this court on .the soundest principles, and cannot now be disturbed. This deed would not conclude John Preston himself; every thing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>it pertinent to this issue is the recital, and Lord <em>Coke</em><footnotemark><em>(g)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>tells us \u201cneither doth a recital conclude, because no direct affirmation.\u201d This court has decided, that a deffiaration reciting the fact, without a positive averment \u00b0 . <em>1 </em>is vicious: and surely tins recital in a deed to which the defendants are not parties, cannot conclude them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aft\">It is said the defendants claim under this deed. It is shewn that F. Preston had once possession of the deed, and that B. Peyton had received part of the money raised by the sale of some of the property. Neither of these, acts can affect the other defendants, who have not delegated a power either to John Preston or his sureties, to hind them. Nothing is evidence as to one of the defendants, which is not against them all. The judgment must be against all or none of the defendants. The original deed therefore could not have been admitted. I will not argue the point as to the copy, because it is <em>a fortiori </em>inadmissible, for the reasons given, and because the notice was wholly insufficient, to entitle the party to use it as secondary evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-9\">In all the cases cited, to shew that a certified office copy is of equal validity with the original, the question was as to the title of the land, and the execution of the deed. This on the contrary is the mere recital of collateral.matter, not necessary to the validity of the deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-10\">It is urged on the other side, that the evidence contained in the deed was of great moment. Any argument on the weight of evidence addressed to a court is irregular. To weigh evidence is the peculiar province of the jury, to the court it is <em>cor am nonjndice.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-11\">2d. The argument of the Commonwealth\u2019s counsel shews, that there is no treasury in Virginia; the treasurer may keep the public money where he pleases; he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>may lend it out; or speculate with it, without being guilty of a default. The act directing him peremptorily to deposit it in hank, is merely directory; and what is more, he is at liberty to disobey the direction. But this is not the law. The Treasurer must deposit the treasure in bank; and to appropriate any portion of it to Ids own use, is at once a conversion, it is a mistake in law to suppose the public treasure in hank would go to the Treasurer\u2019s executor, were he to die: it would pass to his successor in virtue of ins office,.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-3\">3d. The point most insisted on is, that we shall not he heard to contradict the treasury books, and annual reports. V/e only ask gentlemen to take the books as true or false. They may have them which they will, if they only stand to their election: we only pray that they may not he considered both true and false, according to the pleasure of the counsel, if they be false, surely we may he allowed to assert the truth in opposition to what is admitted to be false. If they be true, there is no default now; for they assert the money to have been in the treasury when Preston resigned his office, as positively as they had asserted it, at any prior time. But from the very nature of these books nothing can appear on their face, hut legal credits, and charges; there is no entry on them, there can be none, of monies embezzled, or when, or how, or by whom converted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-4\">Something is said of Preston\u2019s not being allowed to allege his own turpitude. This is a very vague and undefined doctrine, the application of which to the present \u00abase I do not precisely understand.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> But I am sure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>there Ls no principle of law which can authorise the Cow - wonwealth to select on which of half a dozen sets of sureties this loss shall fall. It is clear, a recovery may \u2018\u00ede 011 ^10 k\u00b0n\u00ed* <em>*a torco </em>when the default occurred, Once depart from that plain principle, and we are at sea; once leave the bond on which the Jesral remedy is clear, \u00b0 <em>J </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>and we, cannot tell on whom the loss may be fixed. But Preston proves that when he is charged with this default, he was innocent; and this is called alleging his turpi,1</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AG4\">These sureties were misled by the culpable supmeneos of the officers of government. Had the committees the executive done their duty, this default could never have happened; had the committee of the legislature, as it ought to have done, insisted on a count, these sureties would never have executed this bond. Instead of doing this, the committee went aside from the ordinary path of its duty, to pay a compliment to the zeal and integrity of the Treasurer; and relying on the faith of government these sureties have been deceived, betrayed, and should the doctrine contended for by the Commonwealth be sustained, will he ruined.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b285-7\"><em>Barbour </em>concluded for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-8\">The question of the admissibility of the deed has been argued both on the ground of its being primary, and secondary evidence. I shall also consider it in those two aspects.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-9\">1. The copy of a deed recorded on the acknowledgment of the grantor is admissible <em>per se, </em>against him anil all claiming under him.<footnotemark>(h)</footnotemark> There was an enrolment at common for safe keeping; which created an estoppel, and after it, the party could not plead <em>non est factum: </em>and the reasons which in ordinary cases require <em>'the </em>production of the original, cease to exist in a caso like this. In ordinary cases <em>non est factum </em>might he pleaded; and when pleaded, the subscribing witness is called to preve the execution, because it is supposed he knows more of the facts than any other person. But if <em>non est factum </em>could not be pleaded at common law to an inrolled deed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>w'*y should the office copy be inadmissible evidence? what purpose can the refusal serve, when the party himself cannot deny by a plea, that it is his deed? The in-then not only proves he made a deed; but that this is the very deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKDL\">The other ground for refusing a copy in ordinary cases js? that the failure to offer the original implies, that there is a difference between the copy and the original, unfavorable to the party offering the copy. But is there any ground in this case for such a presumption? If the evidence of the officer could prove the original if produced, why not that the copy is true? This doctrine was established in the case of Smartle v. Williams;<footnotemark>(i)</footnotemark> and the bargainor and those claiming under him were estopped. This case was adjudged before the statute of Anne; and the antiquity of the deed, now used to distinguish that case from this, was not relied on by the court, which proceeded on the ground of its being an inrolled deed. <em>Peake </em><footnotemark><em>(k)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in laying down the law as to ancient deeds, observes that if the deed be erased or interlined, the ordinary evidence in such cases will be required. Plainly shewing, that the original itself is produced in such cases. Besides, you must learn even the antiquity by the copy, which presupposes the copy to be admissible. (The counsel on the other side said, \u201cno, the antiquity appears from. .the date of the clerk\u2019s certificate.\u201d) It is urged that this doctrine is questioned by <em>Buller; </em>but he does not question, that the deed inrolled on the acknowledgment of the bargainor,\u2019 is evidence against'him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-6\">In England, the officer for the safe keeping of deeds is not appointed to do it by the express words of the statute, but by its legal operation; so it is in Virginia. In England too it is said, the. estate passes by virtue of \u2022the inrolment, and cannot pass without it. So it docs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>here, as to creditors and subsequent purchasers without notice. There is the same confidence reposed in the officer charged with the safe custody, here as in England; and that is the ground for admitting the copy in both countries. It is objected that in England the deed is inrolled only on acknowledgment in court; and here it is on the certificate of acknowledgment before justices, The statute of 27 <em>Ken. </em>VIII. c. 16, provides for the inrolmont of deeds on acknowledgment before two justices, and the <em>cusios </em>rohdonlm, In Virginia, magistrates are supposed to deliver the deed and certificate under seal, which is a sufficient precaution to prevent forgeries after execution. But there are many cases in England in which the copy was admitted, where no snrolmcnt was required by the <em>statute, </em><footnotemark><em>(l)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>And where the deed docs need inrolmcnt (as this does as to creditors and snbsequent purchasers without notice,) it is when inrolled, a record: and if a record, there is an end of the dispute. The language of our statute is that \u201cdeeds shall be admitted to record\u201d Ac., and the expression to be \u201centered of record\u201d makes the entry when made a record, <footnotemark><em>(m)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>And generally the copy of any original document of a public nature is admissible evidence: <footnotemark><em>(n)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>as the sworn copy of a church register: and a copy certified by a sworn officer charged with the custody, is better evidence than an ordinary sworn copy. The case cited from 14 <em>East, </em>is a mere <em>dictum </em>of the Judge, and not an adjudication.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AI6Z\">The statute of Anne made no other alteration of the common law, than to dispense with the production of the original when it was pleaded with a profert. The commonwealth is a stranger to the deed, and was not obliged to make profert. And since the case of Head <em>v. </em>Brookman,<footnotemark><em>(o)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a deed may be declared on without profer\u00ed: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>^ profer\u00ed be made, the deed must be produced. The dictum of <em>Sir James Mansfield </em>in the case cited in 5 <em>Taunton, </em>is directly contrary to the statute of <em>Anne.\u00ab </em>But surely as much faith is due to copies certified by , J * , , , . our clerks to be true, as to transcripts rrom the books oi ^ie fni*ia company in England,\u2019 and they are admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-8\">2. The deed should have been received as secondary evidence. This court will control the practice of all inferior courts.<footnotemark>(p)</footnotemark> And. giving notice to produce originals to let in secondary proof, is of modern date. <em>Morgan </em>states the practice with a <em>queere </em>whether it be necessary. Philips<footnotemark><em>(q)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>lays down the law to be, that a counterpart may be given in evidence without notice,\" yet he places counterparts under the head of secondary evidence. And where the deed is in court, notice for its production is not <em>necessary.</em><footnotemark><em>(r)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The inconvenience of the course it is said we should have taken, would be great. To send <em>subpoenas duces tecum </em>to many clerks of the remotest counties'in the state, could never be intended by the statute, to be required. In the case of Maswell <em>v. </em>Light<footnotemark>(s)</footnotemark> the court would have allowed the copy in evidence, if the original had been duly recorded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-9\">Preston <em>v. </em>Harvie and Falcon <em>v. </em>Harris, are <em>cited to </em>shew, that this court will not reverse a judgment for an immaterial error. But in both cases, the error committed in the inferior court, if there was any, was to the advantage of the appellant. That is not the case here. The error was injurious to the appellant. The recital of the deed would have operated to the disadvantage of Preston, and neither he nor his sureties could have contradicted the recital, <footnotemark>(t)</footnotemark> It is said that if all the defendants were not bound by the recital, and the acts done, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>none were. To support the contrary position I refer to Geddy <em>v. Butler,</em><footnotemark><em>(u)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and Nelson <em>v. </em>Burwell, <footnotemark>(v)</footnotemark> A bill of exceptions is not a demurrer to evidence. There was in this case other evidence than that spread upon the record, and we may presume any thing to have been proved, which might have been proved. It may have been shewn that the deed was made at the instance of all the defendants and that all of them acted under it. The defendants cannot claim under the deed, and evade the operation of any part of it; they have elected to abide by it, and they must take it, throughout.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-4\">3. We insist that whenever the default occurred, treasurer Baker had a right to apply the monies received by him of J. Preston, to its extinguishment. The general court said no, it was the commonwealth\u2019s money; and it could not be applied to the payment of a debt due by Preston. There is however no particular date fixed, at which it is said this money came to hand. If it was received in 1818, it is conceded that it may be applied to extinguish the default of that year. But suppose it to be the commonwealth\u2019s money. Had it not a right to apply its own money as it pleased? And if it applied the money to the discharge of the last bond, the presumption would arise that the first was paid, <footnotemark><em>(w)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In common prudence then, she ought to apply the money to extinguish the debt first due.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-6\">4. I come now to the main question on the merits, and insist that no evidence can bo received to contradict the treasury books. If they be conclusive of what money shall be considered to be on hand at the time the bond was executed, I care not, as to the manner in which they are so; whether by estoppel, or because of such weight, that no counter evidence shall be heard. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>alleged on the other side, that matter of estoppel must be pleaded; and that there is no evidence in itself conclusive before a jury, as <em>evidence.</em><footnotemark><em>(x)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>But I hold, that whatever may given in evidence on the general issue need not be pleaded; and that there are many matters conclus*ve on such issue, without being pleaded; I will only refer to the authorities, <footnotemark><em>(y)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>There, are cases in which certain matters are conclusive before the jury on the general issue: judgment in ejectment is conclusive in an. action for <em>mesne </em>profits: so an acquittance for rent dm* at a subsequent time to that now demanded, is conclusive to shew, that the prior rent had been paid; and no, proof shall be admitted to the contrary, <footnotemark><em>(z)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In Chew <em>v. Moffet,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the defendant pleaded, that the bond was obtained by false suggestions, misrepresentations &amp;e., tifo plaintiff rejoined, that there was no fraud in obtaining it; and this court held, that the plaintiff having joined i\u00e1sue, instead of demurring to the plea, had let in the proof of fraud, and was concluded by the verdict: bui fraud in obtaining the document used as estoppel, is a fair question for a jury to decide.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-4\">If we have a right to rely on the conclusive character of these books, I hold that they are conclusive. The, statute requires that the treasurer shall in \u201cbooks pro \u2022 vided at public expense,\u201d keep his accounts &amp;c., the treasurer is not only a high public officer, but he is a sworn officer. Now in the case of a record, it is allowed to be used as estoppel from the confidence reposed in the court in which it is recorded. In matter <em>in pais </em>the naked fact itself is an estoppel; in matter of deed it is because of the solemnity of the instrument; and it is a general rule of law, that no one shall be allowed to al <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>lege contraries. The legislature in this case could never have intended that the finances of government should depend on parol evidence, in its nature frail, perishahle, and uncertain. It gave to these books the digjuity and character of records, or <em>quasi </em>records. Then the treasurer is a sworn officer; what he has once assorted on oath, he should never be allowed to deny. A sheriff cannot deny the truth of his return. If Preston he concluded by these books, so are his sureties; for whatever binds him. is obligatory on them, <footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-3\">Preston should have made up his annual report before lie resigned; his failure to do so, is itself a default. He should not place his sureties in a better situation by making no report; which would be to mend one fault by another.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-5\">Counsel tell us that Preston does not falsify the hooks; that the books do not shew the money actually on hand. But our argument is, that the books shewing the money ought to be in the treasury, it is not for Preston to aver, it was not there, it ought to have been there, and if it was not, he and they must take the consequences.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-7\">It is argued too, that the books are true throughout or not at all; and if true there is no default to this day. That \\Vould be to allow Preston to discharge himself and sureties, by keeping the books falsely throughout. We do not object to its being shewn what is the actual default of Preston, hut to the mode by which he seeks to prove it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-9\">The defence is that there was a greater default in 1818 than that now claimed. But the mere deposit of any portion of the public treasure in the individual name of John Preston, was no embezzlement. Nor does it any where appear, when or how this money was exhausted; he may after depositing it to his private credit, have disbursed it in public expenditures. The period at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>which this default is said notoriously to have happened; has become notorious by admitting illegal testimony. The consequences of the error, cannot cure it. And the ac{ua{ count which is urged as the last and only security for the public treasure, may be rendered utterly unavail*nS ^ withdrawing the money after it is counted. Upon the whole, these sureties have embarked in the same vessel with their principal, and however hard their fortune? they must abide his destiny.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b243-13\"> When commissions were about to be issued by the Clerk, for organizing the Special court, the ordinary court of Appeals directed the Clerk, to send a summons to every Judge capable of sitting in a special court of Appeals. The practice before had been, to suffer the party at whose instance a. special court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>called, to take out the summons.</p>\n<p id=\"ACZ\">When the court above, was organised, and before its proceeding to act, <em>Leigh </em>made a question, whether the court was legally constituted; since Judge Bhooke had withdrawn, without being interested in the matter, or under any permanent disability to sit; being unwell, and having a sick family. It was urged, that the law contemplated some durable impediment, and not a temporary incapacity, which might \u25a0 be obviated by a continuance of the cause. The motion being submitted, the Judges withdrew to the conference room to deliberate: after a few minutes they returned, and were unanimously of opinion, that the objection should be overruled, and that the court as constituted, should proceed to hear and determine the cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"Arq\"><em> </em>It will be observed, that the words, \u2018\u2018 and every year thereafter,\u201d were incorporated into tire statute after the execution of the bond.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b246-9\">J) The expression \u201con Ins first election, before he shall have power to act, he shall give bond\u201d &amp;c. relates to the provision in the first sentence of the section, authorising the Treasurer to continue in office to the end of the ensuing session of the legislature without re-election.

They have been much insisted on by the English Judges in all the cases subsequent <em>ip </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Walton v. Shelly on the same subject; and are mainly relied on, by the courts both of Massachusetts, and New-York, in adopting the rule laid down in the case of Walton v. Shelly, rather than that of Jordaine v. Lashbrooke, <em>7 Term Rep.</em>601. by which the former decision has been overruled. The profession will be surprised to learn, after 35 years of universal acquiescence in the existence of the principle as a maxim of the Roman law, that there is no such rule in the whole Roman Code. It is true, that by the civil law, as by ours, a contract tainted with turpitude could not be asserted in a court of justice, \u201c <em>ex maleficio non oritur contractus\" </em>this principle however, established nothing, as to the evidence on which such contract depended. The only rule of the civil law applicable to testimony, which has the least analogy to that cited by Lord <em>Mansfield, </em>will be found unthe head \u201cDe Testibus.\u201d <em>Dig. </em>22. <em>tit. 5. l </em>2. <em>\u201cIn </em>testimonies autem dignitas, lides, mores, gravitas, ex-aminanda est: <em>et ideo testes, qui adversas fidem suam teslationis, vaCillant, audiendi non sunt </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ATUA\">The words <em>\u201caudiendi non sunt,\" </em>do <em>tot \u2022 </em>mean, that the witness shall not be heard; but that he shall not be regarded or credited; for the word \u201c <em>vacillairt\" </em>implies that he is heard, and that all faith in his testimony is destroyed by the manner of his giving evidence, (vaciliare a nonnullis dicitur <em>qui hiesitat in dicendo testimonio. Not. </em>19. <em>Gothof. Corp. I.

Shee, <em>Cowp. </em>199, he cited Bush v. Rawlins to prove, that one who had taken a bribe, was a competent witness in an action <em>qui tam, </em>to prove the bribery. And in the case then before the court, he held, that the witness (a clerk) was competent to prove, he had embezzled Ms employers\u2019 money, and had staked it <em>on </em>the chance of certain lottery tickets coming up prizes, contrary to the lottery act. Buller who was counsel said, \u201cno one shall be admitted to prove his own turpitude,\u201d he cited no maxim or case however, and Lord <em>Mansfield </em>decided against Ms argument.</p>\n<p id=\"AZL\"><em>Mote by the </em>Reporter-</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"176\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-60\" label=\"(h)\">\n<p id=\"b285-10\"> 14 <em>Viner </em>444, B. pl. 2. <em>Com.

It is so evidence, because where a deed of bargain and sale is inrolled pursuant to the first mentioned statute, that inrolment is a record so that a copy of it may be read in evidence. (14 <em>Vin. </em>445 and other cases.) It ought also to be read in evidence, for the further reason, that as the law has appointed them to be public acts, and reposed a confidence in the recording officer, the copies of such public acts, shall be like other public acts, good evidence. (Gi/6. <em>L. Evidence </em>99 and other authorities.) This which is the established law of England holds <em>a fortiori </em>in relation to this country. By the English statute, the acknowledgment by the grantor might be before two Justices in the country: whereas until lately, our deeds were required to be acknowledged or proved in open court. The distinction is not unimportant: and has been sanctioned by the most respectable judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Opinions in this country. In the case of Lee v. Tapscott 2. <em>Wash. </em>281, President <em>Fendlelon </em>emphatically allowed a copy of a patent recorded in a county court to he evidence, and preferred it to a simple registration; for the iinportant reason, that the clerk acts under the superintendance of a court of justice; which court would pro-vent erased or improper deeds from being thrown into the public records. Under our laws, having this important provision and check existing in them, this usage (if you please,) as to the receipt of copies, in evidence, grew up, and came to maturity. And although that system has been lately changed, so as to admit deeds to record, on the certificate of two Justices only, that usage ought not to be considered as affected. The system is, even now, on as good a footing as to the confidence due to the officer's receiving the acknowledgment, as is that in England. The systems are now in this respect precisely the same. If therefore the decisions of the English courts legalized copies as evidence under their statute, those decisions equally apply, even to our modern system on this subject. At the same time, that construction more forcibly applies to the stronger case of deeds acknowledged or proved before a court of Justice, under which our rule was established: and it was the intention of the legislature, in making the alteration, not to change the rule in relation to the point of evidence, but merely to substitute a more convenient mode, for the accommodation the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-3\">These decisions of the English courts, although never brought directly before the supreme court have received the countenance of that court in sundry instances. There are several decisions in that court which cannot be reconciled to any other idea. As cases of this character, we will mention those of Maxwell v. Light, 1st <em>Call </em>120; Whitaker v. M'Ilhany, 4 th <em>Munford </em>310; Turner v, Stip, 1st <em>Wash. </em>319, and the before mentioned case of Lee v. Tapscott.</p>\n<p id=\"ATM\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Owing to the English decisions before mentioned and to these corroborations of them by our own courts, the position that a copy of a recorded deed may be given in ev\u2019^ence&gt; has grown into a general usage in this country, But this point does not rest upon mere usage. It is as tnuch established as a principle of evidence, as any other to be found in the books. If, however, it rested only on mere usage, and had not this last and greatest sanction, this court would be disposed to respect that usage.\u2014 \"While it would hold itself at liberty, as was done in the case of Tompkies <em>v. </em>Downman, to depart from a usage, which, was in conflict with the actual expressions of a statute, and perhaps in opposition to great principles; it would respect an usage which was not confronted by such powerful objections. It would respect it, as the court of appeals did, among others, in the cases of Hudson <em>v. </em>Johnson, 1st <em>Wash. </em>10,\u2014Jones <em>v. </em>Logwood, 1st <em>Wash. </em>42, and Branch <em>v. </em>Burnley, 1st <em>Call </em>147. It would, especially, hesitate to repeal an usage, which has been so general and universal, as that its reversal would inundate this country with litigation, and lay the foundation of innumerable appeals and law suits. The court sees but little danger in adhering to this usage.\u2014 While, on the one hand, there is but little utility in exhibiting original papers which a court or confidential commissioners have already passed on as genuine, and which the party is concluded from denying to be his deed, by the acknowledgment and recording thereof. A copy is not without it preference, in some sense over the original. It lays a <em>veto </em>upon the grantee, as to altering or erasing that deed, from and after the time of the acknowledgment. Such a subsequent alteration or erasure would be controlled and corrected by the attested copy, previously taken, by a sworn officer. Nothing however now said by the court, is to be construed to impair the right of a party, whatever it may be, to call for the introduction of an original deed, instead of a copy.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>The counsel for the appellees, foreseeing that this point might be decided against them, have taken the ground, that the original deed itself, if before the court, could not be read against their clients: nay, they have taken the yet bolder and stronger ground of saying, that the deed could not have been read even against John Preston. As against John Preston himself, it was properly answered, that the deed was signed, sealed and aeknowl\u00bb edged, by him. It is therefore emphatically his deed. It relates also to the subject now in controversy. It admits that the penalty of the bond now sued on, may have been incurred, which carries with it an admission that the defalcation happened in the year 1819, and it pro vides for the indemnification of these appellees, therefor. As this deed binds John Preston, and acknowledges the material matters in controversy in this motion, it is of no account, that there are other books and evidence going to prove the same facts. It is the right of suitors in courts of justice to exhibit as many evidences on the same point, if legal and relevant, as they please. The court cannot cut them out of this privilege. It cannot compel them, at its pleasure, to rely upon a single document or witness. Had this deed been received in evidence, the Jury might still have rendered a verdict for the appellant, by virtue of its provisions, notwithstanding the opinion given against him by the general court, touching the conclusiveness of the books, offered as evidence; and thus this appeal would have been prevented. It might have been evidence, both to outweigh the appellees\u2019 parol evidence, then sanctioned by the opinion of the general court, and to confirm or supply the statements in the books of the treasury. It might-have had that effect, because it speaks, pretty explicitly as to the time of the defalcation, and might thus, as to him, have worked an estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">It does this, by admitting that the penalty of the bond before us, may have been incurred, which cannot be, un* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>less the embezzlement happened in the year 1819. Again, it is of no account, at least as against John Preston, that the acknowledgments in this deed were made after the eXpiration of his office.. Parties may bind themselves 1 . . \u25a0 . <em>J . </em>by their, confessions even up to the time ot trial.</p>\n<p id=\"AqD\">As for the sureties, (the appellees,) it will be, seen, in an after part of this opinion, that <em>they </em>must stand <em>on </em>a common ground with their principal. Yet the deed is also binding as to them. It is so binding, because it is made, emphatically, for their benefit, and must be considered as made at their instance. The case is not altered by the mere intervention of trustees. The sureties themselves are the real grantees; and, besides, the deed has been accepted by them, and acted under for their benefit. For any tiling known to the court, the proceeds of the property conveyed, may have been already, in part, paid by the trustees, in their exoneration. They are, therefore, estopped from disclaiming to be bound by this deed. They cannot claim under it, and yet disclaim it. If it is their deed for one purpose, it is also for the other. We arc also of opinion that the answers given to the other objections to this'deed, equally apply in relation to the securities. Considering them, therefore, independently of their principal, which, however,., the court is not bound to do, we are clearly of opinion, that there is no objection to the copy of the deed being given in evidence, and that the judgment of the general Court in this particular is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"Apv\">With respect to the character of the books of the treasury department, the coui\u2019t is of opinion, that as to the treasurer himself they are conclusive to charge him. In\u00bb relation to very numerous transactions, between even private parties, mutually confided in by each other, it may be a matter of primary convenience and accommodation, that their books should, by consent, afford conclusive evidence. It may be vastly inconvenient at least that every particular item should be the subject of par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>ticular litigation, and be open to parol, conilicting and contradictory testimony, it must, at least, be admitted, that such individuals may by common agreement, adopt \u00a1hoce books as a standard in exclusion of all other evideuce. The convenience, if not necessity, of such a cri\u2018teriou, in the case before us, is entirely manifest. It would be of vast inconvenience to open all of the innutncrablc items existing; on the books of the treasury, to a particular litigation and scrutiny. Of this criterion, the officer himself, at least, has no reason to complain, if he does the business himself or has faithful agents, he cannot possibly be injured. In addition to the considerations arising from mutual convenience, as aforesaid, ifc is also, In the opinion of the court, of great weight, that the treasurer is a sworn officer: that his books are provided at public expense; that that officer is required to state his accounts frequently and distinctly to the General Assembly; and that his office, and consequently his books, are under1 the control of the executive council\u2014 Do all these precautions amount to nothing? Do they not speak the legislative sense, upon this subject, as strongly as positive words could do? Are not books taken under all these solemnities, more to he regarded than the mere private accounts of private and unsworn individuals? If in the case of Moody <em>v. </em>Thruston, 1 <em>Stra. </em>481, a statement of balances made by commissioners under an act of parliament, was held to be conclusive evidence, even although one of the parties litigant had had\u2019 no time allowed him to prove his accounts, much more ought the treasurer, under all the provisions and precautions of our laws, to be permitted to bind himself. If in the case of Stevens <em>v. </em>Coburn, 2 <em>Call, </em>440, the certificate of the land commissioners was held to be final, and <em>that </em>even against an infant, much more ought Preston\u2019s own certificate (if we may so express ourselves) to be held to be final, against himself. It is of no account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>that, in that case, the land law <em>declared </em>that the cer tifi \u2022 cate should be \u00f1nal: There is no difference between an act containing such a declaration, and one affected by Pri&gt;lc5ples, and containing provisions, -which irresistibly compel us to come to a similar conclusion.\u2014The establament of these books as conclusive evidence, in such cases, while it deprives that officer of a great advantage he would have over the commonwealth, if he were permitted by his clerks, or others, to falsify, in after times, his own items, solemnly entered by him in his books, is further called for by the necessity of acting by general rules, in such cases; and that policy is supported by-several analogies in our laws. Under the provisions of the act for registering deeds, no man is permitted to aver an ignorance of a deed, which is duly recorded. So under the caveat law, no man is allowed to aver his ignorance, that another had entered for the land in dispute, upon the books of the surveyor of the county; as was decided by the court of appeals, in the case of Noland r. Cromwell. Both these provisions go upon the ground of the general utility, if not necessity, of establishing general rules, in these cases; and of referring to public documents, which are accessible to all, instead of leaving every case in respect of evidence to stand on its own bottom. They are both wisely calculated to prevent frauds and perjuries, and to cut up and prevent infinite disputes and litigation. In these last cases particular mischiefs may, perchance, happen, hut they are submitted to as the lesser of evils, and in favor of the general provisions of acts of great public convenience and utility. In relation to the treasurer, in the case before us, no possible inconvenience can result to him, but from his own negligence or the corruption of his clerks. In the last case he must have his remedy over against them, or against those who are responsible for them. If in the case of an ordinary deed or bond, a man is estopped to deny matters contained in such deed or bond, from the mere cir <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>cumstance of having annexed a <em>scroll </em>thereto, much more ought the treasurer to be concluded in the case before us. Being a sworn officer bo ought to be.bound by books rendered under that sanction! be ought to be bound books solemnly kept by him, under all the checks and precautions too, established by the wisdom of our laws. While there is no necessity for it, neither is the commonwealth in any condition, to defend herself, against innumerable claimants bringing perhaps, suspicious witnesses to invalidate the solemn entries made upon the books of the treasury. No conceivable degree of diligence on the part of the officers of the commonwealth could protect her interests, if these general criteria were to be departed from, and, an infinitude of litigation opened upon her.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">These books thus conclusive against the treasurer, are also conclusive against bis sureties. If a judgment against him is to bind them, so also is the evidence on which that judgment is rendered__In tiie case of Braxton executor of Claiborn <em>v. </em>Winslow and others, (1 <em>Wash. </em>31, and <em>Call\u2019s </em>manuscript reports more at large,) it was decided, that to fix the amount of an executor\u2019s liability, the action must be brought against him, and that the recovery against him will bind his sureties..\u2014It is also said in that case, that if A. agrees to pay B. what C. owes him, lie cannot call upon A. until he establishes his demand in a suit against C. the proper party to defend the suit. So. it was decided in the case of Greensides <em>v. </em>Benson, 3 <em>Atkins, </em>248, that sureties are bound, as to the amount, by a judgment rendered against the principal: that it is immaterial if that judgment were even rendered without defence on the part of the principal, for that shews rather a consciousness that the principal had no defence to make. The court also decided in that case, that it would not take the whole account <em>oroer again </em>at the instance of the sureties and that the ease of the sureties is not at all better! \u201cfor as the ver- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number><em>\u00ab </em>diet was found against the principal, who was the \u201c proper person to try it, it would he hard to have the <em>\u201c </em>same matter <em>tried over again, </em>in as many actions as <em>\u201c </em>^ie 811 reties please.\u201d We entirely concur in this rcasoiling. Sureties are not to be permitted to try over aSain&gt; cases already decided against the principal: nor, when tried against them in the first instance, to avail themselves of evidence which the principal himself would be inhibited from using.\u2014These authorities are conclusive to shew that the sureties stand on a common foundation with the principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\">The counsel for the appellees have repeatedly told us, that as the amount of the defalcation was in issue between the parties, they ought to be allowed to prove that issue on their paid. They ought not to be allowed to prove it, by any thing-but legal testimony. Their position, in the latitude in which it is taken, would equally go to let in hearsay testimony, or depositions not upon oath. The Judges ought not to surrender their province of inhibiting the introduction of <em>illegal </em>testimony. In the opinion of this court, the parol evidence offered by those who stand in the shoes of the Treasurer, to invalidate and set aside his books, is as inadmissible as the hearsay or unsworn testimony just mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">The books of the treasury being thus held to be conclusive evidence, both as to the principal and the sureties, .we come to apply them to the case before us. We readily admit that there ougiit to be separate bonds for each and every year, and that the Treasurer of every year, although, in fact, he be the same person, ought to be considered as if he were a different person.'\u2014When, in the case before us, the present Treasurer succeeded the late Treasurer in his office, and at the same time the latter had handed over his books to the former, shewing that a stated sum of money was in the public treasury, the former, however, was not bound by that statement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>His proper course was, to go into the treasury, with the late Treasurer, as in fact he did,* to count the money, and see that the sum stated was there, and grant his receipt thereto*. He might do this, or he might waive a *\u2022 \u00b0 count, and thus give his confidence, to his predecessor, as to the amount of the money actually in the treasury. In the last case he would be estopped by this confidence, to say, that that money was not there. So also the present Treasurer might equally bind himself by Ms <em>acts. </em>His entering into the office, and omitting to make a count, would he held as a waiver thereof, an acknowledgment that the money stated, was actually in the treasury. This, also, was precisely the case with John Preston, at the commencement of his term of 1819, and considering* his predecessor of the foxuner year, as a different person. At that time, also, John Preston either counted the money and as it were gave Ms receipt for it, or gave his confidence that it was there. In neither case can he object, that the money stated was not in the treasury, at the commencement of his term of 1819. This doctrine holds <em>a fortiori </em>as to Mm, as he was also the former Treasurer. A man may, more readily give confidence to himself than to another*, and there is less hardship in holding him to the consequences of it. John. Preston might by calling a count of the money, at the commencement of his term of 1819, and finding a deficiency, have charged himself as for the year 1818, and. discharged himself and his sureties for the year 1819/ failing to do this, however, he has admitted himself to have the money in 1819, and he and his sureties for that year are consequently liable. The conclusion resulting from these principles is, that all the money stated in the books to he in the treasui\u2019y in January 1819, is admitted to have been there, and that no parol evidence can be received to shew the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">The foregoing opinion of the court in relation to the copy of the deed, offered, in cvidejiQe and rejected, makes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>it unnecessary for us to decide, conclusively, upon the judgment of the General court, objected to in the first bill of exceptions. As however the original deed was Prove^ by the appellant to have been in the hands of one of the appellees, as it was not known by the appellant to *!0 elsewhere, and as the appellee, Francis Preston, no otherwise discharged himself from the custody thereof, than by his own verbal and unsworn statement; our present impressions are, that he ought to have been considered in the possession thereof, so as to let in the reading of the copy by the appellant, or at least to procure a continuance of the trial. Had such a continuance been moved for and rejected, that rejection would, in our opinion, have been clearly erroneous. We repeat, however, that we do not <em>decide </em>this question. In is unnecessary in this case to be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The court is of opinion, that there is no error in so much of the opinion of the General court as sustained the demurrer to the third plea, and overruled the same; nor in overruling the motion of the appellants, to reject the second plea. The reasons in favor of these opinions of the court are so manifest that they need not be assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The court coming more particularly to the judgments complained of in the 2d bill of exceptions tendered by the appellant, and bearing in mind the principles and reasons herein more particularly detailed in relation thereto, is of opinion, that the motion made by the appellant to exclude the evidence so as aforesaid adduced by the appellees from going to the Jury, as being inadmissible evidence, so far as the same was offered to exonerate the said appellees from responsibility for the balance of $83,099 30, appearing from the books and reports of John Preston, as Treasurer, to be due to the commonwealth at the time of his resignation, ought to have been sustained; and that the judgment of the General court overruling the said motion, and admitting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>.\u00bfaid evidence to go to the Jury, is erroneous. The court \u00b0 <em>J is </em>also of opinion, that the second \u00a1notion of the appellant for the court to instruct the Jury, that notwithstanding the facts proved by the appellees as aforesaid, the com monwealth was entitled to recover against them the said sum of $83,099 30 cents, (the deficit appearing on Treasurer\u2019s books as kept for the year 1819,) and also the several sums of $4,488 08 cents, $39,000, $5,481 <em>57, </em>and $510, as is in the said bill of exceptions more particularly explained, ought to have been sustained\u2014Because the said several stuns last mentioned, although not received in 1819, nor properly audited or entered on the Treasurer\u2019s books, at the time when received, yet were entered in the bank to the credit of the said John Preston, as Treasurer of the commonwealth, and were reasonably tobe regarded, as constituting a part of the $248,086 62 cents, turned over in bank by him to the appellant, upon his resigning his office..\u2014The court is consequently of opinion that the judgment of the General court overruling the same, and declaring that the appellees were only liable for the due application by the said John Preston for the sum <em>actually </em>in the treasury, at the <em>commencement </em>of his last term of office, and of the sums received by him during his said term, is erroneous. The reasons operating with the court, for coming to this conclusion, have been already sufficiently detailed. The court is also of opinion, that the money received in the bank by the present Treasurer from his predecessor, was. a payment by the latter to the former for the use of the commonwealth, and having been made without any specific direction as to the application thereof, the present Treasurer had a right to apply the same to the ex-tinguishment of any balance due by him to the commonwealth which became due by consequence of not crediting the commonwealth with the same money on the treasury books; which money he had received as Treasurer, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>had passed to Ms credit as Treasurer in bank, the pay - ment being made with the same money in bank, which should have appeared to the credit of the commonwealth 011 ^10 treasiHT books;\u2014and that the judgment and instruction given to the Jury, contrary to this position, is erroneous.\u2014It is, therefore, the unanimous opinion of . x the court, that the said judgment of the General court is erroneous, and should be reversed. All the Judges concur not only in this conclusion, hut also in all the points and principles now laid down\u2014except that one Judge dissents from his brethren upon one point; and on that point will be pleased to express his own opinions. Therefore it is considered, that the said judgment here\u00bb versed and annulled, and that the appellant recover against the appellees the costs expended in the prosecution of the appeal aforesaid here. And it is ordered, that the Jury\u2019s verdict be set aside, and the cause remanded to the said General court for further proceedings to ho had; and on a further trial, that court will give the instructions now approved by this court, if required, and conform to the other principles laid down by the court, which is ordered to be certified to the General court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"197\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-81\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b304-6\">White, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ak9l\">dissented on one point, and delivered the following opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqq\">This is a motion against John Preston the late treasurer, and his sureties, upon his bond as treasurer. This bond is dated on the 18th January 1819, and conditioned, for his faithful performance of the duties of his office, during the ensuing year. The words of the condition are, \u201cnow if the said John Preston <em>shall </em>faithfully ac- \u201c count for all monies and other things which <em>shall </em>come \u201c to his hands in virtue of his office, and perform all \u201c other articles thereof according to law, then this oh- \u201c ligation to be void, otherwise to remain in full force \u201c and virtue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>The notice given to the defendants of this motion, recites the bond, and the condition; and concludes by averring, that the condition has not been complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"A9b\">John Preston did not appear to defend the motion, aud judgment by default was entered on a writ of inquiry awarded against him. The other defendants, his sureties, appeared, and pleaded three pleas. The third of these pleas, was properly overruled on a general demurrer. The appellant\u2019s counsel, then moved the court, to reject the second plea; which motion was perhaps properly overruled; at least it was not an error which ought to be available in an appellate court. The parties then came to issue on the 1st and 2d pleas, which though different in form, in substance presented the same issue: which issue was this; the defendants said that a sum of money, viz;: gl,200,251 36 <em>and no </em>more, came to the hands of John Preston as treasurer, between the 18th January 1819, and the 17th January 1820, the period for which they were bound; and that he did faithfully account for all the said monies which came to his hands in virtue of Ms office during the term thereof. The plaintiff on the other hand avers, that a sum larger than $1,200,251 36 came to the hands of the said Preston in virtue of Ms office between the said 18th January 1819 and 17th January 1820; and that he did not account for, or pay the aforesaid sums of money, &amp;c.; but the same did divert, misapply, and convert to his own use; and so had violated the condition of the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">By these pleadings two facts were presented for the decision of the jury. 1st, whether between the 18th January 1819 and 17th January 1820, more money than $1,200,251 36 did come to the hands of the said Preston in virtue of Ms office; and 2d, whether the sums actually so received, were faithfully accounted for.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The plaintiff to support the issues on his part, offered in evidence, the books of account of the treasury department, which were proper evidence, and were not object <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>^\u00b0\" ^1'01111 ^iese hooks it appeared among other things. that there had been paid into the treasury before and during the year 1819, and up to the 17th January 1820, su\u00ed\u00edl $833,297 7 more than had been disbursed for the public service; which money ought to have been hi the public coffers, and <em>the </em>fair presumption from the face 0f the books was, that it was there. But upon a count, it was found that $83,099 30 of the money was not to be found. When did tills eloignment take place? now became the. important question between the parties. If it was eloigned before the 18th January 1819, it was not within the condition of the bond on which the motion was made; and the verdict should have been for the defendants on the issues made up. If it was after that day. the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The plaintiff rested his case on the treasury hooks alone, and insisted, that as they shewed this money had been received, and did not show that it had been disbursed for the commonwealth, it must be taken to have been in the treasury on the day of the date of the said bond, and of necessity, to have come to John Preston\u2019s hands in virtue of his said office, after that date, to the-exclusion of all evidence to the contrary. The defend - ants on tlieir part introduced evidence, calculated to satisfy the jury, (if proper to be submitted to them) that <em>inf act </em>this eloignment took place in the year 1818, and before the date of the defendants\u2019 bond,. on which the motion was made; which was the very fact in issue before the jury. And this evidence being submitted to the jury, did satisfy them, that the eloignment in dispute took place before the execution of the bond, and they found a verdict for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The counsel for the appellant had however moved the court, to exclude tills testimony on behalf of the defendants from the jury; and excepted to the opinion of the court, overruling his motion. The question now to be decided is, whether the testimony offered by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>defendants ought to have been heard by the jury upon these issues? I had supposed it could not be questioned, if this had been a private transaction; if Preston had been the factor of a foreign merchant, and had given bond and security every year, for faithfully discharging Ms duties, and such a case as the present had arisen he-tween the employer, and Preston and his sureties fordiff'erent years, (this is in effect a contest between the sureties, to Preston it is immaterial on what bond he is made responsible) that both Preston and Ms sureties would be let in, to shew by evidence, the truth of the case. If this be not ihe law, not only I, but every lawyer with whom I have practised, or who has appeared before me for thirty-seven years, has laboured under a strange delusion. I am aware that the confession of a party may be given in evidence against him, and is not evidence for him; but when it is so given although it be strong, it is not so conclusive, as to prostrate his rights against the truth of the case; but he is at liberty, to shew by other testimony that he made the statement under a mistake, through misunderstanding, or inadvertence. The rules of law, and the demands of justice, ever searching for the real truth, absolutely require, that such evidence should be heard. Even against the principal you can not recover for a default, not within the condition of the bond; much more should this be the case, when there is another bond, to indemnify the obligee against that very default. Is it more consistent with law and justice, that the obligor and his sureties, should be made liable upon a bond which does not covenant against the act complained of, when there is another bond which does cove nant against that act, in the case of the treasurer, than it would be in any other? If this be so, it must be, be, cause the law has ordained it, from principles of public policy; and that is the ground taken. It is said, that Che defendants are concluded, that is estopped, from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Prov*nS ^7 any evidence other than these books, that there is any mistake or error in them.</p>\n<p id=\"AIF\">An estoppel is that which prevents one from shewing ^ie <em>^ru^1 </em>in defence of his rights: call it by what name we will, it is that which shuts out the evidence of the actual truth of the case. For this reason, estoppels have ever been held to be \u201crepugnant to reason, and odious in law.\u201d They are tolerated in a very few cases, and only from absolute necessity. Even in these cases, Judges have for ages been astute, to unshackle the es-topped, by every means in their power. If these books do work an estoppel, it is not by the operation of the statute, for that does not pretend to alter their nature as matter of evidence. Neither is it by the general principles of the common law, which holds estoppels to be odious. No case has been adduced, to shew they work an estoppel; no <em>dictum </em>of any judge, lawyer, or writer has been referred to, as even intimating such a doctrine; and I undertake to say, that there is none. In England there is a treasury, a treasurer, and treasury books: those books no doubt are kept by an officer under the solemnity of an oath; suits, and prosecutions must have arisen in Which the evidence furnished by the books became necessary [as in Lord Melville\u2019s case;] there are in England too, many great public corporations, in which books are kept as those now in question; the law treatises and reports, contain many cases as to the manner of giving them in evidence, and their effect when offered; but not a word is any where said, of their working an estoppel: such an idea was never conceived in any of the numerous cases decided. That they operate by way of estoppel is attempted to be shewn, by analogies drawn from reasoning adopted by this court. The argument does not convince my understanding. <em>The </em>cases referred <em>to, </em>[except that of Noland <em>v, </em>Cromwell,] depend on statutes constituting judicial tribunals, and expressly declaring that their decisions shall be final. And Noland <em>v. </em>Cromwell, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>was decided on the long established principle, that a party having a good defence at law, shall not be relieved in equity, for failing to make it; and that the entry in the surveyor\u2019s books, was sufficient notice, and that the party should 'not aver an ignorance of the entry or a want of notice in this case, any more than of a recorded deed, to which the statute has assimilated it.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">Nor does it alter the case, that the treasurer is a sworn officer. His swearing to do his duty, does not make entries in the treasury books true, which arc in fact false. In the case of Goode <em>v. </em>Galt<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> lately decided by the court of appeals, a judgment was reversed for an error which grew out of the false return of a sheriff (though made upon <em>oath,') </em>and the cause was sent back with orders, that the sheriff should be permitted to amend the return.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">I admit that these are public books, bought with public money, kept for public purposes under the sanction of an oath. They are evidence of a high and solemn nature, and should only he outweighed by <em>direct </em>and <em>decisive </em>testimony. But that they are to shut out, or were ever intended to shut out the daylight of truth, 1 do not, and cannot believe. Notwithstanding the guards which are provided, these books like all others, may contain errors. Can it be believed, the legislature intended, that even if evidence should he offered proving erroneous entries, as clearly as any thing can be proved, still such evidence must be rejected and the Jury compelled to find a verdict against the very truth and justice of the case? and this under the old, and <em>odious </em>doctrine of estoppel; for <em>odious </em>I must call it, since it is so held in every book in Which it is mentioned: an estoppel too, applied to a new subject, in an entirely new way. Had the legislature intended this innovation on the best established principles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>of evidence, it would have declared its will, in express . terms.</p>\n<p id=\"An3\">It is said, that the case ought to be considered, as if a different individual had been chosen Treasurer, and had given a new bond, every year. That in such a case, books transferred to the succeeding Treasurer, shewed a certain balance ought to be in the treasury, hut in fact the money had been eloigned, and the successor through false confidence or any other motive, received the books without counting the money, and reporting the <em>deficit, </em>that he and his sureties would be precluded from shewing, that he was not the actual embezzler, and that the money had been converted by his predecessor, before he came into office; that such conduct would be a breach of official duty, and that a suit might be prosecuted against the succeeding Treasurer and his sureties; that the Commonwealth might recover on assigning the fact as a breach of the condition to the full extent of the loss actually sustained, I do not deny; but that on a suit charging the succeeding Treasurer with being the actual embezzler, during the year in which he was Treasurer, at once destroying his character, and charging his sureties to the exoneration of the real culprit and his sureties; on an issue too, made up to try the precise fact; whether the default and embezzlement occurred in one year or the other, the party should be estopped from proving his innocence and the guilt of his predecessor, and thus charge the sureties who are really hound, I cannot admit.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">If these hooks work an estoppel, why were they not pleaded in the replication? Why was issue joined, upon the facts set forth in the plea? Why did the attorney go to trial before the country? By going before the Jury on the issue tendered, he has loosed the estoppel, and let in the evidence of the truth. I cannot perceive the force of the reasoning, by which this estoppel is main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>tained. If the fact be, that the embezzlement took place in 1818, and is not within the condition of the bond for 1819, can the estoppel change the actual fact, and make that true which is false? Will it make that which was done in 1818, to have been done in 1819? Will it alter the eternal principles of justice, and make that right, which is in itself wrong? If on the other hand, the whole evidence be laid before the Jury, will not the Jury under the direction of the court, in this case as in the more awful ones of life and death often presented to its deliberation, be competent to weigh the evidence, and determine what is true? and even if the Jury should err in its decision, that error may he corrected, by granting a new trial. 1 do not see that the monstrous evils anticipated, will result from suffering the facts in cases affecting the public revenue to ho given in evidence to the Jury. When the commonwealth arraigns a citizen at her bar for treason or murder, (the highest crimes known to our jurisprudence,) she submits the case both on the law and the facts to a Jury. If she cannot in proceedings against the Treasurer, submit the law of the case to a Jury, surely it is a stronger reason why the Jury should at least pass judgment, on the facts affecting the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">This is an estoppel of a new character. It is said, the hooks work no estoppel as to the commonwealth; she may contradict the hooks. The old fashioned estoppels, even in the sternest periods of the English law, were reciprocal: both parties were estopped, or neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">It has been remarked, that this case ought to fee decided on great principles. Controversies in courts of justice, ought to be decided on correct principles always; on great ones when they apply. I know of no principles of law great or small, which can convert these books into an estoppel on either party. There is however one great and fundamental principle, which runs through the bill of rights, the constitution, and the laws of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>land; it ought to exist in the laws of every nation upon earth; the principle, that every free citizen whether in a civil or a criminal proceeding, has a right to be heard ]n hjs defence; to produce his witnesses, and to have a \u201e m. \u00bfair and impartial <em>trial on the merits of Ins </em>cause. The oommonwea^h can claim no exemption from the operation of this equal rule, in a controversy with the meanest of her citizens. However bound to her by allegiance 'and by reverence, when she appears in the character of a suitor, her tribunals of justice can recognise in her, no claim to superiority in rights, over the vilest of mankind. From this great principle I would deduce the inference, not that the defendants were estopped, and the commonwealth, abroad, and at large; but that neither party was estopped: that both might prove by evidence competent in ordinary cases, the whole truth of the case; and that the defendants had a right to prove the only material fact which the Jury was sworn to try. I say the only material fact, because that the money was once in the treasury, and was embezzled, is admitted on all sides: the time when it was embezzled, is the only fact in dispute, and that was the point to be settled by the Jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">But granting that these books operate as an estoppel, and such an one as was never before heard of, an estoppel to one party only, what do they estop the defendants from proving? That the facts stated in those books are not true. But do the books also estop the defendants from shewing, that the inferences drawn by the appellant\u2019s counsel from the books are false? The books ho where shew that the money was in the treasury when this bond was executed, or at what time it was eloigned.\u2014 Facts are stated, from whence it is inferred by logical deduction, that the money was in the treasury when the bond was executed, and therefore must have been eloigned thereafter. Are the defendants estopped from shewing by express and undeniable proof, that the money was taken from the treasury, and embezzled,'before they exe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>euted the baud? Suppose that fact made to appear beyond the possibility of doubt, what will become of these inferences of logic? They vanish like mist before the sun. Even if the proof adduced in this case was not sufficient to outweigh the evidence furnished by the hooks, other cases may occur in which it would he sufficient. The precedent now to be fixed, will operate in all future cases, between the commonwealth, the treasurer and his sureties. I cannot consent to the establishment of such a rule. For these reasons, and others, which I would have stated, had the very short time I have had to ar~. rango my ideas, permitted, 1 am of opinion, that the judgment of the general court on this point was correct.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b309-6\"> <em>Ante </em>153.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
