Bayly, his agents and all others, from selling or otherwise interfering with the property conveyed to him as trustee as aforesaid, until the further order of the court. This order of injunction was made upon a bill addressed to-the judge of said court, in which bill the said Julia D. Muller, wife of Andrew Muller, suing by said Andrew Mailer, <em>her next </em>friend, and the said Andrew Muller, in his own right, were complainants, and the said Peyton G. Bayly, James G. Brooks and Lucy Giles were defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-6\">This bill, with the said order endorsed thereon, which was directed \u201c to the clerk of the Circuit court of the city of Bichmond,\u201d was filed in the clerk\u2019s office of the-said court on the 15th day of June 1869, the day before-the day fixed for the said sale. The bill, after stating-the execution of the said deeds of the 6th of April 1860, and the 28d of May 1868, and the general provisions thereof, and that the defendant, James G. Brooks, was the holder of the said negotiable note secured by said deed of trust, contains the following charges : \u201cTour oratrix further charges that the said sum of $3,000 when received, was exclusively used by the said Andrew Muller in the payment of his individual debts, and thus the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>leading purpose of the deed will he defeated, which is designed to secure to her the sole and separate use, benefit, enjoyment and control of the said property; and whilst, by the terms of the said deed of settlement, power is given to her to mortgage, convey in trust, or wise pledge, the said property; yet, it is a power which, when exercised, must be exercised in furtherance or support of the leading object of said deed, which is for the use and benefit of your oratrix, to the exclusion of her husband and his creditors, by the express terms of said deed ; and when a mortgage is made, or a conveyance in trust given, it must be, to raise money for the use and benefit of your oratrix, and not to be used, as was done under the deed in this case, to pay the creditors of her husband. \u201d fii She alleges that the said Bayly, acting under the said deed to him as trustee, has advertised the whole of the said real estate to be sold on Wednesday next at public auction, and she believes and so charges, that the said property, if then sold under a forced sale, under the said deed, will be sold at a ruinous sacrifice ; that owing to the scarcity of money, and the depressed condition of the business interests of this community, property is selling at very low prices, far below its l\u2019eal value, and, when forced sales are' made, at still lower figures; and she further charges, that owing to the large amount of the cash payment, if the sale is made as advertised by said Bayly, it will he attended with great, if not irreparable loss and injury to your oratrix and her children, who will be entitled to the property in the event she does not dispose of the same by will.\u201d The hill then makes the proper persons defendants, prays for an injunction of the said sale; and concludes with a prayer for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-4\">Copies of the said deeds of the 6th day of April 1860, and of the 28d day of May 1868, were filed as exhibits \u25a0 with the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-5\">The bond required by the injunction order having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>been executed, a subpoena, with the said order endorsed was issued against the said defendants, directed, the. sheriff of the said city, and returned \u201c executed\u201d on tbe defendants, Brooks and Bayly, but \u201cnot found and no inhabitant\u201d as to the defendant, Lucy Giles, who lived in Henrico county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-4\">On the 28th of June 1869, the defendants, Bayly and Brooks, appeared Gy counsel and filed their several answers, to w'hich the plaintiffs, by counsel, replied generally ; and the cause was set for hearing as to those defendants, and a new subpoena was awarded against the other defendant, Lucy Giles, directed to the sheriff of Henrico county, and returnable to the following August rules of the said court:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-5\">On the 7th day of July 1869, in the clerk\u2019s office of the said Circuit court of the city of Richmond, an order of the judge of the said court in vacation, was received by the clerk, in the words following, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-6\"><em>\u201cJulia B.

The post nuptial deed of settlement iuvests the appelJulia D. Muller, with an absolute estate, in equity at least, in the property thereby conveyed to her sole and separate use; and so far from restricting the power of alienation, which is incident to such an estate, unless otherwise provided in the settlement, it expressly gives such power in the amplest form. After conveying the property to a trustee, <em>\u201c </em>in trust for the sole and separate use, benefit, enj oyment and control of the said Julia D. Muller, free from all claim on the part of her present or any future husband or his creditors,\u201d the deed declares the conveyance to be, \u201c upon the further trust, that the said Julia D. Muller - shall have power, by a writing under her hand, to mortgage, convey in trust, or otherwise pledge, the said property, or any of it; and when requested in writing by the said Julia D. Muller so to do, the trustee, Lucy Giles, shall sell the property herein conveyed, or any part of it, and shall either pay over the proceeds to the said Julia I). Muller in whole or in part, or shall invest the same in whole or in part, in other property, to be held on the same trusts herein declared, as the said Julia I). Muller may request.\u201d In pursuance of this ample power and this express trust, the deed of trust of the 23d of May 1868, was executed to secure the debt claimed by the appellee, Brooks, in this case. All the parties in interest, in law or equity, were parties to that deed, and duly executed it\u2014Lucy Giles, the trustee, the said Julia D. Muller, the beneficiary, and Andrew Muller, her husband. The bill charges that the debt secured by the deed is the husband\u2019s debt, and though the deed is executed in literal pursuance of the power, yet, that the power was given to be exercised for the benefit of the wife, and not of the husband, and that the execution of the deed, to secure a debt of the husband, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>was therefore a perversion of the power and a breach of the trust. It does not appear from the deed of trust that the debt thereby secured <em>icas </em>the debt of the hus--baud only. It is therein described as the debt of all the parties of the first part of the deed\u2014Lucy Giles trustee, Julia L. Muller and Andrew Muller her husband. But suppose it was, as the bill avers, the debt of the husband only ; or, rather, that the money derived from the creation of the debt was applied to the payment of his individual debts : \u25a0 does that fact, of itself, invalidate the deed ? Certainly not. A wife who has an absolute separate estate, with power to dispose of it as she pleases, and therefore with power to throw the proceeds of the sale of it into the sea if she pleases, can surely devote it to the benefit of her husband and to the payment of his individual debts. She can certaiuly give it to anybody in the world but her husband: and why not to her husband also ? When she gives it to her husband, we must closely scrutinize the act, lest it should have been induced by undue influence; for we know that the wife is almost always, more or less, under the influence of the husband, which may be unduly exercised. But if the gift be free and voluntary ou her part, and within the terms of her power, it is always a valid, and often a meritorious act. That a wife may give her separate estate to her husband, or devote it to his benefit, is now too well settled a proposition to require a citation of authority for its support. If she be induced by fraud or undue influence on his part to do so, the act will be void. But it is not pretended in the bill, that there was any fraud, or undue influence, or influence of any kind, used by the husband to induce the execution of the deed by the wife in this case. The invalidity of the deed is placed solely upon the naked ground of the incapacity of the wife, though invested with the largest possible powers, to divert her separate estate from her own exclusive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>enjoyment, and to devote it, or any part of it, to the Payment or security of her husband\u2019s individual debts. Then, what other ground of equity is there in the hill ? Only the allegations that the time is unpropitious \u00a3or a gaqe&gt; or Was, when the bill was filed ; that money was searce; and that, owing to the large amount of the cash payment required, the sale, if made as advertised by the trustee Bayly, would be attended with great, if not irreparable, loss and injury to the wife and her children. Certainly these allegations can afford no just ground for enjoining the sale. It is not pretended that the terms of the deed were not strictly pursued by the trustee in advertising the sale ; that he required a larger cash payment to be made by the purchaser than was authorized or prescribed by the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Thus it appears that there was no good ground for an injunction ; that it ought not to have been granted : and having been improvidently granted, that it ought to have been dissolved on motion, even without the necessity of an answer or of a demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"Apo\">But it is said that the Circuit court of the city of Richmond had no right to <em>make </em>the order which it did make on the 8th of July 1869, for the removal of the cause to the Circuit court of the county of Henrico; and that, if the cause was improperly brought in the Circuit court of the city of Richmond, a3 stated in the said order, it ought to have been dismissed, according to the principle of the cases of <em>Randolph's ex'or, </em>&amp;c. v. <em>Tucker &amp; al., </em>10 Leigh 655; and <em>Beckley </em>v. <em>Palmer &amp; al., </em>11 Gratt. 625; instead of being removed to the Circuit court of the county of Henrico.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">It seems difficult to perceive how the appellants could he prejudiced by removing their cause <em>to </em>another court instead of dismissing their bill; or how they would have been any better off than they now are, if their bill . had been dismissed by the Circuit court of the city of Richmond for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>But ought the bill to have been dismissed for the want of jurisdiction, supposing it to have stated a proper for equitable relief?</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">It is contended, that though the hill states a proper case for equitable relief, that relief coaid be tered only by the Circuit or County court of the county of Honrico, and not by the Circuit court of the city of Richmond, according to the Code, ch. 179, \u00a7 4, p. 786, which declares that \u201cjurisdiction of a bill for an injunction to any judgment, act or proceeding, shall be in a Circuit, County or Corporation court, of a county or corporation in which the judgment is rendered, or the act or proceeding is to be done, or is doing, or apprehended,\u201d &amp;c. It is contended that this is an injunction suit, wilhiii the meaning of that section, that the proceeding injoined, to wit: the sale under the deed of trust, was about to take place in the county of Henrico, and not in the city of Richmond, and therefore that only the courts of the county, and not the courts of the city, have jurisdiction of the suit; though every judge of a Circuit court has, under \u00a7 6 of the same chapter, a general jurisdiction in <em>awarding </em>injunctions <em>; </em>but Ms order must, according to <em>\u00a7 </em>9, bo directed to the clerk of such Circuit court as has jurisdiction under \u00a7 4, and the proceedings {hereupon shall be as if the order bad been made by such court or the judge thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">It is well settled that \u00a7 4, of chapter 179, aforesaid, applies only to a puro bill of injunction, and not to a bill seeking other relief, to which the injunction sought is merely ancillary. This was expressly decided by this court in the rocent case of <em>Winston &amp; als. </em>v. <em>The Midlothian Coal Mining Company &amp; als., </em>20 Gratt. 686. See also 2 Rob. old Pr. 249, and the cases there cited of <em>Hough </em>v. Shreeve, 4 Munf. 490; <em>Singleton </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>&amp;c., 6 Munf. 397; and <em>Pulliam </em>v. <em>Winston, </em>5 Leigh 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The bill in this case is something more than a pure injunction bill. It seeks to invalidate the deed of trust* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>upon the ground that it was not authorized by the deed \u00b0t settlement. And it prays for general relief. As all ^ie Part^es to the suit, except perhaps the trustee in the settlement, Lucy Giles, seem to have resided in the city 0f R.\\chmond when the suit was brought, it follows, therefore, that the Circuit court of the city had jurisdiction of the suit, upon the principle of the cases just cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">But it had jurisdiction of the suit, even if we regard it as a pure injunction suit. A court of chancery acts upon the person, and as a general rule, has jurisdiction wherever the defendant resides or is found within its territorial limits. Sometimes a statute gives to a particular court of chancery special jurisdiction in a particular case. The statute in regard to pure injunction suits is one of that nature. But certainly that statute does not take away or impair the power of a court of chancery of genal jurisdiction to take cognizance of a case submitted to its decision by the consent of all parties, especially when, all of them reside within its territorial limits. If a decree had been made in this suit by the Circuit court of the city of Richmond, showing that it was heard in such court by consent of all parties, surely the decree would not b\u00e9 void for want of jurisdiction, even though the bill were a pure injunction bill, and showed upon its face \u2022that the proceeding sought to be injoined was about to take place outside of the boundaries of the city. So, a so, if the plaintiffs in the injunction suit elect to bring their suit in the Circuit court of the city of Richmond, where all or nearly all of the parties concerned reside, instead of in the Circuit court of the county of Henrico, it would not lie in their mouths afterwards to say that the ci'iirt thus selected by them, had no jurisdiction of the suit. The <em>defendants </em>might, perhaps, make the objection, but not the <em>plaintiffs. </em>True, the law in regard to the jurisdiction of an injunction bill was no doubt made chiefly, if not entirely, for the benefit and conve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>nience of the plaintiff in the injunction, but he may waive that benefit; and by bringing his suit in another <em>court,1 </em>he does waive it, so far as he is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">In this case there was nothing in the bill to show that the property about to be sold was situated outside of city, or that the sale was to be made outside of the city. The bill was filed by the plaintiffs in the Circuit court of the city, and the two principal defendants, Bayly and Brooks, who resided in the city, filed their answers, making no objection to the jurisdiction of the court. These answers were replied to generally, and the parties were thus at issue: after which the order of removal aforesaid was made. When that order was made there was nothing in the cause showing, certainly, that the property to be sold was situate outside of the city. The advertisement describes it as within 300 yards of the corporation line; but whether without or within that line is not stated. The lots are described as being in Duval\u2019s addition, and as being designated by certain numbers in the plan of that addition.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Row, can it be predicated of this case that the Circuit court had not jurisdiction of it when the order of removal was made ?</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">That proposition is sought to be maintained on the authority of the cases of <em>Randolph's ex'or &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Tucker &amp; al., </em>10 Leigh, 655, and <em>Beckley </em>v. <em>Palmer &amp; al., </em>11 Gratt. 625, before referred to. Do they maintain it? We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">In the case of <em>Randolph's ex'or </em>v. <em>Tucker </em>&amp;c., which was decided by a special court of appeals, consisting of three judges of the General court, the suit was brought in the Circuit court of James City county, where none of the defendants resided ; to obtain an issue of <em>devisavit vel non </em>in regard to John Randolph\u2019s will, which had been admitted to probate in the general court. The defendants resided in other, and generally distant, counties, and the transaction sought to be injoined was to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>place in a distaut county. The only ground for mainlining the jurisdiction was the service of process on the defendants, Bryan and wife, who happened to be in\u2019 James City; though they resided elsewhere. The ground of jurisdiction was considered colorable merely. One of the principal defendants objected to <em>the </em>jurisdiction of the court iu his answer ; and most of them, at the hearing, moved a dismission of the bill for want of jurisdiction. The Circuit court overruled the motion, and the special court of appeals reversed the judgment and dismissed the bill. In that case, it will be observed, that the objection to the jurisdiction of the court came not from the plaintiffs, hut from the defendants. If the defendants had been willing to try the case in James City, the plaintiff's, after bringing their suit in that county, would hardly have been sustained 'in a motion to dismiss it because they did not bring it elsewhere. That case was a peculiar one. It was not a pure injunction suit, and the injunction prayed for \u201cwas merely ancillary to the other and principal relief prayed for.\u201d That the ground of jurisdiction was merely colorable, and the palpable inconvenience of the place selected by the plaintiffs for the suit, were the reasons which induced the court to sustain the objection of the defendants, and to dismiss the hill for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">In the case of <em>Beckley </em>v. <em>Palmer &amp; al., </em>the bill, upon its face, showed that it ought to have been filed in the Circuit court of Fayette county, where the judgment sought to be injoined was rendered,' instead of the Circuit court of Baleigli, and the objection was made by, and the decision of the court was in favor of, the defendants, and not the plaintiffs, who had elected to bring their suit in the Circuit court of Baleigli. This was one of the grounds on which this court affirmed the decree of the court below dismissing the bill. There was another ground of dismission, in regard to which four of the five judges who sat in the case concurred, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>rather three of them, for Judge Daniel did not state his ground for the affirmance. It is worthy of remark, that in that case the court did not reverse all that had been done by the court below, both on the original bill and the amended bill, and dismiss both bills for want jurisdiction ; but affirmed the decree of the court below, after amending it, by formally dissolving the injunction : thus sustaining, to that extent, the jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">Those cases, therefore, cannot be regarded as authority for holding that when the order of removal was made the Circuit court of the city of Richmond had no jurisdiction of the case. .</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">We are of opinion, then, that it had such jurisdiction. And now we come to the question,</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Is there any error in the order of removal ?</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">There was first such an order made in vacation, but on the next day the vacation order wTas set aside, and the same order was made in court. The court order is the one, the validity of which we are now to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">The law 'which authorizes a suit to be removed from one Circuit court into another, is to be found in the Code, ch. 174, \u00a7 3, p. 719. \u00a3\u00a3 On the motion of any party to a suit in a Circuit court, the said court may order it to be removed to any other Circuit court,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">It does not appear on whose motion the order of removal in this case was made ; nor is that necessary. It does appear that both parlies were present by their counsel when the order was made ; and the presumption is that it was duly made. The order assigns as a reason for making it, that it appeared that the cause had been improperly brought in the court. Even if this reason were unfounded in fact, it would not invalidate an order which the court had power to make, and to which there was no exception. The court might have thought the cause had been improperly brought into the court, even though the court had jurisdiction to try it. But that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Circuit court has a right to remove a cause therein pending into another Circuit court, and that the Circuit C01ir^ the city of Richmond made such an order of removal in this case, the parties being present by their counsel, is conclusive of all question in the appellate court, as to the propriety of such order of removal, no exception having been taken to that order in the court below. That the cause was at rules when the order of removal was made, does not make'that order premature. The law authorizing such removal is general in its terms, and does not require the cause to be on the court docket when removed. And now we come to consider the question,</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Is there any error in the vacation order of the judge of the Circuit court of the county of Henrico, made_on the defendant\u2019s motion to dissolve the injunction?</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">That motion came on to be heard on notice of the same, and on the bill, answers and exhibits, and the order of removal aforesaid, and on two objections taken by the plaintiffs to the hearing of said motion, to wit: 1st. That the cause was removed from the Circuit court of the city of Richmond during the vacation of the Circuit court of the county of Henrico ; and, 2d. That the same had not been placed upon the docket of the latter court at its regular term. And after argument by counsel, the said judge ordered the injunction to be dissolved and the bill to be dismissed: and further, suspended the effect of the order for thirty days ; no doubt to afford the plaintiffs an opportunity of applying for this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">That the cause was removed during the vacation of the Circuit court of Henrico, can make no difference. Hor can it make any, that the same had not been placed upon the docket of the said court at its regular term, when the said motion and order were made. The law gives to the court, to which the cause may be removed, no discretion about it. Section 4, of ch. 174, p. 719, of the Code, provides that \u201c when any suit is ordered to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>be removed under this chapter, the clerk of the court from which, shall transmit to the clerk of the court to which, it is removed, the original papers therein,\u201d &amp;c. ; 4 4 whereupon the case <em>shall </em>be proceeded in, heard and determined by the court to which it is removed, as if had been brought and the previous proceedings had in said court.\u201d The directions of this section as to the transmission of the original papers were complied with in this case, and \u00e1 motion to dissolve the injunction was then made, on notice of the same, to the judge of the Circuit court of Henrico county in vacation, and was heard by him precisely as it would have been if the suit 4 4 had been brought and the previous proceedings had in said court;\u201d all of which was in strict conformity with the law. The Code, ch. 179, \u00a7 12, p. 738, declares that 44 the judge of a Circuit court in which a case is pending, whereon an injunction is awarded, may, in vacation, dissolve such injunction after reasonable notice to the adverse party. His order for the dissolution shall be directed to the clerk of said court, who shall record the same in the order hook.\u201d An order of dissolution could have been made in vacation by the judge of the Circuit court of the city of Richmond, at any time before the removal of the cause from that court, and by tbe judge-of the Circuit court of the county of Henrico at any time after the removal of the cause to that court; without waiting, in either case, until the cause was put upon the docket, or until an order of court was made for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The judge of the Circuit court of the county of Henrico having power to make the order of dissolution which was made in the case, the next question is, Was it right to make such an order ? and that question has already, in effect, been answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">But the judge, besides dissolving the injunction, made an order to dismiss the bill; which he had no right to-do in vacation. The Code, ch. 179, \u00a7 14, declares that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>where an injunction is wholly dissolved, the bill shall stand dismissed with costs, unless sufficient cause be shown against such dismission, when the case is in a circuit court, at the next term,\u201d &amp;c. \u201c The clerks of said courts shall enter such dismission on the last day of said terms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">There are two questions connected with this case, which we have deemed it unnecessary to decide, and upon which we do not wish to be understood as intimating any opinion ; and they are, 1st, whether the plaintiff in an injunction suit has not a right of election to bring it in the place in which the judgment was rendered or the proceeding is apprehended which is sought to be injoined, or to bring it in the place where the defendants or some of them reside <em>; </em>and, 2diy, if he be bound to bring it in the former, and it be brought in the latter, by mistake of the judge awarding the injunction in directing his order to the clerk of the latter instead of \u2022the former, or otherwise ; whether it be necessary to dismiss the bill, on motion being made for that purpose ; or whether, instead of dismissing it, the suit may not be removed into the proper court, by order of the court in which it is improperly brought. These questions may both be <em>res adjudicata. </em>But whether so or not, we mean not now, because it is unnecessary, to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">Therefore, so much of the said order as purports to dismiss the bill is void and must be disregarded ; and we are of opinion that the said order ought to be amended in that respect, and as amended affirmed, and the cause remanded to the said Circuit court of the county of Henrico for further proceedings to be had therein as aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-12\">Decree amended and aeeirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
