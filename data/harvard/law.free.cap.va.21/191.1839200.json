Rootes jr. maker,- and Thomas Rootes, and Lawrence Battaile, successive indorsers of a negotiable note, for $1500, and $3 <em>70, </em>notarial charge of protest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-13\">The defendant not appearing to defend the suit, the court gave judgment for $1500 and $3 <em>70, </em>with interest from the time the money was due on the face of the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AGV\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>On appeal to the Superior court of the county, the judgment w as reversed, and the cause remanded for farther proceedings. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected, that ^ie judgment should be entered for the principal due; the defendant\u2019s counsel, insisted on the liberty of pleading to the action.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b200-3\"><em>Stanard </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-4\">The objection that the declaration contains parties not found in the writ cannot be sustained, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> And in this case justice having been done by the judgment of the county court, it should not be disturbed. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-5\">it was propei* to give judgment for interest as well as principal: for the statute directs execution in such cases, to be issued, for interest, andprincipal.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> indorsers of negotiable notes, are to every intent, principal debtors; and judgment should be for interest, as well against the indorser as the maker.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-6\">As to notice of non-payment, or protest; there is no law requiring it. The indorser is bound for the debt, with or without notice.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b200-7\"><em>Wickham </em>and 1lobins\u00f3n, contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-8\">The variance between the writ and declaration, in joining persons in the latter, not parties to the former, is error. The cases cited to shew the contrary, are where there is an appearance, which waives the objection. There can be no office judgment without a declaration, which is founded on the writ, and they must agree.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-9\">The variance in giving judgment for a larger sum than is claimed in the writ, is equally fatal. The writ demands but $1500; the judgment is for $1503 70.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>The Superior court could not correct the error, for the clerk of the county court, did wrong to enter an office judgment; the variance precluded it; every thing done after the declaration was filed is erroneous; and the cause must be sent back to the rules.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-3\">It must appear from the declaration, that the plaintiff has used due diligence, before he can charge the indorser.<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> This necessarily results, from the statute placing negotiable notes on the same footing with bills of exchange;<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> for that is undoubtedly the law as to bills.

Baker,</em><footnotemark><em>(h)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and Baird <em>v. </em>Peter,) <footnotemark><em>(i)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>since if the judgment were rightly entered, the clerk, under the act, would have included interest also in the execution, which therefore would produce the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">But the court is, at the same time, of opinion, that this writing is not of that character, and that, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>neither the interest, nor a final judgment for the princi\u00bb pal sum could be given upon it, without the intervention of a jury. It is not a writing for the payment of money absolutely, but a collateral contract to pay it under certain circumstances. The opinion of this court discriminating between these two classes of contracts has been heretofore given, and particularly in the cases of Ruffin <em>v. Call, </em><footnotemark><em>(k)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and Henderson <em>v. Hebhurn,</em><footnotemark><em>(l)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and by that opinion, this writing falls within the latter class of contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">The court is therefore of opinion, that the judgment of the Superior court be affirmed, by which the interest and damages will be hereafter assessed under a writ of enquiry. It is the right of the appellee to reverse this erroneous proceeding altogether, and thus be let into Ms objections on the merits, instead of being subjected to pay the principal sum, under the consent of the appellant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(g)\">\n<p id=\"Ale\"><em> </em>See 1 <em>New Code, </em>508. \u00a7 79.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(h)\">\n<p id=\"Ave\"> 2 <em>Munf. </em>334.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(i)\">\n<p id=\"ALS\"> <em>4 Mumf.76.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AL7\"> Brooke absent</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(k)\">\n<p id=\"b202-5\"> 2 <em>Wash, </em>181.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(l)\">\n<p id=\"Ap_\"><em> </em>2 <em>Call, </em>232,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
