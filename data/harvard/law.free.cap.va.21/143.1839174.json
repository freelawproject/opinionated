Sometime in that month, he sold her to William Skinner, a citizen, resident in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>state of Ohio. In conformity with the sale, Kincheloe delivered possession to Skinner at Marietta in Ohio, and received the purchase money. Griffith was present at ^his sale; and on the 23d August 1816, Kincheloe executed a bill of sale for Fanny, to Griffith, which bill was delivered to Skinner. This bill was an absolute sale of Fanny from Kincheloe to Griffith, who was at the time, and continued to be, a citizen of Virginia, The agreement to have a bill of sale executed to Griffith, was between him and Skinner, for Kincheloe was no party to their contract, though he executed the deed. At the time of its execution, Skinner stated to Kincheloe, that he wished the bill of sale to be to Griffith, because by the laws of Ohio, he could not hold a slave in his own right. Fanny was at different times seen at Skinner\u2019s residence in Ohio. She was last seen there, in the spring of 181.8. About the 1st October 1818, she returned to Virginia, where she was taken into the possession of Griffith, who claimed her under the bill of sale. The section of the Constitution of Ohio, prohibiting involuntary servitude was inserted into the verdict. And upon these facts, the law of the case was submitted to the court: which gave judgment for the pauper, and Griffith appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b152-4\"><em>Hay </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJB\">insisted, that the Constitution and law of Ohio, were not set forth with sufficient certainty to warrant the judgment; and that there should be a <em>venire de novo. </em>That it did not appear Fanny made any thing more, than a sojournment in Ohio, which did not entitle her to freedom; the Constitution of the U. States prevented that effect. In a special verdict nothing can be supplied by intendment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b152-5\"><em>Forbes </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGY\">The whole transaction is, on its face, a fraud, intended to evade the laws of Ohio.
