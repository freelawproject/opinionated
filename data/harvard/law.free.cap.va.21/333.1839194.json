He hired himself of his master William Wallace, and having accumulated the sum of \u00a7100, agreed to pay it, and \u00a7200 more at a future day to his master, provided he would emancipate him. The proposal was accepted. After it was accepted, Wallace insisted that Dempsey should find some one to be surety, for the payment of the \u00a7200; one Bacon agreed to become bound for the payment, and executed his bond to Wallace. In this state of things, one Lawrence took the place of Bacon, agreed to pay the \u00a7200, and Dempsey was to be bound to him for it. This arrangement was made in concert between Bacon, Wallace, and Lawrence. Dempsey paid the money to Lawrence by instalments. Lawrence then went to North-Carolina, and promised Dempsey if he would <em>go </em>with him he would emancipate him. Dempsey went and remained two years: returned and lived on a piece of land adjoining Lawrence, always acting as a free man. Lawrence died, and his widow claimed Dempsey as a slave. The bill prayed, that all persons be injoined from molesting or selling the plaintiff as a slave; and that the widow of Lawrence, be decreed to execute a deed of emancipation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-9\">The defendant (the widow of Lawrence) never answered the bill, and Dempsey\u2019s counsel asked a final decree. \u25a0Chancellor Nelson Was willing to continue the injuxic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>tion, until Dempsey could assert his freedom in a fegular manner, in a court of law; but it being insisted that he should make a final decree, he dissolved the injunction and dismissed the bill: and an appeal was taken. - <em>x </em>*</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b342-7\"><em>M.

In England, such a contract by the rules of the common law would have insured to a villain his freedom. 1 <em>Inst. Lib. </em>2 sect. 204.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-9\">It is sufficient to observe, that this agreement was soon changed into another, more effectual in law for Dempsey, by which Wallace transfered Dempsey to Bacon, in trust, to he emancipated in a certain event. After this, Bacon having the legal right to Dempsey transfer-ed him to Lawrence in trust, also, for the same purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-10\">There appears to have been no writing to this effect: but the fact appeal's, by oral evidence, and slaves may, like other chattels, be transfered by delivery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-11\">But admitting that there had been no trust, and that D. had been absolutely the slave of Lawrence, Dempsey is nevertheless entitled to freedom, in consequence of being brought by Lawrence from North-Carolina to Virginia, contrary to the act of 1792. <em>Vid. Vir. L. Edition, </em>1803.

Because, in suits for freedom, u here essential justice can be done, the court ought not to adhere to strict form. 2 <em>Call, 350. </em>Pleasants <em>v. </em>Pleasants, 1 <em>Hen. &amp; Munf. </em>134.

This seems to be a legal consequence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-12\">The case of Pleasants <em>v. </em>Pleasants does not decide, that a person, held as a slave shall not upon recovering-his freedom recover the profits of his labor while so detained. It only decides, that, <em>under the circumstances of that case, </em>such profits were not recoverable.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b342-13\"> This ground is overruled as to the present case by the au\u2022ihority of Murray v.
