Mosby by their bill in the Richmond Chancery, prayed an injunction to prevent farther proceedings on two forthcoming bonds, executed by them to Taylor, on the ground, that the penal bills on which the judgments at law had been rendered, were altered after delivery, without the knowledge of the plaintiffs, which prevented their making the proper defence against tbe back interest in the court of law. The bills on which the judgments were obtained, were \u201cto pay by a given day, with interest from a prior day <em>if not punctually </em>paid, and then followed a penalty of double the amount of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>debt. The erasure alleged was of the words <em>(&lt;ifnot punctually paid,\u201d </em>which had the mark of a pen drawn over them. To prove that the erasure was before delivery, several affidavits, and a third penal bill executed at the same time, and for part of the same debt, were offered in evidence. The answer denied that the erasure was after delivery. The Chancellor dissolved the injunction, and Mosby appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b181-4\"><em>J. Robertson </em>and <em>8. Taylor, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-5\">The injunction was dissolved for want of sufficient proof that the erasure was after delivery. We maintain the proof is adequate; and Waller <em>v. </em>Long<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> shews, that a note or bond purporting to bear interest from the date if not punctually paid, is a contract with a penalty for default, against which a court of equity will relieve. If it be said that there is no occasion to come into equity for the erasure, which is a forgery that cannot alter the contract at law, the answer is, that the penalty gives jurisdiction; and the party should stand in the same situation in equity, that he wmuld have done in a coart of law, had the contract remained unaltered.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b181-7\"><em>Leigh, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMf\">One comes into equity on the conscience of his case. The plaintiff admits he owes the debt: and that he would pay the back interest, if he was not punctual in the payment of the principal. The injunction too, was for the whole debt, when there is no dispute except as to the back interest. Waller <em>v. </em>Long, is a technical exception founded on the particular penalty, it has no application to a case like this. There is here no proof that the erasure was after delivery, which is the foundation of the defence.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b181-9\"> 6 <em>Munf. </em>71.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b181-8\">Roane, Judge.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"A92r\">The decree is to he reversed; the injunction reinstated, and made perpetual as to the back interest, and to be affirmed for the residue.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AYd\"> Brooke absent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
