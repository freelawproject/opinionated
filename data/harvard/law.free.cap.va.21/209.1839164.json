The deed of trust dated March 1809 recited, that Langhorne had sold to Hobson a tract of land in Cumberland, to which Langhorne\u2019s wife liad not relinquished her right of dower; and that Hobson refused to pay the purchase money, unless she would. The deed of trust vested in. Taylor, for the use of Langhornc\u2019s wife for life, remainder to their joint children in fee, nine negroes, in consideration of her relinquishing her right of dower, love and affection &amp;c. The bill stated that Blanton had levied an execution obtained against Langhorne on part of the trust property, and prayed an injunction, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-10\">Blanton\u2019s answer averred, that part of the debt was due prior to the execution of the deed of trust; and charged the deed to be fraudulent as to all creditors, because when executed Langhorne was largely in debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-11\">Depositions were taken to prove Langhorne was largely in debt when he executed the deed of trust; to prove the value of the slaves; that he said they were his, after the execution of the deed; and that he and his wife exercised a joint ownership over them; and sold some of them by joint bills of sale. The Chancellor perpetuated fhe injunction.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number><em>Bouldin </em>for the appellant</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvK\">insisted, that the deed was absolutely void because made to defraud creditors. If it be voluntary it is clearly void as to creditors. But that is not the only, badge of fraud. Granting all one\u2019s effects is another badge, as Twine\u2019s case proves: a conveyance for the use of one\u2019s wife and children is another mark of fraud. Selling property for less than its value is certainly no conclusive evidence of fraud; but selling it to a person, and under circumstances, in which it is the interest of the party to get the least sum possible, is suspicious. At least the deed is voluntary as to all the property beyond the value of the wife\u2019s dower, which is the consideration alleged.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b218-4\"><em>Si Taylor </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGx\">The argument that the deed is void as to the excess beyond the value of the dower, applies only to creditors at the time.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b218-5\">But <em>Bouldin </em>said,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AM-\">if the deed be fraudulent at all, it is as to every creditor whether before or after, and cited <em>Fonblanque\u2019s equity.</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b218-7\"><em> </em>4 <em>Munf. 251.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"ADA\"><em>&amp;) </em>1 <em>Fonbl </em>261.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b218-6\">Roane, Judge.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"ACo\">The court is of opinion, upon the testimony that the deed of March 1809, in the proceedings contained, from Win. B. Langhorneto Samuel Taylor, is fraudulent and void, so far as it respects tlie creditors of the said Langhornej but as the dower interest of Mrs. Langhorne in the tract of land conveyed to Thomas Hobson by the deed, also among the proceedings, is admitted to have been relinquished by her in consideration of the provision made for her and her children by the deed first mentioned; and as the fraud of her husband in relation to the said deed, if she participated in it, should not be imputed to her, by reason of her coverture, the court is further of opinion, upon the principles settled by the court in the case of Quarles <em>v. </em>Lacy,<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>provision made by the said deed should not he disturbed, so far as it does not exceed the value of the dower interest for which it was substituted.</p>\n<p id=\"Amb\">Tiie decree is therefore to be reversed with coats, and the case is remanded in order to have that value ascertained; after which the injunction is to be perpetuated to the extent of that value, and dissolved for the residue.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Am1\"><em> </em>Cabell absent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"Ahv\"> 4 <em>Munf. </em>251,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
