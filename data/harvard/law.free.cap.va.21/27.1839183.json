To her grand-daughter Fanny Moore, a pecuniary legacy. The other children of her daughter Moore she added, were intentionally pretermitted. To her <em>son-in-law </em>Joseph Yarbrough, she gave the half of the mill and its appurtenances on Meherrin River. The residue of her estate, she desired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>be divided into five equal parts, of which, one was given to her son Thomas Walton; one to the children of her daughter Temperance Yarbrough; one to the children ^er daughter Susanna Morton\u2014Hughes Morton being excepted; one to Robert and Thomas Walton sons of her son Robert; and the remaining fifth to her daughter Sally Bitts. Her daughter Martha Knight, and her son John B. Walton, and all her grand-children not expressly provided for, she added were intentionally omitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-6\">Woodson Knight and Martha his wile, who was a daughter of George and Martha Walton, together with several of the children of Knight and his wife, brought their bill in Chancery, complaining, that the power of appointment conferred on Martha Walton by the will of George, was improperly executed; and praying, that the execution might be decreed to be void. The devisees of Martha Walton were made defendants to the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-7\">The Chancellor decreed, that the widow of G. Walton by his will, had power to dispose of the property in dispute among the children\u2019 and grand-children as she pleased, and that she had well executed the power, except in devising half the mill, &amp;c., to Joseph Yarbrough who was neither a child nor grand-child of the testator, but a son-in-law. He also decreed, that this moiety on the death of Martha Walton vested in the heirs of George Walton; and ordered an account of the profits, <em>See. </em>of the mill by a commissioner; who was directed, to report the value of the mill, the number of heirs of G. Walton, <em>ScC;</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-9\">In vacation, one of the plaintiffs petitioned the Chancellor for an appeal from this decree tho\u2019 interlocutory, because the decree was erroneous, affected the rights of the parties, and .an appeal in that stage of the cause might save the expense of the reference. The Chancellor refused the appeal. In which he was overruled by a Judge of this Court, and now the cause was argued on the merits by <em>Leigh </em>for the appellant:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Who said, it was the manifest intention of the testator, that each child and grand-child should have a share.\u2014 And under the clause, itself, she could not pretermit any object of the testator\u2019s bounty, or make the appointment illusory by giving a trifle. \u25a0 Equality is equity in such cases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-5\">This case is to be argued upon authority: and on English authority, for there is no case in point, which has occurred in Virginia; Fleming and Swan certainly is not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-6\">In Equity, powers to appoint are trusts,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> and where a power is given to dispose of the subject at discretion, in whatever words, the appointment is improperly executed, if a mere trifle be given to any object of the bounty, and more so, if any object be entirely pretermitled.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> The only case in which a variance from this doctrine appears, is that of Burrell <em>v. </em>Barrell.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> But there the devise was, that the wife should make such disposition among the children, as she should think proper, <em>or they best deserve. A </em>guinea only was given to one, and the power was held by Lord Camden, to be well executed; because the wife bat\u00ed a discretion as to the objects, as well as the fund, by the words; and might have omitted the son altogether.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-8\">There arc many decisions as to what inequality will avoid an appointment; 200/. out of 18,000/. and 100/. out of 24,000/. have been held not to he illusory.<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> But in those cases, something was given to all, which was not done in the case before us; and then, the appointment is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>clearIy vo^*<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> The case of Alexander <em>v. </em>Alexander<footnotemark><em>(f)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>seems opposed to all the cases on this point: for there must be a power given by the will to select some, *n exclusion of others, to justify the omission of any one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-4\">This power is not well executed even at lawr, for there are no special reasons existing, to justify the exclusion of any of the objects. No misbehaviour is imputed to any of them.<footnotemark>(g)</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-5\">Another provision to be sure, will authorise a pretermission. But this must be a provision by the person charged with the appointment. <footnotemark><em>(h)</em></footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-6\">And the death of the <em>cestui que trust </em>will justify an omission.<footnotemark>(i)</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-7\">The case of Morris <em>v. </em>Owen<footnotemark>(k)</footnotemark> does not affect this. There a power was given, to appoint among children, and the court held it error, to give a portion to a grandchild; and giving a slave to one of the children during the life of the person charged with the appointment, was held a good execution. In this case, I admit the appointments as to slaves given during Martha Walton\u2019s life, to be well executed: but not so of those made by her will. If the will be no execution of the power, the estate <em>must </em>be distributed according to the statute; if it be a defective execution of the power, this court will supply the defect, and execute it equally.<footnotemark>(l)</footnotemark> And the slaves given in Martha Walton\u2019s life must be included, in ascertaining what is equality.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b38-8\"><em>Wickham, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aum\">Beside Morris and Owen, Coles <em>v. </em>Brown is a decision of this court, on the doctrine of ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>pointmcnts, in which, an appointment was supported in a stronger case for the other side than this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-3\">This is equally a trust, whether the wife have power to select or not. An appointment of a penny to one is good at law, where all are to receive something. But a court of equity it is said will not allow such inequality. Yet it will allow inequality, and that very gross. One ninetieth part of the subject devised, has been supported even in equity.<footnotemark>(m)</footnotemark> All the judges regret, that such doctrine has prevailed, yet it is admitted. In Spencer <em>v. </em>Spencer,<footnotemark>(n)</footnotemark> the court expressed the difficulty it felt, on the subject of illusory appointments. The rule deducible from the English authorities, applies only to cases, in which all the objects of the bounty are in equal degree related to the testator, and\u00e1is inapplicable to a case like this, of children and grand-children.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Acn\">The word <em>among, </em>does not necessarily mean <em>all, </em>but may be answered by dividing the subject between any number of the persons entitled; and at <em>pleasure, </em>and in her <em>discretion, </em>are different tilings; one confe,rs an arbitrary, the other a limited power: another point in which this case is distinguishable from the English.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b37-9\"> 4 <em>Ves. jr. </em>708. 5 <em>Ves. jr. </em>495.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b37-10\"> Gibson <em>v. </em>Kinven 1 <em>Vern. </em>66.

So too if the trustee appointed, as aforesaid, give any portion of the trust fund to a_ child of the testator, such appointment is to be confirmed, if sufficient remains to give each object of the bounty, as above-designated, a reasonable share of the whole fund; otherwise such appointment is to be declared void, as not being conformable to the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">We are further of opinion, that all the. appointments attempted to be made in and by the last will of Martha Walton, ought to be declared void; they being repugnant to the intention of the testator, in the particulars, before declared.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">We are also of opinion, that if any appointment, made as aforesaid, shall be declared valid under the principles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>here,in stated, that the object oe objects in whose favor such appointment shall so have been made, will not be entitled to come in for a share of the residue of the trust fund, without bringing into account, the subject so appointed; the correct rule being, that when the trustee, who alone is confided in, to mate a discrimination as to quantity, fails to do- so, according to the confidence reposed, the Court must adopt equality as the rule: it would be a departure from this rule, to divide the residue among all the objects; and this is tlie more reasonable, in as much as tlie person having the power may not have intended the inequality which would thus be produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-3\">The decree is therefore to be reversed, and the cause remanded; that all parties, necessary to a final decision, according to these principles, may be made, and. a final decree he pronounced, agreeably thereto.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b39-11\">Brooke absent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
