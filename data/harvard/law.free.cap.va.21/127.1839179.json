The sheriff returned, that a jury being summoned and charged as aforesaid, upon their oaths said, that Kownslar should be at liberty to keep bis dam at the present, height, and that the damage to Ward will be SS300, by backing tlie water; and nothing was said in the inquest, as to any other requisitions of the writ. It was not found, whether navigation would be injured; the passage of fish obstructed, the health of neighbours injured &amp;,c. on the return of the inquest, Ward appeared as defendant in the county court, which on hearing the evidence granted Kownslar leave, to continue his darn, on paying Ward the $300 awarded him. Ward appealed to the Superior court: there Ward objected to the judgment, because the damages were inadequate: the jury not considering the injury done to a mill seat lie had above Kownslar\u2019s; he offered evidence to support this objection. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Kownslar objected to the evidence being heard; because it ought to have been introduced in the county court, on a motion to quash the inquest. The evidence was. admitted, to which Kownslar excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-4\">The Superior court reversed the judgment, for inadequate damages; and remanded the cause to the county court, with directions to set aside the inquest, and to award a new writ.

On this ground, and not on that taken by the Superior court, on which we give no opinion, the judgment of that court quashing the inquisition, and reversing the proceedings up to the petition is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(d)\">\n<p id=\"b137-8\"><em> </em>2 <em>Rev.
