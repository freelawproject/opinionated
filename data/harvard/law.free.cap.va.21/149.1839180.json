Bull, Hite, and North, are made defendants. an(l the hill prays, that Hite may be decreed to carry his agreement to appropriate his clerk\u2019s fees to the payment of the debt due Bull, into specific execution; that Hite and Bull may discover the. contents of the letters which passed between them on the subject; that Bull may be decreed to release his lien on Hill\u2019s property, and enjoined from claiming the debt of Hill, and that North might be compelled to settle it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-4\">North answered, that he was once agent for Bull for the collection of the debt, that he was requested by Hill not to sue for it, till he heard farther from him, but Hill never spoke of it more; that Hite once placed in his hands, clerk\u2019s fees, nominally, equal to the debt, but the fees were principally due from insolvent debtors; what he collected he paid to Bull; that while he was sheriff, Hite put other clerk\u2019s tickets into his hands for collection, but without any appropriation of them to Bull\u2019s debt, the proceeds of the collection were paid to Hite.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-5\">Bull, in his answer, acknowledges, that at Hite\u2019s request, he had given him farther indulgence for the debt, but without knowing at the time, or having any reason to believe, that any specific fund had been appropriated to the payment of it, much less that Hite had made such appropriation, in consequence of an agreement with Hill, as stated in the bill. The indulgence lie gave, was intended as an indulgence not only to Hite, but to Hill, whose property was pledged for the debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-6\">The deposition of Hite, a defendant, was taken in the cause, which was objected to as inadmissible.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b158-7\"><em>Tucker </em>and <em>Bouldin </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6V\">Hite is .a competent witness, it is clear where the interest is equal either way, the testimony is admissible. Bull had' an existing judgment against him; and Hill had his right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>to a decree in equity; if the interest be not equal, it is strongest against the party calling him; in that case also, he is competent.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> As to the objection of costs, it applies with equal force in any possible event of the suit. Costs in equity are discretional'}, and Hite should pay them, for withdrawing the funds appropriated for the payment of the debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-4\">But Hill was discharged by the new contract, entered into between Bull and Hite; by which, Bull gave farther time. For this, Rees Berrington,<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> is a clear authority.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b159-5\">Leigh, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aoo\">Hite is an incompetent witness; for he is liable for costs, being a party to the suit on the record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-6\">Nor was Hill discharged from liability, by the indulgence given Mite. The doctrine on this subject is stated with too much latitude by the other side. It is true, a principal shall never give up a lien, and hold the surety bound afterwards. This is the rale laid down in Cronghton <em>v. Duval</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>But Bull gave up no lien.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-7\">Besides, Hill is not a mere surety. There was a consideration personal to Hill: it was a longer forbearance, which induced him to execute the deed of trust. Me as sinned the debt by this act, on himself. He cannot now be suffered to remit himself back, to the original bond.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b159-9\"><em> </em>2 <em>Salk. </em>691.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b159-10\"> <em>2 Ves. jr. 243.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b159-11\"> <em>2 Call, </em>69.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b159-8\">Hoajvb, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"ApLq\">Without deciding upon the admissibility of Geo. Hite\u2019s deposition, so far as it is affected by his alleged liability for costs, in the case before us; and there being other abundant testimony, the court is of opinion, that the appellee Bull, having agreed to wait with the said Hite, the principal debtor, one whole year, for a moiety of his debt, without the knowledge or consent of the appellant; thereby making a new contract with the principal, without the assent of the surety. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>which not only varied materially the situation of the parties, but suspended his resort to a bill of <em>quia </em>timet/ this case is brought within the established principle of equity, which was admitted by this court, in the case of Croughton and Duval, and the appellant is absolutely discharged thereby, from his liability to pay the debt in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The decree is, therefore, to be reversed with costs, and the appellee decreed to release the deed of trust in the proceedings contained;- and be also perpetually in-joined, from demanding the debt aforesaid from the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
