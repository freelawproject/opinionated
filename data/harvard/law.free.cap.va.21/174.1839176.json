Granting injunctions <em>ex vi termini </em>imports a power to prevent some impending injury, and not that of redressing a wrong already done. The very object of an injunction is to keep things in the condition in which they stand when the application is made. In England the whole proceeding is <em>in personam. </em>Our laws have scrupulously guarded against all changes of property, without allowing to the party the benefit of an appeal to correct errors of law. Every interlocutory order in Chancery professing to change the possession, is subject to revision and reversal by this court. But there is no appeal from a pending injunction; tolerate the principle now asserted, and one may be turned out of his house, in the most inclement seasons, by <em>ex parte </em>proceedings, in vacation, of which the first intimation lie has, is the order to leave his own fire-side, and family mansion. There is no precedent for such a proceeding in any volume of cases; no principle to sanction it in any writer on equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-9\">As little can the power be maintained under the law giving authority to the Chancellor to grant <em>ne exeats. </em>That proceeding is justified only by the strong necessity of the case: only on the supposition, that the property is about to he removed beyond the jurisdiction of the court. But the bridge cannot be removed. A <em>ne exeat </em>to arrest the removal of fixed property is an absurdity in law, and a solecism in language. The whole proceeding of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Chancellor is then, unknown to our laws, unheard of in our courts; it is hazardous, mischievous in its consequences, and arbitrary in its nature. No case then, could w arrant such an interposition of the Chancellor, but this case, would be wholly beyond tiie reach of the Chancellor, if in any imaginable instance he possessed the power lie has asserted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-5\">The executrix has only a collateral claim at best, to secure the payment of her annuity, and of debts generally, But that does not authorise the executrix to take the real property from the heir. Courts have never gone farther where lands are charged with payment of debts, than to create an implied charge on the realty in the hands of the hair.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-6\">The clause in the will then, gave to the personal representatives, no right to the possession of the real estate. The Chancellor has not observed the distinction which exists between an express power to sell, and a charge by implication on the real. He has proceeded on the authority of <em>Maddox. </em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Donne <em>v. </em>Lewis,<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> contains the law at this time for the order of subjecting property to the payment of debts. There is but one case contrary to the doctrine there laid down: in Newman <em>v. </em>Johnson,<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> it was held that \u201ca devise that debts and legaee cies being first deducted, all the real and personal to <em>\u201c </em>J. S\u201e\u201d was a devise to sell for payment of debts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-8\">But if the testator had authorised the executrix to sell the real, for payment of debts, the executrix would not have had a right to take possession of the real estate. For such a power however clearly expressed, would not break the descent; the realty would pass to the heir subject to the <em>devise.</em><footnotemark><em>(e)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AME\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>The executrix then has a mere power to sell, and that is derived not from the power given in the will, but from the act of Assembly in conjunction with it, which pro^ddes, that the executor or administrator may sell, where the will appoints no one for that purpose. Prior to the act of Assembly, the sale could only have been made by a trustee appointed by the Chancellor for that purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-4\">Mrs. Trent is by the will devisee, and legatee of an annuity. As devisee she surely has no right to property not devised to her. As legatee of the annuity, she is a creditor to that amount, but no creditor under the will ever claimed possession of any part of the realty, and much less a creditor by legacy. The will charges the payment of debts, on the realty, but not of legacies, and a legacy unless expressly charged on realty cannot be by implication. It may be said that if debts are paid out of real estate, her annuity shall be charged on personal estate; but if the right exist, it extends only to substituting her in place of specialty creditors, who had themselves no right to possession of the real. Even if the annuity had been by express words charged on the bridge, the heir would have the right of possession of the bridge, and to the residue of tolls.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Ax4\"><em>S. Taylor, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXR\">The bill charges that the whole personal estate of the testator is disposed of: that the defendant had tried an unlawful detainer and had been defeated, and nevertheless had, in the absence of the keeper, of the bridge, taken possession of the toll-house, within the limits of the land devised to Mrs. Trent. The order of the Chancellor is, that the defendant shall be Injoined from receiving the tolls, if the injunction was proper, the appointment of a receiver was a matter of course.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-6\">Mrs. Trent, is the legatee of an annuity, and we may go into evidence <em>aliunde </em>to shew that the testator de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>signed to charge the payment of it, on the real property.<footnotemark><em>(f)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>To do this even parol evidence is admissible. I* nt in this case the face of the will proves that it was the intention of the testator, to charge the real with the payment of the annuity, for there was no other property not specifically appropriated, on which it could be charged but the realty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-5\">The preference given by the common law to the heir so much i-elied on, has no existence in V irginia: our statute of descents has destroyed every pretext for such preference. <footnotemark><em>(g)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-6\">And even in England, annuities are chargeable on the real estate. <footnotemark><em>(h)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>There is no difference between charges by implication, for the payment of debts, and of legacies; and it is clear, that debts charged by implication bind the realty.<footnotemark>(i)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-7\">In this case it is to be remarked, that the annuity is to a wife entitled to dower in the real estate; and this testamentary provision is instead of dower. She is then a purchaser for a valuable consideration.<footnotemark>(k)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-8\">The heir should at least give security for the payment of the annuity: that may be demanded wherever the legacy is payable at a future day.<footnotemark>(l)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b189-9\">\n<em>W. Hay,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Asf\">on the same side. It is unimportant, who has the right to execute the trust. The rights of Mrs. Trent in her individual character, are enough to warrant the decree. Nor does it matter whether the order was made in term or vacation. The hill states that the toll house descended clothed with trusts, the power of the court is clear if a trust existed; is that the case?</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A20\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>There are cases in which creditors come in to be satisfied out of a trust fund, and the personal estate being\u2019 exhausted the Chancellor has appointed a receiver.<footnotemark>(m)</footnotemark> case ^ie Pr\u00b0fits are liable as well as the subject: and the reason for a receiver\u2019s being\u2019 appointed is the stronger, from the destructible nature of the property. We have then, to sustain our case, to shew only, an interest in Mrs. Trent; and probability that the personal estate is already exhausted. That is charged in the bill; the answer neither admits, nor denies it; and the depositions prove not merely the probability, but the certainty of the fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-5\">The equitable construction, and operation of such devises, as to the liability of respective portions of the testator\u2019s estate, has often been considered by the courts in England. The court is referred to the numerous cases without commentary. <footnotemark><em>(n)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The will charges the annuity on the whole estate, <footnotemark><em>(o)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and the implied charge binds the bridge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-6\">There is no distinction between charges by implication of debts and legacies; if there were, one would think it should be in favor of legacies.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b190-7\">\n<em>Leigh,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Asq\">on the same side. This court is now sitting in judgment on an appeal from an order of the Chancellor, made in term time and not in vacation. If the decree be right in its main principles, but wrong in its details, it will be corrected and not wholly reversed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-8\">The general direction that debts shall be paid, charges the whole real estate with all the testator\u2019s debts. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>\u00bfases are numerous to shew that such is the effect of a clause in the commencement of a <em>will,</em><footnotemark><em>(p)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and the reason is the same wheresoever the clause occurs in the</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Azk\">If the real estate is charged with the payment of debts, the real estate descended must be subjected, before that specifically devised to the widow.<footnotemark>(q)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-7\">The annuity is a pecuniary legacy charged on the real estate descended, from the plain intent of the will. The personal estate is inadequate to the payment of debts; if cannot he charged on the personal property given the widow; not on property specifically devised for the payment of debts; and there remains nothing on which if can be charged, but the real estate descended.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-8\">If the annuity be in lieu of dower, the widow is a purchaser for value.<footnotemark>(r)</footnotemark> The court has generally a power to appoint a receiver in such cases, where the heir refuses to give security: or it may even direct the descended property to be sold, and hold the proceeds subject to the annuity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-9\">No matter in what right the defendant holds, the trust attaches to the property in his hands, <footnotemark>(s)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b191-10\"><em>Wickham, </em>concluded for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A83\">From the nature of hank debts, the moment the defendant assumed the payment of the debt due the bank by the testator, the estate of the testator was discharged, and Trent the defendant to the bill, became bound for the debt. This at once makes the defendant a creditor of the testator's estate to a large amount. But for this prior and stronger claim, the complainant might have had all that she has asked.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZh\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>The will incontestibly shews, that the testator designed his heirs should take the bridge. He gives to his wife a right of passage over it; a provision wholly unnecessary aT1^ even absurd, on the supposition he had already given her the subject itself,</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AldD\">By the true construction of the will, the widow is devisee of certain slaves; of household furniture; and legatee of an annuity of $1500 <em>per annum. </em>If the estate be insolvent, she can receive no portion of the property thus devised; and whether it be so or not, she must be postponed to the defendant to the bill, who is a creditor. If not, it would be to take from the defendant\u2019s pocket without any equivalent, the whole bank debt which he has assumed to pay for the estate. He enters on the property as heir at law, which he is entitled to do: but even if he entered as a creditor (for he unites both characters) the widow whose right is subordinate, has no cause of complaint. Had she the possession, she would be obliged to give security to account for the profits which must be .applied to the payment of the debts due the defendant, before any part is appropriated to the discharge of her legacy. The defendant exempts her from this responsibility without the least prejudice to her interest: she cannot therefore desire the possession for any equitable purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-5\">The case does not present a proper subject for an injunction. It is not one in its operation. It is in fact a writ of <em>habere facias possessionem. </em>The Chancellor proceeds upon the supposition that the descent is broken: but a devise that debts shall be paid docs not break the descent. He perhaps has misapplied an expression used in <em>Maddox, </em>that \u201cthe testamentary disposition rides over the title of the heir,\u201d the real meaning of which, is no more, than that the heir takes the property subject to the charge, and in subordination to it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-6\">It is not pretended that the original order of the Chancellor was right: and that being the foundation of all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>subsequent proceedings, it is tantamount to a confession of error throughout.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASg\">The case of Jones <em>v. </em>Pugh,<footnotemark>(t)</footnotemark> which is relied upon, at most proves only the power of the court, where a proper case occurs for its interposition. The power in conccivable cases, surely does not prove the propriety of its interference in this. It is a rule in marshalling assets, never to take the estate from the heir until the personal estate proves insufficient; another rule of marshalling assets is, that the heir is not responsible for profits; it is true that a creditor may extend the lands; and equity follows the law, but neither law nor equity will subject the profits in the hands of an heir or devisee, when they accrue before judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-5\">Admit\u00eding the power of the court asserted under the authority of Jones <em>v. Pugh,</em><footnotemark><em>(u)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the question recurs, is this a proper case for the exercise of such power?</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-6\">Whenever a receiver is appointed, it is on the supposition that the person in possession is not to be trusted. Is the defendant unworthy of this trust? If any injury can result from his possession it is to the creditors: but they are thrown on another fund. Whereas the defendant\u2019s debt is to be paid out of this very subject. He is obliged to account for the debt he has assumed even should the estate prove insolvent; and to take the complainant\u2019s annuity out of this fund would be a fraud upon the creditors. He ranks first in the order of creditors on this fund, and unites to that character the quality of heir to the testator. The property then cannot be in safer hands. The very objection drawn from the perishable nature of the subject proves the superiority of his claim, for there is no one so strongly interested in its preservation. Even if the complainant had possession of the bridge, we could sue to divest her, or for the profits. If we be called on to marshall the assets, vv'e say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>wc are applying them according to the distribution equity makes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"As9\">Having taken this general view of the case, I come to reply more in detail to the several arguments on the , .. s other side.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aid\">And 1st, That the annuity is chargeable on the real property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AoZ\">The parol evidence resorted to, to prove this intention, is inadmissible. Shermer <em>v. </em>Shermer, and Kennon <em>v. M\u2018Roberts,</em><footnotemark><em>(v)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>were not cases in which parol evidence was admitted to explain the intention of the testator. In cases in which parol evidence has been admitted it has been confined to explanations of the true intention of the testator; here it is offered to shew his situation. And if the court will look into the actual state of his affairs, it will find the testator was wholly ignorant of it; he estimates his estate at more than \u00a7200,000. It is insisted that his charging debts on the real, is proof that he knew the personal estate was insufficient to pay Ms debts. The inference is <em>not </em>necessary. And if he <em>meant </em>to charge the legacies on the real, why did he not do it expressly, as ho has the debts?</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-8\">It is a rule of law that the heir shall not be disinherited by implication. The rule is a wise and politic one; the objections made to it, apply not to the rule, but to the particular application of it, to the English law of descent; our statute has altered the persons who are heirs, but the rule remains unchanged; and this court is bound to respect it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-9\">It is said that, legatees stand in place of creditors, having a right to be satisfied out of this fund, which brings me to the 2d point made by the other side.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-10\">But debts are not charged on the lands, except that due by the defendant. The clause in the will is, that particular real property shall be sold, and then \u201cas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>many of the lots in the town of Manchester <em>as will he suffidentf\u2019 </em>which confines the charge to the Manchester lots, and the property specifically directed to be sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-4\">The 3d point, that the legatees may marshall the assets, therefore fails; for debts cannot claim satisfaction out of this fund; and legacies being in their place, can be in no better condition. But suppose the debts had been a charge on this subject, legatees can stand in place only of debts that have been satisfied out of the personal estate, that might have ranked on the real. But a legatee shall never rank as against the devisee of real estate; for both are objects of the testator\u2019s bounty, and he who has the possession shall hold it. A legatee can only claim against the heir, not against a devisee, and surely a legatee can have no better right against a devisee merely because he is also heir.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-5\">The widow can derive no advantage from the circumstance of her having no dower allowed her. She might have insisted on her dower, but in that case she should not have acquiesced in the will. She has submitted to the will, and she must take all the consequences of her act. But if she could claim right of dower in the bridge, it would be to one third of the tolls: not to the entire bridge. The clause allowing her to pass toll free, negatives the idea, that the testator intended she should receive any portion of the tolls.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-6\">Something was said of the toll house being on land expressly devised to the widow, but it is a mere accessory, and will follow the principal subject.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b187-10\"> <em>Prec. in Chan. </em>262, 397, 430. 3 <em>Ves. jr. </em>738, 551, 359.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"ASR\"><em> </em>1 <em>Mad. </em>474.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"AGa\"> 2 Br. <em>Ch. </em>263.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"(d)\">\n<p id=\"Ao7\"> 1 <em>Vern. </em>45. 1 <em>Mad. </em>Ch. 483.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-5\" label=\"(e)\">\n<p id=\"AZx3\"> 1 <em>Bro.

It was created by these words in that will,\u2014\u201cI direct the payment of all my just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>debts;\u201d and is not retracted by the subsequent selection of a part of his estate, to be sold for that purpose. The devise being in the first instance pure and simple, for the payment aforesaid; is not made conditional by what follows in another sentence, and respected the peformance, an(j ho\u00a3 t|ie Sllbstance of the grant; which regarded rather the mode in which the payment should be made, than the question whether the payment should be made at ail. Nor is this construction varied by the probable mistake uuder which the testator laboured as to the sufficiency of the property selected to pay the debts aforesaid. Estimating that property by the very high scale of value, by which he estimated bis whole estate, and which the peculiar character of the times justified, there could be no doubt in his mind of its adequacy; and if so, his will did not contemplete a contrary state of things, nor, consequently, revoke the unqualified charge in it, before noticed.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The court is further of opinion that, exclusive of that, charge, the result would probably be produced, by the express charge upon all the testator\u2019s property in favor of the debts due to the banks, and by the consequent right of his other creditors to throw the bank creditors upon the other and ulterior property, so as to get satisfaction,\u00bb themselves, out of the property which was particularly charged and selected.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">It is further the opinion of the court that the whole estate of the testator, not specifically devised or bequeathed is charged by his will to pay the legacy or annuity of $1500 per <em>annum, </em>given to the appellee. We are to consider it, because this fact is charged and relied on in the supplemental bill, and because sufficient facts are disclosed in the testimony, in relation to the insufficiency of the personal estate, to shew that this must have been intended by the testator. If he meant the legacy to be paid at all, he must have intended that it should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>charged on the realty: yet this charge should not rest exclusively on the bridge now in question, not only because there are no words in the. will so as to restrict it, hut because an annuity which was intended for the maintenancc and support of the widow, for life, ought not to depend on the existence of a subject which is of a nature peculiarly destructible. The appellee is therefore in? the condition of a legatee having her legacy charged upon land, and her claim as such, must be postponed to those of the creditors having a lien upon the same subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">We cannot consider that the appellee has a claim upon the bridge in question, in part of her right of dower in the real estate; nor that the annuity in question was intended to be in lieu of dower, and therefore (as it might he contended,) has a pre-eminence over a mere and simple legacy. Hi either of these grounds of claim is asserted by the bill or proved by the testimony. We cannot make the appellee\u2019s case better than she has made it. We cannot injure the appellants by sustaining grounds of claim which were neither charged nor proved on the part of the appellees, nor could have been regularly disproved <em>by </em>the appellants, as they were not put in issue by the pleadings. We can only consider the appellee\u2019s claim, upon this record as a simple legacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Subject in common with all the other real estate to pay the debts of the testator, and this legacy in subordination to those debts, the bridge in question descended to the present appellants. They took it, liable to the charge aforesaid, and they only in the first instance were entitled to the possession. The possession ensures to them, not only on general principles, but by a construction growing out of the particular provisions of the will in question. A general right of possession in the appellee, of the bridge aforesaid, is inconsistent wi Hi that provision in the will, which gives to her the use of it for particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>purposes. The right of possession thus doubly guaran\u00bb teed to the present appellants, ought not to be disturbed, until a change of possession should be made necessary, in fulfilment of the charge imposed on this property by the will; or until some mismanagement thereof, or misapplication of its profits, should render it improper that the appellees should hold the possession any longer. In either of these events however, the case ought to be previously made out, to justify the interposition of the <em>court. </em>Until the change shall be shewn to be necessary, the regular\u2019 principles of the common law, in relation to the possession ought not to be departed from. They ought pot, especially in this case, in which the appellants have' superadded to their characters of heirs, that of extensive creditors.. \u25a0 Nor ought this peculiar kind of property which is always in want of repairs, and is emphatically liable to destruction, to have been lightly taken from the owners, and put into the hands of a mere bailiff. The permanent interest of all the parties would strongly lean against such a proceedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">We are therefore of opinion, that the change of possession of the bridge in question wras, in this case, irregular and premature. Circumstances had not yet been disclosed to the court, sufficient to justify a change of that possession. It had not yet been shewn that the appellants were misapplying the profits of the bridge; or that they had been required, or had refused to give security for the due application thereof. The main ground of the present proceeding was on account of the appellee herself. Without either charging or proving, that she had any claim of greater dignity than that of a mere legatee, she gets in the van of the creditors, and claims to possess and occupy for her own use, property which may eventually be exhausted by them. So far as respects her own rights, she asks a decree from the court which is not justified by the premises she has established; and which may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>never be proper, on account of the superior and conflicting lights of the creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">We are therefore of opinion, the decree is erroneous, and ought to be reversed, so far as it conflicts with the foregoing principles} that the injunction should be dissolved} the possession of the bridge restored to the appellants, and the cause remanded to he further proceeded in, pursuant to the principles stated in this decree.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b195-9\"> Brooke absenfc</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
