Effinger, Henry Elick and Timothy Quinlan to enforce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>the vendors, and also judgment, liens, against a tract of land in the county of Rockingham, which Ralston had sold to Effinger, and parts of which Effinger had sold to the other defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-4\">In October 1858, by a written agreement under seal, Ralston sold to Effinger a tract of land estimated to contain three hundred and thirty-one acres, for the sum of $12,000, of which $1,000 was to be paid in cash, Effinger was to discharge a debt of $3,000 due to Robert Grey, for which there was a lien on the land ; and the remainder was to be paid in seven equal annual payments of $1,142.85. And Ralston was to convey the land by deed with general warranty, in which a lien was to be reserved for the purchase money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-5\">Effinger was put into possession of the land, and in 1860 Ralston and wife conveyed it to him with general warranty. In the same year Ralston recovered a judgment against Effinger on the first bond; and in 1866, he recovered j udgments on the other bonds. He set out the foregoing facts in his bill; stated that Effinger had lately sold to \u2022 Flick about eight acres, and to Quinlan about eighty acres of the land.' That the debt of $3,000 to Grey, which, by the contract, Effinger had assumed to pay, was still unpaid. And he prayed that the land might be sold for the payment of the judgments ; and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-6\">The defendants demurred to the bill, and Effinger also answered. He stated some small payments he had made on the judgments, and also some interest on the debt to Grey ; and he says that the plaintiff derived his title to the land, except about thirty acres, from his father, David Ralston, and that David Ralston had not made a deed to him for it: though said David had joined with the plaintiff\u2019 in conveying the property to the trustee in the deed to secure Grey\u2019s debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-7\">In May 1867, the cause came on to be heard, when the court overruled the demurrer, and directed a commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>sioner to ascertain and report the amount due from Effinger to the plaintiff, on account of the purchase of the land ; and leave was granted the plaintiff to file an amended bill. This amended bill ihade the heirs of David Ralston, deceased, H. Jewett Grey, to whom the debt due Robert Grey, had, on the death of the latter, been transferred, parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-10\">The commissioner returned his report, and the cause came on again to be heard, when it appearing by said report that there was due from Effinger to the plaintiff $7,780.57, of principal money due by judgment, with interest from the dates when the payments fell due, and that Effinger was further indebted to Grey in the sum of $8,000, with interest from January 1st, 1849, subject to some small credits named, and that Ralston could make a good title to the land, the court made a decree against Effinger in favor of Ralston and Grey, for the sums ascertained to be due to them respectively; and unless he paid the money within sixty days from the date of the decree, the sheriff who was appointed a commissioner for the purpose, should proceed to sell the land, on the terms of one- \u201e fourth cash, and the balance in four equal annual payments, bearing interest from the day of sale ; the title to be retained until the whole purchase money was paid. And out of the proceeds of sale he should first pay off Grey\u2019s debt, and then pay to Ralston the amount ascertained to be due to him. The decree provided that the land in the possession of Effinger should be first sold ; and if that was not sufficient to pay the debts, the residue of the tract; or so much as was necessary, should be sold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-11\">The commissioner returned his report of the sale, by which it appeared that the land still in the possession of Effinger, consisting of two hundred and fifty acres, was sold at $31.10 per acre, and Ralston became the purchaser ; that the land in the possession of Quinlan was sold at $32.70 per acre, and he was the purchaser ; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>that Flick became the purchaser of the eight acres in Ms possession at \u00a725 per acre. The commissioner says \u201c that in his opinion, as well as of persons w'ho are disin- 1 terested with whom he has conversed, all of these sales have been judiciously made, and ought to be confirmed.\u201d And he says that the price realized from the sales exceeds considerably the amount which Effinger was to pay \u2022for the property when it was in good condition ; and that it has been much injured since his purchase.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-4\">The commissioner returned with his report a number of affidavits of farmers residing near the land aud knowing it well, expressing the opinion that it went for its full value. There is also an affidavit from Quinlan, in which he says, that though he contracted in 1866, or February 1867, to pay Effinger \u00a745 per acre for the eighty acres he purchased, yet he was deceived by Effinger in regard to the lines and in other respects, in such way that he determined shortly afterwards not to pay for it. And he did not intend to pay any more than he contracted to pay at the sale by the commissioner ; and that it is not worth that much.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-5\">Effinger excepted to the report, aud objected to the confirmation of the sale, upon the ground that the court should have confirmed the sales made by Effinger to Quinlan and Flick ; and should have subjected the purchase money due to Effinger to the payment of the purchase money due to Ralston, instead of virtually setting said sales aside and ordering a resale. 2d. Because of inadequacy of price, as shown by affidavits filed. There were affidavits also filed by persons living in the neighborhood of the land, who express the opinion that the land was worth forty-five dollars per acre.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-6\">The cause came on to be further heard on the 3d day of November 1869, when it was decreed that if Effinger files with the clerk of the court bond with good security in the penalty of \u00a715,000, conditioned that at the next offer of the land for sale, he will bid five per cent, more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>than the commissioner sold the land for, including costs of said sale, and upon the same terms, and comply with them, then the commissioner should proceed to advertise and sell the said land upon the terms prescribed in the former decree. But if Effinger did not execute said bond within sixty days from the rising of the court, then the sale made should, stand confirmed ; and the sheriff was directed in that event to deliver the land to the purchasers. Effinger obtained an appeal from this decree to the District court of appeals at 'Winchester, from whence it was transferred to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b452-10\"><em>Harris, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b452-11\"><em>Woodson </em>and <em>Liggett, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b452-12\">Moncure, P.</author>\n<p id=\"AQF\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">The court is of opinion that the Circuit court did not err, at least so far as the appellee, Ralston, is concerned, in not confirming the sales made by the appellant to Flick and Quinlan in the proceedings mentioned. Those sales were made in subordination to the paramount right of the said appellee, Ralston, who, in his contract of sale to the appellant, expressly reserved a lien on the entire tract of land sold, to secure the deferred instalments of the purchase money. The sales to Flick and Quinlan of portions of the said tract of land, were subsequently made by the vendee, Effinger, without the consent of the vendor, Ralston, and of course were not binding upon him, and could not prejudice his paramount right to have the whole tract of land sold, if necessary, for the payment of the purchase money due to him. The court properly directed the commissioner appointed to make the sale, to sell in the first place the portion of the land remaining in the hands of Effinger ; and if a sufficient amount should be realized from said sale to satisfy the -decree, including costs of suit and sale, to make no further sale. But, in case a sufficient amount should not be realized from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>said sale to pay oft' and satisfy the said decree, then the court properly directed the said commissioner to sell the residue of said land sold by Ralston to Eftinger, or so much thereof as might be necessary to satisfy the balance due under the said decree from the said Eftinger. This was all that either Effinger, Flick, or Quinlan had any right to require in regard to the land sold to Flick and Quinlan. Ralston was not bound to engage in a controversy with them about the specific execution of the contracts of sale made to them by Effinger. If they had proposed to pay into court to the credit of the cause the amounts due on their contracts with Effinger, and had shown that such amounts were at least equal to the value of the land bought by them respectively, the court ought to have accepted their proposition, received the money, and confirmed their title : and no doubt the court would have done so. But they made no such proposition. On the contrary, Quinlan, who purchased eighty acres of the land, says, in an affidavit filed and read as evidence in the cause, that he was deceived by Effinger in regard to the lines of the said land, and in other respects, and in such a way, that he determined, shortly afterwards, not to pay for it. It seems that the sale to Quinlan was in February 1867, about a month before the institution of this suit; and, except as to f500 of the purchase money, which was to be paid in hand, was on a credit of one, two, three and four years. It would have been unreasonable and unjust to require Ralston to incur the expense, trouble, and delay of a suit to enforce the specific execution of this contract between Effinger and Quinlan, especially when Quinlan contested its validity on the ground of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">The court is further of opinion that the Circuit court did not err in not setting aside the sale made by the commissioner in February 1869, on the ground of inadequacy of price, and ordering a resale. The commissioner who made the sale reported that it wras for a fair and full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>price, and ought to be confirmed ; and many affidavits were taken and filed to that effect; while on the other hand, about as many were taken and filed to the contrary effect. The preponderance of the evidence seems to sustain the report, and the opinion of the Circuit court was to the same effect. To induce a court to set aside a sale fairly made in pursuance of a decree, merely upon the ground of inadequacy of price, there ought to be a decided preponderance of evidence of such inadequacy, even if it be conceded that mere inadequacy of price is, in itself, a sufficient ground for setting aside such a sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">The court is further of opinion that the Circuit court did not err in making it a condition of a resale of the laud, that the appellant should file with the clerk of said court, bond with good security in the penalty of $15,000, conditioned that at the next offer of the land for sale he would bid five per cent, more than the commissioner sold the same for before, including the costs of said sale, and upon the same terms, and would comply with the terms of said sale. The court might well have refused to order a resale on any terms whatever, but have confirmed the sale absolutely ; and of course the appellant has no right to complain of the terms on which a privilege was afforded him by the court of having a resale, if he desired one and could and would comply with the terms. He made no motion to open the biddings. If he had done so, &gt;and pursued the proper course in such cases, the court would have ordered them to be opened on proper terms. \u201c Where a person is desirous of opening a bidding, (says Sugden in his law of vendors, p 66, marginal), he must, at his own expense, apply to the court by motion for that purpose, stating the advance offered. Notice of the motion must be given to the person reported the pm chaser of the lot, and to the parties in the canse. If the court approve of the sum offered, the application will be granted,\u201d and a\"new sale ordered. \u201c Mere advanee of price, (says Sugden fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>ther, Id.,) if the report of the purchaser being the best bidder is not absolutely confirmed, is sufficient to open the biddings \u201c but the court will stipulate for the price, and not permit the biddings to be opened upon a small advance ; aud although an advance of ten per cent, used, generally, to be considered sufficient on a large sum, yet no such rule now prevails; but in the case of a sale under a creditor\u2019s suit, the court permitted the biddings to be opened upon an advance of 5 per cent, on \u00a310,000. An advance of \u00a3350 upon \u00a35,300 was refused, and it was said that the former cases only established, that where an advance so large as \u00a3500 is offered, the court will act upon it, though it be less than 10 per cent.\u201d \u201c The determinations on this subject assume a very different aspect when the report is absolutely confirmed. Biddings are in general not to be opened after confirmation of the report; increase of price alone is not sufficient, however large, although it is a strong auxiliary argument where there are other grounds.\u201d (Id. 67.) \u201c Where the biddings are opened, the advance is ordered to be deposited immediately, and the costs of the purchaser to be paid by the persons opening the biddings.\u201d (Id. 69.) Such are some of the rules of the English practice on this subject, and the same practice and rules, substantially, exist in this State, though not in all the States of the Union. They do not, however, apply to this case, as it was not a case for opening the biddings, no advance of price having been offered, nor even a motion to open the bid-dings made. It is needless, therefore, to enquire whether the penalty of the bond required of the appellant as aforesaid was not greater than it might well have been. The court is therefore of opinion that there is no error in the decrees aforesaid, and that the same ought to be' affirmed. But the court is of opinion that such affirmance ought to be without prejudice to any relief to which the appellant may be entitled against the appellees, Elick and Quinlan, or either of them, either in this suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>or in any other suit he may he advised to bring on account of the sales made by him to them respectively in the proceedings mentioned. They have become purchasers at the sale made under a decree in this suit of the same land previously bought by them respectively of the appellant, but they have so become purchasers at less prices than those at which they had previously bought the land as aforesaid. And as they seem to have thus gotten what they had contracted for with Effinger, it may be just and equitable that they should account with him for the difference between the amount of purchase money agreed to he paid by them to him, and the amount of the price at which they purchased the same land under a decree in this suit as aforesaid. Such a mode of settlement would seem to be consonant with the case of <em>Stephens </em>v. <em>Hutchison, </em>&amp;c. 6 Gratt. 147. Without, however, deciding that question, which cannot properly be decided upon the pleadings and proofs now in this cause, we think the decree appealed from and the affirmance thereof ought to be without prejudice as aforesaid ; and it is therefore ordered accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">The decree was as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">The court is of opinion, for reasons stated in writing and filed with the record, that there is no error in the decree aforesaid. But, as the appellees, Flick and Quinlan, have become purchasers at the sale made under a decree in said suit, of the same land previously bought by them respectively of the appellant, and have so become purchasers at lower prices than those they had agreed to pay to him for the same land, it may he just and equitable that they should account with him for the difference between the amount of purchase money agreed to be paid by them to him, and the amount of the price at which they purchased the same land under a decree in said suit as aforesaid. Such a mode of settlement would seem to be consonant with what was decided by this court in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>case of <em>Stephens </em>v. <em>Hutchison, </em>&amp;c., 6 Gratt. 147. \"Without, however, deciding that question, which cannot properly he decided upon the pleading and proofs now in the cause, the court is of opinion that the said decree appealed from, and the affirmance thereof, ought to be without prejudice to any relief to which the appellant may be entitled against the said Flick and Quinlan or either of them, either in this suit or in any other suit he may be advised to bring, on account of the sales made by him to them respectively as aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">Therefore, it 'is decreed and ordered that the said decree appealed from be affirmed, but without prejudice as aforesaid, and that the appellant pay to the appellee, Balston, thirty dollars damages, and his costs by him about his defence in this behalf expended, which is ordered to be certified, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Decree affirmed ; <em>bul without prejudice.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
