J lent to <em>G </em>$5,000, and took his bond for the amount, dated April 17, 1862, payable five years after date, with interest, and a deed of trust on land to secure the debt. The money loaned had been deposited in bank in January 1861 to J\u2019s credit, and she gave G a check upon the bank for the amount in the usual form.

G afterwards sells the land, covered by the deed of trust, to M, and leaves in M\u2019s hands enough of the purchase money to pay the debt due to J; and M undertakes to pay it. On the 30th November 1864, J enters into an agreement with M, by which J agrees to take $2,000^ gold in full of the bond, provided it is paid in two months from the date of the agreement. M pays $865 within the two months, and he pays $413 in February, after the two months is out; and he pays no more during the war. M not having fulfilled the agreement, it is not binding on J, and M must pay the balance due upon the bond; crediting the gold payments at 2j- for one; that being the ratio agreed upon by the parties in their agreement.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b352-10\">3.

It is not necessary for the court, before directing the trustee to proceed to sell, first to refer it to a commissioner to report how much and what part of the trust subject shall be sold.

L. Jeffries, then of Washington city, in payment of a debt that had been some time due to her. Of this sum she had drawn out a thousand dollars prior to April 1862. At this date she was living in Kichmond <em>; </em>and on the 19th of April 1862, she lent to P. J. Glover, of the county of Albemarle, five thousand dollars, giving her check upon the said hank in the usual form for the amount; the money in bank being the balance which had been deposited as stated above. For this loan Glover gave to Mrs. Jeffries his bond payable five years after date with interest payable semiannually ; and he conveyed to John B. Tucker a tract of land in the county of Albemarle, estimated to contain two hundred and twenty-eight acres, being a part of an estate known as \u2018\u00a3 the Brook farm,\u201d in trust to secure the payment of the principal and the punctual payment of the interest. This deed is in the form given in the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-8\">In November 1862, Glover sold and conveyed the land mentioned in the deed of trust to J. Augustus Michie, at the price of $45 per acre ; and the trust in favor of Mrs. Jeffries was recited in this deed, and it was agreed that Michie should retain in his hands, and have a right to see to the application of, so much of the purchase money for said lands as should be sufficient to satisfy the said lien.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-9\">On the 30th of November 1864, Mrs. Jeffries and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Michie entered into a written agreement, which is called in the proceedings \u201c the gold contract.\u201d In this agreement the bond and deed of trust executed by Glover, and the conveyance to Michie are recited, and it is agreed between the parties, that if Michie will pay to Mrs. Jeffries two thousand dollars in gold, within two months from this date, Mrs. Jeffries will deliver up the said bond, and acquit the said Michie from all liability on the same ; the said Michie binding himself herein to make such payment within such time. And the agreement states in the conclusion of it, that Michie has paid to Mrs. Jeffries $328 in gold, as payment in part on that day in pursuance of the agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-10\">On the 29th of December, Michie made a further payment in gold of $537 ; and on the 21st and 22d of February 1865, after the sixty days had expired, he made two payments, the first of $206 and the second of $207; both in gold. No further payments were made during the war. And after the war, Michie not having paid anything on the debt, Mr. Tucker, the trustee, at the request of Mrs. Jefiries, advertised the land to be sold under the deed of trust. The advertisement stated that the trustee would sell so much of the land as was necessary to pay the balance of the debt, such balance amounting to $1,751.89, with interest from the 19th day of April 1865 : up to.which time Michie had paid the interest on November 20th, 1864, before the gold contract was entered into.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-11\">\"When the sale was advertised, Michie obtained an injunction from the judge of the Circuit court of Albemarle county to stop it. In his bill he set out the foregoing facts ; and he says when he made the payment in December 1864, he asked Mrs. Jeffries if she required the balance to be paid within the sixty days ; she replied she did not; that he might go On and pay it as soon as he could ; and he wen.t on and procured gold as fast as he could, and made the two payments in February 1865 ; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>which lefta balance due from him of $722, as of the 30th of January 1865. He proceeds to state an arrangement he made with Mrs. Jeffries when he made the last pay- - ment, by which he was to send at gold prices, bacon and flour to the amount of $200 in gold, and was preparing to send negroes to Richmond to sell and make up the balance, when he was prevented by the raid of General Sheridan, which cut off' communication with Richmond, and then by his own sickness for three months. He insists that after what had been done, Mrs. Jeffries had no right to repudiate the gold contract, and upon the most favorable construction for her, she was only entitled to recover $722, with interest from the 30th of January 1865. And if that contract was to be repudiated the original loan to Glover was a loan of Confederate money, and should be scaled. And making Mrs. Jeffries and the trustee defendants, he calls upon her to say if the money loaned was not Confederate money, and if it wgs not the true understanding and agreement between herself and P. J. Glover, that the debt should be paid in Confederate money. And he asks the court to decide whether the gold contract is still in force, or if it has been repudiated. If it has been repudiated, then he insists that Mrs. Jeffries shall lose the benefit of the last payment in gold, and that he shall be credited with its value in Confederate money, at the time of the payment ; which would more than extinguish the debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-4\">Mrs. Jeffries answered the bill. She states that the money was delivered to Glover in the manner herein-before stated. She denies that she ever loaned Confederate money to Glover, or in any way or shape, directly or indirectly, agreed to receive payment of her loan of $5,000, in Confederate money. She says it was well understood at the time by Hr. Michie, that the gold arrangement was a war measure, limited to war times. She denies that at the' time of the payment of the 29th December 1864, she told Michie that she did not require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>the balance to be paid within the sixty days named in the contract, and that he might go on and pay it as soon as he could. On the contrary, she well remembers that Dr. Michie, when he made the payments in February, or one of them, said he supposed she would not receive it, because the sixty days had run out. But this respondent did receive these payments. She did so because the war was still going on, and it was in accordance with the line of policy which prompted her to make the gold contract. But in receiving these payments in conformity with, the terms of the contract, she did not, either in terms, or by implication, bind herself to receive still other payments in gold upon the same terms, especially if the war was over at the time they were proffered. She has never repudiated the gold contract; but abided by it as long as it lasted. On the other hand, she never agreed to leave this contract in force for an indefinite period, nor can her receiving the payments in February be so construed. Her receiving the payments in February 1865 was not done under the contract, for it was then at an end, but outside of it; though the payments were taken upon the same terms with those received under the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-10\">She further states that the balance of $1,751.89, with the interest thereon from the 19th of April 1861, (for the payment of which amount the sale was advertised by the trustee,) was arrived at by crediting the gold payments on the $5,000 bond at two and a half times their amount, that being the ratio agreed on in the gold contract. And she sets out in detail the credits endorsed on the bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-11\">The evidence in the cause is sufficiently stated in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-12\">The cause came on to be heard on the 22d of May 1867, when the court held that w'hether the gold contract was or' was not first limited to two months, it was after-wards extended without limitation; but that it was af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>terwards repudiated by Mrs. Jeffries, aud this repudiation was acquiesced in by Michie. It was further held that the original debt was not a Confederate contract, and that the debt was not liable to be scaled. It was therefore decreed that the injunction be dissolved with costs and damages; and that Tucker should sell at public auction, to the highest bidder, as trustee, under and by virtue of the trust deed, the tract of land conveyed to him in trust by said deed ; giving notice of the time and place as directed in the decree. And the terms of sale were to be ; cash enough to pay expenses of the trust including the expenses of the sale, and the costs of suit; and the balance of the purchase money in three equal instalments, falling due respectively in one, two and three years from the day of sale, with interest, to be secured by the bonds of the purchaser, with approved \u2022personal security ; and a deed of trust upon the land. And the trustee was directed to report to the court and return the bonds taken. Michie thereupon applied to the District court of appeals at Charlottesville, for an appeal; which was allowed: and the cause was after-wards transferred to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b357-4\"><em>Watson </em>and <em>Duke, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b357-5\"><em>Robertson </em>and <em>Southall, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b357-6\">Moncure, P.,</author>\n<p id=\"AKd\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">The court is of opinion that the debt in the proceedings mentioned, contracted on the 17th day of April, 1862, by P. J. Glover, with the appellee, Martha B. L. Jeffries, for the loan of five thousand dollars, payable five years after date, with interest from the date, payable semi-annually, and secured by the bond of the said Glover, and a deed of trust on real estate, was not, &lt;e according to the true understanding and agreement of the parties,\u201d payable in Confederate States treasury notes, nor contracted with reference to such notes as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>standard of value ; and, therefore, that the said debt is not subject to be scaled in the mode prescribed by the acts of Assembly in such case made and provided. \u25a0 The money loaned had been deposited by the lender in the Bank of Virginia, in December 1860, or January 1861, and remained there, on deposit, until the date of the loan, when it was drawn out by the borrower on the check of the lender. The bank was bound to pay specie or specie funds, in discharge of the check, and tue borrower was not, any more thau the lender, bouud to receive anything else. If he received Confederate States treasury notes in payment of the check, which is quite probable, though the fact does not certainly appear, he received them voluntarily, without any understanding or agreement to that effect with Mrs. Jeffries, and even without her knowledge, and no doubt because they suited his purposes as well as any other money; at least with the exception of specie ; which could not then he gotten. Such notes were then comparatively little depreciated, and were of as much value, compared with specie, as bank notes or any other paper currency, or as legal-tender notes were when the principal of the debt became payable. The money having been deposited in bank before the war, the bank would no doubt have been willing to pay it out in bank uotes, in discharge of the check, if the borrower had preferred or required it. And if he did not, it was probably because Confederate States treasury notes served his purpose just as well. The great length of time which the debt had to run, five years, confirms the view that it w'as not understood to be payable in Confederate States treasury notes. The parties could not then have contemplated that the war would last so long, or that such notes would be the currency when the debt would become payable. Hone of the parties, neither the lender, nor borrower, nor the appellant, the subsequent vendee of the land convoyed by the deed of trust, who assumed the payment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>debt as part of the purchase money, contemplated that, the debt would be payable in anything but good and lawful money at the time of its maturity; at least until long after the war, when, it seems for the first time, the appellant conceived the idea that it was payable in Confederate money, and subject to be scaled. The acts and declarations of all the said parties during the war repel such an idea. The debt was treated as a debt in good aud lawful money, in the sale made by Glover to the appellant, of the laud conveyed by the deed of trust for its security. It is not pretended that in that transaction Glover represented that the debt was payable otherwise than in good money; but the effect of the transaction seems to have been, to leave in the hands of the purchaser, in part payment of the purchase money, so much of it as would be sufficient to pay, in good money, the amount of the said debt at its maturity, with interest in the meantime, according to the terms of the bond and deed of trust, and to impose on the purchaser the obligation of making such payments. The appellant\u2019s agreement, on the 30th of November 1864, to pay two thousand dollars in gold, within two months thereafter, in discharge of the said debt, repels the idea that he then considered it to be payable in Confederate States treasury notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">The court is further of opinion, that the agreement of November 30, 1864, between Mrs. Jeffries and the appellant, called in the pi\u2019oceedings the \u201cgold contract,\u201d being exhibit- \u201c N \u201d referred to in the bill, is a conditional agreement, expressly limited, by its terms, to the period of two months from its date ; and not having been fully performed by the appellant by the payment to her of two thousand dollars in gold within that period, she was not bound to deliver up the said bond, and acquit him of all liability on account of the same, but he remained bound for the full amount thereof, subject to the credits endorsed thereon, crediting the gold pay-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>meats at two and a half times their amount, that being the ratio agreed on between the parties .in their said \u25a0agreement of November 30, 1864. The state of things which existed when the .said agreement was entered into, the situation of the parties at that time, and all the surrounding circumstances, concur in showing that the parties actually intended what the terms of their agreement literally express, as aforesaid, and that <em>time </em>is of the essence of their agreement. Mrs. Jeffries would not have agreed to receive less than one. half of the amount of the debt (eveu though paid in gold) in full payment of it, except under the circumstances which surrounded her at the time, and on the terms and condition expressed in the agreement. It was believed by the parties that those circumstances would continue to exist for at least two months, and therefore that period was given to the appellant for the full performance of the agreement. He well knew that he was\u00bb bound by the agreement to make full payment within the two months in order to be entitled to have the bond delivered up, and to be acquitted from all liability on account of the same ; and therefore he thought it necessary to ask her, as he says he did on the 29th of December 1864, when he made her a payment of $537 in gold, if she required the balance to be paid within the sixty days. She denies this allegation in her answer, and there is not sufficient proof of it to overcome the effect of such denial. But the allegation shows that he considered it necessary to procure her consent within the sixty days, to the extension of the time for the performance of the \u201cgold contract\u201d beyond that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">The court is further of opinion, that the said agreement having failed of full effect by the failure of the appellant to make full payment of the said sum of two thousand dollars in gold within the said term of two months, it was not revived, nor extended to any period, definite or indefinite, and certainly not to any period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>beyond the actual existence of the war, (which alone had induced the agreement,) by anything which occurred after the expiration of the said term. The appellant alleges in his bill that \u201c on the 29th day of December 1864, your complainant paid Mrs. Jeffries $537 in gold ; at the time this payment was made, complainant asked Mrs. Jeffries if she required the balance to be paid within the sixty days ; she replied that she did not; that he might go on and pay it as soon as he could.\u201d \u201c He proceeded as rapidly as he could to make collections of gold, and on the 21st day of February 1865, he made another payment in gold of $206, and on the next day he paid $207 in gold, making, in the two payments, $413, which left a balance due from complainant of $722, as of the 30th day of January 1865.\u201d In answer to these allegations, Mrs. Jeffries says: \u201cTour respondent denies that at the time of the payment of the 29th of December 1864, she told Dr. Michiethat she did not require the balance to be paid within the sixty days named in the contract, and \u2018 that he might go on and pay it as soon as he could.\u2019 On the contrary, she well remembers that Dr. Michie, when he made the February payments, or one of them, said he supposed your respondent would not receive it, because the appointed time for payment (the sixty days) had run out. But in spite of this fact, your respondent did receive those payments. She did so, because the war was still going on, and it was in precise accordance with the line of policy which prompted her to make the gold contract. But, in receiving these payments in conformity with the terms of the contract, your respondent did not, either in terms, or by implication, bind herself to receive still other payments in gold upon the same terms, especially if the war was over at the time they were proffered.\u201d The appellant and respondent were .both examined as witnesses in the case, and their testimony corresponds with what is stated in the bill and answer respectively as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>aforesaid. There is no other testimony on the same subject, except that of Judge Ould, which confirms that of Mrs. Jeffries. We must take the facts, therefore, to be as stated by her, and so taking them, there can be no doubt or difficulty in deciding that the right to make payments on the gold contract ended, at least with the war, if not with the said period of two months from its date. That the appellant was himself of that opinion, is conclusively shown by the fact that he made no payment nor offer of any payment on account of that contract after the payment made in February 1865, as aforesaid. She wrote him on the 24th of April 1866, and again on the 1st August 1867, stating her necessities for money, urging him to pay the interest due on the balance of his debt, and representing the principal of that balance to be about eighteen hundred dollars. Both of these letters were received by the appellant; and yet he answered! neither of them until December 1, 1867, more than eighteen months after the date of the first, and four months after the date of <em>the </em>second. He then wrote to her, saying, \u201cI must apologise for not answering the letter you wrote me last summer, by stating that I contemplated visiting Richmond iu a short time, and thought it best to see you in person in regard to the money I owe you on Major Glover\u2019s bond. I have, however, been prevented by business from taking the trip, and shall not be able to see you before the month of February, when you may rely on my paying you two years\u2019 interest on the remainder of said bond. If you would prefer making a reasonable deduction on said bond, I will make an effort to pay all of the principal that has not heretofore been paid.\u201d This letter is inconsistent with the idea that the writer then considered the gold contract as still subsisting ; and the same may be said of another letter, written by him to her, dated March 2, 1868 ; but it is. needless to state its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">The court is further of opinion that the bond and deed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>of trust are not tainted with usury ; as fully appears from what has already been said. Rut if they were, there are two sufficient answers to the objection: 1st, - that it was not made in the pleadings, non otherwise, in the court below, but is made now, lor the first time, in argument, in the appellate court, and therefore it comes too late ; and, 2diy, it comes from the wrong quarter. Dr. Glover, on whom the usury is supposed to have been practiced, has waived the objection, if it could ever have been made, and bo far as he is concerned, has, in- effect, paid the money. He left it in the appellant\u2019s hands for the use of the creditor, and the appellant is bound in-good faith, both to the debtor and the creditor, to pay over to the creditor the money thus had and received to her use. A court of equity will not entertain him in his-attempt to withhold it. He is met at the door of the court by one of its favorite maxima, that \u201che who asks, must do, equity.\u201d In fact he has no equity to ask. The' money is not his, but Mrs. Jeffries\u2019. He has no claim to nor interest in it. That this is the law seems to be well settled, by the Supreme court of the United States, in <em>DeWolf </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>10 Wheat. U. S. R. 367, 393; and by this court in <em>Crenshaw\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>&amp;c., 5 Leigh, 65; and <em>Spengler </em>v. <em>Snapp, </em>Id. 478; all of which cases were cited in argument by the counsel for the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">The court is further of opinion, that the-bond of Dr.. Glover, secured by the deed of trust in the proceedings mentioned, being fully due and payable, in good and lawful money, subject only to the credits endorsed thereon ; and there being no doubt as to the true balance due and unpaid on account of said debt; and the trustee in the deed having proceeded, in strict pursuance of its terms, to execute the trust <em>thereof; </em>he was doing a lawful act, in a lawful way, when his proceedings were' arrested by the injunction awarded in this ease. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>the court below might very well, uot only have dissolved that injunction, but dismissed the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">But the court is further of opinion, that while that course might well have been pursued, <em>that </em>court had the power, at its election, to retain the cause, and have the trust executed under its superintendence and direction ; as was done in the case of <em>Hogan </em>v. <em>Duke &amp; als., </em>20 Gratt. 244, cited by the counsel for the appellant. That course seems to be convenient, as it saves the expense and necessity of another suit, in case one should be necessary, and it tends to ensure a due and faithful execution of the trust. Certainly, the debtor can have no good cause to complain of such a course.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-12\">The court is further of opinion, that there is nothing in that portion of the decree of the Circuit court, which directs the trustee in the said deed of trust to proceed to make a sale under and by virtue of the same, or which prescribes the place, manner and terms of such sale, of which the appellant has any just cause to complain. The trustee, by the express direction of the decree, must pursue the terms of the deed, except so far as the decree directs otherwise, and the decree directs otherwise, only in regard to the terms of the sale ; the deed adopting the form prescribed by the Code, which provides that the sale shall be for cash; while the decree provides that the sale shall be for only so much cash as may be enough to pay expenses of the trust, including expenses of the sale and costs of the suit, and on a credit of one, two and three years, as to the balance of the purchase money. Surely the appellant has no cause to complain of this change of the terms prescribed by the deed, and he does not complain of it. But he complains that the decree directs the trustee to sell the whole of the tract of land conveyed by the deed; whereas the Code, p. 562, ch. 117, \u00a7 6, which applies to this case, requires him to <em>\u201c </em>sell the property conveyed by the deed, <em>or so much thereof as may be </em>necessary.\u201d There is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>no substantial variance between the Code and the decree in this respect. It was not the design of the framers of the Code to make any substantial innovation of the law \u25a0 in regard to deeds of trust, but merely to prescribe a general form for such deeds, where the parties do not prefer some other form. The object was, to save labor in the preparation of such instruments ; and therefore the section provides that the sale shall be for cash, and of the property conveyed by the deed, or so much thereof as may be necessary. These terms were prescribed in reference to what was supposed to be suitable to a majority of cases of deeds of trust. When slavery existed, as was the case when the Code was adopted, slaves were a common subject for conveyance by deed of trust; and slaves were generally sold for cash. And, except wdien sold in families, were sold separately, and it was proper to sell only so many of them as were required to satisfy the purposes of the trust. The form of the deed of trust prescribed by the statute applies to \u201c property \u201d generally, and not to land alone. It is the duty of a trustee not to sell more of the trust subject than the purposes of the trust require, even though the deed direct him, iu case of default, to sell the trust subject, without saying, \u201c or so much thei\u2019eof as may be necessary to satisfy the purposes of the trust.\u201d <em>That </em>is always implied, unless a contrary intention plainly appears. The decree, therefore, in directing the trustee to sell, \u201c under and by virtue of the trust deed,\u201d the tract of land thereby conveyed to him, is to be construed and read, as if the words, <em>\u201c </em>or so much thereof as may be necessary,\u201d followed the words above mentioned. In sayiug, \u201c under and by virtue of the trust deed,\u201d all the terms of the deed, and of the law on which it is founded, are, in effect, embodied iu the decree, except such as are therein expressly varied. There is no ground to apprehend that the trustee will not execute his duties fairly and faithfully, and there is no suggestion of the kind in the bill. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>his advertisement of the sale under the deed of trust, he stated that he would sell so much of the land as might be necessary to pay the balance due upon the debt; and he will no doubt make the same, or a similar statement, in his advertisement of the sale under the decree; but whether he will or net, it will be his duty to sell only so much of the land as may be necessary for the purposes of the trust. \u00a5e do not mean to say that he must sell precisely so much as may be sufficient to satisfy the purposes of the trust and no more. It may be difficult, or impossible to do this, and it may in fact be a breach of trust to do it. He cannot so divide and sell the land as to do unnecessary injury to the owner. He is the agent of both parties, and must consult and respect the rights of both. The sale of a part of a tract of laud, may injuriously affect the sale or value of the balance ; and it may be the duty of the trustee to sell the whole tract, or more of it than is required for the purposes of the trust, especially if desired by the owner of the land to do so. By duly considering the rights, interests, and wishes of the parties, an intelligent aud faithful trustee will rarely find any difficulty in the discharge of his trust, and when he does, he can have the difficulty removed by invoking the aid of a court of chancery for that purpose. In this case, the parties are already in court, and it will be easy to obtain that aid if necessary. There is no necessity for any preliminary reference to a commissioner to ascertain and report how much, and what part of the land should be sold. It is the duty of the trustee to determine that question, aud the presumption is that he is fully competent and able to do so. Should he meet with any difficulty in doing so, it will then be time enough to ask for such a reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">The court, is of opinion that there is no error in the decree of the Circuit court, and that it ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-12\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
