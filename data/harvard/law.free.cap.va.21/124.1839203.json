That Jabez is still under 50, embarrassed in bis circumstances; and that Venus has been taken under an execution against Jabez \u00b0 Early, and purchased by Garland, (as the agent for certain plaintiffs in the execution,) who sold her to Read, who sold to Booth. The bill prayed, that the defendants might be compelled to give security for the forthcoming of Venus and her increase, when Jabez Early should attain the age of 50, and be restrained in the meanwhile, from taking her out of the state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-6\">The clause of the will after <em>lending </em>Venus to Jabez Early, subject to the control of the executors, and directing, that no title should be made until he attained 50 years of age; and that if lie died before that time, the executors should make a title to his heirs, was in these words; \u201cI lend him one negro girl, by name Venus, \u201c now on Ms plantation, to Mm until he arrives to the \u201c age of 50 years, for the express purpose of supporting \u00ab his family, and to his heirs for ever..\u201d The Chancellor of the Richmond district was of opinion, that the absolute property passed to Jabez Early by the testament; and dismissed the bill.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b133-8\"><em>Bouldin </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A84\">The word \u201cheirs\u201d often means \u201cchildren;\u201d \u201cchildren,\u201d sometimes means <em>\u201cissuer* </em>we must take either in the construction of wills, in the sense in which the testator used them, Here the testator clearly means, to give the use for a specific number of years to Jabez, and the absolute property to his children; The limitation is not too remote, and the devise to the remainder-men is good.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b133-9\">Call, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApW\">The words convey the whole estate; for they give the absolute property to Jabez, when he reaches 50; he is therefore,the legal owner <em>alt </em>initio, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>this hy operation of the rule in Shelly\u2019s case.
