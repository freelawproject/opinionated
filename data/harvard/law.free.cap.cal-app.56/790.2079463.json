A demurrer interposed to the complaint by defendant was sustained without leave to amend, followed by a judgment dismissing the action, from which plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-13\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The judgment attacked and which it is sought to have annulled and set aside is that entered in the case titled <em>McLain v. Llewellyn Iron Works, ante, </em>p. 60. [204 Pac. 869], wherein, on an appeal therefrom by the defendant therein, who is plaintiff in the instant case, an opinion was filed in this court on January 6, 1922, reversing the judgment so appealed from. The effect of the order so made in that case is to set aside and annul the</p>\n<p id=\"b820-14\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>judgment which is made the subject of plaintiff\u2019s attack in this action. Hence the record presents a moot question only, and- for that reason the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">A petition for a rehearing of this cause was denied by the district court of appeal on February 3, 1922, and a petition to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on March 6, 1922.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">All the Justices concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Lennon, J., was absent and Richards, J., <em>pro iem., </em>was acting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
