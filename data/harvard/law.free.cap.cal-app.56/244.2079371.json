The complaint asked for judgment for $25,000, with accrued interest, counsel fees, and costs. The clerk of the court after trial made an entry in his minutes reciting that judgment had been ordered in the sum of $3107.37, with counsel fees and costs. A few days thereafter findings of fact and conclusions of law were filed with a decree awarding judgment in the sum of $31,447.24, with counsel fees and costs. Appellant insists that the trial court was bound by the minute entry made by the clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-14\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> No bill of exceptions is presented, so the appeal must be deemed to be one on the judgment-roll alone. <bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The minute entry of judgment is no part of the judgment-roll. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>(Sec. 670, Code Civ. Proc.) In examining the judgment-roll we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The appeal is without merit, as the amount noted in the entry of the clerk was manifestly a mere clerical error.</p>\n<p id=\"AQQ\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Langdon, P. J., and Sturtevant, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
