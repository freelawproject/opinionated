No briefs have been filed in behalf of appellants. The cause was regularly placed on the calendar of January 5, 1922, for oral argument. No appearance was made for either appellant. The appeal is submitted on the record on motion of the respondent without argument. Section 1253 of the Penal Code provides: \u201cThe judgment may be affirmed if the appellant fails to appear, but can be reversed only after argument, though the respondent fail to appear.\u201d Under the law \u201cbut one disposition can be made of the case in its present condition; it can be affirmed.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gehrig, </em>7 Cal. Unrep. 149 [72 Pac. 717].) A careful examination of the record, however, discloses no prejudicial error in the conduct of the trial, the rulings of the court, or the instructions to the jury. The evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>of the defendants\u2019 guilt is positive and ample to sustain the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The judgments and orders appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"A8\">Burnett, J., and Hart, J., concurred. .</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
