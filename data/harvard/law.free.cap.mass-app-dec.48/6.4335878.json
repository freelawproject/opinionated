There was a finding for the defendant and the plaintiffs claimed a report. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b13-9\">\u201cAt the trial there was evidence that the automobile of the plaintiff, Thomas E. Burzynski, was stolen on the night of December 11, 1969; that at seven o\u2019clock P.M. on said date, Thomas E. Burzynski, Jr., the son of said Thomas E. Burzynski, had parked said automobile, locked the doors of said automobile and closed all the windows; that the trunk (luggage compartment) was fully enclosed and locked; that at about eleven o\u2019clock P.M. he went to where he had parked said automobile, saw that it was not there, telephoned his father who telephoned the police; that said automobile was fpund on December 15,1969, in a damaged condition; that the rear wheels and battery had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>been taken; that some of the contents of the glove compartment had been taken; that the boot of the convertible top, which separated the interior of the vehicle from the trunk (luggage compartment), had been slashed; that the ignition lock was broken; that certain personal property had been taken from the trunk (luggage compartment); and that the right door window was pulled out.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-5\">\u201cThe insurance policy concerned was introduced into evidence. The said policy provided insurance to the plaintiffs against theft of personal property away from the premises of the plaintiffs, subject to the following exclusion: \u2018This policy does not apply, as respects this peril, to loss away from the premises of: . . . . .....(b) property while unattended in or on any automobile, motorcycle or trailer, other than a public conveyance, unless the loss is the result of forcible entry either into such vehicle while all doors and windows thereof are closed and locked or into a fully enclosed and locked luggage compartment, of which entry there are visible marks upon the exterior of said vehicle\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b14-8\">The judge found: \u201cThe policy in issue contained the usual exclusion that it did not apply unless there was forcible entry \u2018of which entry there are visible marks upon the exterior of said vehicle.\u2019 There were other conditions as well and I find that the plaintiff sustained the burden of proving them. However, I do find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>that the condition of the car as described by the plaintiff did not amount to \u2018visible marks upon the exterior of the vehicle \u2019. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b15-9\">Doherty, Wallace, Pillsbury &amp; Murphy of Springfield for the Defendant</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b15-10\">William M. Fitzgerald of Springfield for the Plaintiffs</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b15-5\">\u201cThe burden was on the plaintiffs to prove that the loss was within the description of the risks covered.\u201d <em>Tumblin </em>v. <em>American Insurance Company, </em>344 Mass. 318, 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-6\">In <em>Hero </em>v. <em>Holyoke Mutual Fire Insurance Company, </em>34 Mass. App. Dec. 120 (1966) on similar facts, this court had occasion to construe the same language contained in the policy issued to the plaintiffs in the case at hand. There we held that a plaintiff must show (a) \u201cforcible entry\u201d and, (b) \u201cvisible marks upon the exterior of said vehicle.\u201d Here the judge specifically found \u201cthat the condition of the car as described by the plaintiff did not amount to \u2018visible marks upon the exterior of the vehicle\u2019.\u201d This finding, warranted by the evidence, or lack of it, cannot be disturbed by us. <em>Heil </em>v. <em>McCann, </em>1971 A.A. 1675.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-7\">There was no error in the judge\u2019s disposition of the plaintiffs\u2019 requests for rulings of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-8\">The report is to be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
