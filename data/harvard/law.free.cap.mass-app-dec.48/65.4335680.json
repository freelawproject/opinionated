These three notes were guaranteed by a Gerald M. McCarthy. This action is brought against the executors of the estate of a Gerald M. McCarthy alleging that the maker of notes had defaulted on the same. The defendants\u2019 answer contained a general denial and payment in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">At the trial the only testimony was. by an officer of the plaintiff trust company who stated that the maker of the notes had defaulted, that he was familiar with the transaction and the signature of Gerald M. McCarthy. The three notes were introduced into evidence and the endorsement of a Gerald M. McCarthy appeared on the reverse side of each note.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">At the close of the evidence the defendant requested that the court rule that the plaintiff had not sustained the burden of proving that Gerald M. McCarthy, defendants\u2019 testator, was the same Gerald M. McCarthy whose signature was on the notes declared upon. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>denied all of defendants\u2019 requests for rulings. The court found for the plaintiff and, being aggrieved, the defendants bring this report.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b73-8\">Louis Kobrin of Boston, for the Plaintiff</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b73-10\">John P. Lebonis, Jr. of Brookline, for the Defendants</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The court erred in denying the requested ruling that there was no evidence to show that Gerald M. McCarthy, defendants\u2019 testator, is the same Gerald M. McCarthy who guaranteed the notes. Indeed, there was no evidence to show that the latter McCarthy had died. It would seem that the rule laid down in the case of <em>Herman </em>v. <em>Fine, </em>314 Mass. 67, is clearly applicable here: \u201cBald identity of name without confirmatory facts or circumstances is insufficient to prove the identity of a person.\u201d <em>Deutsch </em>v. <em>Ormsby, </em>354 Mass. 489. <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>DiPaolo, </em>313 Mass. 492. <em>Hinds </em>v. <em>Bowen, </em>268 Mass. 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The defendants\u2019 general denial made it incumbent on the plaintiff to prove every element of its case, including the fact that defendants\u2019 testator was the person who endorsed the notes in question. Finding for the plaintiff vacated. Case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
