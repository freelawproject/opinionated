The plaintiff claiming to be aggrieved by the court\u2019s disposition of this requests for rulings, seeks review thereof by this Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">We have before us an instrument entitled \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Draft Report\u201d signed by the trial justice. This report contains the required statement that it includes all the evidence material to the questions reported. It does not, however, contain the report of the evidence and the specific findings of fact made by the trial justice as required by Rule 28 of the District Court Rules (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">It is evident, however, from a comparison of the evidence reported and the findings of fact made by the trial justice, as submitted to this Division, that there are extreme variances between the two. We, therefore, are unable properly to decide the correctness of the trial courts\u2019 dispositions of the plaintiff\u2019s requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">In the first instance, it is the obligation of Counsel to see that the report to the Appellate Division contains everything material to matters reported so that the Division may decide whether the trial Judge\u2019s action was justified, yet, the trial Judge also has the duty to see that the report is sufficient. <em>Coco </em>v. <em>Lenfest, </em>37 Mass. App. Dec. 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">In this case the ends of justice will be served by remanding the case to the trial court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>the purpose of correcting the report. Ordered accordingly.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b42-4\">Wm. H. Shaughnessy for the Plaintiff</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Aj-\">Timothy L.
