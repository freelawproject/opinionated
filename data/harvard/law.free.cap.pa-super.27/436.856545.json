The borough of Kutztown is a borough duly incorporated and subject to the provisions of the general borough law of April 3, 1851, P.

The plaintiff is a resident of said borough and the owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>of two two-story brick houses and a tract of land consisting of building lots, fronting for a distance of about 570 feet upon the eastern side of Noble street, in said borough.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-3\">8. Noble street was originally laid out according to what is known as the \u201cFisher plan, \u201d which is not a plot of the entire borough, but was adopted by the same in 1859. The center line of the street was fixed at its intersection with Sander alley by a stone known as the \u201c Fisher stone, \u201d and at the southern limits of the borough by a hole drilled in the rock and so described on the plan.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-4\">4. In 1885 a number of houses had been built on opposite sides of a portion of Noble street, fifty-four feet apart, not, however, equidistant from the center line according to the Fisher plan. Since 1884 there have been disputes about the proper location of the building line on the western side of the street, the plaintiff repeatedly protesting against the adoption of the one followed in the erection of houses on that side and at least on one occasion threatening legal proceedings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-5\">5. On July 3,1885, upon due notice to the property holders, the borough council passed, and on July 13, 1885, the chief burgess approved, the following ordinance \u201c to widen and lay out that portion of Noble street between Sander alley and the southern limits of the borough : \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-6\">\u201cSection 1. Be it enacted and ordained .... that that part of Noble Street .... be widened and laid out to the width of 54 feet .... as follows, to wit: Beginning at a corner in the center of Sander Alley marked by a planted stone, so called the \u2018 Fisher stone, \u2019 at said street and running thence by lots lying on the east side of said street .... and lots lying on the west side .... south 22 degrees, east 2106 AV feet to a point in the center of a public road running along the southern limits of said borough of Kutztown.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-7\">\u201c Sec. 2.

Prior to the passage of this ordinance stakes had been driven along the properties fronting on Noble street designed to indicate the curb lines thereof as proposed to he widened; the lines marked by said stakes coinciding, not with the lines of a street fifty-four feet wide with a center line conformable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>to the Fisher plan, but with the line now contended for by the borough.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-3\">7. After the passage and approval of the ordinance, proceedings were instituted by the borough to No. 3 November sessions, 1885, court of quarter sessions of Berks county, for the assessment of damages; the petition averring as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-4\">\u201c That that part of Noble Street .... beginning at a corner in the center of Sander Alley, marked by ... . the' \u2018 Fisher Stone \u2019 at said street and ending at a point in the center of a public road .... has been of the width of feet.

At the time of the view, the stakes mentioned in the next preceding finding and marking the supposed, curb lines of the street as widened were in the ground. No damages were awarded. The report was confirmed absolutely January 13, 1886. The draft attached to it indicates an existing \u201ccenter stone\u201d at the intersection with Sander alley as one. of the termini of the center line of Noble street \u2014 the \u201c Fisher stone,\u201d which was then in its original place and was the only stone that could be meant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-6\">8. In 1886, in pursuance of an opening order issued from the Q. S., part of Noble street was opened and the curb lines of the remainder south of plaintiff\u2019s property marked by stakes by the borough supervisor ;\u25a0 the lines followed by him being substantially those now contended for by the borough, and placing the center line of the street midway between the front of the Bieber residence as marking the building line on the 'eastern, and the Bloch house as marking the building line on the western side according to a survey made by the borough surveyor Humbert.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-7\">', 9. On September 10, 1897, the borough council by resolution, not submitted to the chief burgess for approval, directed an engineer, Charles F. Sander, to prepare a map of the borough, and on February 17, 1898, by a similar resolution approved the map' by that time prepared by him. It has been kept hanging for public inspection\u2019 in the council room. Upon this (the \u2019Sander) survey the center line of Noble street is virtually conformed to that of the Fisher plan. . ...</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>10. In 1897, also, when plaintiff was about to build the two houses referred to in the second finding of fact, and applied to the borough council (of which at the time he was a member) for the proper building line, Sander was instructed by the council to give him the proper line; and Sander thereupon gave plaintiff the building line in conformity with the Sander survey which he w'as then preparing. And the houses were placed accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-4\">11. On April 6, 1900, the borough council adopted a resolution, not previously advertised nor submitted to the chief burgess for approval,'recognizing the Humbert survey (see findings, No. 8) as determining the center line of Noble street, whereby the Bieber residence and the Bloch house mark the opposite building lines thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-5\">12. In August, 1900, an engineer, M. M. Dreibelbis, made a survey at the instance of the borough and took up and replaced the Fisher stone at its present location, 41- inches away from where he found it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-6\">18. On or about April 14, 1903, written notice was served on plaintiff by the borough through its chief burgess to set curbs along his property fronting on Noble street according to the line thereof by the Humbert survey, and upon his refusal' and thirty days\u2019 failure to do so, proceeded, according to the terms of the notice, to do so itself, with the purpose of charging him with the cost thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-7\">14. The opening of the street to the eastern curb line of the Humbert survey will-encroach upon the plaintiff\u2019s land along1 its entire length an average of about two feet beyond the curb line, as indicated by the Fisher plan or the Sander survey.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-8\">' 15. There are several buildings erected sinc\u00e9 1885 upon the western side of Noble street opposite the property of plaintiff, all of them substantially conforming to the lines of the Humbert survey.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-9\">DISCUSSION.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-10\">\u2022 It may be well to1 discuss the questions arising in this case before-formulating the legal conclusions which seem required by the facts found.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-11\">' When the ordinance of July 13,1885, declared the purpose of widening and laying out at the width of - fifty-four feet Noble <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>street, a street already located and in existence, it could hardly be understood as intended nor could it well be effective to change the location of the street by disturbing its established center line. It necessarily meant an extension of the breadth of the street equally to the north and south of that line as it then existed. And especially must this be so in view of the mention of the Fisher stone which marked the one terminus of that line. Upon the familiar principle, also, which gives to calls for monuments upon the ground an effect overriding calls for' courses and distances, this explicit reference to the Fisher stone renders the words \u201c South 22 degrees east \u201d of trifling, if any, significance. Without moving the Fisher stone from its then location, or ignoring it, the plaintiff\u2019s case does not appear to be helped by reference to this bearing. And, of course, the subsequent removal of the stone cannot at all affect the question here involved. Nor, in view of the express reference to the Fisher stone, is it of controlling import that before the passage of the ordinance there had been some confusion in the building line observed by successive builders along the street, some on the one side keeping, twenty-seven feet away from the Fisher center line, others on the opposite side coming closer to it. Perhaps but little less unimportant is the fact that, before the passage of the ordinance and at the time of the view, the curb lines of the street as supposed tq be contemplated were marked by stakes upon the ground. The function of the viewers was not to lay out the street or determine its curb lines. They had only to do with the assessment of damages: Alleyin Kutztown, 2 Woodw. 373, 375. If they Were misled by the marks erroneously put upon the ground by the borough officials, that might have constituted an objection to their award. But it could not make that the lawful line of either side of the street which was not its lawful line according to the terms of the ordinance. Nor by any of these things did the plaintiff, in the absence of evidence that he had something to do with causing the mistake, become estopped by it. True, he saw the stakes there, but he could not ascertain that they were wrong or how far they were wrong, except by having a survey made. Indeed, it has taken twenty years of disputing back'and forth, three or four different surveys, and a judicial trial to ascertain the fact and extent of the mistake niade. Certainly a party is not affected with notice of a fact so obscure ; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>see Rhode v. Neff, 1 Woodw. 477. -Again, the circumstance that the borough supervisor, in attempting partly to carry out the opening order issued to him from the Q. S., continued the error made in the original marking of the lines of the street is incapable of concluding the plaintiff, when there is nothing to show that the latter was in any way directly and personally concerned in the matter. So far as the right of the borough or its officers subsequently to change the location of the street to its correct lines is concerned, and therefore as regards the rights of property holders who have built upon their properties fronting on the street according to the lines upon which it was there actually opened, it may be that the borough is concluded by what has been done ; nor might the correctness of the location of the street be a legitimate subject of inquiry in case of an obstruction of any portion of it as opened to the public use; see Holden v. Cole, 1 Pa. 303 ; McMurtrie v. Stewart, 21 Pa. 322; Furniss v. Furniss, 29 Pa. 15; Clark v. Com., 33 Pa. 112; Van Buskirk v. Dawley, 91 Pa. 423; Com. v. Dicken, 145 Pa. 453; Hancock v. Wyoming Boro., 148 Pa. 635; Brewer v. Sullivan Co., 199 Pa. 594, 596. But when it comes to the opening of a street to its full width from curb to curb, which has not been theretofore so opened, by requiring a property holder to curb along vacant lots belonging to him and fronting upon the street, it seems very clear that the line of the street there controlling as to both parties is the lawfully established line, not another line not as yet actually existing, but indicated by what may have been previously done accidentally or mistakenly. If it is deemed necessary by the borough authorities, either to relocate the street upon the lines originally contemplated, -or to adapt its legal lines to its actual location, there seems to be but one method of so doing: viz. by ordinance duly passed, upon which proceedings may be based for the purpose of compensating, in the one case the property holders misled by the erroneous location, or in the other the property holders from whom additional land will have to be taken. Even the Act of May 22, 1883,. P. L. 39, would not seem to furnish a method of accomplishing the purpose, in so far as it involves the pushing of the curb line farther on to the property of plaintiff: Camp v. Port Allegheny Boro., 1 Pa. Dist. Rep. 328. But one thing is sure, that in no event can the change be made by mere resolution of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>council: Gilmore v. Connellsville Boro., 15 W. N. C. 342. Hence no effect can be given in this case to either the resolution of September 10, 1897 (see findings, No. 9), nor that of April 6, 1900 (see findings, No. 11), in so far as any change of actual or legal location may have been involved in the one or the other. The lawful lines of Noble street must be understood to be those established by the ordinance of July 13, 1885. The rights of the parties in this suit must be tested by reference to them. This is all the more manifest when it is remembered that sec. 3, cl. vii., Act of April 3, 1851, P. L. 320, 1 Purd. Dig. 247, pi. 158, makes it the duty of the borough to prepare and keep for public inspection, \u201c a draft or plan of the roads, streets, lanes, alleys and courts opened or laid out, with every explanation necessary to a full understanding of the same; \u201d that the defendant borough did have prepared and since the beginning of 1898 kept in its council room (which is perhaps not a strict, but doubtless for present purposes a sufficient, compliance with the statutory requirement) such a draft or plan* namely, the Sander survey (see findings, No. 9) ; that in 1897, at the council\u2019s direction the engineer then preparing it'furnished to plaintiff the line upon which the houses he was about to build and did build were to be and were placed; and that this building line, as well as that indicated by the Sander survey, thereafter approved and hung up for the inspection of the public, coincides with the plaintiff\u2019s present contention and is inconsistent with that of the borough.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-3\">It is urged, however, on behalf of the latter, that this is not a case for equitable relief; that the threatened action of the borough, if unlawful, will constitute asimple trespass ; and that for its redress the plaintiff has an adequate legal remedy. It is impossible to concede this proposition. The borough purposes not only to encroach upon plaintiff\u2019s land, but to subject him to litigation for the recovery of the cost of setting curbs. In no form of action at law could he be compensated for the entire injury thus likely to be sustained by him, consisting in the deprivation of his land,' the encumbrance of his remaining property by lien and the expense of defending against the borough\u2019s claim for- reimbursement, etc. The decision in Gilmore V. Connellsville, supra, relied on by defendant, is not in this particular in point./ A question there arose, as-also in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Camp v. Port Allegheny, supra, whether the <em>wrong </em>done or threatened to plaintiff by an unlawful taking of or attempt to take his property could be redressed or restrained by the court of Q. S. under sec. 22, act 1851, and its supplement of May 22, 1883; and it was held that it could not. .On the other hand, it is clear under Boro, of Verona\u2019s App., 108 Pa. 83, Dorrance v. Dorranceton Boro., 181 Pa. 164, and similar cases, that where a borough attempts to proceed in the locating, opening or widening of a street without having secured to itself the necessary authority to do so, under void municipal legislation, or contrary to law, it may at the suit of a property holder likely to be injured thereby be restrained in equity. But it must not be forgotten that in equity a decree is never a matter of right, but of grace, resting in the sound discretion of the chancellor in view of the whole situation: Penna. R. R. Co. v. Ry. Co., 184 Pa. 227, 237. Nor will he, in granting, withholding or formulating a decree, overlook the rights and interests of the public in the subject-matter and results thereof; see R. R. Co. v. Lippincott, 86 Pa. 468, 481; Heilman v. Ry. Co., 175 Pa. 188, <em>199; </em>or the injury consequent upon it to third parties necessarily affected over whom the plaintiff has no superior equities; see Maxon v. Berkeley, etc., Soc., 59 L. J. Ch. 524. It is manifest that a decree for a permanent absolute injunction forbidding the borough of Kutztown forever to take the two feet of plaintiff\u2019s property here in dispute and for a return to the Fisher lines might result in extreme inconvenience to the borough, to the public, and to other property holders upon Noble street. It may be that the street ought speedily or at some future time to be opened to the full width of fifty-four feet, and that it would involve a serious disarrangement of the plan upon which the borough is presently laid out and building' up, as well as a much heavier expense to it and a far greater hardship upon other property holders, to adhere, in so doing, to the Fisher lines, than to move the center line closer to plaintiff\u2019s property. The power of the borough by proper legislation and proceedings to make such a change and to appropriate as much of plaintiff\u2019s property as shall be needful to carry it out, is undoubted. The plaintiff\u2019s right is to insist upon a legal exercise of that power and upon just compensation. A decree such as is prayed for in his bill would go beyond his rights and the reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>necessities of the case. Both will be fully served by enjoining the borough from proceeding witli its declared purpose until by due and lawful legislation the location of Noble street as established by the ordinance of July 13,1885, shall have been changed and the borough have become entitled to appropriate the land in dispute as part of said <em>street. </em>Such a decree will conform to that entered by the Supreme Court in Boro, of Verona\u2019s App., 108 Pa. 83, and will protect the rights of all concerned with a minimum of inconvenience to each.' The costs, of course, will have to fall on defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-4\">CONCLUSION'S OF.

And in view of the very thorough and able manner in which he has considered the whole ease, it is doubtful if anything profitable can be added in support of his decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">The borough of Kutztown was duly incorporated and made subject to the provisions of the general borough law of April 3, 1851, P. L. 320 and its supplements.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">The plaintiff is a resident of said borough and the owner of two two-story brick houses and a tract of land consisting of building lots, fronting for a distance of about 570 feet upon the eastern side of Noble street in said borough. This street was originally laid out according to what is known as the \u201c Fisher plan,\u201d which was adopted in 1859. The center line of the street was fixed at its intersection with Sander alley, by a stone known as the <em>\u201c </em>Fisher stone,\u201d and at the southern limits of the borough by a hole drilled in a rock, and so described on the plan. The street was originally laid out and opened fifty feet wide. By ordinance of July 3, 1885, it was ordained, \u201c that that part of Noble Street. ... be widened and laid out to the width of fifty-four feet as follows, to wit: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Beginning at a corner in the center of Sander alley marked by a planted stone, so called the \u201c Fisher stone,\u201dat said street and running thence by lots lying on the east side of said street. . . . and lots lying on west side. . . . south, 22\u00b0 east, 2,106.36 feet to a point in the center of a public road running along the southern limits of said borough of Kutztown.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-3\">The whole contention in this case arises over the question of the true interpretation of this ordinance. The plaintiff contending that it did not change the original center line of Noble street, as it was fixed when the street was first laid out and opened. On the other hand, the representatives of the borough contend that notwithstanding the commencement of the center line of the street at the original stone, yet the effect of the ordinance was to establish the center line easterly from the original location so that in front of the plaintiff\u2019s premises, the easterly line of the street, when opened in pursuance of said ordinance, would encroach upon the plaintiff\u2019s premises nearly two feet, and would pass through his brick buildings about that distance from their fronts.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">The learned court upon elaborate findings of fact (which are not excepted to) found as a matter of law and fact that the center line of said street, as established by the ordinance of July 3, 1885, was precisely the same as it had been from the establishment of the street. In other words, that the effect of the ordinance was simply to widen the street to fifty-four feet by taking two feet from the lots on both sides of the street. That is, measuring twenty-seven feet from the Fisher line, east and west. If the line is to be established as contended for by the Borough, the front of plaintiff\u2019s brick buildings will be nearly two feet in the street. But if the center line of the street is maintained as it always has been, then the plaintiff\u2019s brick houses are practically on the line of the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">After this ordinance of July 3,1885 went into effect, viewers were appointed to view a.nd assess the damages caused by the widening of the street. The petition by the borough for the appointment of these viewers, among other things, contained the following: \u201c That public necessity and convenience requires that the said street be widened and laid out to public use to the width of fifty-four feet.\u201d The viewers acted and made their report and awarded no damages to the plaintiff. <em>We </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>think the language above quoted and the action of the viewer furnished very strong evidence that the borough, or its representatives, at that time, did not construe the ordinance as changing the center line of Noble street, because it is not reasonable to suppose that no damages would have been awarded to the plaintiff, if it was understood that two feet in depth of the front of his buildings was to be cut off by the street line.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">On September 10, 1897, the borough council, by resolution, directed an engineer, Charles F. Sander, to prepare a map of the borough, and on February 17, 1898, the council, by resolution, approved the map by that time prepared by Sander. This map was thereafter kept hanging for public inspection in the council room. Upon this survey the center line of Noble street was made to conform to the original line, the Fisher plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">In 1897 when plaintiff was about to build the two brick houses referred to, he applied to the borough council for the proper building line, and Sander was instructed by the council to give him the line; and Sander thereupon gave the plaintiff the building line, in accordance with the Sander survey which he was then preparing. And the houses were placed accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The above circumstances furnish very strong evidence that the present contention of the borough, that the ordinance of 1885 changed the center line of Noble street, is an afterthought. At best the said ordinance is not clear,' as is shown by its reading and by the different views taken as to its effect. We quite agree with the learned court that the borough has power to change the center line of the street. But when that is done it should be by an ordinance which is clear and not susceptible of reasonable doubt as to its meaning. If this street is to be so changed that it will encroach upon the buildings of property owners along the respective sides, they will clearly be entitled to damages and, therefore, it is necessary that tho ordinance should be so clear and precise that all interested parties will have notice, and that the lines of the street can be accurately fixed and the damages ascertained and assessed with reasonable certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">It is earnestly contended by the learned counsel for appellant, that a line run from the \u201c Fisher stone \u201d south 22\u00b0 east, 2,106,86 feet to a point in the center of a public road <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>running along the southern limits of the borough, places this point about three feet east of the hole drilled in the rook as originally fixing the center line of Noble street. The learned court below did not regard the variation as of much importance. In this view we concur. It is not at all peculiar that a surveyor running this line in 1885 might, by carelessness, imperfect instruments, the variation of the needle or by all of these things combined, end his line three feet east of the original hole in the rock. The fact that he fixed no other monument but simply ended at a point, in our opinion, furnishes strong evidence that he ended his line at the said hole, or so near thereto that he deemed it unimportant and, therefore, did not fix any other monument upon the ground. This view is strengthened by the fact that the other end of the line was not changed at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\">But it is unnecessary to further discuss the questions raised, as we are entirely satisfied with the decree of the court below, and the reasons of the learned judge in support thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">The assignments of error are all dismissed and the decree is affirmed; and it is further ordered that the appellant pay the cost of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Porter and Henderson, JJ., dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
