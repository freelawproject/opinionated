J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_P\">This case concerns the proper procedure for a trial court to employ in deciding a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction when jurisdictional facts are disputed by the parties. This interlocutory appeal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> stems from the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss, on the basis of sovereign immunity, a putative class action brought by the plaintiffs, four state employees,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to recover damages from the defendant, the state of Connecticut, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-51q.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The state claims that the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>improperly denied its motion to dismiss because the actions challenged by the plaintiffs, as a matter of law, do not fall within the scope of the waiver of sovereign immunity conferred by that statute.* *<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The state argues specifically that public documents it submitted in conjunction with its motion to dismiss established unequivocally that the plaintiffs were not \u201cdiscipline [d]\u201d or \u201cdischarge[dj\u201d as contemplated by \u00a7 31-5lq, but rather, collectively were laid off in response to economic pressures, a policy decision it claims is exempted from the purview of the statute. Because we conclude that, at this stage of the proceedings, an unresolved factual dispute exists that renders consideration of the state\u2019s legal argument premature, we dismiss the appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The record reveals the following procedural history. The plaintiffs commenced this action on December 19, 2005. In their complaint, they alleged that they, along with 2800 other unionized state employees, were terminated from their employment with the state in January, 2003, because of their union membership and activities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>and their exercise of their state and federal constitutional rights, namely, freedom of speech and freedom of association. Specifically, they averred that: their union, Connecticut State Employees Association, and twelve other unions that together comprised the State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition, were parties to various collective bargaining agreements with the state; in and after November, 2002, the state, through members of its executive branch, had sought changes to those agreements that would favor the state, particularly, concessions of existing union member rights that the unions, pursuant to statute,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> were not obligated to forfeit; more severe concessions were demanded from unionized employees than from nonunionized employees, particularly as to health and pension benefits; the state threatened to terminate the employment of union members if the sought concessions were not made; the state followed through on that threat and terminated 2800 unionized state employees, including the plaintiffs, when those concessions were not made; only unionized employees were targeted for termination; such termination was in response to the refusal of the plaintiffs and their unions to support then Governor John Rowland (governor) in his bid for reelection; the terminations were motivated by \u201canti-union animus and in retaliation for the unions\u2019 and union members\u2019 exercise of their [constitutional] rights\u201d of freedom of speech and freedom of association, specifically, their participation in and support of union activities and their choice of political candidates. The plaintiffs alleged that, because of the foregoing actions of the state, they had suffered lost earnings and emotional distress and were entitled to seek relief pursuant to \u00a7 31-51q.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">On July 19, 2006, the state filed a motion to dismiss the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 10-30 and 10-31. The state argued that, even if an action against it was authorized by \u00a7 31-51q, the circumstances under which such an action could be brought were limited and, on the facts of this case, not present. Specifically, the state claimed, \u201cthe conduct about which [the] plaintiffs complain \u2014 a policy decision to eliminate 2800 state jobs through layoffs in the midst of a massive financial crisis \u2014 is well beyond the scope of \u00a7 31-51q because the implementation of this policy decision was not a \u2018discharge\u2019 or \u2018discipline\u2019 as [contemplated by] the statute . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">In support of its motion, the state did not submit to the trial court any affidavits<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or other evidence directly pertaining to the termination of the plaintiffs\u2019 employment, but instead requested that the trial court take judicial notice of facts allegedly established by certain publicly available documents. Those documents included: the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement; an undated report prepared for the legislature by its office of fiscal analysis regarding revisions made to the original 2001-2003 biennial state budget in response to a deficit that had arisen; an April 1, 2003 letter to the governor from Nancy Wyman, the state comptroller (comptroller);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the governor\u2019s \u201cBalanced Budget Plan,\u201d dated December 6, 2002, and selected portions of public acts passed during the 2003 legislative sessions to address the budget deficit.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> According to the state, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>foregoing documents demonstrated conclusively that the termination of the plaintiffs\u2019 employment was a policy decision made by the governor in response to budgetary pressures and, accordingly, constituted a mass layoff,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which is not actionable under \u00a7 31-51q.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The trial court denied the state\u2019s motion to dismiss. The court did not address directly the state\u2019s legal argument that a mass layoff cannot constitute a violation of \u00a7 31-51q. Instead, the court noted that there was a factual dispute as to the reason for the termination of the plaintiffs\u2019 employment that could not properly be resolved on a motion to dismiss, and that in deciding such a motion, it was obligated to view the allegations of the complaint most favorably to the plaintiffs. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The court stated: \u201cThe plaintiffs have alleged that they and other union members were terminated because of their union status; the state argues that those state employees were laid off due to budgetary considerations. These claims cannot be resolved on a motion to dismiss as the factual dispute \u2014 and there is certainly a factual dispute \u2014 is not before the court on this motion. Rather, the question is whether the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint contains sufficient allegations to fall within the purview of \u00a7 31-Blq; it does, and therefore the motion to dismiss is denied.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">The state argues that the trial court improperly denied its motion to dismiss because the action about which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>the plaintiffs complain \u2014 a mass layoff of 2800 workers due to economic considerations \u2014 as a matter of law does not constitute the impermissible type of discharge or discipline prohibited by \u00a7 31-51q. According to the state, the documents it cited in support of its motion to dismiss established conclusively that the plaintiffs\u2019 loss of employment, contrary to the allegations of the complaint, was part of such a layoff and, therefore, that there was no violation of \u00a7 31-51q that would trigger a waiver of sovereign immunity. The state further claims that the general context surrounding the plaintiffs\u2019 loss of employment demonstrates clearly that the plaintiffs were laid off due to a policy decision of the governor to reduce the size of the state workforce in the face of a fiscal crisis, and such a decision does not amount to discipline or discharge within the meaning of \u00a7 31-51q. We conclude that, because, on the record presented to the trial court, a factual dispute existed over the reason for the plaintiffs\u2019 loss of employment, the trial court properly declined to address the state\u2019s legal argument and denied its motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The applicable legal principles are well established. \u201c[W]e have long recognized the validity of the common-law principle that the state cannot be sued without its consent . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Aiken, </em>278 Conn. 204, 211, 897 A.2d 71 (2006). Nevertheless, a plaintiff may surmount this bar against suit if, inter alia, he can demonstrate that \u201cthe legislature, either expressly or by force of a necessary implication, statutorily waived the state\u2019s sovereign immunity . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 212. Even when there is an express statutory waiver of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>immunity, however, the plaintiffs complaint must allege a claim falling within the scope of that waiver. See <em>Kozlowski v. Commissioner of Transportation, </em>274 Conn. 497, 502, 876 A.2d 1148 (2005); see also <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Peabody, N.E., Inc., </em>239 Conn. 93, 101-102, 680 A.2d 1321 (1996) (\u201c[w]hen the state waives . . . immunity by statute ... a party attempting to sue under the legislative exception must come clearly within its provisions\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Lack of a statutory waiver of immunity is a jurisdictional defect properly raised by a motion to dismiss. <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>University of Connecticut Health Center, </em>290 Conn. 245, 252, 963 A.2d 1 (2009); see also Practice Book \u00a7 10-31 (a) (1). \u201cA motion to dismiss . . . properly attacks the jurisdiction of the court, essentially asserting that the plaintiff cannot as a matter of law and fact state a cause of action that should be heard by the court. ... A motion to dismiss tests, inter alia, whether, on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction. . . . [0]ur review of the court\u2019s ultimate legal conclusion and resulting [determination] of the motion to dismiss will be de novo.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Filippi </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>273 Conn. 1, 8, 866 A.2d 599 (2005). In undertaking this review, we are mindful of the well established notion \u201cthat, in determining whether a court has subject matter jurisdiction, every presumption favoring jurisdiction should be indulged.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Amodio, </em>247 Conn. 724, 728, 724 A.2d 1084 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Trial courts addressing motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 10-31 (a) (1) may encounter different situations, depending on the status of the record in the case. As summarized by a federal court discussing motions brought pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>the analogous federal rule,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201c[l]ack of subject matter jurisdiction may be found in any one of three instances: (1) the complaint alone; (2) the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts evidenced in the record; or (3) the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts plus the court\u2019s resolution of disputed facts.\u201d <em>Ramming </em>v. <em>United States, </em>281 F.3d 158, 161 (5th Cir. 2001). Different rules and procedures will apply, depending on the state of the record at the time the motion is filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">When a trial court decides a jurisdictional question raised by a pretrial motion to dismiss on the basis of the complaint alone, \u201cit must consider the allegations of the complaint in their most favorable light. ... In this regard, a court must take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint, including those facts necessarily implied from the allegations, construing them in a manner most favorable to the pleader.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Filippi </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>supra, 273 Conn. 8; see also <em>Shay </em>v. <em>Rossi, </em>253 Conn. 134, 140, 749 A.2d 1147 (2000), overruled in part by <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Egan, </em>265 Conn. 301, 325, 828 A.2d 549 (2003); see, e.g., <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Peabody, N.E., Inc., </em>supra, 239 Conn. 99-100 (deciding jurisdictional question on pleadings alone).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">In contrast, if the complaint is supplemented by <em>undisputed facts </em>established by affidavits submitted in support of the motion to dismiss; Practice Book \u00a7 10-31 (a);<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> other types of undisputed evidence; see, e.g., <em>Kozlowski </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transportation, </em>supra, 274 Conn. 504 n.7 (photographs and deposition testimony); <em>Ferreira </em>v. <em>Pringle, </em>255 Conn. 330, 336, 766 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>400 (2001) (lease agreement); <em>Shay </em>v. <em>Rossi, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 139 n.7 (official records of department of children and families); and/or public records of which judicial notice may be taken; <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Aiken, </em>supra, 278 Conn. 217 (state employees\u2019 collective bargaining agreement); the trial court, in determining the jurisdictional issue, may consider these supplementary undisputed facts \u201cand need not conclusively presume the validity of the allegations of the complaint.\u201d <em>Shay </em>v. <em>Rossi, </em>supra, 140. Rather, those allegations are \u201ctempered by the light shed on them by the [supplementary undisputed facts].\u201d Id., 141; see also <em>Barde </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>207 Conn. 59, 62, 539 A.2d 1000 (1988). If affidavits and/or other evidence submitted in support of a defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss conclusively establish that jurisdiction is lacking, and the plaintiff fails to undermine this conclusion with counteraffidavits; see Practice Book \u00a7 10-31 (b); or other evidence, the trial court may dismiss the action without further proceedings. See, e.g., <em>Ferreira </em>v. <em>Pringle, </em>supra, 344-45; <em>Amore </em>v. <em>Frankel, </em>228 Conn. 358, 364, 367-69, 636 A.2d 786 (1994). If, however, the defendant submits either no proof to rebut the plaintiff\u2019s jurisdictional allegations; <em>Connecticut Hospital Assn. </em>v. <em>Pogue, </em>870 F. Sup. 444, 447 (D. Conn. 1994); or only evidence that fails to call those allegations into question; <em>Ostow &amp; Jacobs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Morgan-Jones, Inc., </em>189 F. Sup. 697, 698 (S.D.N.Y. 1960); the plaintiff need not supply counteraffidavits or other evidence to support the complaint, but may rest on the jurisdictional allegations therein. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Finally, where a jurisdictional determination is dependent on the resolution of a critical factual dispute, it cannot be decided on a motion to dismiss in the absence of an evidentiary hearing to establish jurisdictional facts. <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>H.N.S. Management Co., </em>272 Conn. 81, 92, 861 A.2d 1160 (2004) (\u201c[w]hen issues of fact are necessary to the determination of a court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>jurisdiction . . . due process requires that a trial-like hearing be held, in which an opportunity is provided to present evidence and to cross-examine adverse witnesses\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Schaghti-coke Tribal Nation </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>264 Conn. 829, 833, 826 A.2d 1102 (2003) (same).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Likewise, if the question of jurisdiction is intertwined with the merits of the case, a court cannot resolve the jurisdictional question without a hearing to evaluate those merits.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Lampa-sona </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>209 Conn. 724, 728, 553 A.2d 175 (\u201c[i]n some cases ... it is necessary to examine the facts of the case to determine whether it is within a general class that the court has power to hear\u201d), cert. denied, 492 U.S. 919, 109 S. Ct. 3244, 106 L. Ed. 2d 590 (1989).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> An evidentiary hearing is necessary because \u201ca court cannot make a critical factual [jurisdictional] finding based on memoranda and documents submitted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>parties.\u201d <em>Coughlin </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>61 Conn. App. 310, 315, 763 A.2d 1058 (2001).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Returning to the present matter, we conclude that the trial court properly denied the state\u2019s motion to dismiss because, on the record before the court, an open factual dispute remained as to the motivations underlying the termination of the plaintiffs\u2019 employment.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Because the applicability of the state\u2019s jurisdictional argument turned on a particular resolution of that factual dispute, the argument was raised prematurely. Under the facts of this case, it is likely that a determination of the state\u2019s motivations cannot be made until there is a full trial on the merits of the action. As we previously have noted, \u201cdefendants\u2019 states of mind and motives [are] facts that . . . are not ordinarily subject to determination on the basis of documentary proof alone.\u201d <em>Shay </em>v. <em>Rossi, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Here, the documents submitted by the state in support of its motion to dismiss demonstrate only that there was a fiscal crisis around the time the plaintiffs\u2019 employment was terminated and that some layoffs of state employees had occurred. At best, the documents raise an issue of fact and are not sufficient to refute the well pleaded allegations of the complaint that the termination of the plaintiffs\u2019 employment was threatened and effected in retaliation for their engaging in constitutionally protected activities.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In short, the state, in pressing its motion to dismiss, relied solely on general background information as to the economic climate and budgetary challenges existing in fiscal year 2003, and provided no evidence to contradict specifically the allegations in the complaint supporting jurisdiction. It submitted no affidavits from, for example, individuals directly involved in the decision(s) to terminate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 employment explaining how those decisions were reached, no testimony to link the general budget adjustments suggested by the public documents to the particular loss of employment suffered by the plaintiffs, no employment records for the plaintiffs explaining the reasons for the termination of their employment or any other evidence to controvert the specific allegations of the complaint as to improper retaliatory action.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Furthermore, there is no indication in the record that the state requested a hearing to present more specific, probative evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">In sum, a critical factual dispute remains as to the reason for the termination of the plaintiffs\u2019 employment, and that dispute could not be resolved on the limited record before the trial court. Accordingly, the trial court properly declined to address the state\u2019s jurisdictional argument, because it was based on facts that had not been established, and denied the state\u2019s motion to dismiss. On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that there is no colorable claim of sovereign immunity warranting an interlocutory appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of the state\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b664-6\"> The state appealed from the ruling of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b664-7\"> The plaintiffs, Robert Conboy, David A.

On March 27, 2007, this court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to dismiss without prejudice and ordered the parties to address the jurisdictional issue in their appellate briefs.

As previously noted, the state has abandoned any challenge to this preliminary determination of the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b669-7\"> As we explain herein, to the extent the trial court reasoned that a factual dispute <em>never </em>may be resolved on a motion to dismiss, the court was mistaken.

See <em>Knipple </em>v. <em>Viking Communications, Ltd., </em>236 Conn. 602, 608, 674 A.2d 426 (1996); <em>Pellegrino </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>193 Conn. 670, 672 n.4, 480 A.2d 476, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 875, 105 S.

Moreover, it is clear from the language of \u00a7 31-51q that an employer\u2019s improper motive is the sine qua non of a claim under that section. See also <em>D\u2019Angelo </em>v. <em>McGoldrick, </em>239 Conn. 356, 360-61, 685 A.2d 319 (1996) (to prevail under \u00a7 31-51q, plaintiff must show causal connection between discipline or discharge and exercise of constitutional rights).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b675-6\"> Specifically, the report from the office of fiscal analysis discusses the deficit and legislative revisions to the 2001-2003 budget. It includes a section captioned, \u201cThe Governor\u2019s Proposed Mid-term Budget Adjustments for [Fiscal Year 2003],\u201d but that section does not mention specifically any layoffs of state employees and does not otherwise allude to the plaintiffs. The April 1, 2003 letter from the comptroller refers to her September 3, 2002 communication to the governor reporting that there was a budget deficit in excess of 1 percent, which required the governor to submit a deficit mitigation plan. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-85 (b) (2). The letter notes the governor\u2019s \u201cproposed elimination of funding for unsettled labor contracts,\u201d that is \u201cstill under consideration,\u201d but does not discuss layoffs particularly or mention that the termination of the plaintiffs\u2019 employment already had occurred in conjunction with the governor\u2019s proposal. The governor\u2019s deficit mitigation plan, dated December 6, 2002, consists of a list of line item spending reductions and revenue increases, but does not discuss explicitly impending layoffs of any state employees, particularly the plaintiffs. The public acts cited by the state made modifications to the fiscal year 2003 budget and, in provisions pertaining to an early retirement incentive program and associated labor force refills, made general references to state employees who were \u201claid off\u201d between November 1,2002, and June 30,2003. Even assuming these general references are in regard to the termination of the plaintiffs\u2019 employment, we disagree with the state that the legislature\u2019s after the fact characterization of the terminations and provision of beneficial measures favoring laid off employees constitute conclusive evidence of the reasoning underlying decisions previously made by executive branch officials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b676-13\"> Because the state failed to submit evidence to rebut the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of retaliatory termination and instead offered only general background information, the plaintiffs were not obligated to respond, but could rest on the allegations of their complaint.
