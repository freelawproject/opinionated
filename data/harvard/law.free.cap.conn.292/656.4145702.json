Patterson, 276 Conn. 452, 886 A.2d 777 (2005), with respect to one of the state\u2019s key witnesses; (3) instructed the jury about the retreat doctrine; and (4) failed to instruct the jury, sua sponte, on the doctrine of defense of premises. We disagree with these claims and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The record reveals the following facts, which the jury reasonably could have found, and procedural history. Shortly after midnight on November 18, 2003, Tameika Moore went to visit a friend who lived in an apartment at 784-786 Capitol Avenue in Hartford. When she arrived at the apartment, Moore was surprised to find the victim, nineteen year old Shomari Greene, there visiting that same friend. Moore asked the victim to leave and proceeded to escort him down the stairs and out of the building. While passing through the first floor hallway of the building, Moore and the victim encountered Lawanne Harris (Lawanne), the defendant\u2019s girlfriend, who lived in an apartment off that hallway with the defendant, her mother, Yolanda Harris (Yolanda), and her four year old sister, Destiny. The victim and Lawanne argued in the hallway for approximately thirty minutes, and the defendant and Yolanda subsequently joined in the altercation after Lawanne summoned them to tell them about a person who was \u201cdisrespecting\u201d her. Thereafter, the defendant and the victim proceeded to threaten each other, with the victim, who was visibly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>intoxicated,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> stating that he had \u201cpeople, too\u201d and would come back to \u201cshoot up the place.\u201d The defendant then pointed a silver revolver at the victim and pulled the trigger, but the gun failed to fire. Moore and the victim then left the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Shortly thereafter, however, the victim walked back to the apartment building, and punched a hole in the glass adjacent to the building\u2019s front door in an attempt to open that door from the inside, because it had locked automatically behind him. After the victim reentered the front hallway, the defendant then shot the victim in the face with the revolver,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> causing his death.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant then fled from the scene by jumping out of the kitchen window of his apartment into the alley between buildings, pausing in the process to point his gun at Maria Ayala, a neighbor who had heard the initial altercation from her apartment, and then had heard the gunshot after leaving her apartment and seeing the victim reenter the building.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Thereafter, the state charged the defendant with murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>defendant elected a jury trial, and a jury was selected before the trial court, <em>Espinosa, J. </em>The case was then tried to the jury before the trial court, <em>Mullarkey, J. </em>The jury rejected the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense and returned a verdict finding him not guilty of murder, but guilty of the lesser included offense of intentional manslaughter with a firearm in violation of \u00a7 53a-55a (a). Judge Mullarkey then rendered a judgment of conviction in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict and sentenced the defendant to thirty-two years imprisonment. This appeal followed. See footnote 1 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly: (1) limited his voir dire questioning of the prospective jurors about whether they could follow the court\u2019s instructions regarding self-defense; (2) failed to give an instruction pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>supra, 276 Conn. 452, with respect to Moore\u2019s credibility; (3) instructed the jury about the retreat doctrine; and (4) failed to instruct the jury, sua sponte, on the doctrine of defense of premises. We address each claim in turn, and set forth additional facts and procedural history where necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The defendant first claims that Judge Espinosa improperly precluded him from questioning the venire-persons about specific defenses during voir dire, and then further erred when she subsequently modified that ruling to permit him to ask them only whether it is ever justifiable to take a life. The defendant contends that this restriction was harmful to him because he needed to ensure \u201cthat the jurors who sat on the case were not automatically prejudiced against [his] defense.\u201d The defendant argues that the venirepersons\u2019 answers to the question asking whether it is ever justifiable to take a life demonstrated that the permissibility of taking another\u2019s life is a controversial topic and that \u201cthere is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>a strong likelihood that there were jurors on the final jury who would <em>never </em>follow the court\u2019s instructions on justification, and thus were automatically biased against [him].\u201d (Emphasis in original.) In response, the state contends that the defendant\u2019s claim is unpreserved for appellate review because he never objected to any ruling made by the trial court with respect to the scope of voir dire and, indeed, \u201ceagerly adopted the court\u2019s suggestion for future questioning.\u201d Alternatively, the state argues that the trial court did not abuse its discretion because the questions that it had permitted enabled the defendant to uncover any relevant prejudices that the prospective jurors may have harbored, and also complied with the well established restriction on voir dire questions that touch on the specific facts of cases. We agree with the state and conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by permitting the defendant to ask the venirepersons whether it was ever permissible to take a life, rather than permitting more specific questions about self-defense.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">The record reveals the following additional facts and procedural history. On the second day of jury selection, while questioning venireperson C.L.,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> counsel for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>defendant asked: \u201cIf Her Honor gives you an instruction on a defense to murder could you follow an instruction on defense for murder?\u201d The trial court and the prosecutor did not interject at this time. After C.L. was accepted as a juror, the trial court stated, \u201cI think that I had mentioned at sidebar that we were not going to get into defenses. You asked the juror would he follow an instruction on defense to murder. There are many instructions I\u2019m going to give that might or might not apply to this case. So that\u2019s not an appropriate question.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Counsel for the defendant then advised the court that he had \u201ctried to keep it very generic because . . . the . . . jurors are being questioned as to whether or not just the charge of murder would affect them. And [his] concern is that somebody may say that, no, they\u2019re . . . not concerned about the charge, but they may not accept that there is a defense to murder. And . . . from [his] knowledge of the case [he is] certain that Your Honor will be giving [a] defense charge on murder and so [he] tried to be veiy generic without saying self-defense or anything else.\u201d The trial court then ruled that counsel could \u201cask ... a more general question, such as, <em>do you believe that it\u2019s ever justified to take a life\"-, </em>(emphasis added); and defense counsel then indicated that he would do that in questioning future prospective jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Thereafter, counsel for the defendant asked that question of nearly every remaining venireperson, and each one who was selected as a juror confirmed that there were circumstances under which taking the life of another would be acceptable, some, specifically G.S., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>K.M., C.R., D.A., J.D. and C.D., stating so in more general terms,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and others, specifically D.D., J.W., P.C., R.P., J.J. and S.D., stating specifically that self-defense was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>an acceptable justification for taking a human life.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Those venirepersons who gave contrary answers were excused from service.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>\u201cThe constitution of Connecticut is unique among state constitutions in providing an inviolate right in criminal cases to question each venireperson outside the presence of other members of the venire panel. . . . The purpose of such voir dire is to enable the court to determine whether the venireperson is qualified to serve on the jury and to assist the parties in the informed exercise of peremptory challenges.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>112 Conn. App. 694, 695, 963 A.2d 1099 (discussing Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 19), cert. denied, 291 Conn. 914, 969 A.2d 175 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">\u201cWe have stated that, as a practical matter, the wide range of cases submitted to juries, along with the attendant impossibility of estabhshing a set pattern of voir dire questions, requires that the trial court be vested with broad discretion in determining the extent of the voir dire examination. . . . [I]n exercising its discretion, the court should grant such latitude as is reasonably necessary to accomplish the twofold puipose of voir dire: to permit the trial court to determine whether a prospective juror is qualified to serve, and to aid the parties in exercising their right to peremptory challenges. ... It is well settled that the court\u2019s rulings . . . will not be disturbed unless the court has clearly abused its discretion or it appears that prejudice to one of the parties has resulted. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">\u201c[I]f there is any likelihood that some prejudice is in the juror\u2019s mind which will even subconsciously affect his decision of the case, the party who may be adversely affected should be permitted questions designed to uncover that prejudice. . . . The latitude . . . afforded the parties in order that they may accomplish the purposes of the voir dire [however] is tempered by the rule that [questions addressed to prospective jurors involving assumptions or hypotheses concerning the evidence which may be offered at the trial . . . should be discouraged .... [A] 11 too frequently such inquir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>ies represent a calculated effort on the part of counsel to ascertain before the trial starts what the reaction of the venire [person] will be to certain issues of fact or law or, at least, to implant in his mind a prejudice or prejudgment on those issues. Such an effort transcends the proper limits of the voir dire and represents an abuse of the statutory right of examination.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lugo, </em>266 Conn. 674, 683-84, 835 A.2d 451 (2003); see also General Statutes \u00a7 54-82f;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Practice Book \u00a7 42-12.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Thus, we afford trial courts wide discretion in their supervision of voir dire proceedings \u201cto strike a proper balance between [the] competing considerations\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pollitt, </em>205 Conn. 61, 75, 530 A.2d 155 (1987); but at the same time recognize that, as a practical matter, \u201c[v]oir dire that touches on the facts of the case should be discouraged.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ankerman, </em>81 Conn. App. 503, 510, 840 A.2d 1182, cert. denied, 270 Conn. 901, 853 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>A.2d 520, cert. denied, 543 U.S. 944, 125 S. Ct. 372, 160 L. Ed. 2d 256 (2004); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Lugo, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 690 (concluding that \u201cquestions concerning gangs in general were sufficient to uncover juror bias for or against the Latin Kings [gang] . . . [and] it was reasonable for the trial court to conclude that questions specifically concerning the Latin Kings [gang] would improperly have afforded defense counsel an opportunity to gauge how each prospective juror would view his defense\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pollitt, </em>supra, 75 (\u201cBy prohibiting the voir dire question posed by defense counsel regarding \u2018mistaken identification,\u2019 the [trial] court may properly have endeavored to prevent a prejudicial assumption about the case from infecting the jury. The questions nevertheless permitted by the [trial] court regarding witness credibility, honest mistake, identification and alibi were adequate alternatives for discerning whether prejudice existed in the jurors\u2019 minds on those issues.\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>supra, 112 Conn. App. 706-707 (trial court did not abuse discretion by permitting defendant to question prospective jurors about their views on \u201chomosexuality in general,\u201d but not more specifically about whether persons might be struggling with their sexual identities); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sheets, </em>40 Conn. App. 328, 330, 332, 671 A.2d 366 (trial court properly precluded defense counsel from asking venire-persons whether they could treat separately two charged robberies \u201cif they knew that the same clerk was working at the store during both robberies\u201d because \u201cdefense counsel had no right to ask jurors their opinions on an assumed set of facts\u201d), cert. denied, 237 Conn. 903, 674 A.2d 1334 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The defendant claims, however, that whether prospective jurors may be questioned during voir dire about self-defense is an issue of first impression for this court. The defendant further contends that <em>State </em>v. <em>Scuilla, </em>26 Conn. App. 165, 599 A.2d 741 (1991), cert. denied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>221 Conn. 908, 600 A.2d 1362 (1992), which is relied on by the state, is both distinguishable on the ground that self-defense was a collateral issue in that case, and in any event, that <em>Scuilla </em>was wrongly decided. In <em>State </em>v. Scuilla, supra, 172, the defendant claimed, inter alia, that the trial court improperly had precluded his counsel from asking \u201cseveral prospective jurors if they personally believed they would have the right to use self-defense to protect themselves in any instance in which they felt threatened.\u201d The Appellate Court rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court \u201cso severely restricted the scope of questioning as to force [the defendant] to go forward without having been able effectively to ferret out possible prejudices of the jury\u201d; id., 173; because \u201c[prospective jurors told counsel they would be able to evaluate witnesses\u2019 testimony fairly and objectively, and would follow the court\u2019s instructions in accordance with the law, despite any negative feelings they may have had about narcotics or self-defense. Although the court limited inquiries in certain areas, we cannot say it did not allow counsel sufficient latitude to expose possible prejudices.\u201d Id., 173-74. We agree with the state that <em>Scuilla </em>is persuasive authority in support of its argument that the trial court in the present case did not abuse its discretion by precluding defense counsel from asking venirepersons specifically about self-defense.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In our view, the only collateral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>issue described by the trial court in <em>Scuilla </em>was narcotics use by the defendant and the victim therein; that description did not apply to the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense by pulling away from a curb at high speed and entering a highway with the victim hanging from the side of his car. Id., 172. Moreover, the conclusion in <em>Scuilla </em>that the trial court had not abused its discretion therein provides even stronger support for the state in the present case, because the defendant herein had th\u00e9 opportunity to question prospective jurors more specifically regarding whether circumstances existed under which it would be permissible to take a life, and some venirepersons cited self-defense specifically as one such circumstance. See footnotes 10 and 11 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Although the defendant observes correctly that self-defense was a critically important issue in the present case, we conclude that the trial court properly required his counsel to question prospective jurors in more general terms about the permissibility of taking the life of another, rather than permitting counsel to ask questions targeted to self-defense specifically. Indeed, the answers of the selected jurors reveal that the trial court\u2019s ruling struck the proper balance between permitting the defendant to consider prospective jurors\u2019 prejudices, while not delving specifically into the facts of the present case, as no juror who responded negatively to the question about whether it is permissible to take a life was selected for service.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by restricting appropriately the defendant\u2019s voir dire questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">The defendant next claims that Judge Mullarkey improperly failed to give a jailhouse informant credibility instruction pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>supra, 276 Conn. 452, with respect to Moore\u2019s testimony. Specifically, the defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s failure to give a <em>Patterson </em>instruction constituted plain error requiring reversal because Moore\u2019s testimony was critical to the state\u2019s case and she had agreed to testify only after the prosecutor had promised to try to get her released on bond from her incarceration on charges of violation of probation. In response, the state argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>that this unpreserved claim does not warrant plain error reversal because the lack of <em>a, Patterson </em>instruction did not undermine the fairness and integrity of the proceedings. The state also contends that the defendant was not entitled to a <em>Patterson </em>instruction because, although Moore was a witness who had been incarcerated, she nevertheless was not a jailhouse informant because she did not testify regarding an incriminating statement made by the defendant while they were imprisoned together. Finally, the state claims that, even if the failure to give a <em>Patterson </em>instruction was improper, it was rendered harmless by Moore\u2019s testimony about her interactions with the prosecutor, the trial court\u2019s general credibility instructions, and other witnesses\u2019 even more damaging testimony. We agree with the state that the trial court\u2019s failure to give a <em>Patterson </em>instruction in the present case was not plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The record reveals the following additional relevant facts and procedural history. At the conclusion of his direct examination of Moore, who had accompanied the victim at the time of his altercation with the defendant, the prosecutor questioned Moore about her criminal history. She testified that she was incarcerated at the time of trial, following an arrest for violation of probation, with two pending cases for criminal trespass and possession of marijuana with intent to sell. Moore testified that the prosecutor in the present case had told her that he would \u201cdo [his] best\u201d to have her released on bond. Moore then testified that no other promises had been made to her with respect to her testimony in the present case. The defendant did not cross-examine Moore on this topic.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>supra, 276 Conn. 465, the defendant\u2019s cell mate from his pretrial detention testified concerning confidential incriminating conversations that he had engaged in with the defendant. The cell mate had agreed to testify only after receiving benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>in return for his cooperation, including a two year reduction in the sentence he was serving for robbery, \u201ca favorable recommendation with respect to the disposition of his pending narcotics charges, assistance in obtaining early parole, a transfer to another prison and restoration of his visitation privileges.\u201d Id. On appeal, we stated that there are two exceptions to the general rule that \u201ca [criminal] defendant is not entitled to an instruction singling out any of the state\u2019s witnesses and highlighting his or her possible motive for testifying falsely . . . [namely] the complaining witness exception and the accomplice exception.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 467. We then observed that \u201can informant who has been promised a benefit by the state in return for his or her testimony has a powerful incentive, fueled by self-interest, to implicate falsely the accused. Consequently, the testimony of such an informant, like that of an accomplice, is inevitably suspect.\u201d Id., 469. Accordingly, we adopted a third exception to the general rule and concluded that the defendant should have received, upon his request, a cautionary instruction about the credibility of a jailhouse informant \u201c[b]ecause the testimony of an informant who expects to receive a benefit from the state in exchange for his or her cooperation is no less suspect than the testimony of an accomplice who expects leniency from the state . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Id., 470; see also <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>292 Conn. 558, 569, 973 A.2d 1254 (2009) (extending <em>Patterson </em>instruction to testimony of all jailhouse informants, even without \u201cexpress promise of a benefit\u201d from government).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Because a <em>Patterson </em>instruction is not a rule of constitutional dimension; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>supra, 276 Conn. 47.1; and because the defendant failed to preserve this claim for appeal, he contends that the trial court\u2019s failure to give a <em>Patterson </em>instruction with respect to Moore\u2019s testimony was plain error requiring reversal. The plain error doctrine, which is \u201ccodified at Practice Book \u00a7'60-5, is an extraordinary remedy used by appellate coruts to rectify errors committed at trial that, although unpreserved, are of such monumental proportion that they threaten to erode our system of justice and work a serious and manifest injustice on the aggrieved party. [T]he plain error doctrine ... is not ... a rule of reviewability. It is a rule of reversibility. That is, it is a doctrine that this corut invokes in order to rectify a trial court ruling that, although either not properly preserved or never raised at all in the trial court, nonetheless requires reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment, for reasons of policy. ... In addition, the plain error doctrine is reserved for truly extraordinary situations [in which] the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings. . . . Plain error is a doctrine that should be invoked sparingly. . . . Implicit in this very demanding standard is the notion . . . that invocation of the plain error doctrine is reserved for occasions requiring the reversal of the judgment under review. . . . [Thus, an appellant] cannot prevail under [the plain error doctrine] . . . unless he demonstrates that the claimed error is both so clear and so harmful that a failure to reverse the judgment would result in manifest injustice.\u201d (Citations omitted; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>290 Conn. 278, 289, 963 A.2d 11 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">We conclude that the trial court\u2019s failure to give a <em>Patterson </em>instruction was not plain error. Specifically, we note that the Appellate Court recently has held that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s failure to give, sua sponte, a jailhouse informant instruction does not present the type of extraordinary situation that warrants plain error review\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Joseph, </em>110 Conn. App. 454, 463, 955 A.2d 124, cert. denied, 289 Conn. 945, 959 A.2d 1010 (2008); particularly when the court has instructed the jury generally on the credibility of witnesses. See id.; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Damato, </em>105 Conn. App. 335, 351-52, 937 A.2d 1232, cert. denied, 286 Conn. 920, 949 A.2d 481 (2008). Thus, we find significant that direct examination of Moore rendered the jury well aware of her criminal history, as well as the prosecutor\u2019s offer to attempt to help obtain release on bond.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Indeed, the defendant commented on Moore\u2019s agenda in discussing the inconsistencies between the various witnesses\u2019 testimony during his closing argument to the jury, which was followed shortly thereafter by instructions wherein the trial court discussed the jury\u2019s role in determining the witnesses\u2019 credibility generally, and directed the jury to consider any personal interest or bias a witness might have with respect to his or her testimony in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>present case.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, because the jury was aware of general credibility concerns with respect to Moore\u2019s testimony, as well as her history and the prosecutor\u2019s offer of assistance, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s failure to give, sua sponte, a more specific <em>Patterson </em>instruction was not plain error, the existence of which \u201cis so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>supra, 290 Conn. 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">We now turn to the defendant\u2019s various unpreserved claims with respect to the jury instructions in the present case, for which he seeks review pursuant to <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), and the plain error doctrine. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. Specifically, the defendant argues that the trial court improperly: (1) added an objective component into its charge on the retreat doctrine; (2) failed to integrate the retreat doctrine into its instruction on the defense of others; and (3) failed to instruct the jury, sua sponte, on the doctrine of defense of premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">The record reveals the following additional relevant facts and procedural history with respect to the crafting of the jury instructions in the present case. The defendant did not file any requests to charge, but participated in discussions during the trial with the prosecutor and Judge Mullarkey regarding the content of the instructions that the trial court had proposed.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>request that the defendant made at that time, beyond the court\u2019s proposed charge, was for an instruction on defense of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Thereafter, prior to closing arguments, the trial court summarized on the record the discussions between the parties and the court about the jury instruction that it intended to deliver, including charges on self-defense, defense of others and lesser included offenses.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> At that time, the defendant responded in the negative when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>the court asked whether the parties had any \u201cadditions or subtractions\u201d or corrections to the proposed charge. After the trial court charged the jury following summations, both the defendant and the state confirmed that they had no exceptions to the instruction as given, the relevant specifics of which will be discussed in parts III A 2 and 3 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">At the outset, we consider the reviewability of the defendant\u2019s instructional claims with respect to the retreat doctrine. The defendant acknowledges that he failed to preserve these claims by filing a written request to charge or taking an exception to the instruction as given, but seeks review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40, under which we review claims not preserved at trial only if: \u201c(1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail. The appellate tribunal is free, therefore, to respond to the defendant\u2019s claim by focusing on whichever condition is most relevant in the particular circumstances.\u201d The state does not dispute that the first two prongs of the defendant\u2019s <em>Golding </em>analysis with respect to the retreat claims have been met, namely, both that the record is adequate for review and that an improper charge on the elements of self-defense implicates the defendant\u2019s due process rights and is, therefore, a claim of constitutional magnitude. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Fabricatore, </em>281 Conn. 469, 477, 915 A.2d 872 (2007); <em>State </em>v. <em>Whitford, </em>260 Conn. 610, 621, 799 A.2d 1034 (2002). Rather, the state relies on the line of cases exemplified by <em>State </em>v. <em>Fabricatore, </em>supra, 469, and contends that the defendant cannot prevail under the third prong of <em>Golding </em>because he waived his claim on appeal by expressing his satisfaction with the challenged instruction at trial. We conclude that this claim is reviewable because the defendant, while acquiescing to the charge as given at trial, did not actively induce the trial court to act on the challenged portion of the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Fabricatore, </em>supra, 281 Conn. 481-82, we concluded that a defendant who had sought review of his claim that the trial court improperly had charged the jury about the retreat doctrine could not prevail under the third prong of <em>Golding. </em>In so concluding, we noted that \u201cdefense counsel not only failed to object to the instruction as given or to the state\u2019s original request to charge the jury with the duty to retreat, but clearly expressed his satisfaction with that instruction, and in fact <em>subsequently argued that the instruction as given was proper. </em>Indeed, defense counsel himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>addressed the duty to retreat in his own summation. Thus, the defendant accepted the duty to retreat theoiy presented by the prosecutor, and openly acquiesced at trial, thereby waiving his right to challenge the instruction on appeal. Under this factual situation, we simply cannot conclude that injustice [has been] done to either party ... or that the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Citing cases wherein the defendant had supplied and advocated at trial for the instructional language that he subsequently challenged on appeal, we emphasized that our conclusion that \u201cunpreserved, waived claims, fail under the third prong of <em>Golding, </em>is consistent with our decisions declining to review claims of induced error . . . [under <em>Golding] </em>because [t]o allow [a] defendant to seek reversal now that his trial strategy has failed would amount to allowing him to induce potentially harmful error, and then ambush the state [and the trial court] with that claim on appeal.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 482; accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Holness, </em>289 Conn. 535, 542-43, 958 A.2d 754 (2008) <em>(Golding </em>review unavailable when \u201cdefense counsel clearly and unequivocally agreed to the limiting instruction that the trial court gave to the jury concerning the statements that the [prosecutor] had attributed to [an unavailable declarant] during cross-examination of the defendant\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>283 Conn. 352, 360-61, 927 A.2d 825 (2007) (defendant could not prevail under third prong of <em>Golding </em>when he affirmatively requested exact lesser included offense instruction challenged on appeal and expressed satisfaction with that charge).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">We conclude that the present case is distinguishable from <em>Fabricatore </em>and <em>Brewer </em>because, although the defendant acquiesced in the charge that the trial court ultimately gave to the jury, he did not supply, or other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>wise advocate for, the retreat doctrine language at issue in this appeal. Put differently, there is no indication that the defendant actively induced the trial court to give the retreat instruction that he now challenges on appeal, which renders this claim reviewable under <em>Golding. </em>See <em>State </em>v. <em>Madigosky, </em>291 Conn. 28, 35 n.7, 966 A.2d 730 (2009) (acquiescence at trial to jury instruction challenged on appeal, without more, does not constitute induced error that would preclude review under Golding). Accordingly, our recent decision in <em>Madigosky </em>requires us to disagree with the state\u2019s argument that the defendant waived his right to <em>Golding </em>review of his instructional claim as it pertains to the retreat doctrine.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Accordingly, we now turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that, in charging the jury, the trial court improperly imposed an objective component on the otherwise subjective retreat doctrine, which, according to the defendant, was harmful because \u201cthe present case hinged substantially on whether the defendant failed to retreat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>within the meaning of the self-defense statute . . . .\u201d In response, the state contends that a review of the overall charge makes clear that the jury here was repeatedly apprised \u201cof the subjective nature of the retreat doctrine.\u201d The state also contends that any impropriety was harmless error because retreat was not a significant issue at trial. We agree with the state and conclude that the challenged instructions were an appropriate statement of the subjective nature of the retreat doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">We note briefly that, after explaining the general principles governing self-defense, namely, the subjective-objective test requiring that the state disprove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant subjectively held an objectively reasonable belief that the use of deadly force was necessary to defend himself or others; see, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 (a);<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> the trial court then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>instructed the jury: \u201cThe state can also disprove the claim of self-defense through the exception to the self-defense of retreat. Our law provides that a person is not justified in using deadly physical force upon another person if he knows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety by retreating. The statute requires both that the retreat was completely safe and available and that the defendant knew of it. Complete safety without any injury whatsoever to him or other people.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">\u201cSelf-defense focuses on the person claiming self-defense. <em>It focuses on what he reasonably believed under the circumstances </em>and presents a question of fact as to whether a safe retreat was available and whether the defendant subjectively knew of it. Retreat is only required where the defendant . . . himself knows that he can avoid the necessity of using deadly physical force with complete safety, did the defendant subjectively know he could retreat with complete safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">\u201cIf you find . . . [that] the state has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that a safe retreat was available and that the defendant knew of it, and you find so unanimously beyond a reasonable doubt, you should reject the self-defense claim. The law stresses that self-defense cannot be retaliatory. It must be defensive and not punitive. So you must ask yourself did the defendant know that he could avoid the use of deadly physical force by retreating safely? If so, and yet he chose to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>pursue the use of deadly physical force, you should reject the self-defense claim.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">\u201c[A] fundamental element of due process of law is the right of a defendant charged with a crime to establish a defense. . . . We previously have held that [t]his fundamental constitutional right includes proper jury instructions on the elements of self-defense so that the jury may ascertain whether the state has met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the assault was not justified. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">\u201cWhere, as here, the challenged jury instructions involve a constitutional right, the applicable standard of review is whether there is a reasonable possibility that the jury was misled in reaching its verdict. . . . In evaluating the particular charges at issue, we must adhere to the well settled rule that a charge to the jury is to be considered in its entirety, read as a whole, and judged by its total effect rather than by its individual component parts. . . . [T]he test of a court\u2019s charge is . . . whether it fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law. ... As long as [the instructions] are correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury ... we will not view [them] as improper.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Whitford, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 617-20; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>231 Conn. 484, 493-94, 651 A.2d 247 (1994) (\u201c[a] charge to the jury is not to be critically dissected for the purpose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statement, but it is to be considered rather as to its probable effect upon the jury in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>guiding them to a correct verdict in the case\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The retreat doctrine is codified at General Statutes (Rev. to 2003) \u00a7 53a-19 (b),<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> which provides in relevant part that \u201ca person is not justified in using deadly physical force upon another person if he knows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety (1) by retreating, except that the actor shall not be required to retreat if he is in his dwelling, as defined in section 53a-100 . . . .\u201d Unlike the self-defense principles set forth in subsection (a) of \u00a7 53a-19, which impose a subjective-objective test; see footnote 23 of this opinion; the duty to retreat set forth in subsection (b) \u201cimposes only a subjective requirement . . . [and] <em>requires both that a retreat in complete safety be available and that the defendant know of it. </em>The self-defense statute ... \u00a7 53a-19 . . . focuses on the person . . . claiming self-defense. It focuses on what <em>he </em>reasonably believes under the circumstances and presents a question of fact [as to whether a safe retreat was available and whether he knew of it]. . . .

Ct. 2113, 158 L. Ed. 2d 722 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Even if we were to assume that the isolated language referring to what the defendant \u201c \u2018reasonably believes under the circumstances\u2019 \u201d is legally incorrect, despite the fact that it comes verbatim from two decisions by this court; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 492; <em>State </em>v. <em>Quintana, </em>209 Conn. 34, 46, 547 A.2d 534 (1988);<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and a widely recognized treatise on jury instructions in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>Connecticut; J. Pellegrino, A Collection of Connecticut Selected Jury Instructions: Criminal (3d Ed. 2001) \u00a7 2.40, p. 115;<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> we conclude that the instructions as a whole did not mislead the jury regarding the subjective nature of the retreat doctrine. Indeed, the very sentence that the defendant complains of emphasizes the entirely subjective nature of the retreat inquiry by stating that it is \u201ca question of fact as to whether a safe retreat was available and whether the defendant <em>subjectively </em>knew of it.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The subsequent sentence in that paragraph emphasizes farther that \u201c[r]etreat is only required where the defendant. . . <em>himself knows </em>that he can avoid the necessity of using deadly physical force with complete safety, did the <em>defendant subjectively know </em>he could retreat with complete safety.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Moreover, the objectionable language was preceded by a paragraph emphasizing that \u201ca person is not justified in using deadly physical force upon another person if <em>he knows </em>that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety by retreating [and that] [t]he statute requires both that the retreat was completely safe and available <em>and that the defendant knew of it.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Finally, a subsequent paragraph made clear the state\u2019s responsibility to prove \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that a safe retreat was available and the defendant knew of it,\u201d and implored the jurors to ask themselves: \u201c[D]id the defendant know that he could avoid the use of deadly physical force by retreating safely?\u201d Thus, we conclude that the jury instruction on the duty to retreat properly reflected the subjective nature of that inquiry.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>3</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly failed to instruct the jury that, \u201cif a third person [that the defendant] was defending was not required to retreat, or could not retreat in complete safety, then [the defendant] was not required to retreat before using deadly force to protect that person.\u201d The defendant emphasizes that, under \u00a7 53a-19 (a), since he steps into the shoes of the persons whom he was defending, namely, Lawanne and Destiny, who were inside the apartment at the time of the shooting, the defendant also had no duty to retreat under \u00a7 53a-19 (b). In response, the state contends that the defendant\u2019s claim is unsupported by the plain language of \u00a7 53a-19 (b), which makes no reference to third persons, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>any impropriety was harmless because retreat was not an issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Although case law suggests, and the defendant contends, that his duty to retreat with respect to defense of third persons requires consideration of the retreat duty of those third persons; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Silveira, </em>198 Conn. 454, 470 n.6, 503 A.2d 599 (1986) (\u201c[a]n interpretation of [\u00a7 53a-19 (b)] requiring a defendant acting in defense of another to retreat, without regard to the ability to retreat of the person defended, would be inconsistent with the general right to defense of others set forth in subsection [a]\u201d); <em>State </em>v. Rodriguez, 47 Conn. App. 91, 96, 702 A.2d 906 (1997) (\u201c[t]he court\u2019s instructions make it clear that a necessary predicate to the defendant\u2019s claim that he, as . . . defender [of a third person], did not have a duty to retreat, is that [the third person] himself did not have a duty to retreat\u201d), cert. denied, 243 Conn. 960, 705 A.2d 552 (1998); we conclude that any omission on this topic was harmless error not requiring reversal under the fourth prong of <em>Golding. </em>As discussed previously; see footnote 28 of this opinion; the critical factual issue in the present case focused on the reasonableness of the defendant\u2019s perception of a threat from the victim or, rather, whether the defendant was motivated to shoot the victim for disrespecting Lawanne. Retreat was not a significant factual issue in this case, and any instructional omission thereon did not operate to mislead the jury. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lemoine, </em>256 Conn. 193, 200, 770 A.2d 491 (2001) (\u201c[b]ecause the state made no claim that the defendant should have retreated . . . the defendant did not suffer constitutional harm by the trial court\u2019s omission of an unnecessary and potentially confusing instruction on the duty to retreat\u201d); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Quintana, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 47-48; <em>State </em>v. <em>Scarpiello, </em>40 Conn. App. 189, 212, 670 A.2d 856, cert. denied, 236 Conn. 921, 674 A.2d 1327 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Finally, we address the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly failed to instruct the jury on defense of premises pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-20.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Although the defendant failed to request this charge at trial, he raises this claim pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40, and contends that the trial court had a duty to instruct the jury, sua sponte, on defense of premises because the victim was a trespasser who had entered the building to commit a crime of violence. Citing, inter alia, <em>State </em>v. <em>Preyer, </em>198 Conn. 190, 199, 502 A.2d 858 (1985), the defendant argues further that his failure to request the defense of premises charge at trial does not preclude review of this claim under <em>Golding </em>because self-defense claims are justification defenses, which relate to the elements of the offense that the state must prove, rather than affirmative defenses for which the defendant bears the burden of proof. In response, the state contends again that the defendant waived review of this claim under <em>Golding </em>by assenting to the instructions given at trial, and relies on a line of Appellate Court cases following <em>Preyer, </em>holding that the trial court does not have a duty to charge the jury on defenses in the absence of a request to charge, regardless of the nature of that defense. We agree with the state and conclude that trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>courts do not have a duty to charge the jury, sua sponte, on defenses, affirmative or nonaffirmative in nature, that are not requested by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">We begin with a review of <em>State </em>v. <em>Preyer, </em>supra, 198 Conn. 195-96, a sexual assault and kidnapping case in which the defendant claimed, and the state conceded, that the trial court improperly had charged the affirmative defense of cohabitation out of the case. The defendant had not, however, filed a proper request to charge or taken an exception to the charge as given. Id., 196. Although this court concluded that the trial court \u201ccommitted plain error by misstating the effect of the governing statutes . . . [thereby] expressly and incorrectly preclud[ing] any jury consideration of this affirmative defense\u201d; id., 198; this court also rejected the defendant\u2019s \u201cmore sweeping claim . . . that a trial court always has an independent obligation, as a matter of law, to charge on any theory of defense for which there is a foundation in the evidence.\u201d Id., 196. This court stated that \u201c[t]here is no basis, in the law of this state, for the defendant\u2019s broad claim that a trial court has an independent obligation to instruct the jury on the affirmative defense of cohabitation if the evidence at trial would suffice to support such a charge. In the absence of a timely request or exception, failure to charge on an affirmative defense is reviewable as an exceptional circumstance within the doctrine of <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), only when the defendant can demonstrate that he \u2018has clearly been deprived of a fundamental constitutional right and a fair trial,\u2019 or under Practice Book \u00a7 [60-5] as plain error. While the constitutional law of due process is implicated by a trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on the essential elements of the offense on which the conviction rests ... we have in the past found no constitutional infirmity in failure to charge on such defenses as entrapment . . . extreme emotional dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>turbance ... or alibi. . . .

Although justification defenses differ from affirmative defenses in that the state, and not the defendant, bears the burden of disproving a justification defense such as self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt, and are of constitutional dimension because they negate an element of the crime charged; see, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 53a-12 (a); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lemoine, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 199; the assertion and proof of the justification defense nevertheless remains the defendant\u2019s responsibility in the first instance. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>264 Conn. 723, 730-31, 826 A.2d 128 (2003) (\u201c[A] defendant has no burden of persuasion for a claim of self-defense; he has only a burden of production. That is, he merely is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>required to introduce sufficient evidence to warrant presenting his claim of self-defense to the jury. . . . Once the defendant has done so, it becomes the state\u2019s burden to disprove the defense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d [Citations omitted.]). It would be inconsistent with this initial burden of production, as well as with the defendant\u2019s right to control the conduct of his own defense; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. Peeler, 265 Conn. 460, 470, 828 A.2d 1216 (2003) (right to counsel of choice \u201cstem[s] largely from an appreciation that a primary purpose of the sixth amendment is to grant a criminal defendant effective control over the conduct of his defense\u201d), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 1029, 124 S.

Thus, the defendant\u2019s compliance with the trial court\u2019s suggestion was not an expression of satisfaction with the trial court\u2019s ruling akin to induced error that would waive a claim on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b682-6\"> To protect the privacy of the venireperson we refer to the individual by initials only.

First, the jury must determine whether, on the basis of all of the evidence presented, the defendant in fact had believed that he had needed to use deadly physical force, as opposed to some lesser degree of force, in order to repel the victim\u2019s alleged attack. . . . The jury\u2019s initial determination, therefore, requires the jury to assess the veracity of witnesses, often including the defendant, and to determine whether the defendant\u2019s account of his belief in the necessity to use deadly force at the time of the confrontation is in fact credible. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">\u201cIf the jury determines that the defendant [did] not [believe] that he . . . needed to employ deadly physical force to repel the victim\u2019s attack, the jury\u2019s inquiry ends, and the defendant\u2019s self-defense claim must fail.

Thus, if a jury determines that the defendant\u2019s honest belief that he had needed to use deadly force, instead of some lesser degree of force, was not a reasonable belief, the defendant is not entitled to the protection of \u00a7 53a-19.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>267 Conn. 363, 373-74, 838 A.2d 186, cert. denied, 541 U.S. 1036, 124 S.

The quotation from <em>Corchado </em>may well have been inartful, because <em>Corchado </em>was not a retreat case under \u00a7 53a-19 (b) but, rather, focused on the inquiries under \u00a7 53a-19 (a) and (c), namely, whether the defendant therein was an initial aggressor, and reasonably believed that the use of deadly force was necessary. <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>supra, 668-69.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b708-4\"> See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>84 Conn.
