The principal issue in this appeal is whether res judicata barred the plaintiffs from bringing an action in the Superior Court for breach of contract and specific performance of the contract after the Probate Court had denied the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for an order for specific performance of the contract. The defendants also challenge the trial court\u2019s conclusions that the action could proceed without the residuary beneficiaries of the decedent\u2019s will, that there was a valid contract of sale, and that the contract could not be avoided under any of the defenses raised. We conclude that, because the Probate Court lacked jurisdiction over the claims brought in the Superior Court, res judicata did not bar the present action. In addition, we conclude that the trial court properly ordered specific performance of the underlying contract. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The record reveals the following procedural history and undisputed facts. On July 16, 2002, the decedent died testate, leaving a will naming the defendants as executors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition to specific devises of personal property to the defendants, the will named as residuary beneficiaries the defendants\u2019 five grandchildren and the Ebenezer Lutheran Church of Willimantic. The decedent\u2019s estate included a parcel of undeveloped land in Hampton (property), which was not specifically devised to any beneficiary. The will expressly authorized the defendants, as executors, to make any division of the estate required therein, to determine what property should be included in each share, and to sell the decedent\u2019s real property without the permission or oversight of the Probate Court or any other court.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">On or about February 24,2004, the plaintiffs met with the defendants to discuss purchasing the property. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>that meeting, the plaintiffs and the defendants completed and signed a real estate purchase agreement form conveying the property from the decedent\u2019s estate to the plaintiffs. As called for in the agreement, the plaintiffs tendered a deposit of $500 by check. The agreement stipulated that a closing on the property would take place on May 24, 2004. Thereafter, some discussions ensued between the parties\u2019 attorneys about the amount of the deposit and the form of the agreement, after which the defendants informed the plaintiffs that they were unwilling to close on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The plaintiffs then filed a petition for an \u201corder of sale of real property\u201d in the Probate Court, seeking to compel the defendants in their capacity as executors to conduct a closing and convey the property. The Probate Court denied the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">The plaintiffs did not appeal from the Probate Court\u2019s judgment, but instead filed a two count complaint in the Superior Court seeking specific performance and damages for breach of contract. The defendants filed an answer denying that they had entered into a contract and advancing numerous special defenses. Thereafter, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that: (1) the Superior Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the plaintiffs were not before it pursuant to an appeal from the Probate Court\u2019s judgment; (2) the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were barred by res judicata in light of the previous Probate Court judgment; (3) the defendants lacked authority to complete the real estate transaction; and (4) the plaintiffs had failed to join the decedent\u2019s residuary beneficiaries as indispensable party defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">The trial court, <em>Martin, J., </em>denied the motion for summary judgment on all grounds. With respect to the defendants\u2019 jurisdictional and res judicata claims, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>court first concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for breach of contract, which sought damages, was a distinct action from the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for specific performance, which sought an equitable remedy. The trial court concluded that res judicata did not bar a Superior Court action on the breach of contract claim because the Probate Court could not award damages. The trial court further concluded that the Probate Court was not a court of competent jurisdiction for the plaintiffs\u2019 specific performance claim because that court has no equitable jurisdiction unless such a claim arises in the context of another matter properly pending before it, which was not so in the present case. The trial court therefore concluded that res judicata did not bar the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for specific performance, and, as a result, the plaintiffs were not required to appeal from the Probate Court judgment in order for the Superior Court to have jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">After a trial to the court, the trial court, <em>Robaina, J., </em>issued a decision dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 count seeking damages for breach of contract because the plaintiffs had offered no evidence as to damages from the alleged breach, but rendering judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on the count for specific performance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addressing the defendants\u2019 res judicata and jurisdictional defenses, Judge Robaina adopted Judge Martin\u2019s decision denying summary judgment as the law of the case. Regarding the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 specific performance count, Judge Robaina found that the agreement between the plaintiffs and the defendants was a valid contract and that specific performance was warranted. In so doing, the trial court rejected the defendants\u2019 special defenses as to whether the action could proceed without the residuary beneficiaries and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>whether the contract otherwise was unenforceable. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">On appeal, the defendants raise legal and factual challenges to the trial court\u2019s judgment that fall into essentially the following three categories. First, they claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the plaintiffs could proceed on their action in light of the res judicata effect of the Probate Court judgment and the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to appeal from that judgment. Second, they claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the absence of the decedent\u2019s residuary beneficiaries did not defeat the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. Third, the defendants claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the contract was enforceable because it improperly found that the agreement: (1) was sufficiently definite and mutually assented to, rather than abandoned by the parties; and (2) was neither the result of mistake nor unconscionable. We disagree and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court. Additional facts will be set forth as needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">The defendants raise a jurisdictional claim, which we typically would address as a threshold matter. See <em>Chapman Lumber, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tager, </em>288 Conn. 69, 85, 952 A.2d 1 (2008). The defendants\u2019 claim that the trial court could exercise jurisdiction only if the plaintiffs had appealed from the Probate Court\u2019s judgment, however, is entirely dependent on their claim that the Probate Court had jurisdiction in the first instance, which forms the basis of their res judicata argument. Therefore, we begin with the defendants\u2019 claim that the trial court improperly determined that the doctrine of res judicata did not bar the plaintiffs from bringing their action in the Superior Court. Specifically, the defendants contend that, because the Probate Court had jurisdiction over the plaintiffs\u2019 initial action for specific performance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>under General Statutes \u00a7 45a-98 (a) (3),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Probate Court\u2019s judgment was conclusive.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>We conclude that the trial court properly entertained the plaintiffs\u2019 action because the Probate Court lacked jurisdiction over the plaintiffs\u2019 action for specific performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>The record reveals the following additional undisputed facts. The plaintiffs\u2019 petition in Probate Court named as respondents the defendants in their capacity as executors of the decedent\u2019s estate. The petition requested that the Probate Court \u201center an order directing the Fiduciaries to conduct a closing of the Real Estate Purchase Contract and to convey the Property as they have agreed to do.\u201d The plaintiffs alleged therein, inter alia, that: the defendants were authorized under the will to sell the decedent\u2019s real property without permission of the Probate Court; the plaintiffs and the defendants had entered into a valid real estate purchase contract; and the defendants neither had conducted a closing nor conveyed the property to the plaintiffs in accordance with their contract. The plaintiffs\u2019 petition did not state a basis on which they claimed the Probate Court could exercise jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">After a hearing, the Probate Court denied the petition, making the following determinations in support of its decision. The court first stated that it \u201chas jurisdiction to approve [the] sale of land in an estate upon petition of executors if it is in the interest of all beneficiaries and is necessary to satisfy claims against the estate.\u201d The court then noted that the plaintiffs were not the executors, and that the defendants as the executors had not petitioned the court for permission to sell the land. Finally, the court found that there was no evidence that the proposed sale was in the best interest of the affected beneficiaries or that the sale of the land was necessary to satisfy claims against the estate. The Probate Court\u2019s decision did not cite to any statutory ground for jurisdiction, or its lack thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">As we previously have noted, Judge Robaina adopted Judge Martin\u2019s decision denying the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment as the law of the case regarding the defendants\u2019 res judicata and jurisdictional defenses. As a general rule, \u201cabsent exceptional circumstances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>a denial of a motion for summary judgment is not appealable where a full trial on the merits produces a verdict against the moving party . . . <em>.\u201d Pelletier v. Sor-doni/Skanska Construction Co., </em>286 Conn. 563, 576, 945 A.2d 388 (2008); id., 577 (reviewing trial court\u2019s denial of summary judgment regarding defendant\u2019s duty of care because trial court decided, as matter of law, issue of defendant\u2019s duty of care prior to trial and no further evidence on issue was presented at trial). We conclude that such circumstances need not exist in the present case because Judge Martin\u2019s decision denying the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment constitutes the law of the case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, our focus in addressing this claim is the propriety of Judge Martin\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Before addressing the merits of the defendants\u2019 claim, we first set forth the proper standard of this court\u2019s review and certain well settled principles guiding our resolution of res judicata claims. Whether the trial court properly applied the doctrine of res judicata to the facts of the case is a question of law meriting plenary review. <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Infinity Ins. Co., </em>282 Conn. 594, 601, 922 A.2d 1073 (2007); <em>Ammirata </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>264 Conn. 737, 744-45, 826 A.2d 170 (2003); <em>Gaynor v. Payne, </em>261 Conn. 585, 595, 804 A.2d 170 (2002). \u201cThe doctrine of res judicata holds that an existing final judgment rendered upon the merits without fraud or collusion, by a court of competent jurisdiction, is conclusive of causes of action and of facts or issues thereby litigated as to the parties and their privies in all other actions in the same or any other judicial tribunal of concurrent jurisdiction. ... If the same cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>action is again sued on, the judgment is a bar with respect to any claims relating to the cause of action which were actually made or which might have been made.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Infinity Ins. Co., </em>supra, 600; see also <em>Gaynor v. Payne, </em>supra, 595-96. In the present case, the sole issue is whether the Probate Court is a court of competent jurisdiction over an action for specific performance of a real estate contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The general parameters of Probate Court jurisdiction are well settled. \u201cThe Probate Court is a court of limited jurisdiction prescribed by statute, and it may exercise only such powers as are necessary to the performance of its duties.\u201d <em>Heussner </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>289 Conn. 795, 802, 961 A.2d 365 (2008); see also <em>Gaynor </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>supra, 261 Conn. 596. A Probate Court may exercise jurisdiction based on statutory authority only when \u201cthe facts and circumstances exist upon which the legislature has conditioned its exercise of power.\u201d <em>Heussner </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>supra, 803. \u201cOrdinarily, therefore, whether a Probate Court has jurisdiction to enter a given order depends upon the interpretation of a statute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Michaela Lee R., </em>253 Conn. 570, 581, 756 A.2d 214 (2000). The Probate Court generally has no jurisdiction over equitable claims, the sole exception being when the equitable claim is incidental to, and connected with, the settlement of a particular estate. <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Hartford National Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>160 Conn. 415, 429, 279 A.2d 726 (1971) (\u201c[t]he situation ... in which the Probate Court may exercise equitable jurisdiction must be one which arises within the framework of a matter already before it, and wherein the application of equity is but a necessary step in the direction of the final determination of the entire matter\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Although the trial court analyzed the defendants\u2019 res judicata claim regarding the specific performance count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>solely on the basis of the Probate Court\u2019s lack of equitable jurisdiction, possibly because the defendants never cited \u00a7 45a-98 (a) as a basis for jurisdiction in their written or oral argument to that court,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the defendants appear to concede that the trial court properly concluded that there is no equitable jurisdiction. We agree. The resolution of the defendants\u2019 res judicata claim therefore requires an analysis of the relevant jurisdictional statute, to which we apply traditional principles of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">\u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Tabone, </em>279 Conn. 527, 534-35, 902 A.2d 1058 (2006). \u201cThe test to determine ambiguity is whether the statute, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>read in context, is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tamowsky </em>v. <em>Socci, </em>271 Conn. 284, 287 n.3, 856 A.2d 408 (2004). The construction of a statute presents a question of law, over which we exercise plenary review. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tabone, </em>supra, 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">We begin our analysis with the text of the relevant statute. Section 45a-98 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cCourts of probate in their respective districts shall have the power to . . . (3) . . . determine title or rights of possession and use in and to any real, tangible or intangible property that constitutes, or may constitute, all or part of any trust, any decedent\u2019s estate, or any estate under control of a guardian or conservator, which trust or estate is otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the Probate Court . . . .\u201d We note first that neither party has claimed that the statute is plain and unambiguous. Indeed, the broad language of the statute creates several ambiguities. The phrase \u201cdetermine title\u201d is language traditionally associated with property law, rather than the contract based action at issue in the present case; see, e.g., <em>Cardillo </em>v. Cardillo, 27 Conn. App. 208, 212, 605 A.2d 576 (1992) (dispute as to whether title had vested in plaintiff upon decedent\u2019s death based on joint tenancy and therefore was not part of estate); <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Cavallaro, </em>2 Conn. App. 622, 623, 481 A.2d 101 (1984) (dispute over joint savings accounts and mortgage deed and note each held jointly by defendant and decedent, with right of survivorship); and may be intended to apply only to actions originating in property law. Conversely, as the defendants urge, the phrase may apply broadly to all actions relevant to the ownership and use of property, including contract actions. We also note that the reference to property \u201cthat constitutes, or may constitute, all or part of . . . any decedent\u2019s estate\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 45a-98 (a) (3); could be intended to limit jurisdiction to disputes over whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>the property at issue belongs to the estate, rather than whether it can be conveyed by the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Accordingly, we turn to the genealogy and legislative history of the statutes governing Probate Court jurisdiction to resolve the ambiguity. The provision that is now codified at \u00a7 45a-98 (a) (3) was enacted in 1993. Public Acts 1993, No. 93-279, \u00a7 6 (P.A. 93-279). Prior to that 1993 enactment, courts of probate had jurisdiction under \u00a7 45a-98 only to grant administration of intestate estates, admit wills to probate, and to call executors, administrators, trustees, guardians and conservators to account. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 45a-98.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Probate jurisdiction was so limited that, prior to the enactment of P.A. 93-279, probate judges even lacked authority to construe will provisions unless the construction was incidental to the determination of a matter already within the court\u2019s express statutory jurisdiction. See <em>Huber </em>v. <em>St. Labre Indian School Educational Assn., </em>4 Conn. App. 436, 440, 494 A.2d 629 (1985). At that time, two statutes granted the Probate Court the authority to order a sale of property. General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 45a-164<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> provided, inter alia, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>that, upon written application of the <em>executor </em>of a will, the Probate Court may authorize the sale of any real property the legal title to which has been acquired by such executor, if the court finds it would be in the best interests of the parties in interest to grant the application.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 45a-428<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> granted lim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>ited authority to the probate courts to order the sale of real property that has been specifically devised or is forbidden to be sold under the terms of a will, allowing such a sale only when it is essential to settle claims against the estate.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This court previously recognized the limited scope of Probate Court jurisdiction as to title matters prior to 1993. We explained: \u201cA probate court has no power to make final determinations of title where title is disputed. It may make such incidental determinations of questions of title as are necessary to enable it to carry out its statutory duties . . . but such determinations have no res judicata effect and are not binding upon the adverse claimants. . . . Questions of title, not incidental to a probate court\u2019s statutory duties, are left for courts of general jurisdiction to resolve in ordinary actions at common law.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Lenge </em>v. <em>Goldfarb, </em>169 Conn. 218, 221, 363 A.2d 110 (1975). Thus, prior to the enactment of P.A. 93-279 and its codification at \u00a7 45a-98 (a) (3), probate courts enjoyed limited jurisdiction and authority over the disposition of real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">In 1991, the legislature appointed a task force to study the probate court system and make recommendations for reform. Spec. Acts 1991, No. 91-19. Task force membership consisted of, inter alia, the Probate Court administrator and three Probate Court judges. Among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>other topics, the task force was directed to examine the jurisdiction of the probate courts. Spec. Act 91-19, \u00a7 1. The task force thereafter submitted its findings in a document captioned \u201cReport to the Governor and the 1992 Session of the Connecticut General Assembly\u201d (Task Force Report). The task force made several major recommendations, including changes to the structure and financing of probate courts. On the issue of jurisdiction, the taskforce suggested \u201cincreasing Probate Court jurisdiction in three areas, which jurisdiction would be concurrent with the Superior Court.\u201d Task Force Report, supra, p. 14. One such recommendation was for the probate courts to have concurrent jurisdiction over \u201ctrying title to real and personal property <em>in which a claim is made that said property should be an asset </em>of a trust, a decedent\u2019s estate, or any estate under the control of a conservator or guardian.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. To accomplish this specific end, the report included draft legislation that proposed the exact language that ultimately was enacted in 1993 by P.A. 93-279, \u00a7 6, and codified at \u00a7 45a-98 (a) (3). Id., exhibit 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">The task force proposed additional draft legislation, which also was adopted by the legislature, that would permit a party to remove a claim to the Superior Court that otherwise properly had been brought to the Probate Court under \u00a7 45a-98 (a) (3) if the party had a right to a jury trial on that claim under General Statutes \u00a7 52-215.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See P.A. 93-279, \u00a7 7, codified at General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>\u00a7 45a-98a.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It is noteworthy that, because specific performance is an equitable remedy, there is no right to a jury trial for such actions. See, e.g., <em>Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Assn. of the United States, Inc. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>212 Conn. 83, 91, 561 A.2d 917 (1989); <em>Texaco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Golart, </em>206 Conn. 454, 458, 538 A.2d 1017 (1988). In contrast, consistent with the task force\u2019s stated intent to provide probate courts with jurisdiction over quiet title actions when there was a dispute as to whether the property at issue belonged to the estate and therefore could be distributed, parties to quiet title actions are entitled to jury trials. See <em>Swanson </em>v. <em>Boschen, </em>143 Conn. 159, 165, 120 A.2d 546 (1956); <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Strong, </em>68 Conn. 273, 286, 36 A. 55 (1896).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Honorable Robert K. Killian, Jr., a task force member and judge of the Probate Court, submitted written testimony to the judiciary committee in which he explained that the task force unanimously had agreed that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>probate courts should have concurrent jurisdiction with the Superior Court in: \u201c(1) trying title to real and personal property in which a claim is made that said property <em>should be an asset </em>of a trust, a decedent\u2019s estate, or any estate under the control of a conservator or guardian; (2) construction of wills admitted to probate; [and] (3) construction of testamentary or inter vivos trusts.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 6,1993 Sess., pp. 2181-82. He further explained that \u201c[t]he members agreed that these matters could be heard more quickly in the probate courts. . . . Many probate judges have been hearing title matters for years on an informal basis, successfully acting as negotiators and mediators thus saving the parties time and legal costs and sparing the Superior Court the burden of these cases.\u201d Id., p. 2182.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">A report from the Probate Court administrator\u2019s office (administrator) produced shortly after the enactment of \u00a7 45a-98 (a) (3) summarized how the 1993 amendment had affected probate courts. Probate Court Administrator, 1993 Annual Report of the Probate Court Administrator (April 1, 1994) (Probate Court Annual Report). The administrator first noted that \u201c[p]robate [c]ourts now have concurrent jurisdiction with the Superior [Court] in certain matters. . . . They include trying title to personal and real property and construing wills and trusts.\u201d Id., introduction. The administrator further explained that, in order to prepare judges for these new areas of jurisdiction, the Connecticut Probate Assembly and the administrator had presented several continuing education programs. Id., p. 1. Although the report cited several programs relating to quiet title type actions,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> there is no indication that the probate judges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>received similar education on contract actions relating to real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">In sum, the limited incidental jurisdiction exercised by the probate courts over real property prior to 1993, the narrow purpose stated in the task force report, the testimony provided by Judge Killian to the judiciary committee, the legislature\u2019s adoption of the exact language proposed by the task force, and the education thereafter provided to probate judges as to property matters solely relating to title, indicate that the legislature intended to grant the Probate Court limited additional jurisdiction. In particular, the legislature intended \u00a7 45a-98 (a) (3) to vest the Probate Court with concurrent jurisdiction with the Superior Court to try title to real and personal property in which a claim is made that said property is an asset of a trust, a decedent\u2019s estate, or any estate under the control of a conservator or guardian. Such a purpose is entirely consistent with the related grant of jurisdiction to the Probate Court under \u00a7 45a-98 (a) (1) to aid in the administration of an estate. Section 45a-98, therefore, does not provide jurisdiction over a breach of contract action, whether to obtain damages or specific performance, simply because the property belongs to an estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">In the present case, therefore, the Probate Court did not have jurisdiction over the plaintiffs\u2019 action for specific performance. The claim involved no dispute as to whether the title to that the property was in fact an asset of the decedent\u2019s estate, as required for jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>tion under \u00a7 45a-98 (a) (3). Indeed, the Probate Court\u2019s decision is itself ambiguous as to whether the court concluded that it had jurisdiction over the claim. See footnote 12 of this opinion. Accordingly, because the Probate Court was not a court of competent jurisdiction under \u00a7 45a-98 (a) (3) with regard to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for specific performance, res judicata did not bar the plaintiffs from bringing their action in Superior Court.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> For the same reason, the plaintiffs were not required to appeal from the Probate Court\u2019s judgment in order for the Superior Court to have jurisdiction. See <em>Kerin </em>v. <em>Stangle, </em>209 Conn. 260, 264, 550 A.2d 1069 (1988) (\u201cWhen entertaining an appeal from an order or decree of a Probate Court, the Superior Court takes the place of and sits as the court of probate. ... In ruling on a probate appeal, the Superior Court exercises the powers, not of a constitutional court of general or common law jurisdiction, but of a Probate Court.\u201d [Citations omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">We therefore turn to the merits of the trial court\u2019s decision granting specific performance. The defendants claim that the trial court improperly rejected two of their special defenses relating to the residuary beneficiaries\u2019 absence from the action. Specifically, the defendants claim that, because title to the property in the estate passed by operation of law to the residuary beneficiaries: (1) the defendants lacked authority to sell the property; and (2) the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>fail because the residuary beneficiaries were not made parties to the action. We conclude that the trial court properly rejected the special defenses because: (1) the defendants had express authority under the decedent\u2019s will to sell the property as part of their duties as executors; and (2) executors may sue and be sued without joining the persons represented by them and beneficially interested in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">As we previously have noted, the will named Ebe-nezer Lutheran Church as a residuary beneficiary as to one third of the residue of the estate and named the defendants\u2019 five grandchildren as residuary beneficiaries as to the remaining two thirds of the residue. The will included no specific devises of the decedent\u2019s real property. The will authorized the defendants, as executors, to make any necessary division of the estate, and to determine what property should be included in each share. In addition, the will gave the defendants, as executors, express authority to sell all or any part of the decedent\u2019s real property without the supervision or permission of the Probate Court.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">The record reveals the following additional procedural history. The defendants filed a motion to strike the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for failure to join necessary parties with an interest in the subject of the action, namely, the residuary beneficiaries. The trial court, <em>Riley, J., </em>denied the motion on the ground that the defendants had not properly identified the allegedly necessary parties pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 10-39 (b).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The defendants did not file another motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>strike, but they subsequently amended their answer to include an additional special defense relating to this issue. In that special defense, the defendants first claimed that they lacked authority to sell the property because title to the estate had passed by operation of law to the residuary beneficiaries and the sale of the property was not necessary to satisfy claims against the estate. The trial court rejected this claim after finding that there was no limitation in the will preventing the defendants as executors from selling the property unless necessary to satisfy claims against the estate, as alleged in the special defenses. The trial court presumed that the defendants had based this special defense on \u00a7 45a-428; see footnote 11 of this opinion; but found that statute inapplicable because it applies to a solvent estate only when property has been specifically devised, or when the sale or mortgage of the property has been forbidden by will. Neither circumstance was implicated in the present case. The defendants also claimed in that special defense that, because title to the disputed property automatically had vested in the residuary beneficiaries, the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action naming only the executors should fail because it omitted indispensable parties. The trial court also rejected this claim on the ground that the defendants had presented no legal authority that required joinder of the residuary beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">We first address the defendants\u2019 claim that the trial court improperly found that the defendants had authority, as executors, to sell the property. Whether parties to a contract have the authority to create a contract is a question of fact. Cf. <em>Maharishi School of Vedic Sciences, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number><em>Inc. (Connecticut) </em>v. <em>Connecticut Constitution Associates Ltd. Partnership, </em>260 Conn. 598, 605-606, 799 A.2d 1027 (2002); <em>II Giardino, LLC v. Belle Haven Land Co., </em>254 Conn. 502, 531, 757 A.2d 1103 (2000). \u201c[W]here the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is challenged we must determine whether the facts set out in the memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are clearly erroneous. . . . We also must determine whether those facts correctly found are, as a matter of law, sufficient to support the judgment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wyszomierski </em>v. <em>Siracusa, </em>290 Conn. 225, 237, 963 A.2d 943 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Both our common law and our statutory law support the trial court\u2019s decision that the defendants were entitled to sell the property, which, as we previously have noted, was not specifically devised to anyone, including the residuary beneficiaries. We first note that this court explicitly has recognized that a testator may give an executor the power to sell real property without the permission or supervision of a court. <em>Gilman </em>v. <em>Gil-man, </em>99 Conn. 598, 607-608, 122 A. 386 (1923) (\u201cA power of sale in this jurisdiction is convenient in the simplest will, and almost a necessity in an instrument which is comprehensive and contemplates a considerable time in the full execution of its provisions. It enables sale of real property pending the settlement of an estate, without the necessity of an application to court for an order, attended perhaps with the expense of a large charge for a surety bond, it facilitates transfer of securities, and in other ways is useful.\u201d). The right of a testator to give an executor the power to sell property without the supervision or permission of a court also has been acknowledged in our General Statutes. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 \u00a7 45a-233 (c)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and 45a-234 (2).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Nothing in these statutes conditions the authority to execute such transactions on the approval of the decedent\u2019s beneficiaries. Although, as we previously have noted in part I of this opinion, the statutory scheme limits the power of an executor to sell a decedent\u2019s property when the property is specifically devised or is forbidden to be sold,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> neither circumstance is implicated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">It is true, as the defendants claim, that, upon the death of an owner of real property, title to the decedent\u2019s property passes to his or her heirs. <em>Stepney Pond Estates, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Monroe; </em>260 Conn. 406, 433 n.28, 797 A.2d 494 (2002); <em>Satti </em>v. <em>Rago, </em>186 Conn. 360, 365, 441 A.2d 615 (1982); <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Chiascione, </em>130 Conn. 304, 306, 33 A.2d 326 (1943). It also is well settled, however, that an executor has possession and control of a decedent\u2019s real property in the course of administering and settling the estate; General Statutes \u00a7 45a-321 (a);<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>and this possession relates back to the time of the decedent\u2019s death. <em>Stepney Pond Estates, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>supra, 433 n.28. When an executor who is in possession of property as part of his or her administrative duties subsequently exercises the power to sell the land, the devisees are deemed never to have taken title. Consequently, \u201can executor exercising his power to transfer property does not transfer the title from the devisees, but from the estate.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">In the present case, the plain language of the will gave the defendants, as executors, the express authority to sell real property belonging to the estate. The defendants were in possession of the property as part of their duties as executors of the estate. Any sale that they entered into constituted a transfer from the estate, not from the beneficiaries. As such, nothing in the record or the law convinces us that the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendants had authority to enter a contract for the sale of the decedent\u2019s property was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">We next address the defendants\u2019 claim that the trial court improperly rejected their special defense that the plaintiffs\u2019 action must fail because the plaintiffs did not join the residuary beneficiaries as indispensable party defendants.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> With respect to our standard of review, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>we note that the trial court determined only that no legal authority supported the defendants\u2019 contention that the residuary beneficiaries must be joined in the action. The trial court made no findings of fact concerning the joinder claim, nor did it base its conclusion on any construction of the will. Moreover, the facts underlying the defendants\u2019 joinder claims are undisputed. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s determination that the residuary beneficiaries were not indispensable parties is a question of law, subject to plenary review. See <em>Webster Bank </em>v. <em>Zak, </em>259 Conn. 766, 773, 792 A.2d 66 (2002); <em>AvalonBay Communities, Inc. </em>v. <em>Orange, </em>256 Conn. 557, 565, 775 A.2d 284 (2001); <em>Olson </em>v. <em>Accessory Controls &amp; Equipment Corp., </em>254 Conn. 145, 156, 757 A.2d 14 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">We first note that General Statutes \u00a7 52-106 squarely rejects the defendants\u2019 contention. Section 52-106 provides: \u201cAn executor, administrator, or trustee of an express trust may sue or be sued without joining the persons represented by him and beneficially interested in the action.\u201d Accord Practice Book \u00a7 9-11. This court has held that, under \u00a7 52-106, a third party bringing an action against an executor as representative of a decedent\u2019s estate need not join the decedent\u2019s heirs. <em>Kukanskis </em>v. <em>Jasut, </em>169 Conn. 29, 31, 362 A.2d 898 (1975). In the present case, as in <em>Kukanskis, </em>the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>tiffs brought the action against the defendants as executors of the will and thus did not need to join the residuary beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Our case law farther supports this conclusion. Parties are indispensable only \u201cwhen their interest in the controversy is such that a final decree cannot be made without either affecting that interest or leaving the controversy in such condition that its final disposition may be inconsistent with equity and good conscience.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hilton </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>233 Conn. 701, 722, 661 A.2d 973 (1995). As we previously have noted, the residuary beneficiaries had no special interest in this particular parcel of land, as it was not specifically devised to them. Their only interest was its value as a percentage of their residuary interest, and even that interest was subject to the defendants\u2019 express authority to sell property belonging to the estate. Nor is there any evidence that omitting the residuary beneficiaries threatened to create a final disposition inconsistent with equity or good conscience. Cf. <em>Goodman </em>v. <em>Bank of Boston Connecticut, </em>27 Conn. App. 333, 341, 606 A.2d 994 (1992) (specific devisee of property is indispensable party in contract action for specific performance of testator\u2019s oral promise to convey property to another party).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">The defendants cite to several cases for the proposition that, because title to property in the decedent\u2019s estate automatically devolved to the beneficiary heirs, they are indispensable parties to claims involving title to such property. These cases, however, involve title disputes over whether a given property belonged to an estate. See, e.g., <em>Cardillo </em>v. <em>Cardillo, </em>supra, 27 Conn. App. 211 (concluding that residuary beneficiaries are indispensable parties where third party plaintiff claimed that \u201cthe decedent\u2019s estate has no estate, right, title, hen, or interest in said property\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); see also <em>Dickman </em>v. <em>Generis, </em>48 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>Sup. 380, 381, 845 A.2d 488 (2004) (\u201cbeneficiaries are proper parties ... to any action to recover estate assets\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Indeed, if an issue before the court is whether the property belongs to an estate, a residuary beneficiary may be an indispensable party because such an action would deprive the heirs of any and all benefit that may accrue from the property. See, e.g., <em>Cardillo </em>v. <em>Cardillo, </em>supra, 213 (\u201c[t]he effect of declaring the plaintiff to be the sole owner in fee simple would be to deprive the devisees of their shares of title\u201d). Similarly, the beneficiary of a <em>specific </em>devise may be an indispensable party to an action because the devisee has a right to that particular piece of property. See, e.g., <em>Goodman </em>v. <em>Bank of Boston Connecticut, </em>supra, 27 Conn. App. 341. Neither circumstance is implicated here. The residuary beneficiaries will receive their beneficial interest in any property that is sold through the will\u2019s requirement of the distribution of sale proceeds and pursuant to \u00a7 45a-234 (21).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We therefore conclude that the trial court properly rejected the defendants\u2019 claim that the residuary beneficiaries must be joined as parties to the Superior Court action.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">The defendants next claim that the trial court improperly rejected their special defenses that the agreement was not sufficiently definite and certain and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>parties\u2019 conduct indicated that any such agreement was later abandoned for lack of mutual assent. The defendants first contend that, because they believed that the signed agreement was contingent on approval of counsel for the estate and that this \u201cmaterial term\u201d was absent from the agreement, there was never mutual assent to the terms of that contract. They further point to the parties\u2019 inability to agree on additional terms after signing that agreement, specifically, the cleanup of the premises, the amount of the deposit and the drafting of the \u201coption contract,\u201d as evidence that the parties mutually assented to abandon that initial agreement. We disagree that the trial court\u2019s rejection of these claims was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">The record reveals the following additional undisputed facts and procedural history. The parties signed a preprinted three page document entitled \u201cReal Estate Purchase Contract\u201d dated February 24, 2004. The top of the document contains the language: \u201cWhen signed by Buyer and Seller this is intended to be a legally binding contract. If either party has questions about any aspect of this transaction, he/she should consult with an attorney before signing this Contract.\u201d The agreement stipulated that the property would be sold to the plaintiffs for $240,000, with a closing to be held on May 24, 2004. The agreement also called for a $500 deposit, which the plaintiffs gave to the defendants after the parties had signed the agreement. The defendants subsequently provided a copy of the agreement to attorney Omar Shepard, Jr., whose law firm the decedent had requested, in his will, that the executors use to settle the estate. Thereafter, the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, Timothy Wentworth, contacted Shepard, and the two attorneys discussed some concerns Shepard had about the amount of the deposit and the form of the agreement. As a result of these discussions, the plaintiffs tendered an additional deposit of $10,000 by check and signed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>an option contract for the land, which the defendants never signed. The plaintiffs then attempted several times to schedule a closing on the property. Ultimately, the defendants returned both deposit checks to the plaintiffs and advised the plaintiffs that they were unwilling to close.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">At trial, the parties offered conflicting evidence as to their intent. Edward Bender testified that he believed that he needed to get Shepard\u2019s approval before doing anything regarding the decedent\u2019s estate. He also testified that he had told the plaintiffs that Shepard would have to have the \u201cfinal say\u201d regarding the terms of the sale. He testified further that, although the parties had spoken about the property, they never had reached any conclusions in terms of a sale price or other details of the sale. Similarly, Clara Bender testified that she had told the plaintiffs that she and Edward Bender needed to talk to an attorney because they could not sell the property themselves. Conversely, John Bender testified that Edward Bender had represented that he had the right to sell the property to anyone at any agreed upon price. Similarly, Carl Bender testified that the defendants never had indicated that they needed the approval of a third party before selling the property. Rather, Carl Bender testified that the parties had discussed sending the agreement to the attorneys merely in order to finalize the details of the sale and conduct the closing.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">Judge Robaina made several findings of fact regarding the agreement between the parties. First, the trial court found that the contract was sufficiently specific, as it identified the property in question, the purchase price, and the amount of the deposit. The trial court also found that \u201cthe document identified as the \u2018Real Estate Purchase Contract\u2019 is a contract. There is no ambiguity as to its terms.\u201d Second, with respect to Shepard\u2019s role, the court found that there was nothing in the will to require approval by counsel before the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>could be sold and that there was no evidence that an \u201coffer\u201d to sell was rejected by the defendants after having received Shepard\u2019s advice. Finally, the court rejected the argument that the agreement had been abandoned. The court noted that there was no evidence that the defendants ever had claimed that the consideration was inadequate, only that the deposit should be larger, a request to which the plaintiffs had acceded.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">We begin by setting out our standard of review. Under well established contract law, a contract must be definite and certain as to its terms and requirements. <em>Glazer </em>v. <em>Dress Barn, Inc., </em>274 Conn. 33, 51, 873 A.2d 929 (2005). In addition, there must be a manifestation of mutual assent to those terms and requirements. <em>Ubysz </em>v. <em>DiPietro, </em>185 Conn. 47, 51, 440 A.2d 830 (1981). The defendants\u2019 challenges to the agreement\u2019s certainty and definiteness and the parties\u2019 mutual assent therefore raise questions of whether a valid contract ever existed. It is well settled that the existence of a contract is a question of fact, which we review for clear error. See <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>244 Conn. 158, 187, 708 A.2d 949 (1998); see also <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>DeRoche, </em>112 Conn. App. 355, 370, 962 A.2d 904 (2009) (applying clear error review to contract challenge based on lack of mutual assent); <em>Ziotas </em>v. <em>Reardon Law Firm, P.C., </em>111 Conn. App. 287, 302, 959 A.2d 1013 (2008) (applying clear error review to contract challenge based on lack of definiteness of contract term), cert. granted, 290 Conn. 903, 926 A.2d 796 (2009). \u201cA finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. . . . Because it is the trial court\u2019s function to weigh the evidence and determine credibility, we give great deference to its findings. ... In reviewing factual findings, [w]e do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>examine the record to determine whether the [court] could have reached a conclusion other than the one reached. . . . Instead, we make every reasonable presumption ... in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Stevenson Lumber Co.-Suffield, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chase Associates, Inc., </em>284 Conn. 205, 216-17, 932 A.2d 401 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The agreement itself provides strong evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the contract was definite, certain and the product of mutual assent. On its face, the contract unambiguously sets out the essential terms and conditions of the agreement. With respect to the alleged need for Shepard\u2019s approval before the agreement was to be finalized, the agreement lends strong support to the trial court\u2019s finding to the contrary. As we noted previously, the language at the top of the agreement provides: \u201cWhen signed by Buyer and Seller this is intended to be a legally binding contract. If either party has questions about any aspect of this transaction, he/she should consult with an attorney <em>before </em>signing this Contract.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The defendants\u2019 initials appear on each page of the agreement, and their signatures appear on the last page. The defendants do not dispute that they did in fact sign the agreement. To the extent that there was conflicting testimony as to whether the parties nonetheless had agreed to Shepard\u2019s approval as a condition precedent to the agreement becoming a valid contract, the trial court was entitled to credit the testimony of the plaintiffs over that of the defendants concerning that matter. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Mullins, </em>288 Conn. 345, 365, 952 A.2d 784 (2008) (\u201c[W]e may not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court when it comes to evaluating the credibility of a witness. ... It is the exclusive province of the trier of fact to weigh conflicting testimony and make determinations of credibility, crediting some, all or none of any given witness\u2019 testimony.\u201d [Citation omitted.]). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>Finally, although there was evidence of proposed modifications, the trial court reasonably concluded that such modifications either were not essential terms or were proposed modifications by the defendants that the plaintiffs in fact had accepted.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s factual findings underlying its conclusion that the contract was valid are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">Finally, the defendants contend that the trial court improperly failed to conclude that, if a contract was formed, the agreement was a result of mistake and is void as unconscionable. Specifically, the defendants contend that they were unilaterally mistaken as to the value of the property, which, according to their expert, was more than double the price set forth in the contract. They contend that this fact, in conjunction with unspecified \u201cpressure\u201d that the plaintiffs had asserted on them to execute the contract, renders the agreement unconscionable and, therefore, unenforceable. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">Although we have had no recent occasion to address the effect of a unilateral mistake, this court previously has recognized that \u201c[t]he mistake of [only one] of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>parties inducing him to sign a contract which, but for the mistake, he would not have entered into, may be a ground in some cases for cancelling the contract .... <em>Snelling v. </em>Merritt, 85 Conn. 83, 101, 81 [A.] 1039 [1911], . . . Relief is granted in such cases only when the mistake is induced by the conduct of the other party, <em>or when he seeks unconscionably to take advantage of it.\" </em>(Citation omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lieberum </em>v. <em>Nussenbaum, </em>94 Conn. 276, 279, 108 A. 662 (1920); accord <em>Milford Yacht Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Milford Yacht Club, Inc., </em>136 Conn. 544, 549, 72 A.2d 482 (1950). The Restatement (Second) of Contracts rule on which the defendants rely, which the Appellate Court more recently has applied, provides: \u201cWhere a mistake of one party at the time a contract was made as to a basic assumption on which he made the contract has a material effect on the agreed exchange of performances that is adverse to him, the contract is voidable by him if he does not bear the risk of the mistake under the rule stated in \u00a7 154, <em>and (a) the effect of the mistake is such that enforcement of the contract would be unconscionable, </em>or (b) the other party had reason to know of the mistake or his fault caused the mistake.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 1 Restatement (Second), Contracts' \u00a7 153, p. 394 (1981); see <em>Shoreline Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norwich Taxi, LLC, </em>70 Conn.

Similarly, although \u201cthe ultimate determination of whether a transaction is unconscionable is a question of law . . . subject to a plenary review . . . the factual findings of the trial court that underlie that determination are entitled to the same deference on appeal that other factual findings command. Thus, those findings must stand unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Cheshire Mortgage Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Montes, </em>223 Conn. 80, 88, 612 A.2d 1130 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">With this background in mind, we turn to the record, which reveals the following additional facts. The trial court did not make an express finding as to mistake, rejecting the defendants\u2019 claim on the basis of having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>failed to prove either procedural or substantive uncon-scionability. With respect to the procedural prong, the court found that \u201cthe parties were in relatively equal positions as to their ability to bargain . . . .\u2019\u2019In its rejection of the defendants\u2019 special defenses of duress and unclean hands, the court previously had found that, although Edward Bender testified that he had felt \u201cpressured\u201d to sign the agreement, there was no other evidence to support that assertion. With respect to substantive unconscionability, the trial court noted that two appraisals for the property had been presented to the court: (1) a May, 2004 appraisal of $310,000, which was undertaken to determine \u201c \u2018the current market value of the property\u2019 and (2) an October, 2007 estimate of $570,000, which was based on development of the land as a twenty lot subdivision.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Both estimates had been prepared by the same real estate appraisal company. The court found that the difference between the $240,000 contract price in February, 2004, and the $310,000 estimate in May, 2004, was not so great as to make the terms of the contract oppressive. Although the court did not make an express finding as to mistake, it did find it \u201cnoteworthy . . . that it appears that neither appraisal was known to any of the parties at the time the contract was formed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The defendants have failed to point to any evidence that would demonstrate that these findings were clearly erroneous. Their reliance on Edward Bender\u2019s general<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>ized testimony that he felt \u201cpressured\u201d to execute the agreement, an appraisal performed four years after the execution of the contract, and the defendants\u2019 assertion that \u201c[i]t would appear that the plaintiffs, as developers, were in a position to know [the property\u2019s] true value and took unfair advantage of the defendants\u2019 lack of such knowledge\u201d; (emphasis added); do not meet this deferential standard.

The credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be accorded to their testimony is for the trier of fact.\u201d [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]).
