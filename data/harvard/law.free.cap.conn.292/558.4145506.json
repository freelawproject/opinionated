App. 167, 187, 931 A.2d 975 (2007). Thereafter, this court granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal limited to the following issues: (1) \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly determine that the special credibility instruction mandated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>276 Conn. 452, 886 A.2d 777 (2005), was not applicable?\u201d; and (2) \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly determine that the verdicts were not legally inconsistent?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>284 Conn. 938, 937 A.2d 694 (2007). With respect to the first claim, we conclude that, although <em>Patterson </em>does not require a special credibility instruction if a jailhouse informant has not received a promise of a benefit in exchange for his testimony; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>supra, 469; the <em>Patterson </em>rule should now be expanded to apply to all jailhouse informant testimony. We also conclude, however, that the absence of such an instruction in the present case was harmless. With respect to the second claim, we conclude that we need not determine whether the verdicts in the present case were legally inconsistent because we conclude, in accordance with <em>United States </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>469 U.S. 57, 69, 105 S. Ct. 471, 83 L. Ed. 2d 461 (1984), that claims of legally inconsistent verdicts are not reviewable. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court on these alternate grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">As set forth in the Appellate Court\u2019s opinion, the jury reasonably could have found the following facts. \u201cOn the afternoon of March 28, 2001, the defendant asked his neighbor [Charles Smith] if he could borrow money, stating that he would pay the money back after he went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>on \u2018a mission.\u2019 Later that evening, the defendant and Richmond Perry drove to Mike\u2019s Package Store in Mid-dlefield. At the counter, an argument ensued between the defendant and the owner of the store, Edmund Caruso, over the amount of change the defendant received from his purchase. The argument escalated, and the defendant pulled out a handgun and jumped over the counter. The defendant pushed Caruso, who then sprayed Mace at both the defendant and Perry. During the altercation, Caruso was shot several times and subsequently died as a result of his injuries. Following the shooting, the defendant and Perry fled from the scene with the cash register. The defendant was arrested several weeks later.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>supra, 104 Conn. App. 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Thereafter, the defendant was charged with felony murder, murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-54a (a), robbery in the first degree, larceny in the fifth degree and conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree. The jury found him guilty of felony murder, larceny in the fifth degree and conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree and acquitted him of murder and robbery in the first degree, and the trial court rendered judgment accordingly. Id., 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">On appeal to the Appellate Court, the defendant claimed, inter alia, that the trial court improperly had: (1) denied his request for a special credibility instruction concerning the testimony of two jailhouse informants pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>supra, 276 Conn. 452; <em>State </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>supra, 104 Conn. App. 170; and (2) denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal with respect to the felony murder charge, because the verdict of guilty on that charge was inconsistent with the verdict of not guilty on the charges of robbery in the first degree, which was the predicate felony for the felony murder charge. Id., 179. The Appellate Court rejected the defendant\u2019s first claim because it concluded that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number><em>Patterson </em>charge is required only when the state has promised some benefit to the jailhouse informant in exchange for testifying, and there was no evidence of such a promise in this case. Id., 174. The Appellate Court rejected the defendant\u2019s second claim because it concluded that, in order to convict the defendant of felony murder, the jury was required to find that the defendant or another participant had caused Caruso\u2019s death in the course of a robbery in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-133; see footnote 2 of this opinion; whereas, in order to convict the defendant of robbery in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2), the jury would have been required to find that the defendant had committed robbery while armed with a deadly weapon. <em>State </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>supra, 183. Because the elements of the two offenses were different, the Appellate Court concluded that the verdicts were not legally inconsistent. Id., 184. Accordingly, the court affirmed the judgment of conviction. Id., 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">This certified appeal followed. The defendant claims that the Appellate Court improperly affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of his request for a charge under <em>Patterson </em>because that case requires a special credibility instruction on jailhouse informant testimony regardless of whether the informant has received a promise of a benefit in exchange for his testimony. He also contends that, if this court disagrees with this interpretation of <em>Patterson, </em>this court should expand the <em>Patterson </em>rule to apply to all jailhouse informant testimony. The defendant further claims that the Appellate Court improperly determined that robbery in the first degree is not a lesser included offense of felony murder for purposes of establishing a legally inconsistent verdict. The state disputes these claims and also contends, essentially as alternate grounds for affirmance, that: (1) even if the trial court\u2019s failure to give a special credibility instruction concerning the testimony of the jailhouse infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>mants pursuant to <em>Patterson </em>was improper, it was harmless; and (2) this court should adopt the rule set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>supra, 469 U.S. 69, that a claim that a verdict is legally inconsistent is not reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">We disagree with the defendant that <em>Patterson </em>applies even when a jailhouse informant has not received a promise of a benefit in exchange for his testimony, but agree with him that the <em>Patterson </em>rule should be expanded and that the trial court must give a special credibility instruction even when the informant has not received an express promise of a benefit. We agree with the state, however, that the absence of a <em>Patterson </em>charge in the present case was harmless. We also agree with the state that claims of legally inconsistent verdicts are not reviewable, in accordance with <em>Powell. </em>Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court on these alternate grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim that the Appellate Court improperly determined that the trial court properly had refused to give a special credibility instruction concerning the testimony of the jailhouse informants pursuant to <em>Patterson. </em>The opinion of the Appellate Court sets forth the following additional facts and procedural history that are relevant to our resolution of this claim. \u201cAt trial, the state presented the testimony of Thomas Moran and Ronald Avery. While awaiting their trials, Moran and Avery shared a courthouse lockup cell with the defendant. Both Moran and Avery testified that while in the lockup, on different occasions, the defendant confessed to them that he and Perry had robbed the package store and had shot Caruso.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">\u201cPrior to his conversations with the defendant in the lockup, Moran had known the defendant and had lived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>with him for a short period of time earlier that year. Moran testified that although he had an extensive criminal record, he did not \u2018believe in violence\u2019 and was testifying because \u2018it was the right thing to do.\u2019 The jury heard evidence that Moran had attempted to use the information three different times in an effort to negotiate an agreement with the state, even though from the beginning, he was told, \u2018you\u2019ll get nothing.\u2019 Moran\u2019s attempts to obtain benefits in exchange for his cooperation were futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">\u201cAvery met the defendant for the first time while in the lockup at the Norwich courthouse. Avery testified that he did not believe the defendant initially, but decided to come forth with the information after seeing the incident reported on the news. Avery testified that he thought there would be a monetary reward for the information, and, furthermore, he had hoped to use the information to \u2018get some play\u2019 on his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">\u201cPrior to the conclusion of the trial, the defendant requested that the judge instruct the jury that it should weigh, examine and view Moran\u2019s and Avery\u2019s testimony with great caution, care and scrutiny to determine whether the testimony had been affected by bias or prejudice against the defendant, and to consider whether Moran and Aveiy testified to serve their own self-interest because they believed or hoped that they would benefit by falsely implicating the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">\u201cThe court denied the defendant\u2019s request but instructed the jury to consider the motives of any witness and the credibility of his or her testimony, taking into account all the evidence as well as any inconsistencies in the witness\u2019 testimony and whether the witness had an interest in the outcome of the trial or any bias or prejudice toward any party or any matter in the case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>supra, 104 Conn. App. 170-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>\u201cOur analysis begins with a well established standard of review. When reviewing the challenged jury instruction . . . we must adhere to the well settled rule that a charge to the jury is to be considered in its entirety, read as a whole, and judged by its total effect rather than by its individual component parts. . . . [T]he test of a court\u2019s charge is not whether it is as accurate upon legal principles as the opinions of a court of last resort but whether it fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law. ... As long as [the instructions] are correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury . . . we will not view the instructions as improper.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Denby, </em>235 Conn. 477, 484-85, 668 A.2d 682 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>supra, 276 Conn. 469, this court stated that \u201can informant who has been promised a benefit by the state in return for his or her testimony has a powerful incentive, fueled by self-interest, to implicate falsely the accused. Consequently, the testimony of such an informant, like that of an accomplice, is inevitably suspect.\u201d We concluded, therefore, that the defendant in that case was entitled to a jury instruction that the testimony of the informant, who had received a promise of a sentence reduction, should \u201cbe reviewed with particular scrutiny and weighed . . . with greater care than the testimony of an ordinary witness.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">The defendant in the present case contends that, under <em>Patterson, </em>a special credibility instruction is required even when a jailhouse informant has not received a promise of a benefit. He contends that the mere expectation of a benefit is sufficient. See id., 470 (\u201cthe testimony of an informant who expects to receive a benefit from the state in exchange for his or her cooperation is no less suspect than the testimony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>an accomplice who expects leniency from the state\u201d). Alternatively, the defendant contends that Moran expressly was promised that he would receive a benefit in exchange for his testimony.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Finally, the defendant contends that, if <em>Patterson </em>does not apply, this court should expand its application to all jailhouse informant testimony. Although we do not agree with the defendant that <em>Patterson </em>applies even when a jailhouse informant has not received a promise of a benefit, we conclude that <em>Patterson\u2019s </em>requirement for a special credibility instruction now should be extended to apply to the testimony of all jailhouse informants.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">In recent years, there have been a number of high profile cases involving wrongful convictions based on the false testimony of jailhouse informants. See, e.g., R. Bloom, \u201cJailhouse Informants,\u201d 18 Crim. Just. 20 (Spring 2003).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Several of these cases resulted in formal investigations that shed much needed light on the extensive use of jailhouse informants in criminal prosecutions, an issue that previously had been \u201clargely a closeted aspect of the criminal justice system.\u201d Id. One such investigation, by a grand jury in Los Angeles county, California, revealed an \u201cappalling number of instances of perjury or other falsifications to law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>enforcement . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Tntemal quotation marks omitted.) C. Sherrin, \u201cJailhouse Informants, Part I: Problems with their Use,\u201d 40 Crina. L. Q. 106,113 (1997). The grand jury also \u201cfound that a particularly clever informant realizes that a successful performance on the witness stand is enhanced if it appears he or she is not benefiting from the testimony. . . . These informants wait until after they\u2019ve testified to request favors \u2014 a request that is generally answered. . . . And, because the reward is not offered before the testimony, the jury has no way to measure the informant\u2019s motivation to fabricate testimony, as the prosecutor ... is under no obligation to disclose nonexisting exculpatory evidence.\u201d (Citations omitted.) R. Bloom, supra, 18 Grim. Just. 24. Thus, the expectation of a \u201c[rjeward for testifying is a systemic reality\u201d; id.; even where the informant has not received an explicit promise of a reward.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In addition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>several commentators have pointed out that jailhouse informants frequently have motives to testify falsely that may have nothing to do with the expectation of receiving benefits from the government.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">In light of this growing recognition of the inherent unreliability of jailhouse informant testimony, we are persuaded that the trial court should give a special credibility instruction to the jury whenever such testimony is given, regardless of whether the informant has received an express promise of a benefit.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As we indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>cated in <em>Patterson, </em>the trial court should instruct the jury that the informant\u2019s testimony must \u201cbe reviewed with particular scrutiny and weighed . . . with greater care than the testimony of an ordinary witness.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>supra, 276 Conn. 465; id., 470 (defendant was entitled to instruction \u201csubstantially in accord with the one that he had sought\u201d). In addition, the trial court may ask the jury to consider: the extent to which the informant\u2019s testimony is confirmed by other evidence; the specificity of the testimony; the extent to which the testimony contains details known only by the perpetrator; the extent to which the details of the testimony could be obtained from a source other than the defendant; the informant\u2019s criminal record; any benefits received in exchange for the testimony; whether the informant previously has provided reliable or unreliable information; and the circumstances under which the informant initially provided the information to the police or the pros<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>ecutor, including whether the informant was responding to leading questions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Having concluded that the defendant in the present case was entitled to this cautionary instruction, we must next determine whether the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s request for such an instruction was harmful. \u201c[A]n instructional error relating to general principles of witness credibility is not constitutional in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">. . . Consequently, the defendant bears the burden of establishing that the error [was harmful] . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 471-72. \u201c[A] nonconstitutional error is harmless when an appellate court has a fair assurance that the error did not substantially affect the verdict.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Snelgrove, </em>288 Conn. 742, 758, 954 A.2d 165 (2008). \u201cSeveral factors guide our determination of whether the trial court\u2019s failure to give the requested instruction was harmful. These considerations include: (1) the extent to which [the jailhouse informant\u2019s] apparent motive for falsifying his testimony was brought to the attention of the jury, by cross-examination or otherwise; (2) the nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>of the court\u2019s instructions on witness credibility; (3) whether [the informant\u2019s] testimony was corroborated by substantial independent evidence; and (4) the relative importance of [the informant\u2019s] testimony to the state\u2019s case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>supra, 276 Conn. 472. We address each factor in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">With respect to the first factor, the state claims that defense counsel cross-examined both Moran and Avery extensively as to their motive for testifying and addressed their incentive to lie in closing argument. Indeed, the defendant concedes that the jury \u201cwas aware that [the] informants . . . both hoped for and anticipated a benefit from the [s]tate when they made their statements to the police upon which their testimony was based. The desired benefits were expressed both during direct and cross-examination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">With respect to the second factor, the trial court instructed the jurors that, in determining whether a witness was credible, it should consider whether the witness had \u201can interest in the outcome of this case or any bias or prejudice concerning any party or any matter involved in the case.\u201d As in <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>supra, 276 Conn. 472, these instructions \u201cwere not extensive, and they contained no reference to [the informants] specifically.\u201d Unlike <em>Patterson, </em>however, the trial court instructed the jury that Moran and Avery had been convicted of prior felonies and that the jury \u201cmay consider that everything else being equal, you would not believe the testimony of a person who has committed a serious crime as readily as you would a person of good character. However, you are not required to disbelieve a witness because he has been previously convicted of a felony.\u201d Thus, the jury was specifically instructed that it should subject Moran\u2019s and Avery\u2019s testimony to greater scrutiny than the testimony of an ordinary witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>With respect to the third and fourth factors, the state claims that the evidence strongly supported the defendant\u2019s conviction even without the informants\u2019 testimony. It points out that the defendant\u2019s neighbor, Smith, testified that, several hours after the defendant told him that he was going on a \u201cmission,\u201d the defendant called him and told him that he had something that Smith might be interested in buying. Smith went to the defendant\u2019s residence and the defendant showed him a handgun. Several days later, Smith went to the defendant\u2019s residence again and the defendant showed him a cash register. The defendant told Smith that the cash register was \u201cfrom his mission . . . .\u201d During a later conversation, the defendant told Smith that \u201cthings went bad when he went to do the mission\u201d and \u201c[t]he old man got killed.\u201d The defendant\u2019s accomplice, Perry, admitted that he had been present at the scene of the murder and testified that the defendant shot Caruso after accusing Caruso of shortchanging him.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The state also presented as evidence the defendant\u2019s written statements to the police, in which he denied that he had been present in the liquor store when Caruso was murdered, but admitted that Perry had brought the cash register to his residence on the day of the murder and that he had hidden it behind a dresser in his bedroom. The defendant also stated that he had pried the cash register open with a screwdriver and that he and Perry had shared the money. The defendant later attempted to remove his fingerprints from the cash register. He further admitted that he and Perry had sold the murder weapon to a drug dealer and that they had split the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Finally, the state presented evidence at trial that a jacket that had been seized from the defendant\u2019s residence was contaminated with Mace, which Caruso had sprayed at his attackers. A chemist employed by the state forensic laboratory testified that the Mace was in the form of droplets, not smears, and, therefore, could not have been transferred to the jacket from the cash register, as the defendant had claimed in one of his statements to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">We conclude that all four factors support a conclusion that the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s request for a jailhouse informant instruction regarding the testimony of Moran and Avery could not have substantially affected the verdict. The jury was made aware of the fact that the informants hoped for a benefit from the state, the court specifically instructed the jury that their testimony should be considered with caution because they were convicted felons and there was strong evidence to support the conviction even without the informants\u2019 testimony. Even if Smith\u2019s testimony was not a model of consistency and clarity,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the defendant has not identified any motive for Smith to have lied about the defendant\u2019s involvement in the murder. Although Perry had a motive to testify falsely about the defendant\u2019s involvement, his testimony was not incredible as a matter of law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Moreover, the jury reasonably could have believed Perry\u2019s testimony that the defendant had participated in the robbery even if it was unsure about Perry\u2019s testimony that the defendant had shot Caruso. Finally, the presence of the cash register <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>and the jacket contaminated by Mace<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> at the defendant\u2019s house, and Perry\u2019s willingness to share the proceeds from the robbery and from the sale of the murder weapon with him, all constituted strong evidence that the defendant had participated in the robbery. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s request for a special credibility charge was harmless and affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court on this alternate ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">We next address the defendant\u2019s claim that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the trial court properly denied his motion for judgment of acquittal on the felony murder charge. The defendant claims that the conviction on that charge was legally inconsistent with the verdict of acquittal on the underlying felony of robbery in the first degree. The state disputes this claim and claims as an alternate ground for affirmance that this court, in the exercise of its supervisory powers over the administration of criminal justice, should adopt the rule in <em>United States </em>v. Powell, supra, 469 U.S. 69, that claims of legal inconsistency between a conviction and an acquittal are not reviewable. We agree with the state\u2019s alternate ground for affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">The resolution of this question requires an in-depth review of the development of our jurisprudence govem-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>ing inconsistent verdicts. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Whiteside, </em>148 Conn. 208, 209-10, 169 A.2d 260, cert. denied, 368 U.S. 830, 82 S. Ct. 52, 7 L. Ed. 2d 33 (1961), the defendant was charged in a twenty-three count information with having published a series of libels, but was convicted of only four counts. On appeal, he claimed that his conviction on count twelve should be set aside because \u201che was found not guilty on a number of counts in which he was charged with publishing, on other dates, defamatory matter similar to that charged in count [twelve] and concerning the same persons.\u201d Id., 214. This court stated that \u201c[e]ach count in the information charged a separate and distinct offense and was complete in itself. The only question is whether the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction on count [twelve], irrespective of the verdict on the other counts.\u201d Id. Because the defendant had not challenged the sufficiency of the evidence on count twelve, \u201c[t]here was no basis for the court to disturb the verdict on that count.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Keating, </em>151 Conn. 592, 593-94, 200 A.2d 724 (1964), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Joseph v. Connecticut, </em>379 U.S. 963, 85 S. Ct. 654, 13 L. Ed. 2d 557 (1965), the two appealing defendants had been convicted of conspiracy. They had been tried with three other individuals, two of whom also had been convicted of conspiracy and one of whom had been acquitted. Id., 594. On appeal, the appealing defendants claimed that their convictions were inconsistent with the acquittal of their codefendant. Id. This court noted that, although the defendants had not claimed in their \u201ccommon assignment of error\u201d that the guilty verdicts were not supported by the evidence, \u201cthe briefs of both the [defendants] and the state argue inconsistency as a question of fact and refer to the evidence offered at the trial.\u201d Id., 595.

Therefore, the court did not address the question of whether a legal inconsistency between a conviction and an acquittal was permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>162 Conn. 112, 114, 291 A.2d 750 (1971), the defendant had been acquitted of four counts of indecent assault on a child and convicted of four counts of injury or risk of injury to a child in connection with the same conduct. On appeal, he claimed that the trial court improperly had denied his request to set aside the guilty verdicts because they were inconsistent with the acquittals. Id., 121-22. In response to this claim, this court stated that \u201c[c]onsis-tency in the verdict is not necessary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 122, quoting <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>United States, </em>284 U.S. 390, 393, 52 S. Ct. 189, 76 L. Ed. 356 (1932). We emphasized that, under <em>Whiteside, </em>the dis-positive question was whether there was sufficient evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>dence to support the conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>supra, 122. We then noted, however, that the test for setting aside a verdict was \u201cwhether the jury could reasonably and logically have reached the conclusion which they did\u201d; id., 122-23; and stated that, \u201c[wjhile an inconsistent verdict is not objectionable in itself, its inconsistency may be considered insofar as it supports a claim that the jury\u2019s conclusion was not reasonably and logically reached.\u201d Id., 123. We concluded that, because, as in <em>Keating, </em>the defendant had filed no appendix with his brief, there was \u201cno basis on which to determine whether the verdict was inconsistent as a matter of fact.\u201d Id. Moreover, because the counts on which the defendant had been convicted and those on which he had been acquitted contained different elements, we concluded that \u201ca conviction of one crime is not inconsistent on its face with an acquittal on the other.\u201d Id., 124. Accordingly, this court again did not directly address the question of whether a facially, or legally, inconsistent verdict would be permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>178 Conn. 704, 705, 425 A.2d 108 (1979), the defendant was convicted of sale of narcotics and acquitted of possession of narcotics. On appeal, the defendant claimed that \u201cthe verdict of the jury acquitting him of the crime of possession is, on the facts 'of the present case, necessarily inconsistent with the verdict of guilty of the crime of sale and therefore the conviction on the first count must be set aside.\u201d Id., 708. This court stated that \u201cinconsistency of the verdicts is immaterial. ... As Justice Holmes long ago observed in the case of <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>United States, </em>[supra, 284 U.S. 393-94]: The most that can be said in such cases ... is that the verdict shows that either in the acquittal or the conviction the jury did not speak their real conclusions, but that does not show that they were not convinced of the defendant\u2019s guilt. We interpret the acquittal as no more than their assumption of a power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>which they had no right to exercise, but to which they were disposed through lenity. . . . That the verdict may have been the result of compromise, or a mistake on the part of the jury, is possible. But verdicts cannot be upset by speculation or inquiry into such matters.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>supra, 708-709. Accordingly, we rejected the defendant\u2019s claim. Id., 709-10; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>189 Conn. 1, 6, 454 A.2d 256 (reversing trial court\u2019s decision setting aside conviction of risk of injury to child on ground that it was inconsistent with acquittal on assault charge because consistency in verdict is not necessary under Rosado), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 933, 103 S. Ct. 2098, 77 L. Ed. 2d 306 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>179 Conn. 617, 620 n.2, 427 A.2d 429 (1980) (rejecting defendant\u2019s claim that verdicts were logically inconsistent because inconsistent verdicts are permissible under <em>Dunn).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>DeCaro, </em>252 Conn. 229, 231, 745 A.2d 800 (2000), the defendant was convicted of nine counts of forgery and acquitted of three counts of larceny. On appeal, she claimed that the verdicts were inconsistent. Id., 242. Citing the same language that this court had used in <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>supra, 178 Conn. 708-709, this court stated that \u201ca factually inconsistent verdict will not be overturned on appeal.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DeCaro, </em>supra, 242. Nevertheless, this court then addressed the defendant\u2019s claim, brought pursuant to <em>Manning, </em>that \u201cher conviction on the forgery charges <em>logically </em>cannot be squared with her acquittal on the larceny charges,\u201d and apparently assumed, without deciding, that her claim that the jury logically could not have concluded that the evidence was insufficient to support the larceny charge while concluding that it was sufficient to support the forgery charge was somehow distinct from a claim of factual inconsistency.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (Emphasis in original). Id., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>243, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>supra, 162 Conn. 123 (\u201c[w]hile an inconsistent verdict is not objectionable in itself, its inconsistency may be considered insofar as it supports a claim that the jury\u2019s conclusion was not reasonably and logically reached\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). This court concluded that, even assuming that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that she had altered the documents with intent to defraud, deceive or injure another, as required under the larceny statute, the evidence was sufficient to establish that the defendant had committed forgery by altering public documents in an effort to conceal her inadequate accounting and record keeping. Accordingly, we concluded that the verdict was not logically inconsistent. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeCaro, </em>supra, 243. In addition, because the elements of the crimes were different, we concluded that the verdict was not legally inconsistent. Id., 245; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>266 Conn. 658, 673-74, 835 A.2d 47 (2003) (assuming, without deciding, that legally inconsistent, factually inconsistent and logically inconsistent verdicts may be treated differently and concluding that logically inconsistent verdicts by separate fact finders are permissible).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Thus, <em>Manning </em>and a number of later cases have recognized three types of claims involving an inconsistency between a conviction and an acquittal: (1) claims of factual inconsistency \u2014 i.e., claims that the jury found that evidence that was insufficient to support a set of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>facts necessary to convict on one offense was sufficient to support the same set of facts necessary to convict on another offense \u2014 that are effectively not reviewable;<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> (2) claims of legal inconsistency \u2014 i.e., claims involving a conviction of one offense and an acquittal of a lesser included offense \u2014 which this court has assumed may result in a reversal of the conviction, without deciding that question; and (3) claims of a logical inconsistency between a conviction and an acquittal, which this court also has assumed may result in a reversal of the conviction, again without deciding that question. A careful review of our cases involving inconsistent verdicts, however, reveals that this classification is based on a misinterpretation of the earlier cases. In <em>Whiteside, </em>this court held <em>without qualification </em>that a factually inconsistent verdict could not be set aside unless the conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence. <em>State v. Whiteside, </em>supra, 148 Conn. 214; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 6; <em>State </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 620 n.2; <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>supra, 178 Conn. 708-709. In <em>Keating, </em>this court did not mention <em>Whiteside, </em>but appeared to assume that whether either a factually or legally inconsistent verdict must be set aside was an open question.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Keat-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number><em>ing, </em>supra, 151 Conn. 595-96. Because the court concluded that the verdict was neither factually nor legally inconsistent, it did not address the question of whether either type of inconsistency would require reversal of the conviction. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">In <em>Manning, </em>this court recognized the general rule that \u201c [consistency in the verdict is not necessary\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>supra, 162 Conn. 122; but also held that \u201c[w]hile an inconsistent verdict is not objectionable in itself, its inconsistency may be considered insofar as it supports a claim that the jury\u2019s conclusion was not reasonably and logically reached.\u201d Id., 123. In reaching this conclusion, this court first referred to language from a number of cases in which the defendant sought to set aside the verdict for insufficiency of the evidence stating that, in reviewing such claims, \u201cwe decide only whether the jury could reasonably and logically have reached the conclusion which they did. <em>Akers </em>v. <em>Singer, </em>158 Conn. 29, 32, 255 A.2d 858 [1969]; <em>Conti </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>149 Conn. 465, 467, 181 A.2d 591 [1962]; <em>Desmarais </em>v. <em>Pinto, </em>147 Conn. 109, 110, 157 A.2d 596 [1960].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>supra, 122-23. This court then assumed that that standard had been applied in <em>Keating. </em>Id., 123. In <em>Keating, </em>however, this court had merely recognized that a verdict may be inconsistent either factually or legally and assumed, without deciding, that an inconsistent verdict could be set aside. <em>State </em>v. <em>Keating, </em>supra, 151 Conn. 596. We did not suggest in <em>Keating </em>that, even if an inconsistent verdict was \u201cnot objectionable in itself, its inconsistency may be considered insofar as it supports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>a claim that the jury\u2019s conclusion was not reasonably and logically reached.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>supra, 123. Indeed, the only reason that we can perceive that an inconsistency between a conviction and an acquittal might be objectionable in the first instance is that the inconsistency suggests that the verdict was \u201cnot reasonably and logically reached.\u201d Id.; see <em>Brown </em>v. <em>State, </em>182 Md. App. 138, 156 n.10, 957 A.2d 654 (2008) (\u201c[a] factually inconsistent verdict is one where a jury renders different verdicts on crimes with distinct elements when there was only one set of proof at a given trial, which makes the verdict illogical\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Because inconsistent verdicts are generally permissible and are inherently illogical, we have difficulty understanding why an inconsistent verdict would not be permissible if the inconsistency supported a claim that the jury had acted illogically. Such an exception would entirely swallow the rule. We further note that, although this court assumed without deciding in <em>DeCaro </em>and <em>Knight </em>that factually, legally and logically inconsistent verdicts should be treated differently and that legally or logically inconsistent verdicts may be set aside, this court never has set aside a verdict on the ground that a conviction on one charge was legally or logically inconsistent with an acquittal on another charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Accordingly, we now repudiate our suggestion in <em>Manning </em>that an inconsistent verdict may be reversed if it supports a finding that the jury acted unreasonably or illogically and reaffirm our holdings in <em>Whiteside </em>and <em>Rosado </em>that factually and logically inconsistent verdicts are permissible. We also now address the question that we avoided in <em>Keating, Manning and DeCaro </em>\u2014 namely, whether legally inconsistent verdicts are permissible\u2014 and answer that question in the affirmative.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In reach<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>ing this conclusion, we axe persuaded by the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>supra, 469 U.S. 62, in which the court reaffirmed its holding in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>supra, 284 U.S. 393, that \u201c[consistency in the verdict is not necessary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>la Powell, </em>the defendant argued that <em>Dunn </em>did not apply in cases in which the defendant was convicted of a compound offense but was acquitted of a predicate offense. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>supra, 60 (defendant contended that, because conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute was element of \u201ctelephone facilitation,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>acquittal on former charge mandated acquittal on latter charge). The United States Supreme Court rejected this claim. The court reasoned that \u201cinconsistent verdicts . . . should not necessarily be interpreted as a windfall to the [gjovemment at the defendant\u2019s expense. It is equally possible that the jury, convinced of guilt, properly reached its conclusion on the compound offense, and then through mistake, compromise, or lenity, arrived at an inconsistent conclusion on the lesser offense.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> But in such situations the [government has no recourse if it wishes to correct the jury\u2019s error; the [gjovemment is precluded from appealing or otherwise upsetting such an acquittal by the [constitution\u2019s [double [j Jeopardy [cjlause.\u201d Id., 65. \u201cThe fact that the inconsistency may be the result of lenity, coupled with the [gjovemment\u2019s inability to invoke review, suggests that inconsistent verdicts should not be reviewable.\u201d Id., 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The court in <em>Powell </em>also noted that \u201can individualized assessment of the reason for the inconsistency would be based either on pure speculation, or would require inquiries into the jury\u2019s deliberations that courts generally will not undertake.\u201d Id. Finally, the court recognized that \u201ca criminal defendant already is afforded protection against jury irrationality or error by the independent review of the sufficiency of the evidence undertaken by the trial and appellate courts.\u201d Id., 67. Because this reasoning is consistent with our decisions in <em>Whiteside </em>and <em>Rosado, </em>we find it persuasive. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaston, </em>198 Conn. 490, 492-93, 503 A.2d 1157 (1986) (agreeing, in dictum, with court\u2019s holding in <em>Powell </em>that inconsistent verdicts are not reviewable); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>3 Conn. App. 374, 389, 489 A.2d 386 (rejecting, under <em>Powell, </em>\u201cdefendant\u2019s argument that reviewability depends on a distinction between factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>and legal inconsistency\u201d), cert. denied, 196 Conn. 803, 492 A.2d 1239 (1985). Accordingly, we conclude that claims of legal inconsistency between a conviction and an acquittal are not reviewable.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We therefore affirm the decision of the Appellate Court that the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal on this alternate ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b580-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, acting either alone or with one or more persons, he commits or attempts to commit robbery . . . and, in the course of and in furtherance of such crime or of flight therefrom, he, or another participant, if any, causes the death of a person other than one of the participants . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b580-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of robbery in the first degree when, in the course of the commission of the crime of robbery as defined in section 53a-133 or of immediate flight therefrom, he or another participant in the crime ...

Whether the informer\u2019s testimony has been affected by interest or prejudice against the defendant is for you to determine. In making that determination, you should consider: (1) whether the witness has received anything (including pay, immunity from prosecution, leniency in prosecution, personal advantage, or vindication) in exchange for testimony; (2) any other case in which the informant testified or offered statements against an individual but was not called, and whether the statements were admitted in the case, and whether the informant received any deal, promise, inducement, or benefit in exchange for that testimony or statement; (3) whether the informant has ever changed his or her testimony; (4) the criminal history of the informant; and (5) any other evidence relevant to the informer\u2019s credibility.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

In <em>Price </em>v. <em>State, </em>405 Md. 10, 949 A.2d 619 (2008), the concurring justice provided the following example of a factually inconsistent verdict: \u201cAssume a legally intoxicated or otherwise reckless driver causes a head-on collision, killing on impact the driver and passenger of the other car. The intoxicated driver is charged with two counts of vehicular homicide. The jury convicts the defendant of vehicular homicide as to the death of the driver of the other car, but finds the defendant not guilty of the same crime with regard to the death of the passenger. Such a result would constitute factually inconsistent verdicts.\u201d Id., 36 <em>(Harrell, J., </em>concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b601-7\"> This may be because <em>Keating </em>involved inconsistent verdicts among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>coconspirators, and not, as in <em>Whiteside, </em>inconsistent verdicts involving a single defendant.

In <em>Ex parte State, </em>Supreme Court of Alabama, Docket No. 1060203 (June 13, 2008), the Supreme Court of Alabama explained the difference between cases involving an inconsistency between a conviction and an acquittal and cases involving an inconsistency between convictions as follows: \u201c [MJutually exclusive [convictions] are the result of two positive findings of fact that cannot logically coexist. In other words, it is legally impossible for the [s]tate to prove the elements of both crimes. . . . Mutually exclusive [convictions] exist when a guilty verdict on one count logically excludes a guilty verdict on another count. In contrast, inconsistent verdicts can exist where there is a verdict of guilty and another of not guilty . . . .\u201d The Alabama court further explained that, for the reasons set forth in <em>Powell, </em>the corut \u201cwill not disturb guilty verdicts on the basis of apparent inconsistencies [between a conviction and an acquittal] so long as there is sufficient evidence to support the [conviction]. However, mutually exclusive [convictions] are contradictory and cannot be reconciled. [Convictions] are mutually exclusive if the existence of any of the elements of one offense negates the existence of any of the elements for another offense of which the defendant also stands convicted.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"ALG_\">We also express no opinion as to whether factually or legally inconsistent verdicts in cases tried solely to the court are permissible. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 671-72 (stating in dictum that rationale for permitting inconsistent jury verdicts does not apply to inconsistent verdicts rendered by judge).</p>\n<p id=\"AsxC\">Finally, our holding in the present case does not apply to civil cases. See <em>Kregos </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>88 Conn. App. 459, 470, 872 A.2d 901 (in civil cases, \u201c[a] verdict that is inconsistent or ambiguous should be set aside\u201d), cert. denied, 275 Conn. 901, 882 A.2d 672 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b605-7\"> Of course, if there is evidence that the jury reached an inconsistent verdict as the result of juror misconduct, <em>Powell </em>would not bar review of that claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b606-14\"> Most state courts follow this approach.
