The state appeals, upon our grant of its petition for certification,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the judgment of the Appellate Court reversing the trial court\u2019s judgment, rendered after a jury trial, convicting the defendant of two counts of risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 53-21 (1) and (2), and one count of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2). <em>State </em>v. <em>Angel T., </em>105 Conn. App. 568, 569, 939 A.2d 611 (2008). On appeal, the state claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the prosecutor had committed impropriety that deprived the defendant of his right to a fair trial by introducing evidence of, and arguing during summations about, the fact that the defendant, while being represented by an attorney, had failed to meet with the police during their investigation of the victim\u2019s allegations. We conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s questions and comments were inappropriate because they implied that the jury could infer the defendant\u2019s guilt from his retention of an attorney during the police investigation, and that these comments deprived the defendant of a fair trial because the state has failed to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that it is not reasonably likely that the jury\u2019s verdict would have been different absent the sum total of the improprieties. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The Appellate Court\u2019s opinion sets forth the following relevant facts and procedural history. \u201cThe victim, then age ten, was the defendant\u2019s niece, and the defendant lived at the victim\u2019s family residence. In July or August, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>1999, the defendant, on three occasions, entered the victim\u2019s bedroom while she was asleep. During the first two occasions, the defendant touched the victim\u2019s legs and tried to pull down her pajama pants. Each time the victim kicked the defendant, and he left the room before he succeeded in removing her pants. On the third occasion, the defendant entered the victim\u2019s bedroom while she was asleep, pulled down her pajama pants, held her legs tightly and licked and bit her in the vaginal area. After the victim hit and kicked the defendant and called out for her father, the defendant left the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">\u201cTwo days after the third incident, the victim told her parents about the defendant\u2019s actions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Her parents confronted the defendant, and, shortly thereafter, he moved out of the residence to New Jersey. No report was made to police at that time. In May, 2004, the victim\u2019s mother told a family counselor about the defendant\u2019s conduct, and the counselor reported those allegations to the police, who initiated a criminal investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">\u201cDuring the investigation, Bryan Bishop, a police detective, attempted to interview the defendant. Bishop left a telephone message to that effect for the defendant in New Jersey. The following day, Bishop received a telephone call from Ron Sanchez, who identified himself as the defendant\u2019s attorney. Sanchez and Bishop scheduled an interview of the defendant by the police, which was to take place at Sanchez\u2019 office in New Jersey on July 7, 2004. When Bishop contacted Sanchez on July 6, 2004, to confirm the interview, Sanchez told Bishop that he could no longer make contact with the defendant. As a result of that conversation, Bishop did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>not travel to New Jersey to interview the defendant but later repeatedly called the defendant\u2019s telephone number in New Jersey without successfully contacting him.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\u201cAt trial, in the state\u2019s case, the prosecutor solicited testimony on direct examination from the victim, the victim\u2019s mother and the counselor indicating that each individual had given written statements to the police. The prosecutor solicited testimony from Bishop in the state\u2019s case that Bishop had taken written statements from the victim, the victim\u2019s mother and others. The prosecutor also presented testimony that Bishop had sought a statement from the defendant, whom he had located in New Jersey, but that when Bishop later spoke with Sanchez, Sanchez claimed that he could not contact the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>\u201cWhen the defendant testified in his case on direct examination, he denied sexually assaulting the victim. During his direct examination, the defendant did not testify about giving the police a statement. The prosecutor, however, on cross-examination, asked the defendant about his failure to submit to the police interview in July, 2004. In so doing, the prosecutor asked the defendant why he did not speak with the police. In response, the defendant testified that his attorney\u2019s advice was not to speak to anyone about the matter. The defendant testified that his attorney instructed him that he could not talk to anybody and that his attorney would represent him in all matters. In response to the prosecutor\u2019s question about whether the lawyer would not let [the defendant] talk to the police even with the lawyer present, the defendant replied in the affirmative, but added that he never talked to the police.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>\u201cDuring opening summation, the prosecutor argued that Bishop\u2019s failure to meet with the defendant was through no fault of the detective himself. The prosecutor commented that the detective had gathered information from the victim and her family, and also had attempted without success to get information from the defendant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defense counsel, during summation, did not touch on the police attempts to interview the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>\u201cThe prosecutor then argued in closing summation that Bishop had wanted to interview the defendant and that there were three versions as to why the interview had not taken place, the defendant\u2019s, Sanchez\u2019 and Bishop\u2019s. The prosecutor argued that Bishop was an impartial investigator reaching out to see what everybody had to say and that Bishop would have benefited from the defendant\u2019s interview in evaluating the case. Once contacted by the defendant\u2019s attorney, the prosecutor stated that Bishop \u2018play[ed] it straight up\u2019 and tried \u2018to go through that attorney\u2019 but was told that the attorney could not contact the defendant. The prosecutor also stated that Bishop testified that he had received no response when he attempted later to contact the defendant directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\u201cLater in closing summation, in discussing the defendant\u2019s credibility, the prosecutor pointed out that the defendant was provided with an opportunity to help with the investigation and asked the jury if he elected to do so. The prosecutor remarked that on the witness stand, the defendant gave the impression that it was always someone else\u2019s fault because the defendant wanted the interview but that Bishop changed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>appointment.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Stale </em>v. <em>Angel T., </em>supra, 105 Conn. App. 569-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Thereafter, the jury returned a verdict finding the defendant guilty of one count of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2), and two counts of risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (1) and (2). The jury, however, found the defendant not guilty of additional charges of one count of attempted sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2) and 53a-70 (a) (2), and one count of attempted risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2) and 53-21 (2). The trial court rendered a judgment of conviction in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict and sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of fifteen years imprisonment, execution suspended after ten years, and probation with special conditions including sexual offender evaluation and registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">The defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction to the Appellate Court, claiming that the prosecutor improperly had questioned him about his failure to meet with the police after they had contacted his attorney, and then commented on that testimony during summations. Id., 573. The Appellate Court, relying on, inter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>alia, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Liddy, </em>509 F.2d 428 (D.C. Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 420 U.S. 911, 95 S. Ct. 833, 42 L. Ed. 2d 842 (1975), concluded that \u201c[t]he state\u2019s introduction of evidence of the defendant\u2019s silence in response to police questioning, on advice of counsel, violated his right against compulsory self-incrimination, \u2019\u2019 and that \u201cthe state\u2019s introduction of such evidence and the adverse comments at trial on that evidence by the prosecutor were improper.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Angel T., </em>supra, 105 Conn. App. 576. Employing the six factor analysis from <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 540, 529 A.2d 653 (1987),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Appellate Court also concluded that the prosecutorial impropriety had deprived the defendant of his right to a fair trial because \u201c[t]he case against the defendant was not overwhelming\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Angel T., </em>supra, 577; it was uninvited by the defense and \u201cthe defendant\u2019s refusal to be interviewed by the police [was] a prominent part of the state\u2019s case.\u201d Id., 578. Accordingly, the Appellate Court reversed the judgment of conviction and ordered a new trial. Id. This certified appeal followed. See footnote 1 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">On appeal, the state claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the defendant was deprived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>of a fair trial by the prosecutor\u2019s questioning, and his commentary during summations regarding the defendant\u2019s having retained counsel and his failure to meet with the police in connection with the case. Relying on, inter alia, <em>State </em>v. <em>Cabral, </em>275 Conn. 514, 881 A.2d 247, cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1048, 126 S. Ct. 773, 163 L. Ed. 2d 600 (2005), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Alston, </em>272 Conn. 432, 862 A.2d 817 (2005), the state argues that this evidence properly demonstrates the \u201csequence of the events as they unfolded\u201d in connection with the investigative efforts of the police. The state emphasizes further that its cross-examination of the defendant concerning his missed appointment with the police was permissible because the defendant testified at trial, which meant that, like any other witness, his credibility was subject to impeachment. The state then relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>100 Conn. App. 236, 917 A.2d 1051, cert. denied, 284 Conn. 933, 935 A.2d 153 (2007), and contends that the comments during summation properly portrayed Bishop\u2019s investigation as fair and thorough, and did not constitute an improper invitation for the jury to infer the defendant\u2019s guilt on the basis of his decision to consult an attorney. Finally, the state claims that any impropriety that may have occurred was harmless under <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 540, because, inter alia, it was not severe, as shown by the defendant\u2019s failure to object at trial, and the corroborating testimony of the victim\u2019s mother and cousin rendered the state\u2019s case a strong one.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">In response, the defendant, positing that the failure of his trial counsel to object to the prosecutor\u2019s questions and comments was \u201c[i]nexplicabl[e],\u201d contends that they were improper because they penalized him for having asserted fundamental constitutional rights, including the right to counsel, the privilege against self-incrimination and the attorney-client privilege. In particular, the defendant relies on <em>United States ex rel. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number><em>Macon </em>v. <em>Yeager, </em>476 F.2d 613 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 855, 94 S. Ct. 154, 38 L. Ed. 2d 104 (1973), for the proposition that the prosecutor had committed impropriety by bringing to the jury\u2019s attention the fact that the defendant had hired an attorney at the time he was approached by the police for an interview, thereby \u201csubtly suggesting] \u201d that \u201cinnocent people help the police when requested to do so, and don\u2019t need lawyers.\u201d Relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>210 Conn. 481, 556 A.2d 154 (1989), the defendant also contends that the \u201csequence of the events\u201d exception relied upon by the state is inapposite since that exception applies only to persons in custody who, while making a statement to the police, can either change their minds and elect to stop speaking or request counsel, or both; in contrast, the defendant in this case never made a statement to the police of any kind. Finally, the defendant contends that the prosecutorial impropriety deprived him of a fair trial because it was uninvited and pervasive, and the state\u2019s case against him was not particularly strong. We conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s questioning and commentary were improper and deprived the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\u201cBefore we address the merits of the defendant\u2019s claims, we briefly set forth the standard of review and the general framework of the law governing claims of prosecutorial [impropriety]. At the outset, we note that the defendant\u2019s trial counsel did not object to the remarks at issue in this appeal. Although these claims are unpreserved, we have recently stated that a defendant who fails to preserve claims of prosecutorial [impropriety] need not seek to prevail under the specific requirements of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>[213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989)], and, similarly, it is unnecessary for a reviewing court to apply the four-prong <em>Golding </em>test. . . . The reason for this is that the defendant in a claim of prosecutorial [impropriety] must establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>that the prosecutorial [impropriety] was so serious as to amount to a denial of due process .... In evaluating whether the [impropriety] rose to this level, we consider the factors enumerated by this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>[supra, 204 Conn. 540]. . . . The consideration of the fairness of the entire trial through the <em>Williams </em>factors duplicates, and, thus makes superfluous, a separate application of the <em>Golding </em>test. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">\u201cFurthermore, the application of the <em>Golding </em>test to unchallenged incidents of [impropriety] tends to encourage analysis of each incident in isolation from one another. Because the inquiry must involve the entire trial, all incidents of [impropriety] must be viewed in relation to one another and within the context of the entire trial. The object of inquiry before a reviewing court in [due process] claims involving prosecutorial [impropriety], therefore, is . . . only the fairness of the entire trial, and not the specific incidents of [impropriety] themselves. Application of the <em>Williams </em>factors provides for such an analysis .... Accordingly, we apply only the <em>Williams </em>factors to unpreserved claims of prosecutorial [impropriety], . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">\u201c[I]n analyzing claims of prosecutorial [impropriety], we engage in a two step analytical process. The two steps are separate and distinct: (1) whether [impropriety] occurred in the first instance; and (2) whether that [impropriety] deprived a defendant of his due process right to a fair trial. Put differently, [impropriety] is [impropriety], regardless of its ultimate effect on the fairness of the trial; whether that [impropriety] caused or contributed to a due process violation is a separate and distinct question that may only be resolved in the context of the entire trial . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Luster, </em>279 Conn. 414, 426-28, 902 A.2d 636 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">We first consider whether the prosecutor\u2019s lines of questioning, and comments thereon during summation, constituted prosecutorial impropriety. Although the Appellate Court has observed that \u201cprosecutors tread on extremely thin ice when they comment on a defendant\u2019s decision to consult with counsel\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>supra, 100 Conn. App. 247; this case presents us with our first opportunity to consider a claim of prose-cutorial impropriety arising from the factual scenario under which a defendant had hired an attorney while claims against him were being investigated by law enforcement officials, but before any custodial interrogation or adversarial criminal proceedings had been instituted.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, we begin with the seminal decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in <em>United States ex rel. Macon </em>v. <em>Yeager, </em>supra, 476 F.2d 614, wherein the defendant had been convicted of manslaughter following an altercation subsequent to a minor automobile accident. During his summation at the defendant\u2019s criminal trial, the prosecutor had commented on the defendant\u2019s actions after the incident, evidence of which had been elicited during cross-examination, noting that the defendant drove away, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>disposed of the gun, hid his tom shirt, and \u201c[got] up the next morning and lo and behold, what does he do? <em>He call[ed] his lawyer. These are acts of </em>innocence?\u201d (Emphasis altered; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. On appeal, the court agreed with the defendant\u2019s argument that \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s statement concerning his telephone call to counsel sought, or at least may reasonably be expected to have tended, to raise in the minds of the jurors an inference of guilt and, as a result, penalized him for the exercise of his constitutional right to counsel.\u201d Id., 615. Relying on <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 615, 85 S. Ct. 1229, 14 L. Ed. 2d 106 (1965), wherein the United States Supreme Court concluded that a prosecutor\u2019s mention of the defendant\u2019s failure to testify in his own defense violated the fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination; see footnote 12 of this opinion; the Third Circuit stated, \u201cwe perceive little, if any, valid distinction between the privilege against self-incrimination and the right to counsel. It can be argued, with equal vigor and logical support, as to either the <em>Griffin </em>situation or the present case, that a prosecutor\u2019s comment seeking to raise in the jurors\u2019 minds an inference of guilt from the defendant\u2019s constitutionally protected conduct constitutes a \u2018penalty\u2019 on the free exercise of a constitutional right.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>United States ex rel. Macon </em>v. <em>Yeager, </em>supra, 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>The case law cited in the parties\u2019 briefs, as well as our independent research, reveal that the vast majority of the federal and state courts, including our Appellate Court, that have considered this issue have followed <em>Yeager </em>and have concluded that prosecutors may not suggest that a defendant\u2019s retention of counsel is inconsistent with his or her innocence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The constitutional foundations for these decisions are, however, varied in nature. Some of these courts, including our Appellate Court, base this conclusion on the defendant\u2019s rights to counsel under the fifth or sixth amendments to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>United States constitution.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>United States </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>620 F.2d 559, 563-64 (5th Cir. 1980) (comment that defendant\u2019s attorney was present during execution of search warrant on defendant\u2019s house violated sixth amendment), on appeal after remand, 672 F.2d 864 (11th Cir. 1982); <em>Zemina </em>v. <em>Solem, </em>438 F.

In our view, this prohibition necessarily is founded in the fourteenth amendment due process assurances of a fair trial under which proscriptions on prosecutorial impropriety are rooted generally.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Ritrovato, </em>280 Conn. 36, 61-62, 905 A.2d 1079 (2006). Indeed, the sixth amendment right to counsel does not attach until the commencement of adversary judicial proceedings via the filing of the information at arraignment; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierre, </em>277 Conn. 42, 96-97, 890 A.2d 474, cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1197, 126 S. Ct. 2873, 165 L. Ed. 2d 904 (2006); and the separate and distinct fifth amendment right to counsel is limited to custodial interrogations by government agents, a situation not implicated in the present case, wherein the defendant had not made <em>any </em>statement to law enforcement authorities. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>290 Conn. 261, 270-71, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>962 A.2d 781 (2009). Thus, because these particularized rights had not yet attached when the defendant contacted his attorney, they are not implicated directly by the prosecutor\u2019s conduct in the present case. Nevertheless, we are mindful that \u201c \u2018[m]ost jurors . . . are not schooled in the law\u2019 <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 632 A.2d 433; and that from such \u201cevidence and arguments, a juror might easily draw the inference . . . that it was [the defendant\u2019s] idea to seek counsel because he had done something for which he needed a lawyer to defend him.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 434. Accordingly, we view \u201c[e]vidence of a criminal defendant\u2019s consultation with an attorney [as] highly prejudicial, as it is likely to give rise to the improper inference that a defendant in a criminal case is, or at least believes himself to be, guilty.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Martin </em>v. <em>State, </em>364 Md. 692, 708, 775 A.2d 385 (App. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Relying on a line of our cases that has applied the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 619, 96 S.

Rather, this evidence is admissible only when the nature and scope of the police investigation and the defendant\u2019s statements in connection therewith are directly at issue.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Montgom</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number><em>ery, </em>254 Conn. 694, 716-17 n.30, 759 A.2d 995 (2000) (evidence admitted pursuant to <em>Doyle </em>exception is inadmissible for purposes of impeachment or proving affirmative guilt); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 490-91 (concluding that state violated <em>Doyle </em>by introducing evidence, and emphasizing during summations, that defendant had invoked his right to silence and requested counsel, but had not made any statement to police at time of arrest).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The state\u2019s reliance on <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>supra, 100 Conn. App. 236, similarly is misplaced. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>supra, 246-47, the Appellate Court concluded that testimony and argument that the defendant had contacted his attorney shortly after the shooting with which he was charged, and then had gone with the attorney to the police, did not violate his right to a fair trial because his own attorney had elicited that testimony, and the prosecutor\u2019s argument was a \u201cdirect response\u201d to the defendant\u2019s argument that he had \u201cdone \u2018the right thing\u2019 \u201d by quickly reporting the shooting, which he claimed had been in self-defense. See id. (noting \u201cevidence that the defendant \u2018ditched\u2019 his rifle, left the scene of the shooting, showered, called his attorney and, accompanied by his attorney, gave a statement to the police\u201d). The Appellate Court further emphasized that \u201cthe prosecutor in <em>[Santiago} </em>did not improperly appeal to the jury to infer guilt from the defendant\u2019s having contacted an attorney and having received the counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>of an attorney. The prosecutor\u2019s specific references to these facts in evidence were isolated and <em>appear to have been directed at clarifying the sequence of events described by the defendant\u2019s counsel as well as the positive inferences that defense counsel invited the jury to draw therefrom. </em>It would be fundamentally unfair to the state were we to permit the defendant\u2019s attorney to comment on the evidence of his conduct after the shooting and to suggest reasonable inferences to be drawn from that conduct, while precluding the state from doing the same in response.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 247. <em>Santiago, </em>therefore, is inapposite, as the attorney contact in the present case: (1) does not implicate the defendant\u2019s conduct that followed the commission of the offense charged; and (2) was not first introduced by the defendant at trial. Accordingly, we conclude that the elicitation of evidence, and the commentary that the defendant, while represented by counsel, had failed to help the police investigation, improperly and impliedly encouraged the jury to infer the defendant\u2019s guilt.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Accordingly, we now determine whether the prosecu-torial impropriety deprived the defendant of his due process right to a fair trial.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Under the well established analysis of <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 540, we consider: (1) \u201cthe extent to which the [impropriety] was invited by defense conduct or argument\u201d; (2) \u201cthe severity of the [impropriety]\u201d; (3) \u201cthe frequency of the [impropriety]\u201d; (4) \u201cthe centrality of the [impropriety] to the critical issues in the case\u201d; (5) \u201cthe strength of the curative measures adopted\u201d; and (6) \u201cthe strength of the state\u2019s case.\u201d \u201cIn determining whether the defendant was denied a fair trial [by virtue of prosecutorial impropriety] we must view the prosecutor\u2019s comments in the context of the entire trial. . . . The question of whether the defendant has been prejudiced by prosecutorial [impropriety], therefore, depends on whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury\u2019s verdict would have been different absent the sum total of the improprieties.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Luster, </em>supra, 279 Conn. 442; see also, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>266 Conn. 440, 460, 832 A.2d 626 (2003) (seminal case articulating standard). Finally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>the state bears the burden of demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that there is no reasonable likelihood that the jury\u2019s verdict would have been different absent the improprieties at issue.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>269 Conn. 563, 572-74, 849 A.2d 626 (2004) (concluding that prosecutorial misconduct due process analysis under <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 540, embodies fourth prong of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 240).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">We note at the outset that, with respect to the first <em>Williams </em>factor, the state concedes that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>did not invite the impropriety. Turning to the second factor, namely, the severity of the impropriety; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 540; the state contends that the defendant\u2019s failure to object, or to move for a mistrial or curative instructions in response to the prosecutor\u2019s questions and comments, belies his contention on appeal that the improprieties were an egregious due process violation. In response, the defendant contends that the impropriety was severe because it was a \u201cdirect assault\u201d on the defendant\u2019s exercise of his constitutional right to counsel, and the questions and comments implied that he was guilty because he was tiying to hide something. With respect to the severity of this impropriety, it is well established that \u201c [w]hen considering whether prosecutorial [impropriety] was severe, this court considers] it highly significant that defense counsel failed to object to any of the improper remarks, request curative instructions, or move for a mistrial. . . . A failure to object demonstrates that defense counsel presumably [did] not view the alleged impropriety as prejudicial enough to jeopardize seriously the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Luster, </em>supra, 279 Conn. 443. Thus, because the defendant failed to object or to seek curative measures at trial, we conclude that this factor supports the state\u2019s contention that the prosecutorial impropriety was not particularly severe.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Defense counsel\u2019s failure to object at trial is, however, \u201cnot by itself fatal to a defendant\u2019s claim . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ritrovato, </em>supra, 280 Conn. 68. Thus, the apparent lack of severity with respect to the impropriety is counterbalanced in part by the third <em>Williams </em>factor, namely, \u201cthe frequency of the [impropriety]\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 540; which is not specifically addressed by the state. Having reviewed the record, we conclude that the improper questions and commentary were not isolated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>in nature. The state elicited the improper evidence through two witnesses, specifically, through its direct examination of Bishop and its cross-examination of the defendant, and then discussed the evidence at length dining both its opening and rebuttal summations. Accordingly, the impropriety was not isolated to a discrete part of the trial. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Warholic, </em>278 Conn. 354, 398, 897 A.2d 569 (2006) (\u201cthe instances of prosecutorial misconduct were not isolated because they occurred during both the cross-examination of the defendant and the prosecutor\u2019s closing and rebuttal arguments\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The fourth <em>Williams </em>factor is \u201cthe centrality of the [impropriety] to the critical issues in the case . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 540. The state contends that the questions and comments were not a central part of its case, which focused on the credibility contest between the victim and the defendant, but instead referred to an \u201cancillary credibility contest\u201d between Bishop and the defendant, specifically, whether to believe Bishop\u2019s statement that the interview did not take place because Sanchez\u2019 office could not locate the defendant, or the defendant\u2019s statement that Sanchez had told the defendant that the police had cancelled the interview. The defendant argues in response that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were \u201cdevastating\u201d to his credibility generally because they had the effect of informing the jury that the defendant had avoided an interview while using his attorney as a buffer. We agree with the defendant that the impropriety was central to the present case, which turned largely on the credibility of the victim versus that of the defendant, and the impropriety gave the clear impression that the defendant, who was not speaking to the police and had retained an attorney in connection with the investigation, had something to hide.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>With respect to the fifth factor, namely, \u201cthe strength of the curative measures adopted\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 540; the state concedes that the trial court did not implement any corrective measures directed specifically at the improper questions and comments. We agree with the state, however, that this lack of curative measures is attributable directly to the defendant\u2019s failure to object at trial to the improper questions and comments, which means that he \u201cbears much of the responsibility for the fact that these claimed improprieties went uncured. We emphasize the responsibility of defense counsel, at the very least, to object to perceived prosecutorial improprieties as they occur at trial, and we continue to adhere to the well established maxim that defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s argument [or cross-examination questions] when [they were] made suggests that defense counsel did not believe that [they were] unfair in light of the record of the case at the time. . . . Moreover . . . defense counsel may elect not to object to arguments [or cross-examination questions] that he or she deems marginally objectionable for tactical reasons, namely, because he or she does not want to draw the jury\u2019s attention to [them] or because he or she wants to later refute that argument [or line of questioning]. . . . The same principles hold true in regard to requests for special instructions. The failure by the defendant to request specific curative instructions frequently indicates on appellate review that the challenged instruction did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>supra, 269 Conn. 597-98; see also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Ritrovato, </em>supra, 280 Conn. 68 (\u201cprosecutorial [impropriety] claims [are] not intended to provide an avenue for the tactical sandbagging of our trial courts\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Finally, we consider the sixth <em>Williams </em>factor, namely, \u201cthe strength of the state\u2019s case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 540. The state, relying on the corroborating testimony of the victim\u2019s mother and cousin;<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> see footnote 2 of this opinion; contends that the Appellate Court improperly determined that the state\u2019s case was not strong on the grounds that the victim was a minor and there was no physical evidence introduced, as well as the fact that \u201cthe jury twice reported to the court that it was deadlocked.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Angel T., </em>supra, 105 Conn. App. 577. The defendant agrees with the Appellate Court\u2019s evaluation of the strength of the state\u2019s case,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and emphasizes that the jury twice reported to the court that it was deadlocked, and that it did not return a verdict until a full day had passed after the court had delivered a Chip Smith instruction.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We conclude that, on the counts of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>the defendant was convicted, the state\u2019s case was not sufficiently strong so as to not be overshadowed by the impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">\u201c [W] e have never stated that the state\u2019s evidence must have been overwhelming in order to support a conclusion that prosecutorial [impropriety] did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>supra, 269 Conn. 596. Nevertheless, we have described \u201ca child sexual abuse case lacking conclusive physical evidence, when the prosecution\u2019s case rests on the credibility of the victim [as] \u2018not particularly strong,\u2019 \u201d even when otherwise sufficient to support a conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ceballos, </em>266 Conn. 364, 416, 832 A.2d 14 (2003). Thus, although there exists evidence in the present case supporting the defendant\u2019s conviction despite the lack of direct physical evidence linking the defendant to the sexual assault of the victim \u2014 namely, the victim\u2019s testimony and the testimony of her mother and cousin \u2014 \u201cwithout independent physical evidence to prove that the defendant had sexually assaulted [the victim], or even that [the victim] had been sexually assaulted at all, the significance of the [prosecutor\u2019s] improper conduct increases considerably.\u201d Id., 416-17. Put differently, even with the testimony by her mother and cousin that the victim had a bite mark on her vaginal area; see footnote 2 of this opinion; there was not sufficient physical evidence to permit the jury to convict this particular defendant without believing the victim\u2019s accusations. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Beaulieu, </em>274 Conn. 471, 482-83, 876 A.2d 1155 (2005) (noting that victim\u2019s credibility remained central issue because bruise on her arm was insufficient physical evidence for state to prevail without believing victim). Moreover, to the extent that the state\u2019s case was strengthened by the constancy of accusation testimony of the victim\u2019s mother and cousin, which corroborated the existence of her injury and her allegations against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>the defendant,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> the credibility of the victim\u2019s mother was subject to question in light of the evidence that she did not have a good relationship with the defendant, even prior to the victim\u2019s accusations in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Furthermore, the multiple reports of jury deadlock indicate that the fact finder itself did not view the state\u2019s case against the defendant as particularly strong. See, e.g., <em>Zappulla </em>v. <em>New York, </em>391 F.3d 462, 471 (2d Cir. 2004) (considering jury deadlock in habeas petitioner\u2019s first trial and lengthy deliberations in second trial in assessing strength of government\u2019s case), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 957, 126 S. Ct. 472, 163 L. Ed. 2d 358 (2005); <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompkins, </em>195 Cal. App. 3d 244, 251-52, 240 Cal. Rptr. 516 (1987) (rejecting argument that evidence of premeditation was strong because \u201cthe jury was deadlocked prior to the judge\u2019s statement [concerning premeditation]; necessarily, at least one of the jurors was not persuaded by the strength of the prosecution\u2019s evidence\u201d). The jury\u2019s deadlock in the present case renders more troubling its split verdict, following the Chip Smith charge, because , the split verdict suggests that the jury had doubts concerning the victim\u2019s credibility as a general matter, as it failed to credit her testimony about the defendant\u2019s earlier attempts to molest her.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>That the jury apparently had some doubts as to the victim\u2019s credibility renders even more significant the state\u2019s impermissible assault on the defendant\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Having reviewed all of the <em>Williams </em>factors, we conclude that the state has not demonstrated, beyond a reasonable doubt, the reasonable likelihood that the jury\u2019s verdict would not have been different absent the sum total of the improprieties in the present case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Luster, </em>supra, 279 Conn. 442. The prosecutorial impropriety deprived the defendant of a fair trial because it was pervasive, uninvited by the defendant and was not subjected to specific curative measures as a result of what the defendant considers to be the \u201c[i]nexplicabl[e]\u201d failure of his trial counsel to object. Moreover, the lack of physical evidence of sexual assault in the present case rendered it a credibility contest between the defendant and his accusers, and the jury\u2019s deadlock, followed by a split verdict, leads us to believe that the state\u2019s evidence did not overwhelm the jury, indicating that the jury may well have been unduly influenced by the impropriety. Accordingly, we agree with the Appellate Court\u2019s decision to order a new trial in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b284-7\"> We granted the state\u2019s petition for certification limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly determine that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s elicitation of evidence regarding a missed meeting between the police and the defendant, and his comment thereon in summation, constituted prosecutorial impropriety which deprived the defendant of his right to a fair trial?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Angel T., </em>286 Conn. 907, 907-908, 944 A.2d 979 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b285-8\"> We note that the victim told her parents of the defendant\u2019s conduct after she became uncharacteristically afraid to go to sleep alone in her bedroom.

See footnote 12 of this opinion. Thus, our analysis is based on cases arising in the context in which the defendant had retained an attorney at a time when those protections had not yet attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">We also note that the defendant\u2019s claims of impropriety in this appeal focus only on the prosecutor\u2019s questions and comments with respect to the fact that the defendant had hired an attorney at the time the police were investigating him. The defendant does not cite any case law in support of a claim that it was improper for the prosecutor to rely, for impeachment purposes, on his failure to submit to a prearrest interview standing alone. See also footnote 19 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b297-6\"> The Third Circuit further concluded that this prosecutorial impropriety was harmful because there was a \u201c \u2018reasonable possibility that [it] might have contributed to the conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States ex rel.

In particular, the court noted that \u201ccritical portions of the evidence were disputed\u201d and \u201cthe credibility of the [defendant] as a witness was a central issue. This is not a situation where the case against the [defendant] was otherwise \u2018so overwhelming\u2019 that the constitutional error did not, beyond a reasonable doubt, contribute to the conviction. . . . The prosecutor\u2019s comment concerning [the defendant\u2019s] consultation with counsel the day after the shooting incident would appear to have been directed to, and may have had the effect of, raising in the jurors\u2019 minds the inference that [the defendant] was, or at least believed himself to be, guilty. Such an inference might certainly tend to cause the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>jury to disbelieve [the defendant\u2019s] version of the story.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>United States ex rel.

In <em>Muhammad, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit concluded, without addressing any of the case law cited in this opinion, that it was not plain error in violation of the fifth or sixth amendments to the United States constitution for the prosecutor to mention that the defendant had telephoned his attorney when a state trooper stopped his coconspirators\u2019 car, which contained a large amount of cocaine. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Muhammad, </em>supra, 657-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">In <em>Riddley </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 777 So. 2d 31, the Mississippi Supreme Court was evenly divided, which resulted in the affirmance of the defendant\u2019s conviction.

Id., 34. The majority emphasized, however, that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were improper and that \u201c[a]ny reference to the seeking of legal counsel prior to police involvement in a crime should not be used against a criminal defendant as it would be more prejudicial than probative and should be excluded under the rules of evidence.\u201d Id., 35. The majority also concluded that any error was harmless on the basis of the overwhelming evidence against the defendant. Id., 35-36. In response, the dissenting justices concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s questioning and commentary about the defendant\u2019s prearrest consultation with his attorney \u201craised an impermissible inference of guilt\u201d; id., 38 (Banks, P.

In seeking legal advice or representation, the person may well believe himself culpable of some tortious or criminal conduct. But he may just as well believe himself entirely innocent or only partly culpable, or he simply may not know whether his acts or omissions are in violation of [the] law. And if he has some pre-formed belief as to his culpability or innocence, that belief may turn out to be unfounded. Indeed, common human experience would suggest that, absent some special circumstance not evident here, the most likely purpose for seeking legal advice or representation is to find out what one\u2019s status and exposure may be. If there is a rational inference to be drawn from the seeking of such advice or representation therefore, it cannot be more than that \u2014 an uncertainty. To draw an inference of consciousness of guilt from the seeking of such advice, then, is both illogical and unwarranted; the fact to be inferred \u2014 the consciousness of guilt \u2014 is not made more probable (or less probable) from the mere seeking of legal advice or representation, and so evidence of the predicate fact is simply irrelevant.\u201d <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 82 Md.

This is because evidence of prearrest, and specifically <em>pre-Miranda, </em>silence is admissible to impeach the testimony of a defendant who testifies at trial, since the rule of <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 426 U.S. 619, is predicated on the defendant\u2019s reliance on the implicit promise of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>223 Conn. 299, 318-19, 613 A.2d 242 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Plourde, </em>208 Conn. 455, 466-67, 545 A.2d 1071 (1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 1034, 109 S. Ct. 847, 102 L. Ed. 2d 979 (1989); see also <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>447 U.S. 231, 238, 100 S. Ct. 2124, 65 L. Ed. 2d 86 (1980) (\u201c[Ijmpeachment follows the defendant\u2019s own decision to cast aside his cloak of silence and advances the truth-finding function of the criminal trial. We conclude that the [fjifth [ajmendment is not violated by the use of prearrest silence to impeach a criminal defendant\u2019s credibility.\u201d); <em>Jenkins v. Anderson, </em>supra, 240 (concluding that use of prear-rest silence to impeach defendant\u2019s credibility did not violate fourteenth amendment due process clause). We note also that there is a division of authority as to whether the use of a defendant\u2019s prearrest silence as substantive evidence of his guilt is constitutionally permissible under the fifth amendment, an issue that we need not consider herein. See, e.g., <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number><em>States </em>v. <em>Muhammad, </em>502 F.3d 646, 657 n.7 (7th Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 1144, 128 S. Ct. 1104, 169 L. Ed. 2d 813 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b307-8\"> The state acknowledges that it did not brief this portion of the prosecutorial impropriety analysis before the Appellate Court, which left that court without the benefit of the state\u2019s views as that court determined whether the prosecutor\u2019s improper questions and comments deprived the defendant of a fair trial. Ordinarily, this would constitute abandonment that would preclude the state from raising this point in its subsequent certified appeal. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Saucier, </em>283 Conn. 207, 222-23, 926 A.2d 633 (2007). We will, however, exercise our discretion to review the state\u2019s arguments on this point because they are directed at an integral part of establishing a prosecutorial impropriety claim, and the certified question in this appeal; see footnote 1 of this opinion; specifically addresses this issue, thus eliminating the possibility of unfair surprise to any party. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Robert H., </em>273 Conn. 56, 86, 866 A.2d 1255 (2005) (\u201cthe state\u2019s [claim on appeal] is not properly before this court because the state did not preserve it for appeal and the claim exceeds the scope of the certified question\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b308-7\"> We first articulated the \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d standard for determining whether prosecutorial impropriety deprived the defendant of a fair trial in 2003 in <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 460, and that standard has become well established in our prosecutorial impropriety case law. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>290 Conn. 70, 77, 961 A.2d 975 (2009); <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>289 Conn. 496, 516, 958 A.2d 731 (2008); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>283 Conn. 748, 760, 931 A.2d 198 (2007); <em>State </em>v. <em>Warholic, </em>278 Conn. 354, 396, 897 A.2d 569 (2006); <em>State </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>275 Conn. 171, 180, 881 A.2d 209 (2005); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ancona, </em>270 Conn. 568, 611-12, 854 A.2d 718 (2004), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 1055, 125 S. Ct. 921, 160 L. Ed. 2d 780 (2005). That line of case law does not, however, indicate which party bears the burden of proving the. harmlessness of the prosecutorial impropriety, once established, and which level of proof is applicable. Thus, that line of cases must be harmonized with our equally well established decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>269 Conn. 563, 572-74, 849 A.2d 626 (2004), wherein we concluded that, \u201cin cases involving incidents of prosecutorial [impropriety] that were not objected to at trial ... it is unnecessary for the defendant to seek to prevail under the specific requirements of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>[supra, 213 Conn. 239-40] . . . [because] [t]he application of the <em>Williams </em>factors ... is identical to the third and fourth prongs of <em>Golding, </em>namely, whether the constitutional violation exists, and whether it was harmful.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Ritrovato, </em>supra, 280 Conn. 59 n.17; <em>State </em>v. <em>Warholic, </em>supra, 361; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ancona, </em>supra, 591-92. Inasmuch as the fourth prong of <em>Golding </em>requires the state to prove that the constitutional violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 240; we emphasize that the state bears the burden of demonstrating, beyond a reasonable doubt, the harmlessness of the prosecutorial impropriety in a given case. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>279 Conn. 139, 143, 161-62, 900 A.2d 1276 (2006) (not necessary to reach defendant\u2019s claim \u201curg[ing] this court to adopt a different standard for evaluating claims of prosecutorial [impropriety], under which a finding of prosecutorial [impropriety] would require reversal of a criminal conviction unless the state could prove that the [impropriety] was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b311-6\"> Moreover, we acknowledge that some of the harm from the impropriety might well have been mitigated by the trial court\u2019s general instructions that emphasized the jury\u2019s role in making credibility determinations, that the credibility of the defendant and the police officer witnesses was to be judged no differently than that of other witnesses and that the attorneys\u2019 arguments were not evidence. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>supra, 269 Conn. 598.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b312-7\"> The state also argues that the plausibility of the victim\u2019s allegations is supported by the fact that the delay in reporting was attributable not to the victim, but to her parents, and that the victim\u2019s mother did not intend for her disclosure of the victim\u2019s allegations to the counselor five years after the abuse had occurred to result in a public prosecution of the defendant; indeed, she became very upset upon learning that would happen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b312-8\"> With respect to the plausibility of the victim\u2019s allegations, the defendant emphasizes that the alleged assaults took place in a bedroom next to the bedroom of the victim\u2019s parents, and that the jury had to believe that the defendant was able to enter the victim\u2019s room \u2014 which she testified that she had barricaded with her bed and locked \u2014 without waking anyone else who was asleep in the apartment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b312-9\"> \u201cA Chip Smith instruction reminds the jurors that they must act unanimously, while also encouraging a deadlocked jury to reach unanimity. . . .
