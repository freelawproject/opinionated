The plaintiffs, Waterbury Twin, LLC, and 150 MH, LLC, appeal* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court dismissing their summary process action against the defendants, Renal Treatment Centers-Northeast, Inc. (Renal Treatment Centers), and Davita, Inc. (Davita).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because we conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 withdrawal of the initial summary process action required them to serve a new notice to quit prior to commencing a new summary process action against the defendants, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">The record reveals the following facts and procedural histoiy. In August, 2007, the parties entered into a written agreement whereby the plaintiffs agreed to lease commercial premises in Waterbury to the defendants for ten years. Renal Treatment Centers entered into possession of the premises on August 30, 2007, and has been in possession since.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiffs allege that the defendants have failed to pay common area maintenance charges when due, or within any applicable grace period from October, 2007, through January, 2008, and also have caused various damages to the utilities on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>the premises during the construction process. On January 18, 2008, the plaintiffs caused a notice to quit for the nonpayment of rent to be served on the defendants, directing them to vacate the premises on or before January 23, 2008.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The notice to quit was served on January 19, 2008. The defendants, however, have refused to vacate the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">On January 31, 2008, the plaintiffs served the defendants with a summary process complaint (initial complaint) with a return date of February 7, 2008, which the marshal returned to the court on February 5, 2008. On February 11, 2008, the defendants moved to dismiss the initial complaint, contending that it violated General Statutes \u00a7 47a-23a<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the summary process statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>because it had not been returned to court at least three days before the return day. On February 15, 2008, the plaintiffs withdrew the initial complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">The following day, February 16, 2008, the plaintiffs commenced this summary process action by issuing a new summary process complaint (new complaint) with a return date of March 4, 2008, which was served on February 25, 2008, and returned to the court on February 26, 2008. The plaintiffs did not serve a new notice to quit prior to issuing the new complaint in this action. Thereafter, on February 27, 2008, the defendants notified the plaintiffs by letter that they had assumed that the notice to quit had been withdrawn and the lease had been reinstated. Additionally, they enclosed a rent check for the month of March, 2008.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The plaintiffs thereafter acknowledged receiving the rent check, but informed the defendants that the notice to quit had not been withdrawn and that the lease would not be reinstated. The plaintiffs accepted the check, but applied it to the damages owed by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The defendants then moved to dismiss this action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, claiming that the plaintiffs, after withdrawing the initial complaint, were required to serve a new notice to quit prior to commencing this summary process action. The trial court, relying on the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Hird, </em>13 Conn. App. 150, 156-57, 535 A.2d 377, cert. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>denied, 209 Conn. 825, 552 A.2d 433 (1988), concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 withdrawal of the initial complaint had revived the lease by returning the parties to \u201csquare one,\u201d namely, \u201cthe status quo prior to the service of the notice to quit.\u201d The trial court concluded, therefore, that the plaintiffs were required to serve a new notice to quit prior to commencing the current action. The trial court further stated, in dicta, that the notice to quit was itself invalid, notwithstanding the fact that it \u201ctracked\u201d the language of \u00a7 47a-23, because it failed to provide adequate notice as to which moneys were due, specifically, base rent or additional rent. Accordingly, the trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and rendered judgment dismissing the new complaint. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the withdrawal of a summary process action automatically withdraws the underlying, otherwise valid, notice to quit, thus restoring the written lease and requiring the landlord to serve a new notice to quit prior to filing a second summary process action.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The plaintiffs argue that serving a new notice to quit does not promote judicial economy, and rely on a line of trial court cases holding that a subsequent summary process action may be maintained using <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>a previously served, otherwise valid notice to quit.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The plaintiffs further contend that the Appellate Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Hird, </em>supra, 13 Conn. App. 150, and <em>Bridgeport </em>v. <em>Barbour-Daniel Electronics, Inc., </em>16 Conn. App. 574, 548 A.2d 744, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 826, 552 A.2d 432 (1988), are not controlling in the present case because they involved facially defective notices to quit. In response, the defendants argue that, under <em>Hird, </em>the withdrawal of the prior summary process action had the effect of restoring the parties\u2019 written lease, thereby requiring the landlord to a serve a new notice to quit prior to commencing a new summary process action. The defendants rely on a trial court decision emphasizing the promotion of judicial economy by this bright line rule,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and note that the plaintiffs could have either amended their defective return date rather than withdrawing the initial complaint, or simply served a new notice to quit. The defendants also posit that permitting a notice to quit to survive the withdrawal of the summary process action would create uncertainty in the subsequent landlord-tenant relationship, should such proceedings not immediately be reinsti-tuted. We agree with the defendants and conclude that, if a landlord has withdrawn a summary process action filed against a tenant, the landlord is required to serve a new notice to quit pursuant to \u00a7 47a-23 prior to commencing another summary process action against that tenant under \u00a7 47a-23a.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>\u201cSummary process is a special statutory procedure designed to provide an expeditious remedy. ...

Ct. 3244, 106 L. Ed. 2d 590 (1989). Thus, the defendants\u2019 \u201cmotion to dismiss . . . properly attacks the jurisdiction of the court, essentially asserting that the plaintiff cannot as a matter of law and fact state a cause of action that should be heard by the court. . . .

Equity Group, LLC </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>285 Conn. 240, 248, 939 A.2d 1122 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">Our analysis of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims begins with the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Hird, </em>supra, 13 Conn. App. 150. In <em>Hird, </em>a landlord initially had sought to evict a tenant for violating certain lease terms governing pets and apartment conditions. Id., 152-53. In July, 1985, the landlord served a notice to quit and then initiated a summary process action that was resolved on its merits in the tenant\u2019s favor on November 6, 1985. Id., 153. The landlord then served a second notice to quit on the tenant on November 15, 1985, alleging that the tenant had failed to pay rent for November, and thereafter instituted another summary process action. Id. The landlord withdrew the second summary process action on January 29, 1986, in response to the tenant\u2019s motion to dismiss alleging that the landlord had failed to comply with applicable federal regulations. Id. The landlord refused the efforts of the tenant to restore her tenancy, and filed a third notice to quit on January 31, 1986, alleging that the tenant had failed to pay rent for January, which was followed by a summary process action shortly thereafter. Id., 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The Appellate Court first concluded that the tenant was \u201ca tenant at will\u201d in January, 1986, because the judgment in her favor on the merits in the first summary process action \u201chad \u2018revived\u2019 the original lease arrangement,\u201d thus obligating her to pay rent to the landlord.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Id., 155. The court further concluded that the lease also had survived the landlord\u2019s withdrawal of the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>summary process action on January 29, 1986, because \u201c[t]he right of [the landlord] to withdraw his action before a hearing on the merits, as allowed by [General Statutes] \u00a7 52-80,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> is absolute and unconditional. Under our law, the effect of a withdrawal, so far as the pen-dency of the action is concerned, is strictly analogous to that presented after the rendition of a final judgment or the erasure of a case from the docket. . . . The withdrawal of the summary process action on January 29, 1986, effectively erased the court slate clean as though the eviction predicated on the November 15, 1985 notice to quit possession had never been commenced. <em>The </em>[landlord] <em>and the </em>[tenant] <em>were back to square one, and the continuation of their lease </em>. . . <em>was </em>restored.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 157; see also <em>Sproviero </em>v. <em>J.M. Scott Associates, Inc., </em>108 Conn. App. 454, 464-65, 948 A.2d 379 (concluding that revival of lease obligations at \u201csquare one\u201d under <em>Hird </em>operates prospectively only and does not require \u201cretroactive revival\u201d of tenant\u2019s obligations under lease \u201cbecause the landlord is compensated for assuming a tenant\u2019s obligations through use and occupancy payments\u201d), cert, denied, 289 Conn. 906, 957 A.2d 873 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">As not\u00e9d previously, our trial courts are split on whether the withdrawal of a summary process action requires the landlord to serve another notice to quit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>prior to commencing a subsequent summary process action. See footnotes 9 and 10 of this opinion. Accordingly, in the present case, we must determine whether \u201c \u2018square one\u2019 \u201d under <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Hird, </em>supra, 13 Conn. App. 157, means the state of affairs as they existed before the filing of the notice to quit, or instead, as they existed before the filing of the complaint in the summary process action. The parties\u2019 briefs do not provide us with any authority beyond the cited Connecticut trial court cases,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and our own independent research has not yielded a great deal of assistance, with the exception of a comprehensive body of case law on this topic from our neighboring state, New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">In New York, as in Connecticut, service of a notice to quit is a jurisdictional prerequisite to a summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>process action. See, e.g., <em>Kaycee West 113thStreet Corp. </em>v. <em>Diakoff, </em>160 App. Div. 2d 573, 554 N.Y.S.2d 216 (1990). In the seminal case on this issue, the court concluded that, once a summary process action had been dismissed, the applicable statute; N.Y. Real Prop. Law \u00a7 232-a (McKinney 2006);<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201crequires the tenant to be informed of the landlord\u2019s intention by service of a new notice. Without a new notice, any subsequent summary proceeding must be dismissed.\u201d <em>Haberman </em>v. <em>Wager, </em>73 Misc. 2d 732, 734, 342 N.Y.S.2d 405 (1973). In so concluding, the court noted that the notice to quit has two functions, namely, to \u201c[end] the tenant\u2019s estate, and [to inform] him of the consequence of his failure to vacate. Because of the latter feature . . . the [legislature did not intend a . . . notice to be good forever.\u201d Id., 733. The court also noted that, following the dismissal of the first summary process action, \u201cthe tenant was entitled to a certain peace of mind. The landlord had done what in the notice he had threatened to do. He had lost. Perhaps now the landlord would lose interest in evicting the tenant. Perhaps the landlord would come to the tenant with an offer of compromise. Perhaps the landlord would be unable to cure the technical deficiencies which led to the dismissal of the first petition. All of these are things a tenant might reasonably hope.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Id., 734; see also <em>Nicolaides </em>v. <em>Division of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number><em>Housing &amp; Community Renewal, </em>231 App. Div. 2d 723, 724, 647 N.Y.S.2d 866 (1996) (\u201c[i]t is well settled that a notice of nonrenewal of a rent stabilized lease does not survive the dismissal of the first holdover action and cannot serve as the predicate for a second proceeding in a new forum\u201d); <em>Kaycee West 113th Street Corp. </em>v. <em>Diakoff, </em>supra, 573 (\u201cSince the Civil Court action was dismissed, the [thirty day] notice upon which it was predicated cannot be revived to support a new action. . . . Before the landlord commenced the new action . . . service of a new [thirty day] notice was required.\u201d [Citations omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">Moreover, the New York courts have recognized the practical value of this bright line rule, even in cases wherein the time lapse between the two summary process actions is minimal, noting that \u201cin matters procedural ... a rule of certainty is preferable to deciding on an ad hoc basis in each case whether the lapse between the two proceedings is reasonable or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Fromme </em>v. <em>Simsarian, </em>121 Misc. 2d 792, 794, 468 N.Y.S.2d 990 (1983); see also <em>Colavolpe </em>v. <em>Williams, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>77 Misc. 2d 430, 431, 354 N.Y.S.2d 309 (1974) (\u201cWithout a new [thirty day] notice, a subsequent summary proceeding must fail. It was not intended that the [thirty day] notice could hang like the sword of Damocles over the head of the tenant, to be used at some future date, at the whim of the landlord. Indeed, the tenant is entitled to know that the prior action was in all respects terminated . . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The plaintiffs claim that not requiring the service of a new notice to quit promotes judicial economy in summary process proceedings, particularly when the first notice to quit was valid. Indeed, they note that they promptly informed the defendants that the notice to quit was not being withdrawn, and that the action would be refilled, as the plaintiffs had no desire to revive the lease. Thus, the plaintiffs argue that they have performed the requisite \u201cunequivocal act which clearly demonstrates [the landlord\u2019s] intent to terminate the lease\u201d;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Sandrew </em>v. <em>Pequot Drug, Inc., 4 </em>Conn. App. 627, 631, 495 A.2d 1127 (1985); and that it would frustrate judicial economy to require service of a new notice to quit prior to the commencement of a subsequent summary process action. Assuming that the underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>notice to quit was valid;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> see footnote 8 of this opinion; we acknowledge that the plaintiffs\u2019 argument has some appeal on the discrete facts of this particular case, which involve a very short time line between actions and commercial parties represented by counsel. Guided, however, by the principles behind the New York case law, we agree with the defendants\u2019 contention that not requiring the service of a new notice to quit as a per se rule could well complicate the status of the parties\u2019 relationship after the withdrawal of the initial complaint, and would require more extensive determinations by the trial court concerning the parties\u2019 intentions and whether postwithdrawal payments are for rent, or use and occupancy. Moreover, notwithstanding the dissent\u2019s arguments to the contrary, the per se rule advocated by the defendants is not likely to be particularly costly or otherwise inefficient, as landlords can either amend the defects in their complaints, or simply serve a new notice to quit after withdrawal and prior to refiling, a process that could add only three days of delay prior to the institution of the subsequent summary process action. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 47a-23 (a) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>47a-23a (a). Accordingly, we conclude that, after withdrawing its initial summary process action, the plaintiffs, as landlords, were required to serve a new notice to quit prior to commencing a new summary process action.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Because they failed to do so, the trial court properly determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction and dismissed this summary process action.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">In this opinion ROGERS, C.

The cases relied on by the majority can be readily distinguished from the facts of the present case. In <em>Nicolaides </em>v. <em>State Division of Housing &amp; Community Renewal, </em>231 App. Div. 2d 723, 724, 647 N.Y.S.2d 866 (1996), <em>Kayeee West 113th Street Corp. </em>v. <em>Diakoff, </em>160 App. Div. 2d 573, 554 N.Y.S.2d 216 (1990), and <em>Haberman </em>v. <em>Wager, 73 </em>Misc. 2d 732, 734, 342 N.Y.S.2d 405 (1973), the New York courts held, in brief opinions with little reasoning, that, after an initial summary process action instituted by a landlord had been <em>dismissed </em>by the trial court, the landlord was required to serve another notice to quit prior to instituting a second summary process action. These cases are clearly inapposite to the present case, where the plaintiffs <em>voluntarily withdrew </em>the initial summary process action, and the trial court took no action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Finally, I address <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Hird, </em>supra, 13 Conn. App. 150, on which the defendants in the present action rely. In <em>Hird, </em>a residential landlord <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>served an initial notice to quit on its tenant on July 15, 1985, alleging that the tenant \u201chad violated the lease by maintaining the premises in an unsanitary condition and by keeping pets on the premises.\u201d Id., 153. The notice contained the following language: \u201cAll payments made by you, on or after the date of this notice, shall be accepted as [u]se and [o]ccupancy [o]nly without prejudice to the [landlord\u2019s] right to evict you.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. The landlord then initiated a summary process action against the tenant, which ultimately resulted in a <em>judgment </em>for the tenant on November 6,1985. Id. Thereafter, the landlord served a second notice to quit on the tenant on November 15, 1985, alleging that the tenant had failed to pay that month\u2019s rent. The landlord then initiated a second summary process action against the tenant, which the tenant sought to dismiss, claiming that the landlord had failed to comply with the federal regulations applicable to the apartment where the tenant resided. Id. In response to the tenant\u2019s motion to dismiss, the landlord voluntarily withdrew the second summary process action on January 29, 1986. Id. On January 31,1986, the tenant was served with a third notice to quit possession, alleging nonpayment of rent for the month of January, 1986. Id., 154. In defense, the tenant asserted that no lease was in effect in January, 1986, because the second notice to quit had terminated the parties\u2019 lease in November, 1985, and therefore, she could not be evicted for nonpayment of rent for that month since only use and occupancy payments were due. Id. The trial court rejected the tenant\u2019s claim, determining that the tenant \u201cwas then occupying her apartment ... as a tenant at will\u201d in January, 1986. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. The tenant appealed, claiming that the trial court improperly concluded that a rental agreement existed between the parties in January, 1986, because the first summary process action that resulted in a judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>ment for the tenant and the second notice to quit operated to terminate the tenant\u2019s lease. Id., 154-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. In doing so, the Appellate Court concluded that \u201c[t]he service of the notice to quit possession on July 15, 1985, did not compromise the [rights of the tenant] because the subsequent trial and judgment on the merits in the summary process action predicated on this notice did not uphold the allegations of the complaint asserting the termination of the lease by this notice to quit possession. The trial court, therefore, correctly concluded that the [tenant\u2019s] lease survived the judgment of November 6, 1985, in her favor. The parties were returned to their status quo before July 15, 1985, by this judgment.\u201d Id., 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The Appellate Court further concluded, however, that \u201cthe [tenant\u2019s] lease also survived [the second] summary process action because of its withdrawal by the [landlord] before a hearing and judgment thereon. . . . The withdrawal of the summary process action on January 29, 1986, effectively erased the court slate clean as though the eviction predicated on the November 15, 1985 notice to quit possession had never been commenced. The [landlord] and the [tenant] were \u2018back to square one,\u2019 and <em>the continuation of their lease of January 9, 1981, was </em>restored.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) Id., 156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">I would conclude that <em>Hird </em>does not support the majority\u2019s conclusion in the present case. The landlord in <em>Hird </em>withdrew the second summary process action in response to the tenant\u2019s motion to dismiss, which claimed that the second notice to quit was defective for failing to comply with applicable federal regulations. Id., 156. Thus, it appears that the second notice to quit was of questionable validity and the landlord\u2019s withdrawal of the second summary process action in <em>Hird </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>may not have been a fully voluntary withdrawal, but, instead, the recognition of a procedural defect in the second notice to quit. To the extent that <em>Hird </em>seems to indicate that a notice to quit is vitiated by the landlord\u2019s voluntary withdrawal of a summary process action, therefore, I would limit the application of <em>Hird </em>to the facts of that case. This interpretation of <em>Hird </em>is consistent with our cases, previously cited herein, that have held that an invalid notice to quit does not terminate the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-5\"> The majority states in footnote 8 of its opinion that it need not address whether the first notice to quit served by the plaintiffs is valid as a result of its conclusion that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the summary process action because of the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to serve a second notice to quit. Like the majority, I assume, for purposes of addressing the plaintiffs\u2019 first claim, that the first notice to quit served by the plaintiffs is valid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b498-6\"> Although the majority concludes that it is not necessary to reach the plaintiffs\u2019 claim regarding the validity of the notice to quit and notes that this court has \u201cupheld as valid a nearly identical notice to quit\u201d; see footnote 8 of the majority opinion; the majority nevertheless asserts that we can not presume the notice to quit is valid and, therefore, its conclusion does not implicitly overrule our substantial body of case law that establishes that a valid notice to quit terminates the lease because there has been no judicial determination that the notice to quit served by the landlord is valid. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">The majority relies on <em>Bargain Mart, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lipkis, </em>212 Conn. 120, 134, 561 A.2d 1365 (1989), in support of its position that we can not presume that the notice to quit in the present case was valid in the absence of a judicial determination of its validity. I find <em>Bargain Mart, Inc., </em>to be inapposite. In that case, the landlord had served notices to quit on the tenant and then had instituted a summary process action. Id., 122. The tenant had challenged the summary process action, asserting several special defenses including that the notices to quit served on him were invalid. Id., 122-23. The parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>eventually settled that summary process action by a stipulated judgment, which did not specifically address the validity of the notice to quit. Id., 123. In a subsequent related action, the landlord attempted to assert that the notices to quit served on the tenant in relation to the prior action terminated the lease. Id., 125. Recognizing that the summary process action had been settled by a stipulated judgment and that \u201c[s]uch a judgment represents \u2018a settlement of the controversy by the parties thereto [thus creating the presumption] that the parties intended to settle all aspects of the controversy, including all issues raised by the papers comprising the record,\u2019 \u201d this court concluded that it had \u201cno basis for concluding that [the initial notices to quit] terminated the [tenant\u2019s] lease.\u201d Id., 135. This court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Bargain Mart, Inc., </em>was clearly based on its conclusion as to which issues were resolved in the stipulated judgment and was designed to give effect to that stipulated judgment. Nothing in <em>Bargain Mart, Inc., </em>prohibits this court <em>from </em>assuming that the notice to quit served in the present case was valid for purposes of deciding whether the plaintiffs were required to serve another notice to quit on the defendants prior to bringing a second summary process action.</p>\n<p id=\"AsiY\">Moreover, the logical consequence of the majority\u2019s conclusion is that no notice to quit can have any legal effect until a court has made a judicial determination that such notice is valid. In other words, if a landlord serves a notice to quit on its tenant, the tenant will not have to consider its lease terminated until the tenant challenges the validity of the notice to quit and receives a judicial determination that the notice to quit was valid. Indeed, the position taken by the majority flies in the face of the public policy that the majority seeks to promote, namely, establishing bright line rules in this area so that landlords and tenants will understand their respective positions more clearly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b500-5\"> The majority asserts that there is no reason to distinguish between a case in which a landlord has withdrawn a summary process action and one in which the summary process action has been dismissed on the merits. To support this conclusion, in footnote 16 of its opinion, the majority cites cases in which the Appellate Court and this court have concluded that withdrawals and final judgments are analogous for purposes of whether a court retains jurisdiction over a particular matter. See <em>Sicaras </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>44 Conn. App. 771, 775, 692 A.2d 1290 (\u201c[withdrawals are analogous to final judgments\u201d), cert. denied, 241 Conn. 916, 696 A.2d 340 (1997); see also <em>Lusas </em>v. <em>St. Patrick\u2019s Roman Catholic Church Corp., </em>123 Conn. 166, 170, 193 A. 204 (1937) (\u201c[t]he situation as regards the jurisdiction of the court to proceed further in the matter after an action has been voluntarily withdrawn is strictly analogous to that presented after the rendition of a final judgment or the erasure of a case from the docket\u201d). I disagree. <em>Sicaras </em>and <em>Lusas </em>were civil cases, not summary process cases. Although there may be no distinction between a voluntary withdrawal and dismissal on the merits for purposes of whether the court retains jurisdiction over a civil case, these cases provide no guidance as to whether a notice to quit served by a party continues to have legal effect after the voluntary withdrawal of a subsequent summary process action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
