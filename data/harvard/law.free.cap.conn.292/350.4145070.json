J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aab\">The plaintiffs, Lori Dias and John Dias,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> brought this medical malpractice action against the defendants, Steven Grady, an obstetrician and gynecologist, and Connecticut Women\u2019s Obstetrics and Gynecology, LLC, alleging that Grady negligently had performed a laparoscopic hysterectomy on Dias. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-190a,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>attached to their complaint the written opinion of a surgeon that Grady had violated the standard of care when he performed the surgery. The defendants then filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the written opinion did not state that Grady\u2019s deviation from the standard of care was the proximate cause of Dias\u2019 injuries. The trial court concluded that \u00a7 52-190a does not require plaintiffs in medical malpractice actions to attach an opinion addressing causation and denied the defendants\u2019 motion. This appeal followed.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">In their complaint, the plaintiffs alleged the following facts, the truth of which we assume for purposes of this appeal. Dias made arrangements with Grady to perform a laparoscopic hysterectomy on December 14, 2005. The surgery was postponed to January 6, 2006, after Grady suffered an injury to his right hand. Dias was discharged from the hospital on January 7, 2006. Two days later, Dias developed abdominal pain, a high <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>fever, \u201crigors\u201d and difficulty swallowing, and she went to the emergency room of Manchester Memorial Hospital. Dias was admitted to the hospital and was treated with antibiotics and intravenous hydration. Ultimately, she was diagnosed with a pelvic abscess caused by a bowel perforation. She was discharged from the hospital on February 3, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Thereafter, the plaintiffs filed a complaint alleging that Grady had committed medical malpractice by performing the surgery when he had limited use of his right hand as the result of an injury, and by using surgical instruments that were the wrong size. Pursuant to \u00a7 52-190a, the plaintiffs attached to their complaint a written opinion by a surgeon stating that, \u201c[ajccording to . . . Dias\u2019 family, after the surgery . . . Grady spoke to them and indicated that he had to do a great deal of the surgery with his left hand and that the instruments which he used were designed for a medium-size patient and that [Dias] was on the small side.\u201d He further stated that, in his opinion, if these statements were true, Grady had \u201cdeviated from the accepted standard of care</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The defendants then filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the \u201cwritten opinion [did] not express any opinion as to whether the perceived deviations from the standard of care actually caused [Dias\u2019] claimed damages.\u201d After a hearing, the trial court concluded that \u00a7 52-190a requires only that a plaintiff provide a written opinion from a similar health care provider that the defendant had breached the standard of care, and does not require an opinion that the breach had caused the plaintiffs injuries. Accordingly, the trial court concluded that the plaintiffs complied with the statute and it denied the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">On appeal, the defendants contend that, because \u00a7 52-190a requires plaintiffs to provide a written opinion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>a similar health care provider that there appears to be evidence of medical negligence, and because proof of proximate cause is an element of medical negligence,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the statute clearly and unambiguously provides that the written opinion must state that the defendant\u2019s breach of the standard of care caused the plaintiffs injuries. The plaintiffs counter that the phrase \u201cmedical negligence\u201d as used in \u00a7 52-190a (a) does not include the element of causation, but means \u201cthe failure to use that degree of care for the protection of another that the ordinarily reasonably careful and prudent [person] would use under like circumstances. ... It signifies a want of care in the performance of an act, by one having no positive intention to injure the person complaining of it.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Branford, </em>12 Conn. App. 106, 108, 529 A.2d 743 (1987). We agree with the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The meaning of \u00a7 52-190a is a question of law over which our review is plenary. <em>State </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>287 Conn. 82, 87, 946 A.2d 1231 (2008). When this court interprets a statute, \u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Southern New England Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Cashman, </em>283 Conn. 644, 650-51, 931 A.2d 142 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">We begin our analysis with the language of the statute. Section 52-190a (a) provides in relevant part that, in any medical malpractice action, \u201cthe claimant or the claimant\u2019s attorney . . . shall obtain a written and signed opinion of a similar health care provider, as defined in [General Statutes \u00a7] 52-184c,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>health care provider shall be selected pursuant to the provisions of said section, that there appears to be evidence of medical negligence and includes a detailed basis for the formation of such opinion. ...\u201d Section 52-190a (a) does not define medical negligence and the phrase is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation. Specifically, the word \u201cnegligence\u201d reasonably may be understood, as the defendants claim, as referring to the cause of action consisting of the elements of duty, breach of the standard of care, causation and damages; see footnote 4 of this opinion; or it reasonably may be understood, as the plaintiffs claim, as specifying an attribute of the defendant\u2019s conduct, namely, \u201ca want of care in the performance of an act, by one having no positive intention to injure the person complaining of it.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Branford, </em>supra, 12 Conn. App. 108. We conclude, therefore, that the phrase is ambiguous. Accordingly, we may \u201clook for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding [the statute\u2019s] enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Southern New England Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Cashman, </em>supra, 283 Conn. 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Section 52-190a originally was enacted as part of the Tort Reform Act of 1986. See Public Acts 1986, No. 86-338, \u00a7 12. The original version of the statute required the plaintiff in any medical malpractice action to conduct \u201ca reasonable inquiry as permitted by the circumstances to determine that there are grounds for a good faith belief that there has been negligence in the care or treatment of the [plaintiff]\u201d and to file a certificate \u201cthat such reasonable inquiry gave rise to a good faith belief that grounds exist for an action against each named defendant.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 52-190a (a). The original statute did not require the plaintiff to obtain the written opinion of a similar health care provider that there appeared to be evidence of medical negligence, but permitted the plaintiff to rely on such an opinion to support his good faith belief. The parties in the present case agree that the purpose of the original version of \u00a7 52-190a was to prevent frivolous medical malpractice actions. See <em>Bruttomesso </em>v. <em>Northeastern Connecticut Sexual Assault Crisis Services, Inc., </em>242 Conn. 1, 15, 698 A.2d 795 (1997) (\u201c[t]he purpose of the legislation is to inhibit a plaintiff from bringing an inadequately investigated cause of action, whether in tort or in contract, claiming negligence by a health care provider\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">In 2005, the legislature amended \u00a7 52-190a (a) to include a provision requiring the plaintiff in a medical malpractice action to obtain the written opinion of a similar health care provider that \u201cthere appears to be evidence of medical negligence\u201d and to attach the opinion to the certificate of good faith to be filed with the complaint. See Public Acts 2005, No. 05-275, \u00a7 2 (a) (P.A. 05-275). In addition, the amendment provided that the failure to file the written opinion would be grounds for dismissal of the complaint. See P.A. 05-275, \u00a7 2 (c), now codified as General Statutes \u00a7 52-190a (c). The legislative history of this amendment indicates that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>was intended to address the problem that some attorneys, either intentionally or innocently, were misrepresenting in the certificate of good faith the information that they had obtained from experts. See Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 18, 2005 Sess., p. 5553, testimony of Michael D. Neubert.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>With this background in mind, we conclude that the phrase \u201cmedical negligence,\u201d as used in \u00a7 52-190a (a), means breach of the standard of care and was not intended to encompass all of the elements of a cause of action for negligence. Section 52-190a (a) requires that the plaintiff obtain the written opinion of <em>a similar health care provider, </em>as defined in \u00a7 52-184c. Although a similar health care provider would be qualified to provide an opinion regarding the applicable standard of care, there are many situations in which a similar health care provider would not be qualified to express an opinion as to causation.* ******<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, there is no statutory mechanism by which a plaintiff can introduce the written opinion of a nonsimilar health care provider regarding causation. Accordingly, a requirement that the plaintiff attach a written opinion of a similar health care provider that there appears to be evidence of proximate causation would, in many cases, be an insurmountable obstacle to bringing an action. Although the language and history of \u00a7 52-190a (a) indicate that the statute was intended to bar meritless medical malpractice actions, we see no evidence that the legislature intended to bar meritorious claims merely because a similar health care provider is not qualified to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>an opinion as to both the applicable standard of care and proximate causation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In the absence of any such evidence, we must presume that the legislature had no such intent. Cf. <em>Viera </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>283 Conn. 412, 427, 927 A.2d 843 (2007) (\u201c[although the legislature may eliminate a common law right by statute, the presumption that the legislature does not have such a purpose can be overcome only if the legislative intent is clearly and plainly expressed\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">In support of their claim to the contrary, the defendants contend that, if the legislature had intended to require a plaintiff to obtain a written opinion from a similar health care provider regarding only the standard of care, and not causation, the legislature would have expressly referred to the standard of care, as it did in \u00a7 52-184c (a). See General Statutes \u00a7 52-184c (a) (\u201cthe claimant shall have the burden of proving by the preponderance of the evidence that the alleged actions of the health care provider represented a breach of the prevailing professional standard of care for that health care provider\u201d); see also, e.g., <em>M. DeMatteo Construction Co. </em>v. <em>New London, </em>236 Conn. 710, 717, 674 A.2d 845 (1996) (when \u201ca statute, with reference to one subject contains a given provision, the omission of such provision from a similar statute concerning a related subject ... is significant to show that a different intention existed\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). We recog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>nize that, ordinarily, \u201cwhen the legislature uses different language, the legislature intends a different meaning . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>98 Conn. App. 85, 92, 908 A.2d 568, cert. denied, 280 Conn. 944, 912 A.2d 477 (2006). We also have recognized, however, that \u201cthose who promulgate statutes ... do not intend to promulgate statutes . . . that lead to absurd consequences or bizarre results.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>228 Conn. 758, 765, 638 A.2d 601 (1994). As we have explained, requiring a similar health care provider to give an opinion as to causation at the prediscovery stage of litigation pursuant to \u00a7 52-190a when a similar health care provider is not required to give such an opinion at trial pursuant to \u00a7 52-184c would bar some plaintiffs who could prevail at trial from even filing a complaint. Because this would be a bizarre result, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The defendants also contend that, under the principle that \u201cthe legislature is always presumed to have created a harmonious and consistent body of law\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>In re William D., </em>284 Conn. 305, 313, 933 A.2d 1147 (2007); the phrase \u201cmedical negligence\u201d as used in \u00a7 52-190a (a) must be construed to have the same meaning as the word \u201cinjuiy\u201d as used in General Statutes \u00a7 52-584.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> They point out that, in <em>Lagassey </em>v. <em>State, </em>268 Conn. 723, 748-49, 846 A.2d 831 (2004), this court stated that \u201cthe term injury is synonymous with legal injury or actionable harm. Actionable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>harm occurs when the plaintiff discovers, or in the exercise of reasonable care, should have discovered the essential elements of a cause of action. ... A breach of duty by the defendant and a causal connection between the defendant\u2019s breach of duty and the resulting harm to the plaintiff are essential elements of a cause of action in negligence; they are therefore necessary ingredients for actionable harm.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) We also stated in <em>Lagassey </em>that \u201c[interpreting the word injury to require some evidence of a causal connection between the harm complained of and the defendant\u2019s alleged negligence is consistent with the state\u2019s tort reform legislation regarding medical malpractice actions. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 52-184c (a) (requiring plaintiff to establish prevailing professional standard of care); General Statutes \u00a7 52-190a (requiring plaintiff to file certificate of good faith but allowing ninety day extension of limitation period) . . . .\u2019\u2019(Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lagassey </em>v. State, supra, 747 n.17.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The defendants in the present case contend that, because, under \u00a7 52-584, \u201cactionable harm does not occur until the plaintiff discovers or should have discovered that the harm complained of <em>was caused by the negligence of the defendant\u201d-, </em>(emphasis in original) id., 747; the legislature must have intended to require that, before bringing a medical malpractice action, the plaintiff must obtain the written opinion of a similar health care provider stating that there appears to be evidence that the defendant\u2019s conduct caused the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. We are not persuaded. We recognize that a plaintiff must have \u201ca good faith belief that grounds exist for an action against each named defendant\u201d in order to bring a medical malpractice action; see General Statutes \u00a7 52-190a (a); and that this requirement applies to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>element of causation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> For the reasons that we have stated, however, we do not believe that that good faith belief certified by the attorney in the certificate of good faith must be based solely on the written opinion of the similar health care provider. Rather, the plaintiffs good faith belief regarding causation may be based on consultation with nonsimilar health care providers or on other reasonable grounds.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 52-190a (a) (\u201c[i]n addition to such written opinion, the court may consider other factors with regard to the existence of good faith\u201d); <em>LeConche </em>v. <em>Elligers, </em>215 Conn. 701, 708, 579 A.2d 1 (1990) (\u201c[t]he existence of a report by a medical expert may be, but is not necessarily, sufficient to establish the plaintiffs\u2019 good faith belief\u2019 under \u00a7 52-190a [a]);<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>LeConche </em>v. <em>Elligers, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>supra, 708-709 (under \u00a7 52-190a [a], trial court must conduct factual inquiry into plaintiffs\u2019 good faith and plaintiffs may rely on information beyond written expert opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b371-10\"> We refer to Lori Dias and John Dias collectively as the plaintiffs and to Lori Dias individually as Dias.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b371-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-190a (a) provides: \u201cNo civil action or apportionment complaint shall be filed to recover damages resulting from personal injury or wrongful death occurring on or after October 1, 1987, whether in tort or in contract, in which it is alleged that such injury or death resulted from the negligence of a health care provider, unless the attorney or party filing the action or apportionment complaint has made a reasonable inquiry as permitted by the circumstances to determine that there are grounds for a good faith belief that there has been negligence in the care or treatment of the claimant. The complaint, initial pleading or apportionment complaint shall contain a certificate of the attorney or party filing the action or apportionment complaint that such reasonable inquiry gave rise to a good faith belief that grounds exist for an action against each named defendant or for an apportionment complaint against each named apportionment defendant. To show the existence of such good faith, the claimant or the claimant\u2019s attorney, and any apportionment complainant or the apportionment complainant\u2019s attorney, shall obtain a written and signed opinion of a similar' health care provider, as defined in section 52-184c, which similar health care provider shall be selected pursuant to the provisions of said section, that there appears to be evidence of medical negligence and includes a detailed basis for the formation of such opinion. Such written opinion shall not be subject to discovery by any party except for questioning the validity of the certificate. The claimant or the claimant\u2019s attorney, and any apportionment complainant or apportionment complainant\u2019s attorney, shall retain the original written opinion and shall attach a copy of such written opinion, with the name and signature of the similar health care provider expunged, to such certificate.

In addition to such written opinion, the court may consider other factors with regard to the existence of good faith. If the court determines, after the completion of discovery, that such certificate was not made in good faith and that no justiciable issue was presented against a health care provider that fully cooperated in providing informal discovery, the court upon motion or upon its own initiative shall impose upon the person who signed such certificate or a represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction which may include an order to pay to the other party or parties the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the pleading, motion or other paper, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee. The court may also submit the matter to the appropriate authority for disciplinary review of the attorney if the claimant\u2019s attorney or the apportionment complainant\u2019s attorney submitted the certificate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b372-9\"> Chief Justice Rogers granted the defendants\u2019 petition for certification to appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-265a, which \u201callows the chief justice to certify a direct appeal to the Supreme Court from an interlocutory order of the Superior Court on an issue of law that involves a matter of substantial public interest and in which delay may work a substantial injustice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Packer </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>246 Conn. 89, 97, 717 A.2d 117 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b374-7\"> <em>See RK Constructors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fusco Corp., </em>231 Conn. 381, 384, 650 A.2d 153 (1994) (\u201c[t]he essential elements of a cause of action in negligence are well established: duty; breach of that duty; causation; and actual injury\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b374-8\"> This court granted the application of the Connecticut Trial Lawyers Association (association) for permission to appear as an amicus curiae.

Greenwald, a physician and a member of the Connecticut State Medical Society, submitted written testimony in which he stated that the new requirement for a written opinion of a similar health care provider was not \u201ceffective reform, because, with a relatively minimal effort, a plaintiffs attorney can still find a single voice out there in the void who will back the case.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 19, 2005 Sess., p. 5768. Greenwald also noted in his written testimony concerning the amendment to \u00a7 52-190a (a) that another bill concerning medical malpractice reform contained the word negligence but not the word causation, and he pointed out that \u201cboth are critical elements in a malpractice case.\u201d Id., p. 5772.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">This court repeatedly has recognized that testimony before legislative committees regarding proposed legislation sheds light on \u201cthe problem or issue that the legislature sought to resolve, and the purpose it sought to serve, in enacting a statute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>240 Conn. 317, 337, 692 A.2d 713 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">The defendants contend that the legislative history of the 2005 amendment to \u00a7 52-190a (a) supports their position. They point out that an early version of the bill that ultimately was enacted as P.A. 05-275, \u00a7 2 (a), required a plaintiff in a medical malpractice action to obtain the written opinion of a similar health care provider \u201cthat there are grounds for a good faith belief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>that there has been negligence in the care or treatment of the claimant <em>and that the claimant has been injured by such negligence.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Senate Bill No. 1052, 2005 Sess. The defendants contend that \u201c[t]he use of the term \u2018medical negligence\u2019 [in the version of the bill that was ultimately adopted] is an appropriate shorthand for both breach of the standard of care and causation.\u201d We think that the General Assembly\u2019s failure to enact the early version of the bill could just as reasonably be understood, however, as evincing an intent to <em>reject </em>the proposed requirement that the plaintiff obtain a written opinion regarding causation. Accordingly, we reject this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b379-13\"> For example, in cases in which the plaintiff has alleged a delayed diagnosis, a similar health care provider would be qualified to provide an opinion as to whether there appears to be evidence that the defendant\u2019s failure to diagnose the illness breached the standard of care, but might not be qualified to provide an opinion as to whether the delay in diagnosis affected the patient\u2019s prognosis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b380-7\"> Indeed, during the floor debate in the House of Representatives on the 2005 amendment to \u00a7 52-190a (a), Representative Michael Lawlor was asked \u201cis it usually the case that the expert who provides the initial opinion will be the expert [who is] used at trial?\u201d 48 H.R. Proc., Pt. 31, 2005 Sess., p. 9503. Representative Lawlor responded that that would be the case \u201cmore often than not,\u201d but also acknowledged that \u201c[s]ometimes [there is] more than one expert retained by the plaintiffs.\u201d Id., pp. 9503-9504. Thus, Representative Lawlor expressly acknowledged that the written opinion of a similar health care provider would not necessarily be sufficient to support all of the elements of a negligence cause of action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b381-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-584 provides: \u201cNo action to recover damages for injury to the person, or to real or personal property, caused by negligence, or by reckless or wanton misconduct, or by malpractice of a physician, surgeon, dentist, podiatrist, chiropractor, hospital or sanatorium, shall be brought but within two years from the date when the injury is first sustained or discovered or in the exercise of reasonable care should have been discovered, and except that no such action may be brought more than three years from the date of the act or omission complained of, except that a counterclaim may be interposed in any such action any time before the pleadings in such action are finally closed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b383-6\"> Indeed, at oral argument before this court, the plaintiffs conceded that if a plaintiff or counsel for the plaintiff did not have a good faith belief, based either on consultation with a nonsimilar health care provider or other reasonable grounds, that the defendant\u2019s conduct caused the plaintiffs injuries, the plaintiff could be subject to sanctions under \u00a7 52-190a (a). See General Statutes \u00a7 52-190a (a) (\u201c[i]f the court determines, after the completion of discovery, that such certificate was not made in good faith and that no justiciable issue was presented against a health care provider that fully cooperated in providing informal discovery, the court upon motion or upon its own initiative shall impose upon the person who signed such certificate or a represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction which may include an order to pay to the other party or parties the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the pleading, motion or other paper, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b383-7\"> Of course, \u00a7 52-190a (a) does not <em>prohibit </em>the similar health care provider from expressing an opinion as to proximate cause in the written statement if he is qualified to do so, and any such opinion could support a finding that the plaintiff had a good faith belief that grounds exist for an action against the defendant. Conversely, if a similar health care provider who is qualified and has all of the information required to provide an opinion on causation fails to do so, that failure could, under certain circumstances, support a finding that the plaintiff lacked a good faith belief that the defendant\u2019s conduct caused the alleged injuries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b383-8\"> As we have indicated, \u00a7 52-190a (a) was amended after this court\u2019s decision in <em>LeConche </em>to require plaintiffs to obtain the written opinion of a similar health care provider and to attach the opinion to the complaint. Although the original version of the statute did not require a plaintiff to obtain or to attach such an opinion, it did permit a plaintiff to rely on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>written opinion to show the existence of good faith. See General Statutes (Kev. to 1987) \u00a7 52-190a (a). Both versions of the statute provide that the written opinion contain a statement \u201cthat there appears to be evidence of medical negligence.\u201d We see no evidence that, by enacting P.A. 05-175, \u00a7 2, the legislature intended to change the substantive requirements of the written opinion so that, in all cases, it would be sufficient to support a finding of good faith.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
