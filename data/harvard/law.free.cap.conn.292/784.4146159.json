J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkI\">The issue in this appeal is whether the modification of the terms of the regional school plan establishing the plaintiff, Regional School District No. 12, to delete a provision whereby the plaintiffs elementary grade levels would remain in their hometown schools, and to add a provision whereby those grade levels would be consolidated into a single school, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>constitutes an amendment to the plan under General Statutes \u00a7 10-47C.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff filed an action for a judgment declaring that the modification did not constitute an amendment under \u00a7 10-47c, and the defendant, the town of Bridgewater, filed a counterclaim seeking a declaration that the modification was an amendment and an order of mandamus requiring the regional board of education (board) to conduct a referendum on the amendment pursuant to \u00a7 10-47c. The trial court rendered judgment declaring that the modification did not constitute an amendment subject to the referendum provisions of \u00a7 10-47c, and the defendant then filed this appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that the modification was an amendment of the regional school plan under \u00a7 10-47c. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>The trial court found the following facts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In April, 1967, the defendant and the towns of Roxbury and Washington formed a temporary regional school study committee (study committee) pursuant to statute. In May of 1967, the study committee issued its final report containing its findings and recommendations, including a recommendation that \u201c[ejlementary grades [kindergarten through fifth grade] [are] to remain in their present home town schools.\u201d Thereafter, the final report was presented to residents of the three towns at public hearings. In August, 1967, each town held a referendum on the question of whether it should join with the two other towns \u201cin the establishment of a regional school district with the schools located in the towns of Bridgewater, Roxbury, and Washington, for the purposes of providing the necessary facilities and administering grades [kindergarten] to [twelfth grade] of the public schools?\u201d Each town approved the referendum. Shortly thereafter, the state board of education approved the establishment of the district.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">In March, 2007, the board voted to enter into an option agreement to purchase land in Roxbury as a potential site for a consolidated elementary school. On May 8, 2007, the defendant conducted a town meeting at which it adopted the following resolution: \u201cResolved, that the [defendant] requests, pursuant to . . . [\u00a7] 10-47c, that the [rjegionai [sjchool [district [no.] 12 plan, as approved by the [s]tate [b]oard of [ejducation on May 11,1967, be amended by deleting the term, \u2018Elementary grades [kindergarten through fifth grade] to remain in their present home town schools\u2019 and inserting in its place \u2018The district consolidate [ejlementary grades [kindergarten through fifth grade] into a single [ejlementary [sjchool ... to be located in . . . Roxbury.\u2019 \u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>defendant forwarded a copy of the resolution to the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Thereafter, the board notified the defendant and the towns of Washington and Roxbury that the resolution adopted at the defendant\u2019s town meeting did not constitute an amendment to the regional school plan under \u00a7 10-47c. The board then held a special meeting at which it approved a motion to adopt a resolution to appropriate funds and to authorize the issuance of bonds and temporary notes to finance the construction of a consolidated elementary school to be located in Rox-bury. The board also adopted a motion authorizing a referendum on the new school project and the issuance of bonds and temporary notes to finance the project pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 10-56.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Pursuant to this motion, the board delivered to the town clerks of the three towns a notice of a referendum to be held on June 19,2007. Because of technical defects in the notice process, the referendum ultimately was cancelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Thereafter, the plaintiff brought an action seeking a declaratory judgment as to whether its plan to build a consolidated elementary school constituted an amendment to the regional school plan adopted in 1967, and therefore was subject to the referendum provision of \u00a7 10-47c, which requires a majority vote in each town <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>in favor of the proposed amendment, or whether the proposal to appropriate funds for the new school was subject only to the referendum provision of \u00a7 10-56, which requires a majority vote of the regional school district as a whole for approval. The defendant brought a counterclaim seeking, inter alia, a declaratory judgment that the resolution adopted at its May 8, 2007 town meeting constituted an amendment to the regional school plan and an order of mandamus directing the board to hold a referendum on the amendment pursuant to \u00a7 10-47c. After a hearing, the trial court rendered judgment declaring that the defendant\u2019s resolution did not constitute an amendment under \u00a7 10-47c, and that the plaintiff was entitled to conduct a referendum on the proposal to obtain funding for the new consolidated elementary school under \u00a7 10-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">This appeal followed. The defendant contends that the study committee recommendations approved by referendum in 1967 constitute a regional school \u201cplan,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 10-47c, and that the modification of that plan to delete the recommendation that the elementary grades remain in their respective hometowns and to add a provision that the elementaiy grades be consolidated into a single school constitutes an amendment subject to the referendum provision of \u00a7 10-47c, which provides: \u201cIf the majority vote in each town of the district is in favor of the proposed amendment to the plan, such amendment shall take effect immediately.\u201d The plaintiff contends that, to the contrary, under this court\u2019s decision in <em>Atwood </em>v. <em>Regional School District No. 15, </em>169 Conn. 613, 363 A.2d 1038 (1975), a proposal to construct a new school and to obtain financing for the school is not an amendment to a regional school plan subject to the referendum provision of \u00a7 10-47c, but is a financing proposal subject only to the referendum provision of \u00a7 10-56 (a), which provides that the referendum \u201cquestion shall be deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>mined by the majority of those persons voting in the regional school district as a whole.\u201d We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">At the outset, we set forth the appropriate standard of review. Whether the consolidation of the three elementary schools into a single regional school constitutes an amendment to the regional school plan subject to the requirements of \u00a7 10-47c is a question of statutory interpretation over which our review is plenary. See <em>Sastrom </em>v. <em>Psychiatric Security Review Board, </em>291 Conn. 307, 316, 968 A.2d 396 (2009). \u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. . . . In seeking to determine the meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratex-tual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">We begin our analysis with an overview of the relevant statutes governing the establishment of regional school districts, namely, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 10-39, 10-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>43,10-45 and 10-47c.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 10-39 provides that, when two or more towns wish to establish a regional school district, they may appoint a temporary regional study committee to study the advisability of doing so. Section 10-43 (a) provides that, if, upon completion of its study, a temporary study committee determines that the establishment of a regional school district is desirable, it shall submit a written report to the state board of education.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 10-43 (b), the state board of education must determine whether the report complies with \u00a7 10-43 (a) and, if so, it must certify to each town clerk of the participating towns that the study committee recommendations have been approved. Section 10-45 (a) provides that, after the state board of education has approved the recommendations, the member towns of a proposed school district must hold referenda \u201cto determine whether a regional school district shall be established as recommended. ...\u201d Under \u00a7 10-45 (b), \u201c[i]f the majority of the votes in each of the participating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>towns is affirmative, a regional school district composed of such towns is established . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Section 10-47c provides in relevant part: \u201c[T]he terms of the plan approved through referenda pursuant to section 10-45 may be amended as follows: If a regional board of education finds it advisable to amend the plan or if the legislative body of a town served by the regional board of education requests amendment of such plan, the regional board of education shall prepare a report on the proposed amendment, including the question to be presented, file a copy with the Commissioner of Education and the clerk of each member town and make copies of such report available to the public at a district meeting called to present the plan. After such public hearing, the board shall set the date for referenda which shall be held simultaneously in each member town between the hours of six a.m. and eight p.m. . . . . If the majority vote in each town of the district is in favor of the proposed amendment to the plan, such amendment shall take effect immediately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">These provisions make clear that, as this court previously has held, the \u201cplan\u201d referred to in \u00a7\u00a7 10-45 and 10-47c \u201cconsists of the recommendations found in the final report of the study committee.\u201d <em>Atwood </em>v. <em>Regional School District No. 15, </em>supra, 169 Conn. 621. The scope and meaning of the word \u201camendment\u201d as used in \u00a7 10-47c, however, is not clear. The word is not statutorily defined and neither the defendant nor the plaintiff claims that the word clearly and unambiguously applies to <em>all </em>deviations from the recommendations of the study committee that are not expressly excluded from the scope of 10-47c.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>determining whether \u00a7 10-47c applies to the proposal at issue in the present case, we may look to the \u201clegislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d <em>Sastrom v. Psychiatric Security Review Board, </em>supra, 291 Conn. 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">In addressing the question of what constitutes an amendment under \u00a7 10-47c, we do not write on a blank slate. In <em>Atwood, </em>the plaintiffs, taxpayers of the towns of Middlebury and Southbury, sought a judgment declaring that the proposal of the defendant, Regional School District No. 15, to build a new regional high school in Southbury constituted an amendment to the original study committee report, which had recommended that the regional high school be housed in the existing Southbury high school. <em>Atwood </em>v. <em>Regional School District No. 15, </em>supra, 169 Conn. 614-15. The defendant claimed that its proposal to issue bonds for the construction of the new high school was not an amendment, but was a financing proposal subject only to \u00a7 10-56. Id., 620. The trial court rendered judgment for the defendant and the plaintiffs appealed to this court. Id., 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">On appeal, this court determined that the \u201cplan\u201d referred to in \u00a7 10-47c consisted of the recommendations made in the final report of the study committee for the defendant, \u201cincluding those concerning the use of then existent high school facilities . . . .\u201d Id., 621. We then concluded that, although \u201cthe provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>\u00a7 10-47c literally apply to the proposal to construct a new high school\u201d; id.; that fact was not dispositive because \u201c[t]he provisions of \u00a7 10-56 also literally apply to the issuing of the bonds necessary to build the high school.\u201d Id. We reasoned that \u201c[b]oth sections cannot be construed as governing the procedure for approving the proposed project. Such a construction would require first a plurality in each town to approve the construction of the school, and then a plurality in the district as a whole to approve the issuance of the necessary bonds. The second approval, though explicitly required by \u00a7 10-56, would be reduced to a meaningless formality.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">We then noted that \u00a7 10-47c expressly excluded certain terms of the plan from the amendment procedure,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and stated that \u201c[i]t is not unreasonable to suppose that terms of the plan relating to areas other than those specifically excluded were also intended to be excepted from the provisions of \u00a7 10-47c.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This supposition is supported by the fact that though \u00a7 10-47c refers to amendments of the terms of the plan generally, \u00a7 10-56 specifically provides a procedure for the approval of bond issues.\u201d Id., 622. We further noted that \u00a7 10-56 had been amended by No. 74-239 of the 1974 Public Acts to provide that \u201c \u2018[t]he exercise of any or all of the powers set forth in this section shall not be construed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>be an amendment of a regional plan pursuant to . . . [\u00a7] 10-47c.\u2019 \u201d Id., 622-23. We then concluded that \u201c\u00a7 10-47c applies only to fundamental amendments of the terms of the plan\u201d; id., 623; such as the size of the regional board and the number of representatives from each town, and did not apply to the terms \u201crelating to the facilities to be provided by the region and estimates of their cost . . . .\u201d Id. We stated: \u201cThat the extraordinary requirement of approval by a plurality in each town is a prerequisite to such fundamental changes is not surprising, since such changes directly affect the voting rights of each individual elector.\u201d Id. Accordingly, we concluded that the proposal to build the new high school was not an amendment of the regional school plan, subject to the referendum provision of \u00a7 10-47c. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">In the present case, the plaintiff contends that, under <em>Atwood, </em>in order to constitute an amendment to a plan under \u00a7 10-47c, \u201cthe proposed action must be one that alters either the structure of the district itself, or the voting power of the district\u2019s residents.\u201d Therefore, it contends, the proposal to consolidate the three hometown elementary schools into a single regional school is not an amendment. The defendant contends that: (1) this case is factually distinguishable from Atwood; and (2) this court should overrule its holdings in <em>Atwood </em>that \u00a7\u00a7 10-56 and 10-47c are mutually exclusive and that only amendments altering the structure of the regional school district or the voting power of the district\u2019s residents come within the scope of \u00a7 10-47c. We agree with the defendant that our reasoning in <em>Atwood </em>was flawed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>The basic flaw in <em>Atwood </em>was our conclusion that \u00a7\u00a7 10-56 and 10-47c could not both \u201cbe construed as governing the procedure for approving the proposed project,\u201d because doing so would render approval under \u00a7 10-56 a \u201cmeaningless formality.\u201d Id., 621. Under \u00a7 10-47c, the legislature intended to allow the voters of any single member town effectively to veto proposed amendments to the regional school plan. If the amendment is approved, however, and requires funding, the legislature intended that the amount and method of funding would be decided by the voters of the district as a whole under \u00a7 10-56. Thus, each statute has a distinct function and applies to a distinct phase of the process. In other words, contrary to our suggestion in <em>Atwood, </em>a determination that \u00a7 10-56 applies to the funding of a proposal does not compel the conclusion that \u00a7 10-47c does not apply to the approval of the proposal in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">We also see no basis for our suggestion in <em>Atwood </em>that \u00a7 10-47c applies only to changes, such as the size of the regional board and the number of representatives from each town, that \u201cdirectly affect the voting rights of each individual elector\u201d in the regional school district. Id., 623. If the legislature had intended to limit \u00a7 10-47c in such a way, it could have done so expressly. It is more reasonable to conclude that the legislature enacted \u00a7 10-47c so that the individual towns that had voted to join a regional school district in reliance on the recommendations of the study committee \u2014 i.e., the \u201cplan\u201d \u2014 would have the opportunity to vote on any change to an existing plan that is not incidental, regardless of the nature of the change.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>is consistent with \u00a7 10-45 (b), which requires that refer-enda on the establishment of regional school districts contain the question: \u201cShall a regional school district be established <em>in accordance with the plan approved by the [s]tate [b]oard of[e]ducation . </em>. . .\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) In addition, nothing in the relevant statutory scheme expressly grants regional school districts the power to create or modify the terms of a plan.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>Whether a change is merely incidental under \u00a7 10-47c must be determined on a case-by-case basis. In making that determination, the court should consider whether the proposal is of a type that a reasonable person would expect to be included in an original plan and whether it is reasonably likely that the inclusion of the proposal in the original plan could have affected an elector\u2019s vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">We conclude that the proposal to consolidate the three separate elementary schools into a single school, thereby eliminating elementary schools in two towns, is not an incidental change to the regional school plan and, therefore, constitutes an amendment to the plan under \u00a7 10-47c. The plan expressly provided in two separate places that the elementary grades would remain in their respective hometown schools. In contrast to the provision that the middle school grades would \u201cbe housed <em>initially </em>in the present Washington High School facility\u201d; (emphasis added); the plan did not indicate in any way that keeping the district\u2019s elementary schools in their respective hometowns was to be a temporary arrangement. In light of the middle school provision, a reasonable person would have believed that, if future consolidation of the elementary schools were a possibility, it would have been mentioned in the plan.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In addition, it is reasonable to conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>the plan provided for hometown elementary schools because it was important to the townspeople in the proposed district to keep their elementary school children in schools close to home and, therefore, they would have been less likely to approve a regional school plan that called for a consolidated elementary school.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Indeed, the legislative history of No. 698 of 1969 Public Acts (P.A. 698), which amended the statutes pertaining to regional school districts; see General Statutes (Cum. Sup. 1967) \u00a7 10-40 et seq.; to clarify that the study committee recommendations constituted the regional school plan and to provide that the townspeople would vote on that plan shows that many towns initially resisted the establishment of regional school districts because the townspeople were under the misconception that regionalization necessarily would require giving up local schools.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>Our conclusion also is supported by the legislative genealogy of the statutes governing the establishment of regional school districts. General Statutes \u00a7 (Rev. to 1958) \u00a7 10-48 provided in relevant part that, \u201c[i]f a regional board of education finds it inadvisable to purchase a site in the town or towns approved in the original referendum held in accordance with the provisions of section 10-45, it may recommend that the site be located in another town or towns and arrange for a referendum to act upon its recommendation to be held in each of the towns comprising the district in the manner provided in section 10-45. ...\u201d This statute was repealed in 1969 when the legislature enacted the amendment procedures set forth in \u00a7 10-47c, which authorize not only the board, but also any member town, to seek an amendment to the plan. See P.A. 698, \u00a7\u00a712 and 27. We see no evidence, however, that the legislature had concluded that a regional board no longer would be required to seek the approval of each member town before relocating a school from one town to another town. Rather, it is more reasonable to conclude that, by enacting \u00a7 10-47c, the legislature intended to expand the referendum requirement to apply to any amendment to the plan. We conclude, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s proposal to delete the plan\u2019s provision calling for separate elementary schools and to add a provision for a consolidated elementary school was an amendment to the plan subject to the referendum provision of \u00a7 10-47c.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">At oral argument before this court, however, the plaintiff pointed out that, when the regional school district was established in 1967, voters were required to vote solely on the question of whether a regional school district should be established; see General Statutes (Cum. Sup. 1967) \u00a7 10-45; and the statutes governing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>the establishment of regional school districts contained no reference to a \u201cplan.\u201d The plaintiff argued that, although \u00a7 10-47c and the referendum provision of the current version of \u00a7 10-45, which were enacted in 1969; see P. A. 698, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 12; applied retroactively to preexisting regional school districts, the 1969 amendments could not make the study committee\u2019s recommendations binding on regional school district boards retroactively because the voters who had approved the preexisting regional school districts had not voted on the recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">We are not persuaded. The 1967 statutes required the study committee to conduct referenda not only on the establishment of the regional school plan, but also on the location of the schools. See General Statutes (Cum. Sup. 1967) \u00a7 10-45.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The 1967 statutes also required the study committee to prepare a final report containing its findings \u201cwith respect to the advisability of establishing a regional district, the towns to be included, the facilities recommended and estimates of the cost of land and facilities.\u201d General Statutes (Cum. Sup. 1967) \u00a7 10-43. The study committee was also required to present the report to member towns in open hearings prior to the referendum on the establishment of a regional school district. See General Statutes (Cum. Sup. 1967) \u00a7\u00a7 10-43 and 10-45. Moreover, although it was not required to do so by statute, the study committee\u2019s report in the present case contained detailed recommendations for the grade levels to be included, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>grade levels for which educational programs were to be provided, educational plans, the distribution of costs among the member towns, operating expenses, projected enrollment and other matters. It is reasonable to conclude that, when the legislature amended the statutory scheme in 1969 to provide that the recommendations of the study committee constituted the regional school plan and that amendments to the plan were subject to referendum under \u00a7 10-47c, and when it provided that these amendments were applicable to existing regional school districts; see P.A. 698, \u00a7 21, now codified at General Statutes \u00a7 10-63h; it intended that study committee recommendations for existing regional school districts would henceforth be considered plans subject to the amendment requirements of \u00a7 10-47c, even though the townspeople technically had not voted on the recommendations in the referenda. Accordingly, we reject the plaintiffs claim that the study committee recommendations in the present case do not constitute a \u201cplan\u201d under the relevant statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">The plaintiff also argues that, even if study committee recommendations made prior to 1969 generally are plans subject to the amendment provisions of \u00a7 10-47c, the study committee recommendations at issue in this case are not, because they expressly provided that \u201c[t]he program and facilities discussed in this report are the [study] committee\u2019s suggestions only. Should a region be established, the . . . board . . . would determine the exact program and facilities for the district. The . . . board is bound only by the broad provisions outlined in the referendum proposal on page [twelve] of this report.\u201d The language accompanying the referendum question on pages twelve and thirteen of the recommendations stated that, \u201c[w]ithin the broad limits of the above proposal, which is prescribed by law, the . . . board . . . would determine the program and facilities of the regional district. Logically, the board could be expected to give due consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>to the recommendations of this study committee, but it is not legally bound by them.\u201d We disagree. First, although the board might not have been bound by all of the recommendations of the study committee when the district was established in 1967, it would appear that the board was not free to change the location of the schools unilaterally, but was legally bound by the referenda establishing the location of the schools unless the towns approved their relocation by referenda. See General Statutes (Cum. Sup. 1967) \u00a7 10-45 and General Statutes (Rev. to 1958) \u00a7 10-48. The study committee had no authority to exempt the board from these statutory provisions. Second, as we have explained, the law was retroactively amended in 1969 to provide that the voters would vote not only on the establishment of a regional school district, but also on the plan, and that any amendments to the plan must be approved by each individual town. We conclude that the mere inclusion in the 1967 study committee recommendations of a generally accurate statement of the then existing law does not exempt the recommendations from the retroactive effect of the 1969 amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to render judgment declaring that the proposal adopted by resolution at the defendant\u2019s May 7, 2007 town meeting constitutes an amendment to the regional school district plan and is subject to \u00a7 10-47c, and to render judgment for the defendant on its application for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b806-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 1047c provides: \u201cWith the exception of the terms which pertain to the capital contribution of member towns, the transfer of property to the regional school district, the grades included, the size of the board of education and the representation of each town on the board and the towns to be served by the regional school district, the terms of the plan approved through referenda pursuant to section 1045 may be amended as follows: If a regional board of education finds it advisable to amend the plan or if the legislative body of a town served by the regional board of education requests amendment of such plan, the regional board of education shall prepare a report on the proposed amendment, including the question to be presented, file a copy with the Commissioner of Education and the clerk of each member town and make copies of such report available to the public at a district meeting called to present the plan.

Reading \u00a7 10-56 (a) in conjunction with the statutes governing the adoption and amendment of regional school plans, however, we conclude that \u00a7 10-56 (a) authorizes a regional school district to construct a school only if the school is contemplated under the regional school plan. If \u00a7 10-56 (a) were construed to authorize regional school districts to build and equip schools entirely as they see fit, then the requirement under \u00a7 10-43 (a) that the study committee include in its final report a description of the facilities recommended and estimates of the cost of land and facilities would be superfluous. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Gibbs, </em>254 Conn. 578, 602, 758 A.2d 327 (2000) (\u201cIt is a basic tenet of statutory construction that the legislature did not intend to enact meaningless provisions. . . . [Statutes must be construed, if possible, such that no clause, sentence or word shall be superfluous, void or insignificant [Internal quotation marks omitted.]). In other words, the study committee\u2019s recommendations, and the opportunity for the townspeople to vote on them under \u00a7 10-45, would be meaningless. As we have indicated, we need not decide in this case whether the <em>replacement </em>of a school that was contemplated in the original regional school plan is subject to the provisions of \u00a7 10-47c. See footnote 10 of this opinion. We conclude, however, that the construction of a <em>type of school </em>that was not contemplated under the original plan \u2014 i. e., a consolidated school, as distinct from a traditional hometown school \u2014 is not within the powers granted to the board under \u00a7 10-56 (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b818-6\"> The plaintiff disputes this reading of the study committee recommendations and contends that they support a conclusion that the location of the elementary schools in their respective hometowns was intended to be a temporary arrangement. In support of this claim, the plaintiff points out that the recommendations state that \u201cthe Washington facility should serve adequately for the first few years of regional operation.\u201d The plaintiff takes this language out of context. The relevant paragraph provides: \u201cThe [study] committee suggests that the [mjiddle [s]chool be housed initially in the present Washington High School facility, after some renovations to outfit it for that purpose. Washington\u2019s elementary facilities would also need some added space. But the combined costs of these two projects would be considerably less than the building of a new [mjiddle [sjchool. Undoubtedly, as enrollments increase, this will have to be done, but the Washington facility should serve adequately for the first few years of regional operation.\u201d It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>clear to us that the \u201cWashington facility\u201d referred to in the last sentence of this paragraph was the existing Washington High School facility that was to house the new regional middle school. At most, the paragraph indicates that, at some point, the Washington elementary school would require renovations to increase its size. There is no suggestion that the school eventually would be eliminated altogether.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b819-6\"> Indeed, the plaintiff concedes that \u201c[t]here is no doubt that the member towns or the residents of those towns might find [the consolidation of the elementary schools to be] highly significant for a number of strongly-held political, historical or personal reasons.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b819-7\"> Section 7 of P.A. 698 amended \u00a7 10-45 to require the study committee to conduct referenda in each member town on the establishment of a regional school district \u201cin accordance with the plan approved by the state board of education . . . .\u201d During the public legislative committee hearings on the bill that was enacted as P.A. 698, W.
