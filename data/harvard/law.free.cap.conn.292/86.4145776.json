(Manafort), from the trial court\u2019s order regarding the allocation of proceeds of a settlement reached in the underlying negligence action brought by the plaintiffs, Joseph Soracco and his spouse, Cheryl Soracco,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against the named defendant, Williams Scotsman, Inc., and the defendant E&amp;F/Walsh Building Company, LLC.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, Manafort claims that the trial court (1) improperly considered facts not in evidence in determining that the equal apportionment of the settlement proceeds between the plaintiffs was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>reasonable,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (2) improperly allowed the plaintiffs and the defendant to settle the matter without Mana-fort\u2019s consent. The plaintiffs oppose Manafort\u2019s claims on several grounds, including that the record is inadequate to determine whether the trial court considered facts not in evidence and that the court was acting with the consent of all parties when it approved the settlement allocation. We need not address the merits of these claims, however, because we conclude that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to determine whether the allocation of the settlement proceeds was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The following uncontested facts and procedural history are relevant to our analysis. The plaintiffs brought an action against the defendant seeking to recover for injuries that Joseph Soracco (Soracco) had sustained on October 16,2001, as a result of the alleged negligence of the defendant\u2019s agents. Soracco sustained his injuries when he fell from a construction trailer after an employee of the defendant allegedly removed the stairs leading from the trailer door to the ground without ensuring that the trailer was unoccupied. Soracco was an employee of Manafort at the time of the accident and was injured in the course of his employment. Manafort became obligated to and did pay Soracco workers\u2019 compensation benefits as a result of his injuries. Soracco\u2019s claim for damages was brought pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-293 and his spouse\u2019s claim for loss of consortium was derivative of his claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Manafort intervened in the plaintiffs\u2019 action, pursuant to \u00a7 31-293 (a), seeking to recover the workers\u2019 compen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>sation benefits that it had paid and become obligated to pay to Soracco. Manafort also asserted a workers\u2019 compensation lien in this action in the amount of $542,411.69. The amount of Manafort\u2019s lien proved to be the main source of contention during the preliminary phase of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">The primary basis for the dispute regarding the amount of the lien and the defendant\u2019s liability was a prior, work-related accident that had occurred on May 7, 1999, in which Soracco had suffered several severe injuries when a steel girder fell across his chest. At the time of the 2001 accident, Soracco only recently had returned to work for Manafort in a \u201clight duty\u201d capacity after missing nearly two and one-half years due to the injuries that he had sustained in the 1999 incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">On October 16, 2006, with the assistance of the court, <em>Holzberg, J., </em>the parties attempted to mediate the various claims. It was the defendant\u2019s position during mediation that the far greater portion of Manafort\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation lien was attributable to the 1999 injury rather than the 2001 injury. In fact, the defendant asserted that only approximately $30,000 of Manafort\u2019s total lien of $542,411.69 was related to the 2001 injury. The parties were unable to reach a settlement during the mediation, and the controversy regarding the legitimate amount of Manafort\u2019s lien never was settled or adjudicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">On October 23, 2006, following the unsuccessful mediation attempt, the plaintiffs and the defendant reported to Judge Holzberg that they had reached a settlement agreement. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel also informed the court that he had provided the defendant with a withdrawal and a formal release from liability.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The substance of the settlement agreement was that, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>exchange for the withdrawal and release, the defendant would pay the plaintiffs a total sum of $750,000. The plaintiffs\u2019 attorney indicated that each plaintiff would receive one half of that amount in satisfaction of their individual claims. Unsatisfied wdth this intended apportionment, Manafort requested a hearing to allow the court to determine whether the equal division of the settlement proceeds was reasonable. Apparently seeking the court\u2019s imprimatur for their settlement, the plaintiffs acquiesced to this procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Judge Holzberg agreed to make a finding regarding whether an equal division of the proceeds between the plaintiffs was reasonable. After considering testimony from Soracco\u2019s spouse as well as arguments from the plaintiffs and Manafort<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> regarding the reasonableness of the settlement allocation, Judge Holzberg upheld the equal apportionment of the settlement proceeds between the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Manafort thereafter appealed to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">We begin our analysis with a brief statement of the relevant principles of standing, followed by an examination of \u00a7 31-293 (a), in order ultimately to determine whether Manafort had standing to contest the allocation of the settlement proceeds. The question of standing implicates a court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. E.g., <em>McWeeny </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>287 Conn. 56, 63, 946 A.2d 862 (2008). \u201c[A] court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over claims brought by persons who do not have standing . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Orsi </em>v. <em>Senatore, </em>230 Conn. 459, 470, 645 A.2d 986 (1994); see also <em>Middle-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number><em>town v. Hartford Electric Light Co., </em>192 Conn. 591, 595, 473 A.2d 787 (1984) (\u201c[t]he issue of . . . standing must be addressed before we reach the substantive merits of the [parties\u2019] claim, because standing has jurisdictional implications\u201d), overruled in part on other grounds by <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>260 Conn. 506, 545, 800 A.2d 1102 (2002). Moreover, concerns regarding subject matter jurisdiction implicate the court\u2019s fundamental authority and may properly be raised and decided by the court sua sponte.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>273 Conn. 434, 441, 870 A.2d 448 (2005) (\u201c[I]t is a fundamental rule that a court may raise and review the issue of subject matter jurisdiction at any time. . . . Subject matter jurisdiction involves the authority of the court to adjudicate the type of controversy presented by the action before it. . . . [A] court lacks discretion to consider the merits of a case over which it is without jurisdiction . . . .\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]). Furthermore, there is no question that this court has jurisdiction to consider, on its own initiative, the jurisdiction of the trial court. See, e.g., <em>Commissioner of Transportation </em>v. <em>Rocky Mountain, LLC, </em>277 Conn. 696, 703, 894 A.2d 259 (2006); <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>275 Conn. 383, 385, 880 A.2d 865 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">It is axiomatic that aggrievement is a basic requirement of standing, just as standing is a fundamental requirement of jurisdiction. \u201cIf a party is found to lack [aggrievement], the court is without subject matter jurisdiction to determine the cause.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bingham </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Works, </em>286 Conn. 698, 701, 945 A.2d 927 (2008); see also <em>Stauton </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>271 Conn. 152, 157, 856 A.2d 400 (2004) (\u201c[P]leading and proof of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>aggrievement are prerequisites to the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction over the subject matter of a plaintiffs appeal. ... A possible absence of subject matter jurisdiction must be addressed and decided whenever the issue is raised.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]). There are two general types of aggrievement, namely, classical and statutory; either type will establish standing, and each has its own unique features. \u201cStatutory aggrievement exists by legislative fiat, not by judicial analysis of the particular facts of the case. In other words, in cases of statutory aggrievement, particular legislation grants standing to those who claim injury to an interest protected by that legislation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pond View, LLC </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>288 Conn. 143, 156, 953 A.2d 1 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">With these principles in mind, we now turn to a detailed examination of \u00a7 31-293 (a), the statute at issue in this case. A review of the statute and its operation demonstrates that Manafort lacked standing to contest the allocation of the settlement proceeds, and, thus, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter its order. Section 31-293 is a detailed scheme governing the parties\u2019 rights in third party workers\u2019 compensation scenarios. Its primary effect is to provide a mechanism for an injured employee to assert a claim against the party allegedly hable for his injury, notwithstanding the employee\u2019s statutory claim for workers\u2019 compensation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The statute also allows an employer who is obligated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits either to intervene in the employee\u2019s action or, in the event that the employee fails to prosecute his claim, to bring an independent action against the alleged tortfeasor.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In either case, the rights of each party with respect to the other are set forth clearly, as is the proper disposition of any damages awarded in an action governed by \u00a7 31-293.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If the employer chooses not to intervene in an action brought by the employee, it still may recover a share of any damages in its capacity as a lienor.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In any event, the employer\u2019s recovery is limited to the amount of workers\u2019 compensation benefits that it has paid or has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>become obligated to pay as a result of the tortfeasor\u2019s alleged negligence or malfeasance.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Finally, the rights of each party are protected by the following critical provision: \u201cNo compromise with the [alleged tortfeasor] by either the employer or the employee shall be binding upon or affect the rights of the other, unless assented to by him.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-293 (a). This provision protects each party, whether the intervening employer or the real party in interest, i.e., the injured employee, by permitting the nonsettling or nonassenting party to retain all of its rights under the statute despite any unilateral settlement by the other party with the alleged tortfeasor.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In other words, if the employee chooses to settle his personal injury claim against the tortfeasor without the assent of the employer, the employer\u2019s right to recover on its hen and to pursue an independent action against the tortfeasor to recover any deficiency on that hen is unaffected. This means, of course, that when the employee and the tortfeasor settle the matter for less than the amount of the hen, the tortfeasor must weigh the risk of further htigation and exposure to greater liability that may result from a settlement reached without the intervening employer\u2019s assent. Significantly, however, the statute does not provide a mechanism for the nonassenting party to challenge a settlement between the other party and the tortfeasor. See <em>Ski-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number><em>tromo </em>v. <em>Meriden Yellow Cab Co., </em>204 Conn. 485, 489, 528 A.2d 826 (1987) (\u201c[the intervening plaintiffs] sole means to assert any right against the plaintiffs third party recovery [is] by way of the procedure set forth in \u00a7 31-293\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Section 31-293 (a) thus strives to balance and protect the interests of all the parties involved in a third party workers\u2019 compensation action. \u201cWe have repeatedly observed that our [Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, \u00a7 31-293 in particular] represents a complex and comprehensive statutory scheme balancing the rights and claims of the employer and the employee arising out of work-related personal injuries.\u201d <em>Durniak </em>v. <em>August Winter &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>222 Conn. 775, 781, 610 A.2d 1277 (1992). Both the employer, who is obligated to pay workers\u2019 compensation, and the injured employee have an independent right to bring an action against a third party who allegedly is liable for the injury. \u201cBy allowing either an employer or an employee to bring an action, the law seeks to vindicate both the employee\u2019s interest in receiving the full scope of tort damages that remain uncompensated by a workers\u2019 compensation award and the employer\u2019s interest in being reimbursed for payments made because of the third party\u2019s malfeasance.\u201d <em>Skitromo </em>v. <em>Meriden Yellow Cab Co., </em>supra, 204 Conn. 488. As we previously noted, the employee\u2019s right to recover damages from the tortfeasor is not limited by the statute but is subject to a judgment lien that can be asserted by the employer to recover \u201cany amount that he has paid or has become obligated to pay as compensation to the injured employee\u201d as a result of the tortfeasor\u2019s negligence. General Statutes \u00a7 31-293 (a). As we also have noted, the employer may proceed independently if the employee does not institute an action or may intervene as a party plaintiff in the employee\u2019s action.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Manafort\u2019s rights in this case are defined entirely by \u00a7 31-293 (a). See <em>Durniak </em>v. <em>August Winter &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>supra, 222 Conn. 782 (\u201can employer\u2019s right to obtain reimbursement from a third party tortfeasor is a statutory claim that is derived <em>in its entirety </em>from \u00a7 31-293 (a)\u201d [emphasis added]). There is no common-law counterpart to an employer\u2019s statutory cause of action under \u00a7 31-293 (a). Id. Thus, in order to claim standing to challenge the allocation of the proceeds of the settlement between the plaintiffs and the defendant, Manafort must show that it has suffered statutory aggrievement. In other words, Manafort must demonstrate that the allocation of the settlement proceeds caused an \u201cinjury to an interest protected by [\u00a7 31-293 (a)].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pond View, LLC </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 288 Conn. 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">We conclude that \u00a7 31-293 (a) does not confer standing on an employer seeking to challenge the allocation of the proceeds of a settlement reached between its injured employee and the tortfeasor. Indeed, the statute protects employers from unilateral settlement agreements by preserving their rights in the face of such agreements and by providing that they cannot be bound by them absent their assent. Section 31-293 does not, however, allow an employer to interfere with a settlement reached between its employee and the tortfeasor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>nor does it provide courts with the authority to dictate the appropriate terms of such a settlement.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">We fail to discern, and Manafort has offered no explanation of, what statutory right has been impinged on by the settlement between the plaintiffs and the defendant. Section 31-293 explicitly contemplates the possibility that such a settlement can occur, and declares, in response, that the settlement \u201cshall [not] be binding upon or affect the rights of the other [party], unless assented to by him.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-293 (a). Therein lies the crux of the problem: Manafort simply cannot be aggrieved by a settlement to which it is not bound, and which does not interfere with its rights in the absence of its consent. As we noted previously, the only rights that Manafort enjoys under this scheme are the right to impose a lien on any judgment or settlement, up to the amount of its workers\u2019 compensation liability, and the right to bring an independent cause of action against the defendant through which it can recover workers\u2019 compensation payments that it has paid or has become obligated to pay as a result of the defendant\u2019s alleged negligence. In the absence of any voluntary relinquishment of these rights by Manafort, the settlement between the plaintiffs and the defendant did not affect Manafort\u2019s rights, and, therefore, Manafort has failed to demonstrate the requisite aggrievement to establish standing.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Ultimately, this appeal represents nothing more than a challenge to the voluntary and consensual division of the proceeds of a settlement reached by the plaintiffs and the defendant. The employer\u2019s cause of action under these circumstances is a creature of statute, namely, \u00a7 31-293. Its rights and remedies are fully and plainly set forth in that statute, which clearly indicates that all of these rights are left intact in the face of a settlement to which the intervening employer does not assent. Because we conclude that none of Manafort\u2019s statutory interests was affected by the settlement between the plaintiffs and the defendant, we further conclude that it lacked standing to challenge the terms of that settlement, and, therefore, the trial court was without jurisdiction to consider Manafort\u2019s challenge to the allocation of the proceeds of that settlement.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">The order is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b107-10\"> We hereinafter refer to Joseph Soracco and Cheryl Soracco collectively as the plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b107-11\"> The action was withdrawn as to the defendant E&amp;F/Walsh Building Company, LLC.

In fact, on its face, it would seem to allow either party to settle without the acquiescence or even the knowledge of the other party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b115-6\"> We note that the <em>only </em>apparent reason for allowing the employer to intervene in the employee\u2019s action is to protect the employer\u2019s rights in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>event of a settlement. In the absence of a settlement, the employer\u2019s rights are completely protected by its judgment lien and its ability to bring an independent cause of action when the employee declines to prosecute his claim. If, for instance, under circumstances similar to those in the present case, the tortfeasor sought to settle the case with the employee and the employee\u2019s spouse for considerably less than the employer\u2019s potential workers\u2019 compensation liability, the employer effectively would be deprived of his right to recover on the lien if it could not pursue a separate cause of action against the tortfeasor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b117-6\"> Indeed, it is clear that \u00a7 31-293 contains no provision authorizing the remedy that Manafort seeks in this appeal, i.e., a new hearing regarding the reasonableness of the allocation of the proceeds arising from the plaintiffs\u2019 settlement agreement. In fact, granting such relief would appear to violate Soracco\u2019s explicit statutory right to settle with the tortfeasor without the assent of his employer. Such a remedy also would implicate the recovery of Soracco\u2019s spouse for her loss of consortium claim, with which Manafort has no right, statutory or otherwise, to interfere.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b117-7\"> We recognize that the doctrines of final judgment and ripeness are also implicated in this appeal and likely provide an independent basis for our ultimate conclusion regarding the lack of subject matter jurisdiction in this case. Because we decide the case on the basis of standing, however, we need not reach these other issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b118-9\"> In conducting this hearing, which is not authorized by the statute, we surmise that Judge Holzberg was attempting to accommodate Soracco and Manafort by mediating this final disputed issue. Our surmise is supported by Judge Holzberg\u2019s expression of surprise when he learned of Manafort\u2019s intention to appeal his determination and order: \u201c[M]y recollection ... is that this was submitted to me by the agreement of the parties to make such a finding .... I was operating under the assumption that the parties were looking for an allocation and frankly would abide by whatever was said.\" Judge Holzberg\u2019s surprise is understandable when one considers that the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint had been withdrawn prior to the hearing on the reasonableness of the apportionment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
