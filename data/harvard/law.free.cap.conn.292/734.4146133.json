Singleton, of manslaughter in the first degree.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Appellate Court concluded that the trial court failed to instruct the jury properly on self-defense by removing from its consideration the disputed factual issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>whether the defendant had used deadly or nondeadly physical force during an altercation with the victim, Leonard Cobbs, that resulted in the victim\u2019s death. <em>State </em>v. <em>Singleton, </em>97 Conn. App. 679, 687, 905 A.2d 725 (2006). On appeal to this court, the state claims that the trial court correctly instructed that the defendant had used deadly physical force in defending himself against the victim because his claim of self-defense required a jury determination as to whether he was justified in killing the victim with a knife, thus making his theoretical use of nondeadly force during the preceding struggle irrelevant. The defendant responds that the instructions were improper because the use of deadly or nondeadly physical force during the struggle was a disputed factual issue for the jury to decide. The defendant alternatively<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> contends that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the \u201cinitial aggressor\u201d exception to the law of self-defense and on the offense of manslaughter in the first degree. We agree with the state that the court\u2019s instructions on self-defense were proper and reject the defendant\u2019s alternative grounds for affirmance. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">The following facts, which the jury reasonably could have found, are set forth in the opinion of the Appellate Court. \u201cThe defendant and the victim . . . had used illegal drugs together. The victim purchased these drugs with the defendant\u2019s money. The defendant was angry that the victim had failed to reimburse him for his share of the drugs. On December 18, 2002, the defendant attempted to find the victim to collect this debt and traveled to both West Haven and New Haven in order to locate him. He eventually found the victim in the Newhall area of West Haven.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>\u201cThe two men spoke, and the defendant demanded that the victim pay him. The victim indicated that he did not have the money. The victim agreed to go to the defendant\u2019s apartment later that day to repay his debt of $180. After arriving at the apartment, the victim again informed the defendant that he did not have the money but offered to perform oral sex as an alternative means to settle the debt. The defendant rejected this proposal and became angry. The defendant then threatened the victim by stating: \u2018Yo, I\u2019ll fuck you up.\u2019 At approximately 6:45 p.m., a physical altercation between the two men commenced. The victim and the defendant moved around the room while engaged in this physical altercation. During this encounter, the defendant stabbed the victim several times with both a knife and a screwdriver.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The stab wound that caused the victim\u2019s death was seven and one-half inches deep, running from left to right, and was caused by a downward strike.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This wound penetrated the chest wall, a portion of the left lung, the pericardium and the heart, and the diaphragm, terminating in the liver. The length, depth and size of the wound all were consistent with having been caused by the knife blade.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">\u201cThe defendant did not call the police or paramedics immediately but, instead, disposed of the knife blade, which had broken off from the handle, and attempted to clean up the apartment. More than thirty minutes after the altercation had ended, at approximately 7:22 p.m., the defendant called his girlfriend, Victoria Salas. After arriving at the apartment, Salas attempted to revive the victim and called 911. At approximately 8:51 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>p.m., the defendant, using Salas\u2019 cellular telephone, called the building maintenance supervisor, Richard McCann. McCann helped the defendant retrieve the knife blade that he had thrown down the garbage chute. At 9:06 p.m., Salas telephoned the police department, and officers arrived more than two hours after the fight. The officers discovered blood throughout the defendant\u2019s apartment. The knife had the victim\u2019s blood on it. The screwdriver had DNA from the victim on the handle, blood from the defendant on the shaft, and a mixture of blood on the tip with the defendant\u2019s DNA as the major contributor. One of the detectives observed that the defendant was bleeding from the middle of his chest and that there was a bloodstain on his shirt approximately the size of a fifty cent piece. This wound later was determined to have been caused by the screwdriver.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">\u201cThe defendant raised the issue of self-defense at trial. The defense was premised on the defendant\u2019s version of the fight. The defendant testified that after he had asked the victim to repay him in the apartment, the victim became verbally aggressive and pulled out the screwdriver and threatened him. The victim then stabbed the defendant in the chest, and a struggle ensued. The defendant managed to disarm the victim, and they continued to struggle. Eventually, the victim grabbed the knife. The defendant managed to grab the victim\u2019s wrists, and, at some point, the knife went into the victim\u2019s body, ending the struggle.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Singleton, </em>supra, 97 Conn. App. 680-82.</p>\n<p id=\"AqhQ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>Both parties requested jury instructions on self-defense. In the state\u2019s request to charge, it proposed instructions referring to \u201cdeadly physical force\u201d that were based on language in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 (a)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the instructions given in <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>264 Conn. 723, 732, 826 A.2d 128 (2003), <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>235 Conn. 274, 286-87, 664 A.2d 743 (1995), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Skelly, </em>78 Conn. App. 513, 516-17, 827 A.2d 759, cert. denied, 266 Conn. 910, 832 A.2d 74 (2003), in which the victims had been fatally shot or stabbed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant proposed instructions that did not refer to \u201cdeadly physical force\u201d but, rather, to \u201creasonable physical force\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>and the use of \u201ca dangerous instrumentality . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court followed the state\u2019s approach and instructed the jury to consider whether the defendant\u2019s use of \u201cdeadly physical force\u201d was justified under a theory of self-defense.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It did not instruct on the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>of nondeadly physical force, nor did it instruct that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>jury was required to decide the degree of force that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>defendant had used. The jury subsequently rejected the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense and found him guilty of the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree. Thereafter, the court rendered judgment, sentencing the defendant to a term of twenty years incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">On appeal to the Appellate Court, the defendant claimed that the trial court\u2019s instructions were improper because the trial court had failed to submit to the jury the factual question of whether the defendant had used deadly or nondeadly force during his struggle with the victim prior to the stabbing. <em>State </em>v. <em>Singleton, </em>supra, 97 Conn. App. 687. The Appellate Court agreed, concluding that \u201c[t]he defendant testified that he [had] grabbed the victim\u2019s wrists and that during this physical encounter, the knife ended up wounding the victim. We cannot conclude, as a matter of law, that such actions constituted deadly physical force. The defendant was entitled to have the jury, rather than the court, make that factual determination. . . . Simply put, the jury did not have the opportunity to consider the factual issue of whether the defendant used deadly or nondeadly physical force. \u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 696. The Appellate Court further observed that, \u201c[h]ad the jury been instructed to determine whether the defendant used nondeadly force, it could have found that the defendant\u2019s grabbing of the victim\u2019s wrists and the ensuing struggle constituted an appropriate level of force to repel the victim. The option never was afforded to the defendant. . . . [T]he improper instructions [thus] prejudiced the defendant by making it easier for the state to disprove the claim of self-defense.\u201d Id., 697. The Appellate Court also concluded that the evidence was not \u201cso overwhelming as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>to render the improper instruction[s] harmless\u201d and ordered a new trial. Id., 698. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">The state claims that the Appellate Court improperly reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction on the ground that the jury should have been instructed to consider the issue of nondeadly force. The state contends that there was no dispute that the defendant inflicted the fatal stab wound with the knife and that, once the jury determined that he had done so intentionally, all that was left to decide regarding his claim of self-defense was whether his actions were justified, thereby rendering irrelevant the issue of whether he had used deadly or nondeadly force during the struggle that preceded the stabbing. The defendant responds that the only intentional force he used was when he fought with the victim over the knife and that the actual stabbing was an unintended consequence of the altercation. Accordingly, he argues that the jury, in considering his claim of self-defense, was required to resolve the factual question of whether he used deadly or nondeadly force during the struggle. The defendant contends that the resolution of this factual question was crucial because it affected the state\u2019s burden of disproving his claim of self-defense by making it easier to refute a claim of self-defense predicated on the use of deadly rather than nondeadly force. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">We begin our analysis with the standard of review. \u201cA fundamental element of due process is the right of a defendant charged with a crime to establish a defense. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>225 Conn. 270, 283, 623 A.2d 42 (1993). An improper instruction on a defense, like an improper instruction on an element of an offense, is of constitutional dimension. . . . [T]he standard of review to be applied to the defendant\u2019s constitutional claim is whether it is reasonably possible that the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>was misled. ... In determining whether the jury was misled, [i]t is well established that [a] charge to the jury is not to be critically dissected for the purpose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statement, but it is to be considered rather as to its probable effect [on] the jury in guiding [it] to a correct verdict in the case. . . . The test to be applied to any part of a charge is whether the charge, considered as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>[supra, 264 Conn. 729-30]; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>[supra, 235 Conn. 284]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>228 Conn. 335, 339, 636 A.2d 782 (1994). ... In reviewing the trial court\u2019s failure to charge as requested, we must adopt the version of facts most favorable to the defendant which the evidence would reasonably support. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>55 Conn. App. 298, 302, 739 A.2d 1264 (1999), cert. denied, 252 Conn. 923, 747 A.2d 519 (2000); <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>32 Conn. App. 687, 690, 631 A.2d 324, cert. denied, 227 Conn. 932, 632 A.2d 708 (1993).\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Singleton, </em>supra, 97 Conn. App. 688-89. \u201cA challenge to the validity of jury instructions presents a question of law over which [we have] plenary review.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mann </em>v. <em>Regan, </em>108 Conn. App. 566, 576, 948 A.2d 1075 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201c[A] person is justified in using reasonable physical force upon another person to defend himself . . . from what he reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of physical force, and he may use such degree of force which he reasonably believes to be necessary for such purpose; except that deadly physical force may not be used unless the actor reasonably believes that such other person is (1) using or about to use deadly physical force, or (2) inflicting or about to inflict great bodily harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>\u201cUnder our Penal Code, self-defense ... is a defense . . . rather than an affirmative defense. . . . Consequently, a defendant has no burden of persuasion for a claim of self-defense; he has only a burden of production. That is, he merely is required to introduce sufficient evidence to warrant presenting his claim of self-defense to the jury. . . . Once the defendant has done so, it becomes the state\u2019s burden to disprove the defense beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . Accordingly, [u]pon a valid claim of self-defense, a defendant is entitled to properjury instructions on the elements of self-defense so that the jury may ascertain whether the state has met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the assault was not justified. ... As these principles indicate, therefore, only the state has a burden of persuasion regarding a self-defense claim . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 730-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">\u201cOur statutes distinguish between deadly and non-deadly force used in self-defense. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19. Additionally, [this court] has recognized that when instructing a juiy on self-defense under \u00a7 53a-19, there is a distinction between deadly and nondeadly force. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Whitford, </em>260 Conn. 610, 631-32, 799 A.2d 1034 (2002); see also J. Pellegrino, Connecticut Selected Jury Instructions: Criminal (3d Ed. 2001) \u00a7\u00a7 [2.39 through 2.40], pp. 110-23. The state may defeat a defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense involving deadly physical force by proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, any of the following: (1) the defendant did not reasonably believe that the victim was using or about to use deadly physical force or inflicting or about to inflict great bodily harm; or (2) the defendant knew that he could avoid the necessity of using deadly physical force with complete safety by retreating,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or surrendering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>possession of property to a person asserting a claim of right or by complying with a demand that he . . . abstain from performing an act that he is not obligated to perform. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19. In other words, the General Assembly has created specific legislation that limits the use of deadly physical force in the context of self-defense when compared to the use of reasonable physical force. If the state can carry its burden of proof with respect to any of the enumerated situations . . . the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense [involving the use of] deadly physical force will fail. In contrast, the right to use reasonable physical force is, by legislative fiat, much broader in scope. In order to defeat a claim of self-defense [involving] the use of reasonable physical force, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not reasonably believe that he or she was subject to the use or imminent use of physical force and did not use a degree of force that was reasonable for that purpose. Simply put, it is much easier for the state to disprove [a claim of] self-defense when [it is predicated on the use of] deadly physical force . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Singleton, </em>supra, 97 Conn. App. 692-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Before addressing the merits, we note that a claim of self-defense is a justification defense. \u201cA justification defense represents a legal acknowledgment that the harm caused by otherwise criminal conduct is, under special justifying circumstances, outweighed by the need to avoid an even greater harm or to further a greater societal interest. 1 P. Robinson, Criminal Law Defenses (1984) \u00a7 24 (a), p. 83. [Thus], in the case of self-defense, [s]ociety\u2019s interest in the right to bodily integrity, when combined with the physical harm threatened [by an aggressor], outweighs the normal prohibition against the physical iryury needed to deter such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>an aggressor. Id., p. 84. All justification defenses share a similar internal structure: special triggering circumstances permit a necessary and proportional response . . . . Id., \u00a7 24 (b), p. 86. In Connecticut, self-defense is a justification for engaging in <em>otherwise criminal conduct. </em>See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19; see also P. Robinson, \u2018Criminal Law Defenses: A Systematic Analysis,\u2019 82 Colum. L. Rev. 199, 236 (1982) ([i]n most modem codifications, self-defense is appropriately treated . . . as a pure justification).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">\u201cJustified conduct is subject to neither condemnation nor punishment because it does not, under the circumstances, violate the prohibition of the law, and indeed may be desired and encouraged. P. Robinson, supra, 82 Colum. L. Rev. 245. Thus, conduct that is found to be justified is, under the circumstances, not criminal. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Yanz, </em>74 Conn. 177, 186, 50 A. 37 (1901) <em>(Hamersley, J., </em>dissenting) (killing in self-defense is not a crime); <em>State </em>v. <em>Scheele, </em>57 Conn. 307, 314, 18 A. 256 (1889) (reasonable exercise of the right [of self-defense is] justifiable and not a crime at all); <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Platt, </em>32 Conn. 75, 83 (1864) (no man is liable in a civil suit or criminal prosecution for an injury lawfully committed in self-defense upon an actual assailant); see also <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Leeke, </em>725 F.2d 246, 249-50 n.2 (4th Cir.) (Rooted in the Anglo-American tradition is the belief that a killing in self-defense is not a crime. . . . [I]t is elementary and fundamental to our jurisprudence that killing or wounding in self-defense is simply no crime at all . . . .), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 870, 105 S. Ct. 218, 83 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1984); Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 53a-16 (West 2001), comment of the commission to revise the criminal statutes (self-defense statute state [s] [a rule] of law under which the use of force is justified and thus not criminal).\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>277 Conn. 735, 752-53, 894 A.2d 928 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>Mindful of these principles, we agree with the state that the trial court\u2019s instructions on self-defense were not improper under the circumstances of this case. We begin our analysis by observing that the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense is not, in actuality, a justification defense. Although the defendant cloaks his claim in the language of self-defense, he does not seek \u201cjustification for engaging in <em>otherwise criminal </em>conduct(emphasis added) id., 752; but repeatedly characterizes his fatal stabbing of the victim as the unintended consequence of the struggle over the knife.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, the defendant never concedes in his appellate brief that he <em>may </em>have stabbed the victim during their struggle; rather, he maintains that he \u201cnever denied that the death of [the victim] had occurred, unintentionally, during a struggle over a knife . . . .\u201d He likewise declares that (1) the victim\u2019s death occurred when the victim was \u201cunintentionally stabbed during the struggle as [he] was defending himself from [the victim\u2019s] knife attack,\u201d (2) \u201c[he] was not aware during the struggle that [the victim] got injured,\u201d (3) \u201cthe stabbing of [the victim] was not an intended result but had unintentionally occurred during the struggle,\u201d (4) \u201cthe stabbing of [the victim] was unintended and . . . happened unintentionally during the defendant\u2019s intentional and justified self-defense struggle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>with [the victim] over the knife,\u201d (5) he testified that \u201cthe only intentional force used was to struggle over the knife and that the actual stabbing occurred unintentionally during the struggle,\u201d and (6) \u201che struggled with [the victim] over the knife in self-defense but . . . the actual stabbing occurred unintentionally . . . .\u201d In other words, the defendant repeatedly claims that the stabbing was, for all intents and purposes, accidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The defendant\u2019s argument on appeal is consistent with his testimony at trial that he did not know that the victim had been wounded by the knife, even when the victim suddenly stopped struggling and staggered over to the bed. In fact, the defendant testified that he thought that the victim \u201cwas kidding\u201d after he ceased fighting and sat down on the bed, and that it was only after the victim rolled off the bed and onto the floor that the defendant saw a bloodstain on the front of the victim\u2019s sweater and discovered the stab wound. The defendant also makes no claim that, even if the jury found that he intentionally had stabbed the victim, he acted in self-defense. Indeed, he contends that his claim <em>differs </em>from that of an accused claiming self-defense who acknowledges intentionally firing a gun or intentionally stabbing the victim but who maintains that it was necessary to do so in self-defense. Instead, the defendant repeatedly emphasizes that the stabbing in this case was \u201cunintended,\u201d or that it \u201chappened unintentionally\u201d during his \u201cintentional and justified self-defense struggle with [the victim] over the knife\u201d and, thus, did not involve any criminal conduct. Consequently, his claim is more properly viewed as a claim of accident, or failure of proof, which raises the entirely different question of whether he <em>intended </em>to commit the crime, not whether he was justified in committing it.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See 1 P. Robinson, supra, Criminal Law Defenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>\u00a7 22, p. 72 (\u201cFailure of proof defenses consist of instances in which because of the conditions that are the basis for the \u2018defense,\u2019 all elements of the offense charged cannot be proven. They are in essence no more than the negation of an element required by the definition of the offense.\u201d); see also id., \u00a7 51 (a), p. 203 n.l (failure of proof defenses are \u201cclearly distinct from justifications . . . [because] they express no general principle of exculpation or exemption\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">A claim of accident, pursuant to which the defendant asserts that the state failed to prove the intent element of a criminal offense, does not require a separate jury instruction because the court\u2019s instruction on the intent required to commit the underlying crime is sufficient in such circumstances. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Schultz, </em>100 Conn. App. 709, 716, 921 A.2d 595 (trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s request to charge on accident or unintended consequences not improper because court instructed jury on element of intent), cert. denied, 282 Conn. 926, 926 A.2d 668 (2007). We nevertheless consider whether the trial court improperly failed to instruct the jury to decide whether the defendant used deadly or nondeadly force when the state agreed with the defendant that he presented sufficient evidence to warrant a self-defense instruction and the trial court concluded that he was entitled to have one. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>55 Conn. App. 298, 300-301, 739 A.2d 1264 (1999) (defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>need not admit to having acted intentionally to assert claim of self-defense), cert. denied, 252 Conn. 923, 747 A.2d 519 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">The state claims that the trial court\u2019s instructions on self-defense were proper because, once the jury found that the defendant had the requisite intent to commit the charged offense, it necessarily would have rejected his claim of accident, or unintended consequences, thus, completely removing from the jury\u2019s consideration the issue of whether the defendant used deadly or non-deadly force during the preceding struggle. We agree.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>The trial court instructed the jury on the elements of murder and of the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree in accordance with the state\u2019s substitute information, which charged that the defendant, \u201cwith the intent to cause the death of [the victim], caused the death of [the victim] by stabbing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>him with a knife, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54 (a).\u201d The court specifically instructed the jury that the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) the defendant intended to cause the victim\u2019s death or, with respect to the lesser offense of manslaughter in the first degree, that he intended to cause the victim to suffer serious physical injury, (2) the defendant, acting with that specific intent, caused the death of the victim by stabbing him with a knife, and (3) the defendant was not justified in using deadly physical force.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The instruction on self-defense thus required the jury to consider the force that the defendant used in stabbing the victim, not the force that he used in the struggle over the knife, because the struggle apart from the stabbing was irrelevant to the charge of murder and the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The defendant\u2019s and the Appellate Court\u2019s focus on the struggle preceding the stabbing is improper in this case. Once the jury found that the state had met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to cause the victim serious physical injury and had caused his death by stabbing him with the knife, there was no disputed factual issue that required the juiy to determine whether the defendant had used deadly or nondeadly physical force during the struggle. The defendant\u2019s intentional use of force during the straggle had <em>no bearing </em>on the ultimate question of whether he was guilty of murder or manslaughter in the first degree because both offenses were predicated on the fact that the defendant intentionally had stabbed the victim.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>The defendant argues that the struggle over the knife was relevant to the charged crimes and that the jury was not required to find that he intended to cause the victim harm because this court has ruled that self-defense is a valid defense to unintentional crimes. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>213 Conn. 579, 584, 569 A.2d 534 (1990) (rejecting claim that self-defense and reckless manslaughter are \u201cmutually incompatible\u201d and holding that self-defense is valid defense to unintentional crime of second degree manslaughter); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>39 Conn. App. 563, 567 n.4, 665 A.2d 910 (\u201c[s] elf-defense is a valid defense to crimes based on reckless conduct as well as intentional conduct\u201d), cert. denied, 235 Conn. 931, 667 A.2d 800 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>24 Conn. App. 586, 590-91, 590 A.2d 490 (stating that self-defense is valid defense to \u201cthe unintentional offense of reckless manslaughter in the first degree\u201d), cert. denied, 219 Conn. 912, 593 A.2d 136 (1991). In the present case, however, the defendant was not charged with a crime involving recklessness but with the crime of murder, and the jury was instructed on the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree, which, along with murder, requires proof of an intent to harm. The defendant also failed to request a jury instruction on a lesser included offense involving reckless or unintentional conduct or to object to the court\u2019s charge on the ground that it did not include instructions on the elements of a lesser included offense involving reckless or unintentional conduct. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s argument is unpersuasive because he was not charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>with, and the jury was not instructed on, a crime that would have required proof that the fatal stabbing was the unintended or reckless consequence of the defendant\u2019s struggle with the victim over the knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">The trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on non-deadly force otherwise was not improper. As we previously explained, the court repeatedly instructed the jury that it must decide whether the defendant was justified in using deadly physical force to defend himself. See footnote 10 of this opinion. \u201cDeadly physical force\u201d is defined in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (5) as \u201cphysical force which can be reasonably expected to cause death or serious physical injury . . . .\u2019\u2019In using the term \u201cdeadly physical force,\u201d the trial court was describing what the jury would have found as to the second element of the crime of murder or first degree manslaughter <em>prior </em>to considering the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense, namely, that he had caused the death of the victim by stabbing him with the knife, an instrument that clearly can cause the harm contemplated by the statutory definition of \u201cdeadly physical force.\u201d Thus, an instruction directing the jury to decide whether the defendant had used nondeadly physical force in committing the crime more than likely would have been confusing because it would have suggested, incorrectly, that the victim\u2019s death might have been caused by something other than the knife or the stabbing. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s instructions on deadly physical force, when read in conjunction with its instructions on causation, were not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">The defendant essentially concedes this point in arguing, with respect to his first alternative ground for affirmance, that the victim\u2019s alleged attack on him with a screwdriver and a knife constituted the use of deadly force because \u201cthere is no question that intentionally stabbing someone with a screwdriver is the use of deadly physical force, as is then coming at that person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>with a long kitchen knife.\u201d Similarly, the defendant, in criticizing the trial court for allegedly failing to instruct the jury that, if it found that he had stabbed the victim intentionally, then, and only then, could or should it find that the stabbing constituted the use of deadly physical force for the purpose of considering his claim of self-defense, in effect concedes that such an instruction would have been proper. The court, however, <em>did </em>instruct the jury that it first must find intent, and then causation, before reaching the question of whether the defendant\u2019s use of deadly physical force was reasonable under a theory of self-defense.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We therefore conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>that, in light of the defendant\u2019s concession that stabbing a person with a knife constitutes the use of deadly physical force, and the jury\u2019s findings that the defendant intended to cause the victim serious physical injury and that he caused the victim\u2019s death by stabbing him with the knife, which were made <em>before </em>the jury reached the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense, the court\u2019s instructions as to whether the defendant was justified in using deadly physical force were not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">The defendant also claims that the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment may be affirmed on the alternative ground that the trial court improperly had instructed the jury on the initial aggressor exception to the law of self-defense. He specifically claims that the instructions failed to make clear that (1) a person cannot be considered an initial aggressor on the basis of words alone, and (2) a person who uses nondeadly force as the initial aggressor may be justified in using deadly force in response to an unjustified escalation from nondeadly to deadly force by the victim of the attack. The state responds that the court\u2019s instructions, when considered in the context of the testimony at trial, \u201cdid not have the effect of directing the jury to conclude\u201d that the defendant was the initial aggressor or that he unlawfully escalated the level of violence from nondeadly to deadly force.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">The defendant acknowledges that his claims are unpreserved because he did not file a request to charge on the initial aggressor exception and did not object to the jury instructions on self-defense when they were given. He therefore seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). \u201cUnder <em>Golding, </em>a defendant can prevail on an unpreserved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>constitutional claim on appeal only if all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. [Id.] The first two [prongs of <em>Golding) </em>involve a determination of whether the claim is reviewable; the second two . . . involve a determination of whether the defendant may prevail. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Peeler, </em>271 Conn. 338, 360, 857 A.2d 808 (2004), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 845, 126 S. Ct. 94, 163 L. Ed. 2d 110 (2005).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>290 Conn. 602, 618 n.12, 966 A.2d 148 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">We conclude that the defendant\u2019s claims are reviewable under <em>Golding </em>because the record is adequate and the claim of an improper jury instruction is of constitutional magnitude. See part I of this opinion. We further conclude, however, that the defendant cannot prevail on his claims because there was no possibility that the jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s instructions, and, therefore, no constitutional violation clearly existed that deprived him of a fair trial. We address each claim in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">The defendant first claims that the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment should be affirmed on the ground that the trial court improperly failed to instruct that a person cannot be deemed the initial aggressor as a matter of law on the basis of words alone and that the qualifying act must be physical rather than verbal. He claims that such an instruction was necessary because the court\u2019s instructions suggested that a person could be deemed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>the initial aggressor on the basis of words alone, even though the law is clearly to the contrary. The defendant also contends that the requested instruction was important because the state misled the jury and caused it to reject his claim of self-defense on an improper ground when the senior assistant state\u2019s attorney (prosecutor) indicated to the jury that it could, and should, find that the defendant was the initial aggressor when he threatened the victim by stating, \u201c[y]o, I\u2019ll fuck you up,\u201d after the victim had offered to perform oral sex as a means of settling his drug debt. The state responds that the facts do not support this view and that the jury was not misled by the trial court\u2019s instructions. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this claim. During closing argument, the prosecutor told the jury that \u201c[t]he initial aggressor is the person who first acts in such a manner . . . that creates a reasonable belief in another person\u2019s mind that physical force is about to be used upon that other person.\u201d The prosecutor then argued: \u201cDo we have a situation like that? Do we have an initial action that caused \u2014 that was threatening [and] that caused fear in [the victim]? You owe me money, I\u2019ve got you in my apartment. You\u2019ve seen the [diagram depicting the respective positions of the victim and the defendant in the defendant\u2019s apartment at the time of the altercation] .... [The defendant is] blocking [the victim\u2019s] way out of the apartment, isn\u2019t he? And [the defendant] says, \u2018I\u2019m going to fuck you up,\u2019 and he starts moving toward [the victim].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">Thereafter, defense counsel argued: \u201cInitial aggressor? [The defendant] says, \u2018I\u2019m going to fuck you up,\u2019 and he goes toward [the victim], the [victim] pulls a screwdriver, and [the defendant] immediately backs up and puts his hands up. Now, [the victim is] the aggressor and he gets stabbed. And they grapple, and [the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>dant] disarms [the victim], and [the victim] goes back and gets [the] knife to escalate it, and [the defendant is] the initial aggressor?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">The trial court subsequently instructed the jury in relevant part: \u201cThe initial aggressor is the person who first acts in such a manner that creates a reasonable belief in another person\u2019s mind that physical force is about to be used upon that other person. The first person to use physical force is not necessarily the initial aggressor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 (c) provides in relevant part: \u201c[A] person is not justified in using physical force when ... (2) he is the initial aggressor . . . .\u2019\u2019In <em>State </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 340-41, we stated that \u201c[i]t is not the law . . . that the person who first uses physical force is necessarily the initial aggressor under \u00a7 53a-19 (c) (2). ... To attach such a meaning to \u00a7 53a-19 (c) (2) would run counter to the plain language of \u00a7 53a-19 (a), which states in [relevant] part that \u2018a person is justified in using reasonable physical force upon another person to defend himself or a third person from what he reasonably believes to be the use or <em>imminent </em>use of physical force, and he may use such degree of force which he reasonably believes to be necessary for such purpose; except that deadly physical force may not be used unless the actor reasonably believes that such other person is (1) using or <em>about </em>to use deadly physical force, or (2) inflicting or <em>about </em>to inflict great bodily harm.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">\u201cRead according to its plain language, and as a whole, doubtlessly \u00a7 53a-19 contemplates that a person may respond with physical force to a reasonably perceived <em>threat </em>of physical force without becoming the initial aggressor and forfeiting the defense of self-defense. Otherwise, in order to avoid being labeled the aggressor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>a person would have to stand by meekly and wait until an assailant struck the first blow before responding. If an assailant were intending to employ deadly force or [to] inflict great bodily harm, such an interpretation of the statute would be extremely dangerous to one\u2019s health. Such a bizarre result could not have been intended by the legislature.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">During closing argument, the prosecutor did not argue that the defendant should be considered the initial aggressor on the basis of words alone, as the defendant contends. In discussing whether the defendant was the initial aggressor, the prosecutor referred to a diagram of the defendant\u2019s apartment and reminded the jurors that the defendant had threatened the victim by blocking his egress, by telling him, \u201cI\u2019ll fuck you up,\u201d and by advancing toward him. The prosecutor thus argued that the defendant was the initial aggressor not simply because of what he had said to the victim but also because of his physical conduct. Accordingly, we conclude that, to the extent that the defendant claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury because the court failed to clarify or correct the mistaken impression conveyed by the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument that the defendant was the initial aggressor on the basis of his words alone, his claim must fail because the prosecutor made no such argument, and, accordingly, there was no misunderstanding to correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">We also conclude that the trial court\u2019s instructions that \u201c[t]he initial aggressor is the person who first acts in such a manner that creates a reasonable belief in another person\u2019s mind that physical force is about to be used upon that other person\u201d and that \u201c[t]he first person to use physical force is not necessarily the initial aggressor\u201d were entirely consistent with the law and thus were proper. The instructions did not advise or imply that a person could be considered the initial aggressor on the basis of words alone. In addition, nei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>ther party argued that a person could be considered the initial aggressor on the basis of words alone. As we indicated in the preceding discussion, the prosecutor argued that the defendant was the initial aggressor as a result of the <em>combination </em>of verbal and physical conduct. Similarly, the defense argued that the victim was the initial aggressor because he had used threatening language <em>and </em>brandished a screwdriver. Accordingly, there was no suggestion by the court or by either party that the person who was the initial aggressor had threatened the other person on the basis of words alone. As a result, we conclude that there was no reasonable possibility that the jury was misled or that it rejected the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense on improper grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">The defendant also claims that the trial court\u2019s instructions were improper because they failed to make clear that the initial aggressor using nondeadly force who is met with deadly force by the victim may be justified in using deadly force to repel the victim.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>claims that this principle is recognized at common law, is therefore implicit in this state\u2019s self-defense statute, and, because it is relevant to the facts of the present case, it was reversible error for the trial court to have omitted such an instruction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 (c) provides in relevant part: \u201c[A] person is not justified in using physical force when ... (2) he is the initial aggressor, except that his use of physical force upon another person under such circumstances is justifiable if he withdraws from the encounter and effectively communicates to such other person his intent to do so, but such other person notwithstanding continues or threatens the use of physical force . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">The language of the statute is plain and unambiguous, and provides that the initial aggressor is justified in using physical force <em>only </em>if he withdraws from the encounter and certain other conditions are satisfied. It does not provide, or suggest, that an initial aggressor who uses nondeadly force is justified in using deadly force to repel the victim\u2019s unlawful escalation of force to the deadly level.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">It is well established that \u201cwe cannot accomplish a result that is contrary to the intent of the legislature as expressed in the [statute\u2019s] plain language. ... As we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>recently have reiterated, a court must construe a statute as written. . . . Coruts may not by construction supply omissions ... or add exceptions merely because it appears that good reasons exist for adding them. . . . The intent of the legislature, as this court has repeatedly observed, is to be found not in what the legislature meant to say, but in the meaning of what it did say. ... It is axiomatic that the court itself cannot rewrite a statute to accomplish a particular result. That is a function of the legislature.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Vincent </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>285 Conn. 778, 792, 941 A.2d 932 (2008). It is thus for the legislature, not for this court, to decide whether a second exception should be added to \u00a7 53a-19 (c) that would permit an initial aggressor to use deadly force in the manner indicated by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Examining the trial court\u2019s instructions in light of the statutory language, we conclude that the court followed the law and properly advised the jury on the initial aggressor exception and the circumstances under which an initial aggressor is justified in using physical force against the victim. Accordingly, we reject the defendant\u2019s first alternative ground for affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">The defendant next argues that the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment may be affirmed on the alternative ground that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on manslaughter in the first degree by stating that it could find the defendant not guilty on that charge only if the state had failed to prove \u201ceach\u201d element of the offense rather than \u201cany\u201d element of the offense. The state replies that, although the instruction did not follow the statutory language precisely, the defendant\u2019s claim should be rejected because the instruction as a whole regarding the state\u2019s burden of proof did not mislead the jury. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>Because defense counsel did not object at trial to the instructions that are now challenged on appeal, the defendant seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. We conclude that the claim is reviewable because the record is adequate and the claim of an improper jury instruction is of constitutional magnitude. See part I of this opinion. The defendant cannot prevail, however, because there was no possibility that the jury was misled, and, accordingly, there was no constitutional violation that clearly existed and that clearly deprived him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this claim. The trial court instructed on manslaughter in the first degree as follows: \u201cA person is guilty of intentional manslaughter in the first degree when, with intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes the death of such person.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">\u201cIn order to prove the defendant guilty of intentional manslaughter in the first degree, the state has the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt [that], one, the defendant had the specific intent to cause serious physical injury to a person, and, two, acting with that specific intent, the defendant caused the death of [the victim] by stabbing him with a knife, and, three, the defendant was not justified in using deadly physical force.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">The court then gave specific instructions on the meaning of \u201cintent\u201d and \u201cserious physical injury,\u201d and asked the jury to recall the court\u2019s prior instructions on justification for using deadly physical force. The court then continued: \u201cBearing in mind the instructions [that] I have given you regarding intent, the elements of the crime of intentional manslaughter in the first degree and justification, in order to prove the defendant guilty of the crime of intentional manslaughter in the first degree, the state must prove beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>doubt that, one, the defendant had the specific intent to cause serious physical injury to [the victim], and, two, acting with that intent, the defendant caused the death of [the victim] by stabbing him with a knife, and, three, the defendant was not justified in using deadly physical force.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">\u201cIf you find [that] the state has proven beyond a reasonable doubt <em>each </em>of these three elements of intentional manslaughter in the first degree, you shall find the defendant guilty of intentional manslaughter in the first degree. In that event, you will deliberate no more, and your deliberations are completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\"><em>\u201cIf you find [that] the state has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt each of these three elements of intentional manslaughter in the first degree, you shall find the defendant not guilty of intentional manslaughter in the first degree. </em>In that event, you will deliberate no more, and your deliberations are completed.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">After the court gave its instructions, the prosecutor noted that the court should have referred to \u201cany\u201d element of the offense in the last part of the instruction on finding the defendant not guilty, but the court replied that it believed the instruction was sufficient as given. Defense counsel did not submit a request to charge on manslaughter in the first degree, raised no objection to the instructions that were given, and referred to the instructions as \u201c[s]hort and sweet, just like I like it.\u201d Thereafter, the court reinstructed the jury in the same manner in response to the jury\u2019s request for complete reinstructions, at which time defense counsel again raised no objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">It is well established that a defendant \u201cis entitled to have the jury correctly and adequately instructed on the pertinent principles of substantive law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>States.

Moreover, \u201c[i]f justice is to be done ... it is of paramount importance that the court\u2019s instructions be clear, accurate, complete and comprehensible, particularly with respect to the essential elements of the alleged crime.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>206 Conn. 685, 709, 539 A.2d 561 (1988).

The court first named the three elements that the state was required to prove for the jury to find the defendant guilty in light of his claim of self-defense, namely, intent, causation and the unjustified use of deadly physical force. The court next described each of the elements in detail. It then summarized the three elements and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>reiterated one last time that, if the state proved <em>each </em>of the three elements, the jury shall find the defendant guilty. Thus, in light of the fact that the court referred <em>four times </em>to the fact that the state would have to prove all three elements in order for the jury to find the defendant guilty, there was no possibility that the jury was improperly led to believe that it could find the defendant not guilty only if the state failed to prove every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.

Our statutes define dangerous instrumentality force as physical force that can be reasonably anticipated or expected to cause serious physical injury. Great bodily harm has been defined as physical damage to the body, which is remarkable in magnitude or in degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">\u201cThe degree of force used must be reasonable, but dangerous instrumentality may be used to counter a perceived dangerous instrumentality.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b761-10\"> The trial court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cJustification is the legal term for self-defense.

In claiming that he acted in self-defense, the defendant is claiming that his use of deadly physical force was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-13\">\u201c \u2018Deadly physical force\u2019 means physical force which can be reasonably expected to cause death or serious physical injury. \u2018Physical injury\u2019 means impairment of physical condition or pain. \u2018Serious physical injury\u2019 means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>physical injury which creates a substantial risk of death, or which causes serious disfigurement, serious impairment of health or serious loss or impairment of any bodily organ.</p>\n<p id=\"AH8\">\u201cAlthough the defendant raised the defense of justification, the state has the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not justified in using deadly physical force.</p>\n<p id=\"Auh\">\u201cThere are two circumstances under which a person is not justified in using deadly physical force. If the state proves beyond a reasonable doubt any one of these circumstances, you shall find that the defendant was not justified in using deadly physical force.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">\u201cUnder the first circumstance, a person is not justified in using deadly physical force when, at the time he uses deadly physical force, he does not reasonably believe [that] the other person is about to use deadly physical force against him or about to inflict great bodily harm to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">\u201cIn deciding whether or not the state has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not justified in using deadly physical force, you will first focus on the defendant. You first focus on what he, in fact, believed at the time he used deadly physical force. Then you focus on whether the defendant\u2019s belief was reasonable under all the circumstances that existed when he used deadly physical force.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">\u201cSelf-defense requires the jury to measure the justifiability of the defendant\u2019s actions based on what the defendant reasonably believed under the circumstances presented in this case and on the basis of what the defendant reasonably perceived the circumstances to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-12\">\u201cThe defendant\u2019s belief must have been reasonable and not irrational or unreasonable under the circumstances; that is, would a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s circumstances have reached that belief? It is both a question of what his belief was and whether or not it was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-13\">\u201cThe act of [the victim] leading to the defendant\u2019s use of deadly physical force need not be an actual threat or assault. The test is not what the other person actually intended but whether the other person\u2019s act caused the defendant to reasonably believe was his intention. In other words, the danger need not have been actual or real.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-14\">\u201cIn judging the danger to himself, however, the defendant is not required to act with infallible judgment. Ordinarily, one exercising the right of self-defense is required to act instantly and without time to deliberate and investigate. Under such circumstances, it is often impossible to make an actual threat when none, in fact, existed. However, the defendant\u2019s belief of danger must be reasonable, honest and sincere. Apparent danger with the knowledge that no real danger exists is not an excuse for using any force.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-15\">\u201cIf you find [that] the state has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not, in fact, believe [that the victim] was using or about to use deadly physical force against him or was inflicting or about to inflict grave bodily harm to him, the defendant\u2019s self-defense claim must fail. If, however, you find that the defendant, in fact, believed that [the victim] was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>using or about to use deadly physical force or was inflicting or about to inflict great bodily harm, you must then decide whether that belief held by the defendant <em>was </em>reasonable under the circumstances. That is, would a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s circumstances have reached that belief?</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">\u201cIf you find that the defendant\u2019s belief was reasonable from the perspective of a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s circumstances, you must then decide whether the defendant reasonably believed that deadly physical force as opposed to a lesser degree of force was necessary to repel such attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">\u201cDetermining the defendant\u2019s belief regarding the necessary degree of force requires that you, again, make two determinations. First, you must decide whether, on the basis of all the evidence presented . . . the defendant, in fact, believed that he needed to use deadly physical force as opposed to some lesser degree of force in order to repel the attack. If you decide [that] the defendant did not, in fact, believe [that] he needed to use deadly physical force to repel the attack, your inquiry ends, and the defendant\u2019s self-defense claim must fail. If, however, you find [that] the defendant, in fact, did believe that the use of deadly physical force was necessary, you must then decide whether that belief was reasonable under the circumstances; that is, would a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s circumstances have reached that belief?</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">\u201cUnder the second circumstance, a person is not justified in using deadly physical force if he is the initial aggressor and does not withdraw from the encounter. The initial aggressor is the person who first acts in such a manner that creates a reasonable belief in another person\u2019s mind that physical force is about to be used upon that other person. The first person to use physical force is not necessarily the initial aggressor.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">\u201cBefore an initial aggressor can use any physical force, the initial aggressor must withdraw or abandon the conflict in such a way that the fact of withdrawal is perceived by his opponent so that opponent is aware that there is no longer any danger from the original aggression.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">\u201cIf you find [that] the state has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the initial aggressor and [that] the defendant did not effectively withdraw from the encounter or abandon it in such a way that [the victim] knew he was no longer in any danger from the defendant, you shall then find [that] the defendant was not justified in using deadly physical force.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-12\">\u201cBearing in mind the instructions [that] I have given you regarding justification, the state has the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt under the first circumstance [that], one, the defendant did not, in fact, believe that he was in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm; or, two, the defendant did not have a reasonable basis for his belief; or, three, the defendant did not, in fact, believe he needed to use deadly physical force to repel the attack; or, four, the defendant did not have a reasonable basis for his belief that he needed to use deadly physical force to repel the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"A9-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>\u201cOr under the second circumstance . . .

The dissent, however, misses the crucial point that the term \u201ccriminal conduct\u201d in the phrase \u201cjustification for otherwise criminal conduct\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 752; means charged conduct. Neither assault nor reckless manslaughter was charged in this case. Accordingly, a jury instruction that the defendant was justified in using nondeadly force against the victim based on such a theory would have been improper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b771-7\"> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>103 Conn. App. 530, 535 n.1, 930 A.2d 716 (2007), the Appellate Court made a similar observation with respect to a claim of sell-defense by the defendant in that case: \u201cContrary to the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>claim on appeal, he did not claim self-defense ... at trial. Rather, he specifically testified, in relation to the complainant: \u2018Never did I strike her. Never did I slap her, never did I push her, nothing of the sort.\u2019 He did testify, however, that he \u2018may have\u2019 grabbed the complainant around the neck when she attacked him, but that [he] never injured her. It appears, therefore, that the theory of defense at trial was more closely related to accident or unintended consequences rather than self-defense. . . . See <em>State </em>v. <em>Schultz, </em>100 Conn. App. 709, 717, 921 A.2d 595, cert. denied, 282 Conn. 926, 926 A.2d 668 (2007). [A claim] of accident is unlike [a claim of] self-defense because . . . self-defense presumes an intentional but justified act, [whereas] accident presumes that any injury was unintended. Id.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b773-7\"> The state correctly notes that Connecticut considers accident and self-defense separate and inherently inconsistent claims, although a defendant may raise them as alternative theories. <em>Shabazz </em>v. <em>State, </em>259 Conn. 811, 816, 792 A.2d 797 (2002) (defendant raised separate theories of self-defense and accident when he testified that he stabbed victim in sell-defense and that he stabbed victim accidentally as they tussled on ground); <em>State </em>v. <em>Shabazz, </em>246 Conn. 746, 763, 719 A.2d 440 (1998) (same), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1179, 119 S. Ct. 1116, 143 L. Ed. 2d 111 (1999); <em>State </em>v. <em>Schultz, </em>supra, 100 Conn. App. 717 (defendant raised separate claims of self-defense and accident); <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 55 Conn. App. 301 (defendant allowed to raise \u201cinconsistent\u201d claims of \u201csell-defense\u201d and \u201cunintentional or accidental shooting\u201d when he and victim allegedly struggled over gun pulled out by victim); see also <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>United States, </em>485 U.S. 58, 64, 108 S. Ct. 883, 99 L. Ed. 2d 54 (1988) (\u201cstate cases support the proposition that a homicide defendant may be entitled to an instruction on . . . [inconsistent claims of] accident and self-defense\u201d). The defendant, however, disregards both legal concepts. On the one hand, he refers to his claim as one of self-defense but disavows the element of intent normally associated with a justification defense. On the other hand, he argues that the victim\u2019s death was an accident, or an unintended consequence of their struggle, but asks the jury to consider the degree of force that he used in the struggle instead of focusing squarely on the issue of intent. As we indicated in our discussion in part I of this opinion, we reject both approaches because neither is legally correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">For similar reasons, the dissent\u2019s assertion that the trial court should have instructed the jury that it could consider whether the stabbing was accidental under a theory of self-defense reflects a misunderstanding of the theory of self-defense, the charges against the defendant and the defendant\u2019s requested jury instructions. Because a theory of accident implicates the element of intent, it needs no special instruction in addition to one on the concept of intent. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Schultz, </em>supra, 100 Conn. App. 716. Moreover, the defendant characterized his requested instruction on self-defense as a justification instruction, which, unlike an instruction on intent, permits the jury to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>sider the degree of force used in the commission of the crime. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 (a). Finally, insofar as the dissent suggests that the jury was not afforded an opportunity to consider whether the stabbing was accidental, we disagree. The jury heard detailed and consistent testimony from the defendant at trial that the victim had been the attacker and that the defendant did not know exactly how or when the fatal wound was inflicted dining the struggle. In addition, the trial court provided the jury with a context in which to evaluate this testimony in its general instructions on intent: \u201cUnder our law, a person acts intentionally with respect to a result when his conscious objective is to cause such result. It is not necessary for the state to prove that the defendant had the requisite intent for any particular period of time before acting on it. The state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had the requisite intent at the time he commits the criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">\u201cWhat a man\u2019s intention has been is, very largely, a matter of inference. No witness can be expected to come here and testify that he looked into another person\u2019s mind and saw therein contained a certain intention. <em>A jury can determine what a person\u2019s intention was at any given time by determining what that person\u2019s conduct was, what the circumstances were surrounding that conduct, and any statements made by that person and, from those, infer what his intention was.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">\u201cAn intent may be inferred from circumstantial evidence provided such inference is reasonable and is warranted from the facts you find proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">\u201cMotive is not an element of the crime charged. The state is not required to prove what motive, if any, was behind the commission of a crime. Even if motive is shown, the state must still prove beyond a reasonable doubt each of the elements of a crime charged. Proof of motive or lack of proof of motive may be relevant if you find it to be so through your determination of whether the state has proven the guilt of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">\u201cYou may consider the presence or absence of motive together with all the other evidence in reaching your verdict and give it such weight which you decide is reasonable.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">In advising the jury to consider the defendant\u2019s conduct, the circumstances surrounding his conduct, any statements that he may have made concerning the incident and his possible motive, or lack thereof, for stabbing the victim, the trial court was, in effect, directing the jury to weigh the defendant\u2019s testimony that the stabbing was the unintended consequence of his struggle with the victim, which did not require consideration of whether the defendant had used deadly or nondeadly force.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b775-7\"> The instructions on the elements of causation and self-defense were identical for both murder and manslaughter in the first degree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b775-8\"> For this reason, we also find inapposite the cases that the Appellate Court cited; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Singleton, </em>supra, 97 Conn. App. 692-95; in concluding that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the use of deadly physical force during the struggle. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Whitford, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 631-34; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wayne, </em>60 Conn. App. 761, 764-66, 760 A.2d 1265 (2000); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>49 Conn. App. 738, 747-50, 718 A.2d 22, cert. denied, 247 Conn. 934, 719 A.2d 1175 (1998); <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>16 Conn. App. 346, 354-56, 547 A.2d 1368, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 828, 552 A.2d 433 (1988). In each of these cases, the jury was instructed to consider the issue of deadly physical force in the context of the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense. The defendant in the present case, however, contends that the jury should have been instructed to consider the issue of deadly physical force in the context of the nonfatal struggle that preceded the stabbing, which was irrelevant to his claim of self-defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b778-6\"> The defendant argues, and the dissent agrees, that \u201cthe [trial] court flatly told the jurors that the defendant had used deadly physical force . . . even before telling them that they had to decide something about the defendant\u2019s intention when he used such deadly force. By so doing, the trial court not only improperly took from the jurors the disputed factual issue of whether the defendant used nondeadly or deadly force, but also improperly influenced the jurors\u2019 consideration of the defendant\u2019s intention by telling them as a matter of law that the defendant had used deadly force and then [by] improperly allowing them to infer [that] he intended to use that degree of force . . . .\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">As we previously explained, the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on nondeadly force was not improper. With respect to the instructions on justification and intent, we note that, before the court instructed the jury on justification, it referred to the elements of the crimes charged, stating as follows: \u201cAlmost every crime is made up of several essential elements. What the essential elements of the crimes here are, I\u2019ll explain to you in a moment. For the present, it is enough for me to say that, before a jury can return a verdict of guilty of a crime, the state must have proved every essential element of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The court then proceeded to give lengthy instructions on the credibility of witnesses, consciousness of guilt, and justification. Thereafter, in instructing on the elements of the relevant crimes, the court stated several times that the jury must decide, with respect to the charge of murder and the lesser offense of manslaughter in the first <em>degree, first, </em>that the defendant had the requisite intent, <em>second, </em>that, acting with the requisite intent, he caused the victim\u2019s death, and, <em>third, </em>that he was not justified in acting as he did. See part HI of this opinion. Accordingly, there is no merit to the claim that the court\u2019s instructions on justification improperly influenced the jury\u2019s consideration of intent because the trial court\u2019s repeated instructions regarding the order in which the jury was to decide the elements of the crimes ensured that it would not consider justification prior to considering the elements of intent and causation. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>290 Conn. 261, 276, 962 A.2d 781 (2009) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>(\u201c[t]he jury is presumed, in the absence of a lair indication to the contrary, to have followed the court\u2019s instructions\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b784-8\"> Defense counsel asked the court to give the following instruction on the use of force by the initial aggressor, which omitted the language that the defendant now requests: \u201cA person is not justified in using physical force when, with the intent to cause physical injury to another person, he provokes the use of physical force by that person. However, if the [defendant was the initial aggressor, his use of physical force upon another is justifiable under such circumstances, if he withdraws from the encounter and effectively communicates to the other person his intent to withdraw, but the other person, notwithstanding, continues the struggle, or threatens the use of physical force. The degree of force used must be reasonable, but [a] dangerous instrumentality may be used to counter a perceived dangerous instrumentality. And when actual or apparent . . . danger from harm has ended, then the right to use that force also ends.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">The trial court gave a similar instruction: \u201c[A] person is not justified in using deadly physical force if he is the initial aggressor and does not withdraw from the encounter. The initial aggressor is the person who first acts in such a manner that creates a reasonable belief in another person\u2019s mind that physical force is about to be used upon that other person.

See <em>State </em>v. <em>Singleton, </em>97 Conn. App. 679, 680, 696-97, 905 A.2d 725 (2006).

Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>The majority opinion sets forth the facts that the jury reasonably could have found. The following additional facts and procedural history, however, also are relevant to the issue on appeal. At trial, the defendant testified that the victim came to his apartment to pay him for a quantity of drugs that the defendant had provided to the victim. After the two men spoke for a few minutes, and without mentioning his drug debt, the victim indicated that he was leaving. The defendant told the victim that he wanted to be paid for the drugs. The victim began \u201cbabbling,\u201d and the defendant moved toward the victim, stating that he was \u201cgoing to fuck [him] up.\u201d The victim then removed a screwdriver from his pocket, prompting the defendant to back away. The victim continued toward the defendant and stabbed him in the chest with the screwdriver. The defendant then grabbed the victim, causing him to drop the screwdriver. The physical altercation between the defendant and the victim continued, but, eventually, they separated. At that time, the victim grabbed a knife from the defendant\u2019s kitchen counter. The defendant then told the victim that he was \u201cgoing to jail,\u201d at which point the victim came at the defendant with the knife. According to the defendant, he \u201cgrabbed\u201d and \u201cbent\u201d the victim\u2019s wrist in an effort to take the knife away from him. The defendant further testified that the two men struggled over the knife, but that, at some point, the victim stopped resisting. The victim staggered, sat down on the defendant\u2019s bed and then rolled onto the floor. When the victim did not move, the defendant approached him and observed that the knife had entered his body. The defendant insisted that he had intended only to disarm the victim and that he otherwise had not intended to cause him any harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">The defendant raised a claim of self-defense predicated on his version of how the victim was killed. In particular, the defendant sought an instruction on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>use of nondeadly physical force against the victim based on his claim that he was justified in using the degree of force necessary to disarm the victim. The defendant also sought an instruction on the use of deadly physical force in self-defense, presumably to account for the possibility of a jury finding that, contrary to the testimony of the defendant, he had stabbed the victim with the intent to do so. In light of the defendant\u2019s trial testimony, however, it is apparent that the defendant\u2019s principal claim involved his use of <em>nondeadly </em>force against the victim, which, according to the defendant, resulted in his altercation with the victim that led to the victim\u2019s accidental stabbing death.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court, however, did not instruct the jury on the defendant\u2019s claim that he had used, and was justified in using, non-deadly force against the victim; the court instructed the jury only on the use of deadly force in self-defense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury found the defendant not guilty of murder but found him guilty of the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (l).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>On appeal to the Appellate Court, the defendant maintained, inter alia, that the trial court improperly had failed to instruct the jury on his claim of the justified use of nondeadly force against the victim. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Singleton, </em>supra, 97 Conn. App. 687. The Appellate Court agreed with the defendant that, because he had requested such a charge, and because the evidence supported the instruction, he was entitled to it. See id., 692, 696-97. The Appellate Court also determined that the trial court\u2019s instructions on self-defense were constitutionally deficient and, further, that the state could not establish that the instructions were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Id., 697-98. Accordingly, the Appellate Court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case for a new trial. Id., 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Upon the granting of certification to appeal, the state contends that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the trial court was required to instruct the jury, in accordance with the defendant\u2019s request, on his claimed use of nondeadly force in self-defense. The majority agrees with the state, concluding that \u201cthe trial court correctly instructed that the defendant had used deadly physical force in defending himself against the victim because his claim of self-defense required a jury determination as to whether he was justified in killing the victim with a knife, thus making his theoretical use of nondeadly force during the preceding struggle irrelevant.\u201d I disagree with the conclusion of the majority, including its characterization of the defendant\u2019s claimed use of nondeadly force as \u201ctheoretical . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">Before explaining my disagreement with the majority, I note that certain well established principles govern this court\u2019s analysis of the issue presented by this appeal. \u201cA fundamental element of due process is the right of a defendant charged with a crime to establish a defense.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>261 Conn. 553, 573, 804 A.2d 781 (2002); see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>also <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>273 Conn. 418, 424, 870 A.2d 1039 (2005) (\u201c[t]he sixth amendment to the United States constitution require [s] that criminal defendants be afforded a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Thus, \u201c[i]f [a] defendant asserts a recognized legal defense and the evidence indicates the availability of that defense . . . the defendant is entitled, as a matter of law, to a theory of defense instruction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>287 Conn. 464, 470, 948 A.2d 1026 (2008). Moreover, \u201c[a] defendant is entitled to have instructions presented relating to any theory of defense for which there is any foundation in the evidence, no matter how weak or incredible . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 573.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">With respect to the adequacy of the instructions, \u201c[t]he test of a court\u2019s charge is not whether it is as accurate upon legal principles as the opinions of a court of last resort but whether it fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law. . . . Thus, we must determine whether the charge as a whole presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will be done. . . . [The] [j]ury instructions need not be exhaustive, perfect, or technically accurate. . . . Nevertheless, the trial court must correctly adapt the law to the case in question and must provide the jury with sufficient guidance in reaching a correct verdict. ... In determining whether the trial court\u2019s instructions meet this standard, we review the jury charge in the context of the factual issues raised [in each case].\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Daley </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>249 Conn. 766, 786, 734 A.2d 112 (1999). It therefore has been stated that, \u201c[t]o pass constitutional muster, jury instructions must be correct in law, adapted to the issues in the case and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>sufficient to guide the jury in arriving at a verdict.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>82 Conn. App. 1, 8, 842 A.2d 590, cert. denied, 269 Conn. 913, 852 A.2d 744 (2004). Finally, when, as in the present case, the instruction implicates an issue of constitutional magnitude, the question to be resolved on appeal is whether it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the court\u2019s instructions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 261 Conn. 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">I now turn to the reason for my disagreement with the majority, which stems primarily from the fact that the trial court, in instructing the jury, repeatedly explained, in clear and unequivocal language, that the defendant\u2019s <em>sole </em>claim was that <em>he had, in fact, used deadly physical force </em>against the victim, that is, he had intentionally stabbed the victim, but that he was justified in doing so. As I have indicated, however, that was <em>not </em>the defendant\u2019s primary claim. Indeed, it was not the claim that the defendant raised in his trial testimony. At trial, the defendant steadfastly maintained that he had used nondeadly force in attempting to wrest the knife away from the victim, that he was justified in using such force, and that the victim accidentally was stabbed to death during the ensuing altercation. The trial court, however, <em>never instructed the jury on this primary theory of defense, </em>that is, that the victim was killed accidentally when the defendant justifiably used nondeadly force in defending himself against what he reasonably believed was the victim\u2019s imminent knife attack against him. Instead, the trial court repeatedly asserted in its jury instructions that the defendant\u2019s claim was predicated on his contention that his use of <em>deadly </em>force was justified. By instructing the jury in this maimer, the trial court effectively removed the defendant\u2019s principal defense from the jury\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>The contrary conclusion of the majority is flawed because that conclusion is founded on the state\u2019s argument that, \u201conce the jury found that the defendant had the requisite intent to commit the charged offense, it necessarily would have rejected his claim of accident, or unintended consequences, thus, completely removing from the jury\u2019s consideration the issue of whether the defendant used deadly or nondeadly force during the preceding struggle.\u201d This contention ignores the import of the trial court\u2019s instructions on the defendant\u2019s claimed use of deadly force in self-defense. The court <em>repeatedly </em>instructed the jury that the defendant was claiming to have used deadly force in self-defense, and the court did so <em>before </em>instructing the jury on the elements of homicide. In other words, the court first explained to the jury that \u201c[t]he defendant claims [that] he acted in self-defense. <em>In claiming that he acted in self-defense, the defendant is claiming that his use of deadly physical force was justified.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">\u201c \u2018Deadly physical force\u2019 means physical force which can be reasonably expected to cause death or serious physical injury. . . . \u2018Serious physical injury\u2019 means physical injury which creates a substantial risk of death, or which causes serious disfigurement, serious impairment of health or serious loss or impairment of any bodily organ.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court further explained that, \u201c[although the defendant raised the defense of justification, the state has the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that <em>the defendant was not justified in using deadly physical force.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">Thereafter, and before instructing the jury on what the state was required to prove to establish the elements of the crime of intentional first degree manslaughter, the trial court repeatedly underscored for the jury that the defendant affirmatively was asserting that he had used deadly physical force against the victim in self-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>defense. In light of these instructions, the jury necessarily was led to believe that the defendant\u2019s <em>sole </em>claim was predicated on his acknowledgement that he had, in fact, used deadly force against the victim, that is, he intentionally had stabbed the victim, but was justified in doing so. For example, the court explained: (1) \u201ca person is not justified in using deadly physical force when, <em>at the time he uses deadly physical force, </em>he does not reasonably believe [that] the other person is about to use deadly physical force against him or about to inflict, great bodily harm to him\u201d; (emphasis added); (2) \u201c[i]n deciding whether or not the state has proved beyond a reasonable doubt <em>that the defendant was not justified in using deadly physical force, </em>you will first focus on the defendant\u201d; (emphasis added); (3) \u201c[y]ou first focus on what he, in fact, believed <em>at the time he used deadly physical force </em>. . . [and] then . . . focus on whether the defendant\u2019s belief was reasonable under all the circumstances that existed <em>when he used deadly physical force\") </em>(emphasis added); (4) \u201c[t]he act of [the victim] <em>leading to the defendant\u2019s use of deadly physical force </em>need not be an actual threat or assault\u201d; (emphasis added); (5) \u201cyou must . . . decide whether the <em>defendant reasonably believed that deadly physical force as opposed to a lesser degree of force was necessary </em>to repel [the victim\u2019s] attack\u201d; (emphasis added); (6) \u201cyou must decide whether, on the basis of all the evidence presented . . . <em>the defendant, in fact, believed that he needed to use deadly physical force as opposed to some lesser degree of force </em>in order to repel the [victim\u2019s] attack\u201d; (emphasis added); (7) \u201c[i]f you decide [that] the <em>defendant did not . . . believe [that] he needed to use deadly physical force to repel the [victim\u2019s] attack, </em>your inquiry ends, and the defendant\u2019s self-defense claim must fail\u201d; (emphasis added); (8) \u201c[i]f . . . you find [that] <em>the defendant . . . did believe that the use of deadly physical force was necessary, </em>you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>must then decide whether that belief was reasonable under the circumstances\u201d; (emphasis added); (9) \u201c[i]f you find [that] the state has proved . . . that the defendant was the initial aggressor and [that] the defendant did not effectively withdraw from the encounter or abandon it in such a way that [the victim] knew he was no longer in any danger from the defendant, you shall then find [that] <em>the defendant was notjustified in using deadly physical force\u201d-, </em>(emphasis added); and (10) \u201cthe state has the burden to prove . . . [that] . . . <em>the defendant did not </em>. . . <em>believe he needed to use deadly physical force to repel the </em>[victim\u2019s] <em>attack </em>... or . . . [that] <em>the defendant did not have a reasonable basis for his belief that he needed to use deadly physical force to repel the </em>[victim\u2019s] <em>attack.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Following these instructions on the defendant\u2019s use of deadly physical force in self-defense \u2014 instructions that comprised six full pages of transcript \u2014 the trial court finally explained the elements of the crime of intentional manslaughter. In doing so, however, the court again expressly repeated the state\u2019s burden of disproving the defendant\u2019s claim that he justifiably had used deadly force against the victim. Thus, the court instructed the jury that, \u201c[i]n order to prove the defendant guilty of intentional manslaughter in the first degree, the state has the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt [that], one, the defendant had the specific intent to cause serious physical injury to a person, and, two, acting with that specific intent, the defendant caused the death of [the victim] by stabbing him with a knife, and, three, the defendant was not justified in using deadly physical force.\u201d By this point in the instructions, the jury already had been instructed repeatedly that the defendant himself was claiming that he had used deadly force against the victim by stabbing him with the knife, but that his use of such force was justified. In other words, the court effectively had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>instructed the jury that the defendant had <em>conceded </em>the elements of the crime of intentional manslaughter\u2014 that is, he had stabbed the victim, thereby causing his death, with the specific intent to cause serious physical injury to the victim \u2014 and that his sole claim was that he was justified in doing so because he reasonably believed that the victim intended to kill him with the knife or to cause him serious bodily injury with it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">The majority contends that the defendant\u2019s real claim is one of accident, and that such a claim does not warrant a special instruction. According to the majority, a defense theory of accident is adequately covered by the court\u2019s instructions on intent. It may be true that it is not always necessary for a court to instruct the jury expressly on a defendant\u2019s claim of accident because such a theory generally will be explained adequately by the court\u2019s instructions on intent. That certainly is not the case here, however, because, as I previously explained in detail, by the time the trial court instructed the jury on the element of intent, the jury already had been apprised, on numerous occasions, of the defendant\u2019s own contention that he did indeed engage in conduct <em>intended to cause the defendant to suffer serious physical injury, </em>but that he was justified in doing so. Consequently, for purposes of the present case, it is manifestly unreasonable to presume that the trial court\u2019s instructions on intent were sufficient to provide the jury with a fair and understandable explanation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>the defendant\u2019s principal theory of defense, that is, that the victim was stabbed accidentally in the altercation arising out of the defendant\u2019s justified use of nondeadly force against the victim. In other words, the majority is misguided in concluding that the court\u2019s instructions on intent were sufficient to inform the jury of the defendant\u2019s primary theory of defense because those instructions unambiguously informed the jury that the defendant <em>was not contesting the element of intent </em>in light of his claim that he intentionally had used deadly physical force against the victim in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">It therefore is unfair for the majority to assert that the defendant\u2019s primary theory of defense was adequately addressed by the trial court\u2019s instructions on the element of intent. Without question, the trial court\u2019s repeated instructions concerning the defendant\u2019s claim that he intentionally had used deadly physical force against the victim made it clear to the jury that the defendant was conceding the elements of intentional manslaughter, but that his use of deadly force was justified. In light of these instructions \u2014 and in light of the court\u2019s complete failure to instruct the jury on the theory of defense raised by the defendant\u2019s testimony at trial \u2014 it cannot reasonably be maintained that the court\u2019s charge on intent was sufficient to guide the jury as to the defendant\u2019s claim concerning the manner in which the victim had been killed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>It is true, of course, that the defendant\u2019s claimed use of nondeadly force in self-defense is not a <em>complete </em>defense to the crime of intentional manslaughter under \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (1). This is so because an element of that offense is the intentional infliction of \u201cserious physical injury,\u201d a term that is defined as \u201cphysical injury which creates a substantial risk of death, or which causes serious disfigurement, serious impairment of health or serious loss or impairment of the function of a bodily organ . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (4). There can be no doubt that the defendant\u2019s claimed attempt to disarm the victim by grabbing the victim\u2019s wrist did not constitute conduct intended to cause \u201cserious physical injury.\u201d In contrast, \u201cdeadly physical force\u201d is defined as \u201cphysical force which can be reasonably expected to cause death <em>or serious physical injury </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (5). Thus, it is the justified use of <em>deadly force, </em>rather than the use of nondeadly force, that serves as a defense to the crime of intentional manslaughter. Consequently, when the state alleges that a defendant has committed intentional manslaughter, a claim by that defendant that he used only nondeadly physical force in self-defense cannot <em>alone </em>serve to relieve him of responsibility for that crime. In the present case, the defendant raised a justification defense \u2014 that is, he claimed that he was justified in forcibly attempting to take the knife away from the advancing <em>victim </em>\u2014 along <em>with </em>the claim that the victim was killed when, wholly by accident, the knife entered the victim\u2019s body during the altercation between the victim and the defendant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>This claim represented the defendant\u2019s theory of defense, and there was ample evidence to support it, namely, the defendant\u2019s own testimony. The trial court therefore was obligated to instruct the jury on that defense theory. In failing to do so, the court effectively removed that defense from the jury\u2019s consideration. Instead, the court instructed the jury only on the defendant\u2019s use of deadly physical force. Because the defendant expressly testified that he had used nondeadly force and <em>not </em>deadly force, the court\u2019s failure to explain to the jury the significance of the defendant\u2019s claim that he justifiably had used nondeadly force, coupled with the court\u2019s initial instructions, in which it repeatedly characterized the defendant as acknowledging his use of deadly force, necessarily was prejudicial. In fact, the court provided the jury with no guidance for evaluating the version of the facts set forth by the defendant in his testimony.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>Thus, contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, the defendant\u2019s claimed use of nondeadly force was not \u201ctheoretical\u201d at all because the defendant expressly testified to the use of nondeadly force. Moreover, the defendant had a constitutionally protected right to have a properly instructed jury consider his claim that he had used nondeadly force in attempting to disarm the victim inasmuch as his alleged use of such force was essential to his theory of defense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because the jury was not so instructed, the Appellate Court was correct in concluding that the defendant is entitled to a new trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>1 therefore dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b792-6\"> Although the defendant\u2019s request to charge contained a proposed instruction on the use of deadly physical force, it is not clear why the defendant sought such a charge in light of his testimony explaining that he had used only nondeadly force in attempting to disarm the victim. In any event, because the defendant sought such an instruction, and defense counsel did not object to the instruction when given, the trial court cannot be faulted for charging the jury on the use of deadly force. As I explain more fully hereinafter, the issue presented by this case is not whether the trial court improperly instructed the jury on deadly force but, rather, whether the court improperly failed to instruct the jury on the use of nondeadly force and, if so, whether the court\u2019s instructions on the defendant\u2019s claimed use of deadly force compounded the harm resulting from that impropriety.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b792-7\"> The trial court\u2019s charge on self-defense, in which the court explains when the use of deadly force may be justified but does not explain the use of nondeadly force, is set forth at footnote 10 of the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b792-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of manslaughter in the first degree when: (1) With intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes the death of such person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b799-7\"> To reiterate, that was <em>not </em>the defendant\u2019s sole claim, or even his principal claim. Most importantly, it was not the claim that the defendant raised on the basis of his own trial testimony. As I previously discussed, the defendant testified that he was justified in engaging the victim physically \u2014 that is, he was justified in using <em>nondeadly </em>force against the victim \u2014 in an effort to take the knife away from the victim as the victim approached him. The court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on the defendant\u2019s primary theory of defense, as the defendant had requested, was improper, and undoubtedly was confusing to the jury in light of the defendant\u2019s testimony that his use of force was limited to <em>nondeadly </em>force.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b800-7\"> The majority asserts that there is no merit to the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court\u2019s instructions on the justified use of deadly force, without more, \u201cimproperly influenced the jury\u2019s consideration of intent because the trial court\u2019s repeated instructions regarding the order in which the jury was to decide the elements of the crimes ensured that it would not consider justification prior to considering the elements of intent and causation.\u201d Footnote 17 of the majority opinion. I disagree that the court\u2019s enumeration of the three elements that the state was required to prove, namely, intent, causation and lack of justification, was sufficient to inform the jury that it could not predicate a finding of intent on the defendant\u2019s own acknowledgement that he had used deadly physical force against the victim. In the absence of such an instruction, the jury was free to conclude that the defendant had formed the intent necessary to commit the crime of intentional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>manslaughter merely on the basis of the defendant\u2019s claim that he did, in fact, intend to use deadly force on the victim. Thus, the mere enumeration of the elements of the offense of intentional manslaughter was not a substitute for an instruction on the defendant\u2019s primary theory of defense \u2014 a theory predicated on the defendant\u2019s claim that he did <em>not </em>use deadly force\u2014 because of the court\u2019s repeated instructions concerning the defendant\u2019s own assertion that he had used such force.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b801-7\"> The majority asserts that the defendant\u2019s contention that he was justified in using nondeadly force is not a legitimate claim of self-defense because, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>\u201c[i]n Connecticut, self-defense is a justification for engaging in <em>otherwise criminal conduct'-, </em>(emphasis in original); and, according to the majority, the defendant is claiming that the victim was killed accidentally and not as a result of the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct. Thus, the majority asserts that, \u201c[ajlthough the defendant cloaks his claim in the language of self-defense, he does not seek justification for engaging in <em>otherwise criminal conduct </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) The majority misses the point. The defendant\u2019s theory of defense is predicated, in part, on the claim that he did, in fact, engage in conduct that otherwise would have been criminal, namely, grabbing the victim\u2019s wrist in an effort to take the knife away from him. In other words, the defendant\u2019s conduct in seizing the victim\u2019s wrist would have constituted a criminal assault against the victim if the defendant had not reasonably believed that it was necessary to engage in that conduct to defend himself against the victim\u2019s attack. It therefore is clear that the defendant\u2019s conduct toward the victim would be criminal if it were not found to be justified, and that that conduct constituted an integral component of the defendant\u2019s theory of defense. Consequently, the defendant was entitled to an instruction on his claim that he was justified in using nondeadly force against the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b802-7\"> I note that the majority views claims of justification and accident as inconsistent. As the Appellate Court correctly observed; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Singleton, </em>supra, 97 Conn. App. 697 n.17; those claims are not necessarily inconsistent, and they do not conflict in the present case. On the contrary, they are fully compatible with one another. Under the defendant\u2019s theory, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>justifiably used nondeadly physical force against the victim in an effort to take the knife away from him, and, while doing so, the victim accidentally was stabbed and killed. There is nothing inconsistent about the defendant\u2019s version of how the victim died. Indeed, even if the defendant had raised inconsistent defenses, he still would have been entitled to an instruction on them. See <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>United States, </em>485 U.S. 58, 64, 108 S. Ct. 883, 99 L. Ed. 2d 54 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b803-13\"> In addition to asserting that the trial court\u2019s instructions on intent were adequate to inform the jury of the defendant\u2019s principal theory of defense, the majority contends that the defendant\u2019s testimony provided a satisfactory basis on which the jury could find that the victim was killed accidentally after the defendant had used nondeadly force in attempting to disarm the victim. I disagree with the majority that the defendant\u2019s testimony excuses the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on the defendant\u2019s theory of accident because a defendant is constitutionally entitled both to <em>present </em>his or her defense <em>and </em>to have the court <em>instruct the jury </em>as to the legal basis on which that defense is founded. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>supra, 287 Conn. 470 (defendant is constitutionally entitled to \u201ca theory of defense instruction\u201d). As I have explained, in the present case, the court failed to provide the jury with such an instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b803-14\"> Because I would uphold the Appellate Court\u2019s reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction, I need not address the defendant\u2019s alternative grounds for affirming the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment. See, e.g., <em>Sterns &amp; Wheeler, LLC </em>v. <em>Kowalsky Bros., Inc., </em>289 Conn. 1, 7 n.9, 955 A.2d 538 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
