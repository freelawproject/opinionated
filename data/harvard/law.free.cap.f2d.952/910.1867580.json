GRADY JOLLY, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1005-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">Thompson Olu Adebisi admits that he entered this country illegally. He seeks, alternatively, asylum or withholding of deportation. He appeals an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals which denied both and further ordered deportation. For the reasons set out below, we affirm the order of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">Adebisi is a native of the town of Arigidi, Nigeria, and is a Nigerian citizen. He is a member of the Yoruba tribe and is the hereditary chief of the Esubete, a \u201csocial group\u201d (or sub-tribe) comprising all males 25 years of age or older in Arigidi. He indicates that membership in the Esubete is voluntary, yet says that all the Arigidi males belong. Both his father and a brother have been murdered by a faction of the Esubete that was opposed to his grandfather, who ruled the Esubete in a dictatorial fashion. Following his father\u2019s death, Ade-bisi refused to be inaugurated as chief of the Esubete because he was afraid this same faction would ultimately kill him. Although his story is unclear on this point, it seems that he cannot simply decline the position, but must submit to some ritual involving the elders of the Esubete (a ritual that he also called a \u201ctrial,\u201d or \u201csacrifice\u201d). He contends that if he submits to this ritual, the elders will have power over him and can kill him by voodoo.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Adebisi seems to expect this curse as retaliation for his refusal of the hereditary chieftainship. He also seems to say that the elders have harassed him by means of voodoo. He states that if he should show up for the ritual, he will be exposed to violence from the faction that has already killed his father and brother. Finally, he contends that the government of Nigeria will not become involved in this matter because it is a tribal matter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He admits that he has never sought police or other governmental help, but says that he cannot do so because of \u201cthe implication of reporting my threats to the government. ... I know what it means when it comes to \u2018voodoo,\u2019 it has invisible power.\u201d He says one of the elders \u201chas threatened me that if I do it [report the matter to the police] ... I know how powerful this charm is. If the curse is put on you and you do anything ... something you should not do ... (indiscernible) will surely come to pass.\u201d Adebisi\u2019s testimony is that the Esubete elders have threatened him with a curse or death if he goes to the police and he is afraid to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">Adebisi testified that after his father\u2019s death, in an effort to avoid the elders, he returned to his job in Lagos. After being found and harassed there, he left his wife and children and fled to the north of Nigeria in an effort to hide from the elders. He was not successful, and when found there, he decided to flee the country. He obtained a visa and flew to Mexico in July 1990. From Mexico, he entered the United States on August 6, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-12\">Adebisi was apprehended after entering this country from Mexico without inspection in violation of Section 241(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the I &amp; N Act), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(2). Adebisi admits that he entered the United States without inspection and is subject to deportation under section 241(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(2). He applied for asylum and for withholding of deportation under sections 208(a) and 243(h) of the Act, 8' U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(a), 1253(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-13\">A hearing was held before an immigration judge on November 26, 1990. The judge found that Adebisi was a credible witness; that Adebisi\u2019s fear of being put to death by the elders of the Esubete if he returned to Nigeria was \u201creal\u201d; and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>he was threatened because of his membership in a social group, i.e., the royal family of the Esubete. The immigration judge held, however, that Adebisi was not eligible for asylum because he did not establish that the Esubete were a group that the government of Nigeria was unable or unwilling to control. The judge found that Adebisi had \u201ca personal problem, even though ... it is not personal within your immediate family.\u201d In her oral opinion, she stated, \u201c[i]t is required that you demonstrate that the persecution against you is aimed against you either by your government or by an organization that the government is unwilling or unable to control. ... I simply find that you are not eligible for asylum because your fear that [sic] your own tribe, in which you joined and participated voluntarily, is simply not enough to qualify you for asylum, because this is truly a personal and private dispute.\u201d The immigration judge denied asylum, denied withholding of deportation and ordered Adebisi deported to Nigeria.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">Adebisi appealed the immigration judge\u2019s order. On March 27, 1991, the Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed the order, in the following language pertinent to this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-5\">[W]e concur with the judge, <em>for the reasons set forth in her decision, </em>that [Ade-bisi] has failed to establish a well-founded fear or clear probability of persecution in Nigeria on account of his membership in a particular social group, [citations omitted]. Rather, the persecution the respondent fears is on account of a personal dispute, namely intra-tribal discord over the respondent\u2019s unwillingness to succeed his father as chief. ... The respondent has made no showing that the government of Nigeria is unable or unwilling to protect him from ... the factions in his tribe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\"><em>In re Adebisi, </em>slip op. at 2 (Board of Immigration Appeals, March 27,1991) (emphasis ours). In appealing the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals, Adebisi contends that he was prejudiced by lack of counsel, lack of communication and by a \u201cbiased judge.\u201d He further argues that the Board erred in failing to grant asylum, in failing to withhold deportation, and in denying voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">This court is authorized to review only the order of the Board. <em>Castillo-Rodriguez v. I.N.S., </em>929 F.2d 181, 183 (5th Cir.1991). Consequently, the errors or other failings of the immigration judge are considered only if they have some effect on the Board\u2019s order. Moreover, \u201c[w]e review the BIA\u2019s factual conclusion that an alien is not eligible for withholding of deportation only to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Zamora-Morel v. I.N.S., </em>905 F.2d 833, 838 (5th Cir.1990) (citing <em>Young v. I.N.S., </em>759 F.2d 450, 455-56 n. 6 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 996, 106 S.Ct. 412, 88 L.Ed.2d 362 (1985)). The same substantial evidence standard governs our review of the BIA\u2019s factual conclusion that an alien is not eligible for consideration for asylum. <em>See Campos-Guardado v. I.N.S., </em>809 F.2d 285, 290 (\u201c[w]e conclude the Board\u2019s denial of the withholding claim is supported by substantial evidence, <em>as is its determination that Ms. Campos is statutorily ineligible for a discretionary grant of asylum.\u201d) </em>(Emphasis added). [Additional citation omitted]. The Attorney General\u2019s ultimate decision whether to grant or deny a refugee asylum, [if eligibility is established,] must be upheld \u2018absent a showing that such action was arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion.\u2019 <em>Young v. I.N.S., </em>759 [F.2d] at 455 n. 6.\u201d <em>Zamora-Morel, </em>905 F.2d at 838.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">To establish eligibility for asylum (the granting of which is within the Attorney General\u2019s discretion), the alien must show 1) that he has a \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution in his country of nationality ... on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, ... 2) that there is a reasonable possibility of actually suffering such persecution if he were to return to that country, and ... 3) that he is unable or unwilling to return to or avail himself of the protection of that country because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>such fear.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(1), (2). An application for asylum is also treated as a request for withholding of deportation. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.3(b); <em>Castillo-Rodriguez v. I.N.S., </em>929 F.2d 181, 185 (5th Cir.1991). \u201cThe showing required to prove a clear probability of persecution [to establish eligibility for withholding of deportation] is more stringent than that required to prove a well-founded fear of persecution under the asylum remedy.\u201d <em>Castillo-Rodriguez, </em>929 F.2d at 185 (citing <em>I.N.S. v. Cardozo-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 449-50, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 1222-23, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-4\">\u201cThe law regulating persecution claims, although humane in concept, is not generous.\u201d <em>Coriolan v. I.N.S., </em>559 F.2d 993, 996 (5th Cir.1977). Adebisi\u2019s testimony clearly reveals a pattern of violence against <em>his family </em>by a faction within the Esubete.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Furthermore, the immigration judge found that Adebisi feared persecution because of his membership in \u201ca particular social group\u201d \u2014 the royal family of the Esubete.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Both the immigration judge and the Board found, however, that Adebisi\u2019s fear of persecution was \u201con account of a personal dispute.\u201d We agree with this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">We think, however, that Adebisi\u2019s fear of persecution (voodoo curse and death threats) was not \u201con account of membership in a particular social group,\u201d but instead \u201con account of\u201d his particular activities or lack thereof as related to that social group. Even if the term \u201csocial group\u201d is understood to apply to a limited group such as the Esubete royal family, it remains clear that Adebisi is being threatened because he refuses to accept a position of leadership, not \u201con account of\u201d his membership in the royal family. Indeed, the Board states \u201cthe persecution the respondent fears is on account of ... intra-tribal discord over the respondent\u2019s unwillingness to succeed his father as chief.\u201d <em>In re Adebisi, </em>slip op. at 2 (Board of Immigration Appeals, March 27, 1991). Thus, we agree that Adebisi cannot be considered for asylum or withholding of deportation because the persecution he fears arises from a \u201cpersonal dispute\u201d between him and a faction of the Esubete tribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-10\">Moreover, this circuit has repeatedly held that \u201cpersecution within the context of the INS regulations relates to persecution by \u201cauthorities,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\u201d \u201csupporters of the ... regime,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\u201d \u201cthe military,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\u201d or \u201cthe government<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\u201d unless \u201cpolitical conditions [in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>alien\u2019s country of origin] are so specially oppressive that a wider range of claims of persecution must be given credence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The evidence in the record supports the Board\u2019s finding that the \u201cpersecution\u201d feared by Adebisi does not arise from activities instigated or sanctioned by the Nigerian \u201cgovernment,\u201d \u201cauthorities,\u201d \u201cmilitary,\u201d or \u201csupporters of the [] regime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">It is true, of course, that the BIA extends the qualifying range of persecution fear to include acts by groups \u201cthe government is unable or unwilling to control.\u201d It found in this case, however, that the Esu-bete elders were not such a group. <em>In re Adebisi, </em>slip op. at 2 (Board of Immigration Appeals, March 27, 1991). Although the evidence shows that Adebisi is unwilling to seek the protection of the Nigerian government, he is unwilling because of his fear of the Esubete elders and their voodoo powers, not because of \u201cspecially oppressive\u201d political or governmental conditions that would justify broader than normal consideration. <em>Coriolan, </em>559 F.2d at 1003. We therefore hold that Adebisi has failed to establish a \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution\u201d that is of the character that would entitle him to consideration for asylum. It necessarily follows that he has failed to make the more stringent showing necessary to justify withholding of deportation. <em>Castillo-Rodriguez, </em>929 F.2d at 185.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">The order of the Board of Immigration Appeals affirming the order of the immigration judge denying asylum or withholding of deportation, and denying voluntary departure is</p>\n<p id=\"AW8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">. As he puts it, the elders can say, \"Thompson, be a dead person,\u201d and he will die.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">. Adebisi cites only one incident, which involved a late night disturbance of the peace, as support for this claim. The disturbance was reported to the police the following day and they refused to act. The immigration judge found this unconvincing as support for Adebisi\u2019s belief that the police would not act on the death threat against him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">. We also note that letters from Adebisi\u2019s friend, Debo Ologundude, and his brother, Nuji Adebi-si, while not clearly showing a pattern of persecution, can be read as supporting that view. Ologundude\u2019s letter indicates the whereabouts of Adebisi\u2019s wife and children is unknown. Nuji Adebisi's letter indicates that a death threat was made against their uncle by the Esubete elders to try to force him to give them Adebisi's location.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">. The immigration judge, in her oral opinion stated, \u201c[tjhere is no doubt, particularly in a situation like yours, that the family relationship that is kinship, can constitute membership in a particular social group.\u201d Administrative Record at p. 76.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">. <em>Bahramnia v.

[A] large number are imprisoned indiscriminately.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1002.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">. We have carefully considered Adebisi\u2019s allegations that he was prejudiced by lack of counsel. The Board found that Adebisi was given \"numerous opportunities to obtain counsel\" and that his \"waiver of his right to representation at no expense to the government was ... knowing and intelligent.\u201d <em>In re Adebisi, </em>slip op. at 1 (Board of Immigration Appeals, March 27, 1991). This finding is supported by substantial evidence and we will uphold it. As to Adebisi\u2019s claims that he suffered from lack of communication and a biased judge, we simply find no merit to them. Our review of the record reveals that, in spite of numerous \"indiscernible\u201d statements in the transcripts, the immigration judge made a searching and wide-ranging inquiry of Adebisi and allowed him plentiful opportunities to elaborate on his answers to her questions and to make comments of his own. In addition, the immigration judge went to some lengths to assure fair treatment for Mr. Adebisi and stated that she was sympathetic to him. We find no support for either \"lack of communication\u201d or a \"biased judge.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
