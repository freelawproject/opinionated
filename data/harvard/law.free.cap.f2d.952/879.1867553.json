Loetzerich appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice of their claim against Home Savings and Loan Association F.A. and the Resolution Trust Corporation. The district court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. For the reasons assigned we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-25\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b974-26\">In September of 1987 the Loetzerichs purchased property in New Orleans, assuming a Home Savings mortgage. The property was destroyed by fire on December 1, 1989; Home Savings then held the mortgage. After filing a fire damage claim the Loetzerichs learned that the property was underinsured.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-27\">In June 1990 Home Savings was declared insolvent and Resolution Trust Company (RTC) was appointed Receiver. Implementing the administrative claims process, RTC published the notice required by 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821(d)(3)(B), and established September 25, 1990 as the deadline for the filing of claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-28\">On November 30, 1990 the Loetzerichs filed a suit against Home Savings and the RTC alleging that Home Savings was negligent for allowing them to assume the loan and hazard insurance when it knew or should have known that there was insufficient insurance to cover a fire loss to the property. The RTC moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the Loetzerichs had failed to exhaust administrative remedies, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821(d). The district court granted the motion and the Loetzerichs timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\">A motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction may be decided by the district court considering only the complaint, the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts reflected in the record, or the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts plus the court\u2019s resolution of disputed facts. <em>Ynclan v. Department of Air Force, </em>943 F.2d 1388 (5th Cir.1991) (citing <em>Williamson v. Tucker, </em>645 F.2d 404 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 897, 102 S.Ct. 396, 70 L.Ed.2d 212 (1981)). In the present case the district court relied on the complaint and undisputed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">The Loetzerichs contend that the district court erred in dismissing their claim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies because the RTC waived the administrative claims process when it failed to provide the notice as required by 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821(d)(3)(C). They contend that this \u201cwaiver\u201d vests the district court with jurisdiction. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">We begin our review with the administrative claims process in the Financial Institutions Reform and Recovery Enforcement Act of 1989 (\u201cFIRREA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 101-73, 83 Stat. 183 (1989). Congress enacted FIRREA to remedy the problems it perceived in the existing regulatory scheme in the savings and loan industry. <em>See </em>H.Rep. No. 101-54(1), 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 291-312, <em>reprinted in </em>1989 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; AdmimNews 86, 87-108 (detailing the history and purpose behind FIRREA). Among its numerous provisions FIRREA established the RTC<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in an effort \u201cto contain, manage, and resolve failed savings associations.\u201d Pub.L. 101-73, 103 Stat. 183, 187, <em>published at </em>12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1811 Note. To assure that the RTC or Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> could deal expeditiously with failed depository institutions, Congress created a new claims determination procedure by which the creditors of a failed institution may be required to first present their claims to the Receiver for administrative consideration before pursuing a judicial remedy. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">This claims procedure was in part informed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Coit Independence Joint Venture v. Federal Sav. &amp; Loan Ins. Corp., </em>489 U.S. 561, 109 S.Ct. 1361, 103 L.Ed.2d 602 (1989).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Coit </em>the Court held that the previous statutes governing the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board did not grant exclusive adjudicatory power to the FSLIC over creditors\u2019 claims against insolvent savings and loans associations under FSLIC receivership and did not divest the courts of jurisdiction to consider those claims <em>de novo. Id. </em>489 U.S. at 587, 109 S.Ct. at 1375-76, 103 L.Ed.2d at 624. The Court also held that because there was no reasonable time limit on FSLIC\u2019s consideration of creditor claims, the FSLIC did not have the power as receiver to require parties to adjudicate their claims first through the FSLIC claim procedure before pursuing judicial remedies.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b975-9\">The new claims procedure gives the Receiver of a failed financial institution the authority to review claims. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821(d)(3). The RTC has 180 days to determine whether to allow or disallow a claim and must timely notify the claimant. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821(d)(5). If the claim is disallowed, or the 180-day determination period has expired, the claimant may request fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>ther administrative consideration or seek judicial review. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821(d)(6)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">Typically, exhaustion of administrative remedies is required where Congress imposes such a requirement. <em>Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975). If the statutory language is not explicit, courts are guided by congressional intent in determining whether exhaustion is required. <em>Patsy v. Florida Board of Regents, </em>457 U.S. 496, 502 n. 4, 102 S.Ct. 2557, 2560 n. 4, 73 L.Ed.2d 172 (1982). Although FIRREA does not explicitly mandate exhaustion of administrative remedies before judicial intervention, the language of the statute and indicated congressional intent make clear that such is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">Section 1821(d)(13)(D)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> operates to divest the courts of jurisdiction over certain actions against the RTC. Section 1821(d)(6)(A) permits a claimant to file suit only after filing a claim with the RTC as receiver and then only if the receiver has disallowed the claim or the 180-day determination period has expired. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821(d)(6)(A). At that point, the claimant may file suit \u201cin the district or territorial court of the United States for the district within which the depository institution\u2019s principal place of business is located ... (and such court <em>shall have jurisdiction to hear such </em>claim).\u201d Id. (emphasis added). FIRREA contains no provision granting federal jurisdiction to claims filed after a receiver is appointed but before administrative exhaustion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As such, section 1821(d)(13)(D) clearly establishes a statutory exhaustion requirement. Other courts have so held. <em>See e.g., Rosa v. Resolution Trust Corp., </em>938 F.2d 383 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 582, 116 L.Ed.2d 608 (1991); <em>Circle Indus. Div. of Nastasi-White, Inc. v. City Fed. Sav. Bank, </em>749 F.Supp. 447 (E.D.N.Y.1990), <em>aff'd per curiam, </em>931 F.2d 7 (2d Cir.1991); <em>United Bank of Waco, N.A. v. First Republic Bank, N.A., </em>758 F.Supp. 1166 (W.D.Tex.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">As we previously have recognized, in enacting an administrative review system Congress may vest exclusive original jurisdiction in the reviewing agency. <em>Central States Southeast &amp; Southwest Areas Pension Fund v. T.I.M.E.-D.C., Inc., </em>826 F.2d 320 (5th Cir.1987). <em>See e.g., Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975). \u201cWhen exhaustion is statutorily mandated, the requirement is jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Townsend v. United States Dept. of Justice Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv., </em>799 F.2d 179, 181 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-10\">It is undisputed that no claim was ever filed herein with the RTC. The Loetzerichs insist, nonetheless, that exhaustion is not required because the RTC did not comply with the mailing requirement detailed in 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821(d)(3)(C)(ii). That section mandates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AU2\">(C) Mailing Required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b976-11\">The receiver shall mail a notice similar to the notice published under subparagraph (B)(i) at the time of such publication to any creditor shown on the institution\u2019s books\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b976-12\">(i) at the creditor\u2019s last address appearing in such books; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b976-13\">(ii) upon discovery of the name and address of a claimant not appearing on the institution\u2019s books within 30 days after the discovery of such name and address.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b977-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821(d)(3)(C).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Loetzerichs contend that this statutory notification requirement is mandatory and the Receiver\u2019s failure to provide the notice relieved them of the obligation to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-4\">Assuming the verity of these allegations, the district court properly rejected the waiver argument. There is no statutory basis for this contention. As we previously have stated, a statutory time period is not mandatory unless it both expressly requires an agency or public official to act within a particular time period and imposes a consequence for failure of compliance. <em>Fort Worth Nat\u2019l Corp. v. Federal Sav. &amp; Loan Ins. Corp., </em>469 F.2d 47 (5th Cir.1972). <em>Accord, United States v. Boccanfuso, </em>882 F.2d 666, 671 (2d Cir.1989) (\u201cFederal agencies do not lose jurisdiction by their failure to comply with statutory time limits unless the statute demonstrates congressional intent that this result occur....\u201d); <em>Saratoga Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. Federal Home Loan Bank Bd., </em>879 F.2d 689 (9th Cir.1989); <em>Twin Pines Coal Co. v. United States Dep't of Labor, </em>854 F.2d 1212 (10th Cir.1988); <em>Navistar Int\u2019l Transp. Corp. v. United States Envtl. Protection Agency, </em>858 F.2d 282, 286 (6th Cir.1988) (\u201cthe failure of the notice of noncompliance to contain the instruction manual or the technical support document does not prevent the EPA from proceeding with the liability hearing.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1039, 109 S.Ct. 1943, 104 L.Ed.2d 413 (1989). Although the Supreme Court has not adopted this rule, it has indicated that it \u201cwould be most reluctant to conclude that every failure of an agency to observe a procedural requirement voids subsequent agency action, especially when important public rights are at stake.\u201d <em>Brock v. Pierce County, </em>476 U.S. 253, 260, 106 S.Ct. 1834, 1839, 90 L.Ed.2d 248, 255 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">The primary purpose underlying FIRREA\u2019s exhaustion scheme is apparent. It allows the RTC \u201cto perform its statutory function of promptly determining claims so as to quickly and efficiently resolve claims against a failed institution without resorting to litigation.\u201d <em>Rosa, </em>938 F.2d at 396. Further, the exhaustion scheme mandated by FIRREA is reasonable, given the brevity of the exhaustion procedure and the <em>de novo </em>judicial review of claims once the procedure is exhausted. <em>Id. </em>Under the facts at bar no exception to exhaustion need be considered. The Loetzerichs have failed to exhaust the administrative remedies as directed by FIRREA; the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b975-10\">. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441a(b)(l).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b975-11\">.
