They were business competitors in the markets of the Hnited States. In January, 1893, they entered into an agreement by which the plaintiff agreed to sell and deliver to the defendant \u25a0such quantities of crude asphalt from the Trinidad pitch lake as the \u2022defendant might require for the fulfilling of its contracts made, or\u2019 \"to be made, with certain parties for supplying them with lake .asphalt for laying or repairing asphalt pavements in specified cities .and towns, including the city of Syracuse. The defendant agreed .to purchase its supplies exclusively from the plaintiff, \u201c and to seE <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>its supplies so purchased for use in laying only sheet asphaltum pavements, sidewalks and floors \u201d in the cities and towns referred to. 'The 6th clause of the said agreement was as follows: \u201c The Standard Company also agrees not to sell or supply asphalt to any person, firm or corporation that does not agree to deal, and deal exclusively, in asphalt obtained from the Barber Company, by or through Standard Company, without the consent of the Barber Company; and the said Barber Company consents and agrees that the Standard Company may \u25a0sell land asphalt for the purpose of laying sheet pavement for a period \u25a0of one year from the date hereof, such pavement to be laid only in \"the cities of Syracuse, Cincinnati and Troy and its suburbs ; otherwise subject to all the further provisions of this agreement.\u201d The proper construction of this clause is the matter in controversy between the parties. The plaintiff contends that the permission .granted\"to the defendant is not a permission to \u201csell\u201d land asphalt for a year following the date of the agreement, but only a permission to sell \u201c for use \u201d within the year \u2014 that is, a permission to sell provided the asphalt <em>sold </em>should be <em>used </em>within the year; or, as the learned counsel puts it, \u201c The <em>use </em>of the defendant\u2019s land asphalt \"for paving in Syracuse was limited to pavements <em>laid </em>within one year from the date of the contract, to wit, during the calendar year 1893.\u201d And as part of its cause of action the plaintiff alleges that during the period of one year from the date of the agreement the defendant, in violation of its covenant, sold land asphalt for the purpose of laying sheet pavement in the city of Syracuse in the years 1894 and 1895. The defendant, on the other hand, contends that under the agreement it had for a year the right to sell land asphalt for a certain use in certain specified localities \u2014 and this, it seems to me, is the true construction of the clause in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">At the date of the agreement (January 2, 1893) the defendant had on hand a large stock of both refined and crude land asphalt, .amounting, according to the defendant\u2019s witness Whitney, to 5,500 tons of refined and 1,200 tons of crude, and according to the plaintiff\u2019s witness Brackett, to 3,000 tons of refined and 500 tons of crude. It is said that there is no evidence that the plaintiff had knowledge \u25a0of this fact. The testimony of Mr. Blackwell shows that the large quantity of land asphalt held by the defendant was the subject of discussion before the agreement was signed, and the presumption is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>almost irresistible that during the negotiations which preceded the: agreement the condition of the defendant as to stock on hand was. made known to the Barber Company. All the circumstances and the terms of the agreement suggest this. The defendant was arranging to abandon its traffic in land asphalt; by the agreement it bound itself \u201c to purchase its supplies of asphalt * * * exclusively from the Barber Company,\u201d and it also agreed <em>\u201c </em>not to sell or supply asphalt to any person, firm or corporation that does not agree to deal, and deal exclusively, in asphalt obtained from the Barber Company by or through Standard Company.\u201d It can hardly be doubted that the Barber Company\u2019s consent that the defendant might <em>\u201c </em>sell land asphalt for the purpose of laying sheet pavement for a period' of one year \u201d from the date of the agreement was granted to give: the defendant a fair opportunity to rid itself of its stock on bandit was certainly of little value if the plaintiff\u2019s contention, 'that the-defendant <em>\u201c </em>could sell \u2018 land \u2019 asphalt <em>for all pa/oements laid withi/rv the-year 1893, </em>and not otherwise,\u201d is correct. That construction would. impose upon the defendant a guaranty that all land asphalt sold by it would be used by the purchaser within the year. If for any cause the work for which it was sold should be interrupted and: delayed and completion thereof during the year be prevented, the: use of the asphalt by the j^urchaser at a later date to complete the: work would be a violation by the defendant of its agreement with the plaintiff, and the plaintiff would thereby become entitled to-declare the agreement at an end under the right reserved in-the 11th clause. The defendant, therefore, could not, with safety,, sell any portion of its stock on hand, for it could not possibly foresee what obstacles might prevent its use during the= year. The interpretation put upon the agreement by the learned counsel for the plaintiff seems to me to be a strained and unreasonable one, and contrary to the evident intention of the parties. That, intention was that the defendant, during a defined period, to wit, during the year following the date of the agreement, should be: free to make sales of its stock of land asphalt for a specific purpose,, to wit, for laying sheet pavements in designated localities, to wit,, the cities of Syracuse, Cincinnati and Troy. It is visible, I think,, on the face of the agreement, and argument cannot make it plainer. Even if there were doubt about it, the plaintiff, being the author <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>\u2022of the agreement, cannot claim to have its obscure clauses construed liberally in its own favor. The \u201c rule of grammar \u201d to which \u2022counsel refers was rather harshly treated in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Robson </em>(148 N. Y. 252). In that case the contract was between a theatrical manager and an actor, and contained this provision : \u201c The said J. R. Smith (the actor) further agrees that if, at any time, Stuart Robson (the manager) shall feel satisfied that he is incompetent to perform the duties which he has contracted to perform in good faith, or is inattentive to business * * * then lie (Robson) may annul this contract by giving two weeks\u2019 notice to said J. R. Smith.\u201d Andrews, Oh. J., said: \u201c There is a little obscurity \u25a0as to the application of the qualifying words, 'in good faith,\u2019 but we think it is sufficiently plain that they were intended to \u2022apply to the conduct of the defendant, as if the contract had read, \u2018 if in good faith the employer shall be satisfied.\u2019 \u201d So the force of the argument of counsel, based on the absence of a comma .after <em>\u201c </em>sheet pavement \u201d in the 6th clause of the agreement, is badly shaken, at least, by <em>Grinnell </em>v. <em>Kiralfy </em>(55 Hun, 422) which was the case of a contract between manager and actor very similar to that in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Robson. </em>Judge Barrett- said: \u201c The defendant (the manager) contends that as there was no comma in the \u25a0original instrument after the word ' contracted,\u2019 the good faith referred to was his in making the contract. The plaintiff, on the \u25a0other hand, claims that the words \u2018 in good faith \u2019 refer to the previous expression, \u2018 shall feel satisfied,\u2019 and that thus she was protected from a capricious or arbitrary discharge. We think the latter is the fair and reasonable construction of this contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">In the second place, the plaintiff claims that the land asphalt mentioned in the complaint was not \u201c sold \u201d by the defendant within the limited time \u2014 that is, during the year 1893. The argument is that the words \u201c may sell,\u201d in the 6th clause of the agreement, are used in their \u201c plain, ordinary and popular sense \u201d (which is probably so); that they mean \u201c may make sales; \u201d that a sale is a transaction between the parties by which title to property \u00a1Dasses from one to the other; that title does not pass by an executory contract of sale; that such contracts are not, therefore, intended or permitted by the \u201c may sell \u201d of the agreement; and that the defendant made no sales, but only executory contracts of sale, of the land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>asphalt in question. My opinion is that this claim ought not to be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">The facts are, that in.January, March and August, 1893, contracts were made between the defendant and the Syracuse Improvement Company for the sale and purchase of sufficient quantities of: land asphalt to pave and keep in repair certain streets in the city-of Syracuse\u2014\u25a0 such asphalt to be delivered and accepted before; dates mentioned in said contracts \u2014 some before July 1, 1893 ;, some before November 1, 1893 ; some before June 1, 1894; some-before September 1, 1894; and the remainder during the years. 1894 and 1895 ; and that the 2,861 tons of asphalt referred to in. the complaint were delivered by the defendant under the said contracts, and were actually used in pavements in 1894 and 1895. The: dates of the deliveries have not been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">When a sale is defined as <em>\u201c </em>a transfer of the absolute title to property for a certain agreed price \u201d (Story Sales, \u00a7 1), or as a \u201c meeting; of minds, by which a title passes from one and vests in another \u201d <em>(Butler </em>v. <em>Thomson, </em>92 U. S. 415), the definition covers or includes the entire transaction, which, from being executory, has-become executed by delivery or payment or performance of conditions or separation or identification and appropriation of the tiling-sold, or other act or event on which the transfer of title is, by the-agreement of the parties, made to depend. The question whether a transaction is a sale by which title has passed to the purchaser usually arises either on a claim asserted by a third party, as in <em>Hatch </em>v. <em>Oil Co. </em>(100 U. S. 124), where the property was seized under-execution as the property of the seller, or, as in <em>Porter Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(29 Hun, 509); <em>Pinckney </em>v. <em>Darling </em>(3 App. Div. 553), where the property was seized under process as the property of the-buyer; or when, before actual delivery, the property is destroyed or damaged, as in <em>Olyphant </em>v. <em>Baker </em>(5 Den. 379); <em>Terry v. Wheeler </em>(25 N. Y. 520), where the barley and lumber were destroyed by fire; <em>Burrows </em>v. <em>Whitaker </em>(71 id. 291), where the logs were swept away by a flood; <em>Mee </em>v. <em>McNider </em>(109 id. 500), where the cocoa was-damaged while in transit from the port of shipment. It is, however, matter of common knowledge that in ordinary, every-day transactions the distinction between a sale that passes title and an executory contract of sale is not heeded or observed. If goods are sold to be-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>delivered and paid for at a future time, business men describe the-transaction, and properly describe it, as a sale. In the Century Dictionary \u201c sale \u201d is defined as follows: \u201c In law, a contract fertile transfer of property from one person to another for a valuable consideration. <em>* </em>* * It is also often used as indicating a present transfer as distinguished from a contract to transfer at a future time, which is sometimes termed an <em>executory sale? </em>In <em>Decker </em>v. <em>Furniss </em>(14 N. Y. 611) the contract stated, \u201c Brown <em>sells </em>to Furniss,\u201d etc. Judge Comstock said that the language imported an executed sale, but that phrases of that sort are used in a very loose - sense and are quite inconclusive, and that \u201c their literal signification is often overruled by the tenor and purpose of the whole instrumentand Judge Weight added: <em>\u201c </em>An adherence to the literal purport of the-word \u2018 sells \u2019 would overrule the intention which the provisions of the agreement, as a whole, plainly indicate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">It is plain 'to me that the words <em>\u201c </em>may sell \u201d were not used by the-plaintiff in the 6th clause of the agreement in any other than the-ordinary sense, and that the plaintiff did not thereby intend to-restrict the defendant to sales of land asphalt by which title would at once or presently pass to the purchasers. They intended \u201c sell \u201d' in the 6th clause to have the same meaning as the same word in the; 5th clause, and it would certainly be absurd to say that by the 5th clause the defendant is prohibited from contracting to sell for future-delivery asphalt purchased by it from the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The defendant should have judgment dismissing the complaint- and for the. counterclaims.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
