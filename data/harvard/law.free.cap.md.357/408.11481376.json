Vol.), Article 27, \u00a7 12A, and four counts of reckless endangerment, Maryland Code (1957, 1996 RepkVol., 1998 Supp.), Article 27, \u00a7 12A-2(a)(l).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On direct appeal, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgments. <em>Jones v. State, </em>125 Md.App. 168, 724 A.2d 738 (1999). We issued a writ of certiorari to determine whether the trial court erred by refusing to instruct the jury that self-defense applied to the reckless endangerment charges.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Jones v. State, </em>354 Md. 330, 731 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>A.2d 439 (1999). We hold that common law self-defense is a viable defense to a charge of the statutory crime of reckless endangerment under \u00a7 12A-2(a)(l) and, consequently, we reverse the judgments of the Circuit Court and the Court of Special Appeals as to the reckless endangerment convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">As our holding in this case turns on a purely legal analysis, we adopt, with slight modifications, the facts as stated by the Court of Special Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-7\">\u201cOn [6 July 1997], Carmen Reavis met several of her friends for an afternoon of fun at Adventure World [now Six Flags], a water amusement park located in Prince George\u2019s County. Among them were Tracy Barber, Gerald Goode, Walter Stokes, Reginald Davis, and William Brown. The group collected inside the park at around 1:80 p.m. and spent the next several hours together. [Petitioner] and Rashad Friday, his friend, arrived at Adventure World at around 5:30 p.m. the same day. About ten minutes later, Friday spotted Reavis, whom he did not know, and, thinking she was attractive, approached her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-8\">\u201c[Petitioner] testified in his own defense. He explained that Friday \u2018reached over to touch [Reavis\u2019] arm to get her attention so she could hear him.... \u2019 When Reavis did not respond, Friday \u2018touched\u2019 her arm again. This time, \u2018[s]he responded immediately with cursing and fussing.\u2019 Friday then \u2018put his hands up and like okay, no problem.\u2019 [Petitioner] turned away momentarily to speak with some friends who were standing nearby; when he looked back he saw that \u2018approximately seven to nine guys [had] surrounded [Friday] in a confrontation.\u2019 Among them were Goode, Stokes, Brown, and Davis. [Petitioner] approached the men and said to Friday, \u2018[l]et\u2019s walk.\u2019 He and Friday then walked together toward the front gate, \u2018where we had seen some safety, the only place I[had] seen security.\u2019 The group followed. At that point, [Petitioner] became scared.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>\u201c[Petitioner] further testified that as he and Friday crossed over a narrow bridge, he looked to his right and saw three of the pursuers attack Friday. He watched Friday \u2018go down\u2019 as his attackers \u2018stomp[ed] on him\u2019 and kicked him in the head and chest. Immediately thereafter, someone grabbed [Petitioner] from behind, threw him into a railing and repeatedly hit his head against it. [Petitioner] remembered being accosted by three assailants: one who stood behind him and restrained his arms and two others who alternated striking him in the head and chest. [Petitioner] explained that, \u2018[w]hen I got one of my arms released I reached in my right pocket, pulled out a knife, opened it up\u2019 and \u2018cut each of them until they let me go.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-5\">\u201cThe State\u2019s witnesses offered a very different version of events. Reavis testified that as she and her friends were walking toward the \u2018Mind Eraser\u2019 roller coaster, Friday grabbed her arm. She did not want to speak with him, so she continued walking. Friday approached her again a few minutes later and this time reached over and touched her breast. When Goode learned what had happened, he confronted Friday and warned him to keep his hands to himself. According to Reavis, \u2018it wasn\u2019t like a crowd of people, you know, around or nothing. It was just like basically us three, and it was a couple people around, but they was like a little distance back.\u2019 Friday made disparaging remarks to Reavis and she found him to be belligerent, not apologetic. Reavis heard [Petitioner] ask Goode if he wanted to \u2018take it outside,\u2019 but Goode refused. About five minutes later, [Petitioner] and Friday suddenly attacked Goode on the bridge. Brown, Williams, and Davis got involved in the brawl to help Goode. Reavis saw [Petitioner] \u2018swinging his arms wildly.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-6\">\u201cStokes testified that [Petitioner] had a knife and that during the brawl, [Petitioner] stabbed him in the leg. Brown testified that during the commotion, [Petitioner] was \u2018swinging\u2019 and then spun around and stabbed him. When the dust cleared, Stokes, Brown, Goode, and Davis had been wounded.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>125 Md.App. at 170-71, 724 A.2d at 739.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>The State charged Petitioner with one count each of attempted second degree murder, attempted voluntary manslaughter, first degree assault, second degree assault, and reckless endangerment for the injuries to Walter Stokes. The State also charged Petitioner with three counts of second degree assault and three counts of reckless endangerment for the injuries inflicted upon William Brown, Gerald Goode, and Reginald Davis.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Petitioner\u2019s jury trial commenced in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County on 21 January 1998. Before the trial concluded on 23 January 1998, Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel presented, in writing, to the trial judge his requested jury instructions. Among these instructions, Petitioner included the following regarding the reckless endangerment charges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\">If an individual is acting in defense of a crime of violence, he cannot be guilty of reckless endangerment. It is the State\u2019s burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not acting in defense of a crime of violence. If you are not so convinced, you must find the defendant not guilty of all counts charging reckless endangerment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">To this, Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel appended a supporting footnote which referenced Maryland Code (1957, 1996 RepLVol.), Article 27, \u00a7 12A-2(b)(4). Unfortunately, Petitioner\u2019s statutory support referred to a superceded subsection of the reckless endangerment statute. Section 12A-2(b)(4), in the version cited by Petitioner and that was effective prior to 8 April 1997, provided that the prohibitions of the reckless endangerment statute generally did not apply to \u201can individual acting in defense of a crime of violence.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The record does not reflect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>that Petitioner, the State, or the court acknowledged or were aware of the superceded status of the statutory provision cited by Petitioner in support of the requested instruction. The trial judge did not give Petitioner\u2019s relevant jury instruction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The trial judge did instruct the jury that self-defense applied to all the charges against Petitioner, except the reckless endangerment counts. Following the judge\u2019s delivery of the jury instructions, Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel excepted to certain omissions from the instructions. Among the exceptions, his counsel asked the trial judge to instruct that self-defense applied to the reckless endangerment charges. Defense counsel stated, \u201cif an individual is acting in defense of a crime of violence he cannot be guilty of reckless endangerment ... I think the jury should know that, that it\u2019s akin to self-defense.\u201d Defense counsel again referred to Maryland Code (1957, 1996 RepLVol.), Article 27, \u00a7 12A-2(b)(4) in support of his oral request.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial judge overruled Petitioner\u2019s exception.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>As noted <em>supra, </em>the record does not reflect that either party or the judge was aware expressly that defense counsel was relying on a superceded version of \u00a7 12A-2(b),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as the basis of the request for the relevant jury instruction. The General Assembly amended \u00a7 12A-2, and specially subsection (b), with the new version taking effect on 8 April 1997, approximately three months before Petitioner\u2019s altercation at Adventure World. In the amended version, \u00a7 12A-2(b) no longer provides a defense for individuals acting in defense of a crime of violence to a charge under \u00a7 12A-2(a)(l), which served as the basis of the reckless endangerment charges against Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The jury found Petitioner not guilty of attempted second degree murder, attempted voluntary manslaughter, and first degree assault. It convicted Petitioner of second degree assault against Stokes and all four counts of reckless endangerment. At sentencing, the reckless endangerment conviction as to Stokes was merged into the related assault conviction. The trial court sentenced Petitioner to ten years in prison with all but four years suspended for the second degree assault conviction as to Stokes and three concurrent four-year sentences in prison for the remaining reckless endangerment convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the convictions. <em>Jones v. State, </em>125 Md.App. 168, 724 A.2d 738 (1999). The intermediate appellate court determined that Petitioner\u2019s requested jury instruction was based on a superseded statutory provision and that under the correct version of the statute, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>self-defense provision which Petitioner relied upon (\u201cdefense of a crime of violence\u201d) applied only to a \u00a7 12A-2(a)(2) charge (\u201crecklessly discharges a firearm from a motor vehicle\u201d). Because the court resolved that Petitioner\u2019s jury instruction was based on an inaccurate statement of the law (as to the statute), it held that the trial judge properly refused to give the requested self-defense jury instruction as to the reckless endangerment counts premised on \u00a7 12A-2(a)(l)(general reckless endangerment conduct). <em>Jones, </em>125 Md.App. at 177, 724 A.2d at 742. The court did not address whether common law self-defense applied to the reckless endangerment charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Before we turn to the substantive issue for which certiorari was granted, we put to rest the State\u2019s renewed non-preservation argument. The State asserts in its brief that, at trial, Petitioner failed to request adequately a self-defense instruction in connection with the reckless endangerment charges. The State points to a trial record excerpt wherein Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel, at one point, seemingly acknowledged, during exceptions to the instructions as given, that \u201cself defense applies to all the counts with the exception of reckless endangerment.\u201d It also highlights Petitioner\u2019s proposed jury instruction that was premised expressly on a superceded version of the reckless endangerment statute. Relying on Maryland Rule 4-325(e),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the State contends that due to Petitioner\u2019s express acknowledgment that self-defense did not apply to reckless endangerment and his erroneous reliance on a super-ceded statutory provision, he failed to preserve for appellate review the issue of whether common law self-defense is applicable to a charge of reckless endangerment.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>We decline to entertain the State\u2019s non-preservation contention further. The State\u2019s analysis is a reiteration of the issue and argument advanced in its conditional cross-petition for writ of certiorari which, as previously stated, we denied. Under our certiorari process, this Court will only consider matters on appeal raised in a petition for writ of certiorari that we have granted. <em>See Walston v. Sun Cab Co., </em>267 Md. 559, 568, 298 A.2d 391, 397 (1973). The certiorari process serves an important function in Maryland\u2019s system of jurisprudence. It allows this Court to select and review cases that we deem to be \u201cdesirable and in the public interest.\u201d Maryland Code (1974,1998 Repl.Vol.), Cts. and Jud. Proc. \u00a7 12-305; <em>See also Walston, </em>267 Md. at 565, 298 A.2d at 395. In exercising this broad discretion, we limit the issues that we elect to review by denying petitions for certiorari in whole or in part, so that we may deal directly with the issues selected. <em>See Streater v. State, </em>352 Md. 800, 802-03, n. 1, 724 A.2d 111, 127, n. 1 (1999). When this Court denies review of an issue in a petition for certiorari or a conditional cross-petition, a party ordinarily is foreclosed from rearguing that issue before us. <em>See Streater, </em>352 Md. at 805-06, n. 4, 724 A.2d at 127, n. 4; <em>Dempsey v. State, </em>277 Md. 134, 143, 355 A.2d 455, 459 (1976); <em>Walston, </em>267 Md. at 565, 298 A.2d at 395. In <em>Dempsey, </em>we explained the effect of an order from this Court limiting certiorari, by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">[w]here this Court\u2019s order granting certiorari limits the issues to be considered, no additional questions will ordinarily be dealt with even if such additional questions were raised in the petition or in a cross-petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-6\"><em>Dempsey, </em>277 Md. at 143, 355 A.2d at 459 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Recently in <em>Streater v. State, </em>352 Md. 800, 724 A.2d 111 (1999), we dealt with an analogous situation to the present case. In <em>Streater, </em>the trial court admitted in evidence a protective order which contained factual findings by a district court judge regarding prior criminal acts committed by the petitioner, Streater. Streater\u2019s counsel objected generally to the admission of the protective order, but failed to raise a specific objection to the admission of the evidence of prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>criminal acts. Despite Streater\u2019s apparent failure to preserve the specific evidentiary issue for which appellate review was sought subsequently, we rejected a waiver argument previously presented in the Respondent State\u2019s denied conditional cross-petition for writ of certiorari and renewed in its brief. We explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-4\">\u201c[g]iven our denial of that petition for certiorari, we must assume that Petitioner\u2019s objection was properly preserved ... the dissent\u2019s protestations are more properly directed at our denial of certiorari on the preservation issue ... [r]ais-ing contentions concerning an issue on which we expressly denied certiorari risks undermining our certiorari process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aro\"><em>Id. </em>at 805-06, n. 4, 724 A.2d at 128, n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">In the case at hand, the State\u2019s waiver/non-preservation argument was settled when we denied certiorari on that question. We shall not undermine the appellate review process by digressing from our chosen course. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">As we explained, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed Petitioner\u2019s convictions. The court\u2019s holding focused on its interpretation of the proper version of \u00a7 12A-2. The court reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">As the language of \u00a7 12A-2(b)(2)(ii) makes plain, an individual who is acting in defense of a crime of violence and who engages in the conduct specified in \u00a7 12A-2(a)(2), i.e., \u2018recklessly discharging] a firearm from a motor vehicle ...\u2019 is not committing the crime of reckless endangerment. That exception is narrowly written, however, and does not apply to the more general conduct set forth in \u00a7 12A-2(a)(2)[sic], i.e., \u2018recklessly engaging] in conduct that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another person ...\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-9\">In this case, appellant was charged with reckless endangerment under \u00a7 12A-2(a)(l). The jury instruction that he requested would have been a correct statement of the law if he had been charged with recklessly discharging a firearm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>from a motor vehicle under \u00a7 12A-2(a)(2). It was not a correct statement of the law under the circumstances of this case, however, and the trial court properly refused to grant it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-5\"><em>Jones, </em>125 Md.App. at 177, 724 A.2d at 742. We agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion to the extent that it resolves the question of whether Petitioner was entitled to a self-defense jury instruction based on \u00a7 12A(b)(2)(ii).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This, however, does not end our inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Petitioner contends that he is entitled to a self-defense instruction under the common law. In support of this alternate theory Petitioner posits that Maryland Code (1957, 1996 RepLVol.), Article 27 \u00a7 12A-3 recognizes his right to assert common law self-defense as a defense to the statutory reckless endangerment charges under \u00a7 12A-2(a)(l). Section 12A-3, entitled \u201cDefenses,\u201d states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">A person charged with an offense under this subheading [\u201cAssault,\u201d which includes reckless endangerment] is entitled to assert any judicially recognized defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Therefore, Petitioner reasons that he should be permitted to assert self-defense as \u201ca judicially recognized defense.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\"> To completely review Petitioner\u2019s argument we begin with an examination of the common law doctrine of self-defense in Maryland. When facts are adduced establishing perfect self-defense to a charge of criminal homicide or as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>sault, the defendant\u2019s actions are said to be justifiable or excusable and the direct result is the acquittal of the defendant. <em>See Dykes v. State, </em>319 Md. 206, 210-11, 571 A.2d 1251, 1254 (1990); <em>State v. Faulkner, </em>301 Md. 482, 485, 483 A.2d 759, 764 (1984). <em>See also Tichnell v. State, </em>287 Md. 695, 718, 415 A.2d 830, 842 (1980). Complete, or perfect, self-defense requires that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">(1) the defendant actually believed that he or she was in immediate or imminent danger of bodily harm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">(2) the defendant\u2019s belief was reasonable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">(3) the defendant must not have been the aggressor or provoked the conflict; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">(4) the defendant used no more force than was reasonably necessary to defend himself or herself in light of the threatened or actual harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-9\"><em>See State v. Martin, </em>329 Md. 351, 357, 619 A.2d 992, 995 (1993); <em>Dykes, </em>319 Md. at 211, 571 A.2d at 1254; <em>Faulkner, </em>301 Md. at 485-86, 483 A.2d at 764; <em>Tichnell v. State, </em>287 Md. at 718, 415 A.2d at 842 (1980); <em>Guerriero v. State, </em>213 Md. 545, 549, 132 A.2d 466, 467 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">The vast majority of our appellate opinions developing the law of self-defense have been in the context of the proper application of perfect and imperfect self-defense in murder cases. Imperfect self-defense differs from perfect self-defense in its effect in that the establishment of imperfect self-defense does not result in an acquittal. <em>Martin, </em>329 Md. at 358, 619 A.2d at 996. If established, imperfect self-defense negates the element of malice in a charge of murder and the defendant may be convicted of the lesser crime of voluntary manslaughter. <em>Faulkner, </em>301 Md. at 500, 483 A.2d at 769. Imperfect self-defense results when a fact-finder concludes that a defendant committed criminal homicide in an honest, but unreasonable belief that he or she was threatened with death or serious bodily harm. <em>Id. </em>The doctrine of imperfect self-defense applies only to \u201ccriminal homicide and its shadow forms, such as attempted murder.\u201d <em>Richmond v. State, </em>330 Md. 223, 233, 623 A.2d 630, 634-35 (1993) (citations omitted). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>It has no applicability to other assaultive crimes. <em>Bryant v. State, </em>83 Md.App. 237, 245, 574 A.2d 29, 33 (1990). While the complexities of perfect and imperfect self-defense are not at issue in this case, these cases are instructional.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">In <em>Corbin v. State, </em>94 Md.App. 21, 614 A.2d 1329 (1992), the Court of Special Appeals dealt with the question of whether a defendant was entitled to perfect and imperfect self-defense instructions in a group attack context. In <em>Corbin, </em>the defendant stabbed the victim during a dispute inside of a car. After the initial attack ended, another person intervened and initiated a second confrontation with the defendant. The defendant testified that the victim joined in the second confrontation and that during the second attack the defendant stabbed the victim for a second time. The victim died from the second stab wound. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s request for a self-defense instruction because it found that both incidents constituted one continuing affray and that the defendant was the initial aggressor in the incident. <em>Corbin, </em>94 Md.App. at 26-27, 614 A.2d at 1332. The defendant was convicted of second-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The court reversed the murder conviction. The court held that when a defendant offers some evidence to show that the second attack was an independent confrontation in which the defendant was not the aggressor, the defendant was entitled to jury instructions regarding the law of perfect and imperfect self-defense. <em>Id. </em>at 31-32, 614 A.2d at 1333. In reaching its conclusion the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">\u2018[W]here several persons are acting together aggressively toward another, and, because of their acts or the acts of either of them, it reasonably appears to him that his life is in danger, or he is in danger of great bodily harm, he may slay any of such persons or all of them, if it reasonably appears to him to be necessary so to do to protect himself from death or great bodily harm. And when a person is called upon to act under such circumstances, he is not bound to decide as to which one of the persons made the actual hostile demonstrations and refrain from injuring the others.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 28-29, 614 A.2d at 1332 (footnotes omitted)(quoting Francis Wharton, The Law of Homicide \u00a7 240 at 396-97 (Frank H. Bowlby ed., 3d ed.1907)). The court added that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Azs\">\u2018Where, in a trial for murder, there is competent evidence tending to show that the accused believed, and had reasonable grounds to believe, that he was in danger of losing his life or suffering great bodily harm at the hands of several assailants acting together, he may defend against any or all of said assailants, and it is reversible error for the trial court to refuse to instruct the jury to that effect.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 30, 614 A.2d at 1333. (citations omitted)(quoting <em>State v. Foley, </em>128 W.Va. 166, 35 S.E.2d 854, 855 (1945)).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Aside from its application to a charge of murder, Maryland appellate courts have applied common law self-defense to other assaultive crimes. <em>See Bussie v. State, </em>115 Md.App. 324, 693 A.2d 49 (1997); <em>Bryant v. State, </em>83 Md.App. 237, 574 A.2d 29 (1990). <em>Bryant </em>was the result of a brutal and bloody altercation between two men. The facts relating to which party started the fight were in dispute, but when the fight ended one party was hospitalized with forty stab wounds. The defendant was charged and convicted of attempted first degree murder, statutory maiming, assault with intent to disable, and assault and battery. <em>See Bryant, </em>83 Md.App. at 239, 574 A.2d at 30. The trial judge gave a jury instruction on perfect and imperfect self-defense as it related to the attempted murder charge, but the judge refused to instruct the jury on self-defense as a defense to the maiming or assault charges. The defendant appealed on the basis of the trial judge\u2019s refusal to instruct and the Court of Special Appeals reversed, concluding that \u201cthe simple and frequently neglected truth is that the defense of self-defense applies to assaultive crimes generally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 245, 574 A.2d at 33. In support of its holding, the court explained the applicability of self-defense to all assaultive crimes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">\u201c[i]t is only just that one who is unlawfully attacked by another, and who has no opportunity to resort to the law for his defense, should be able to take reasonable steps to defend himself from physical harm. When the steps he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>takes are reasonable, he has a complete defense to such crimes against the person as murder and manslaughter, attempted murder, assault and battery and the aggravated forms of assault and battery. His intentional infliction of (or, if he misses, his attempt to inflict) physical harm upon the other, or his threat to inflict such harm, is said to be justified when he acts in proper self-defense, so that he is not guilty of any crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 246, 574 A.2d at 83 (quoting W. Lafave &amp; A. Scott, Criminal Law \u00a7 5.7 (2d ed.1986)) (emphasis in original). The court added that because self-defense could exculpate the defendant from the underlying assault charges, the necessary implication was that self-defense could be a complete defense to the aggravating forms of assault. <em>See id. </em>at 246, 574 A.2d at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">With respect to the statutory maiming charge, the court reasoned that if the victim\u2019s maiming injuries were caused by a necessary self-defense to an attack which threatened the defendant with death or serious bodily injury, then the trial judge should have given a self-defense instruction to maiming charges. <em>Id. See also Bussie v. State, </em>115 Md.App. 324, 693 A.2d 49 (1997)(self-defense instruction is appropriate to a charge of assault with intent to disable).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">In sum, we think it clear that when an individual reacts, in an honest and reasonable belief, to a threat of imminent danger that may cause his or her death or serious bodily harm and uses no more force than the situation requires, that individual is legally exonerated from the criminal liability his or her actions may create, regardless of whether the State charges him or her with one of the various types of criminal homicide or assault under Maryland common law. <em>See Dykes v. State, </em>319 Md. 206, 211, 571 A.2d 1251, 1254 (1990); <em>State v. Faulkner, </em>301 Md. 482, 485, 483 A.2d 759, 761 (1984); <em>Redcross v. State, </em>121 Md.App. 320, 327, 708 A.2d 1154, 1157 (1998); <em>Bussie, </em>115 Md.App. at 346, 693 A.2d at 60. <em>Bryant, </em>83 Md.App. at 245, 574 A.2d at 33. With the previously declared applicability of self-defense in mind, we next <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>turn to examine the body of law dealing with the statutory crime of reckless endangerment.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The crime of reckless endangerment, not recognized as a distinct crime at common law, is codified in Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 1999 Cum.Supp.), Article 27 \u00a7 12A-2. The statute provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">(a) <em>Creation of substantial risk of death or serious 'physical injury; penalties.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-8\">\u2014(1) Any person who recklessly engages in conduct that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another person is guilty of the misdemeanor of reckless endangerment and on conviction is subject to a fine of not more than $5,000 or imprisonment for not more than 5 years or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">Section 12A-2 is a relatively new addition to the arsenal of criminal statutes used to deter criminal conduct. In 1989, the General Assembly enacted the statute with a clear policy goal in mind. It focused on deterring reckless behavior that posed a risk of serious injury or death before the injury or death occurred. <em>See State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 500-01, 649 A.2d 336, 348 (1994)(citing <em>Minor v. State, </em>326 Md. 436, 442, 605 A.2d 138, 141 (1992)). It was clear to us in <em>Minor </em>that the underlying purpose of the statute was aimed toward deterrence. We explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-10\">it is readily evident from the plain language of [the reckless endangerment statute] that it was enacted to punish, as criminal, reckless conduct which created a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another person. It is the reckless conduct and not the harm caused by the conduct, if any, which the statute was intended to criminalize.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-11\"><em>Minor, </em>326 Md. at 441, 605 A.2d at 141. <em>See also Williams v. State, </em>100 Md.App. 468, 481, 641 A.2d 990, 996 (1994)(reckless endangerment is directed at inhibiting criminal conduct before it goes too far).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>The elements of a prima facie case of reckless endangerment are: 1) that the defendant engaged in conduct that created a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another; 2) that a reasonable person would not have engaged in that conduct; and 3) that the defendant acted recklessly. <em>See Albrecht, </em>336 Md. at 501, 649 A.2d at 348-49. The predominant issue in the Maryland cases dealing with the crime of reckless endangerment has been the question of defining the requisite mental state of recklessness required to sustain a reckless endangerment conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">In <em>Minor v. State, </em>326 Md. 436, 605 A.2d 138 (1992), we were called upon to determine whether a defendant who handed his intoxicated brother a loaded shotgun, dared him to play \u201cRussian Roulette,\u201d and watched his brother shoot himself had the required mental state to violate the reckless endangerment statute. The defendant argued that he did not act recklessly because he subjectively believed that his brother was not going to pull the trigger of the gun. He urged us to adopt the Model Penal Code definition of \u201creckless\u201d which defined that mental state as a conscious disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk. <em>Minor, </em>326 Md. at 440, 605 A.2d at 140 <em>(citing </em>Model Penal Code, \u00a7 211.2). We rejected the defendant\u2019s argument, instead opting <em>for </em>an objective definition. We stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-5\">guilt under the statute does not depend upon whether the accused intended that his reckless conduct create a substantial risk of death or serious injury to another. The test is whether the appellant\u2019s misconduct, viewed objectively, was so reckless as to constitute a gross departure from the standard of conduct that a law-abiding person would observe, and thereby create the substantial risk that the statute was designed to punish.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 443, 605 A.2d at 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">We later applied this test in <em>Albrecht, </em>336 Md. at 501, 649 A.2d at 348-49. The defendant in <em>Albrecht </em>was a Montgomery County police officer. In an arrest confrontation with a group of suspects, the police officer aimed his self-customized shot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>gun at a young woman and unintentionally pulled the trigger. The woman was killed instantly. The police officer was charged and convicted of involuntary manslaughter and multiple counts of reckless endangerment. One issue in our inquiry was whether the police officer\u2019s conduct \u201cconstituted a gross and wanton deviation from reasonable conduct\u201d such that would support the reckless endangerment convictions. <em>Albrecht, </em>336 Md. at 487-88, 649 A.2d at 341. We reaffirmed our holding in <em>Minor, </em>explaining that the trier of fact is to measure the accused\u2019s conduct against that of \u201can ordinary prudent citizen similarly situated.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We ultimately held, under the objective standard, that there was sufficient evidence to uphold the trial court\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">From the foregoing, we glean two points that are of particular significance to the case at hand. First, it is clear from our case law that the legislature enacted \u00a7 12A-2 to deter or inhibit behavior. The statute criminalizes reckless behavior that creates a substantial risk of death or serious bodily harm. Second, to evaluate whether the behavior is reckless under \u00a7 12A-2, the trier of fact must evaluate the defendant\u2019s conduct from the standpoint of an ordinary, law-abiding citizen under similar circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">With these points in mind, we come to the ultimate inquiry in this case: whether self-defense is appropriate to be judicially recognized as a defense to a charge of general reckless endangerment. For reasons we shall explain below, we hold that when a defendant is charged with the statutory crime of reckless endangerment under \u00a7 12A-2(a)(l) and evidence is presented to generate an issue of common law perfect self-defense, the defendant is entitled to have the jury instructed regarding the application of self-defense to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>charge of reckless endangerment, assuming the other necessary instructional elements are in place.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">In murder and assault contexts, a person who protects himself or herself from an imminent attack is excused from the criminal liability that his or her defense may create. <em>Dykes v. State, </em>319 Md. 206, 210-11, 571 A.2d 1251, 1254 (1990); <em>Bussie, </em>115 Md.App. at 347, 693 A.2d at 60; <em>Corbin, </em>94 Md.App. at 28-29, 614 A.2d at 1332; <em>Bryant, </em>83 Md.App. at 246, 574 A.2d at 33. Although we do not encourage people to defend themselves when they have the time and the ability to get help from a law enforcement authority or retreat to safety, our law does not dictate that a person stand idly by and become a victim of assaultive aggression. <em>Bryant, </em>83 Md.App. at 246, 574 A.2d at 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">In this case, the State charged Petitioner with attempted second degree murder, attempted voluntary manslaughter, first degree assault, four counts of second degree assault, and four counts of reckless endangerment. The charges stemmed from the series of actions taken by Petitioner at Adventure World. Petitioner\u2019s evidence generated the issue of self-defense, but the trial judge instructed the jury on self-defense only as it related to the murder and assault charges. We cannot reconcile the conflict between potentially excusing conduct based on common law self-defense to charges of attempted murder and assault while not making available a similar defense to the statutory reckless endangerment charges. Therefore, we shall recognize, pursuant to \u00a7 12A-3, the appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>cability of common law self-defense to the statutory crime of reckless endangerment under \u00a7 12A-2(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">In every reckless endangerment case where the fact finder believes the evidence generating self-defense, the fact finder is foreclosed from finding the three elements of reckless endangerment. A required element of reckless endangerment is that a reasonable person would not have engaged in the conduct at issue in the case. <em>See Minor, </em>326 Md. at 443, 605 A.2d at 141. In every case where a defendant shows that his or her actions were taken in an honest and reasonable belief that he or she was in imminent danger of serious bodily harm from an assaultive attack, and used no more force than necessary in light of the attack, as matter of logic, it cannot be said that the defendant engaged in conduct that a reasonable person would have abstained from under the circumstances. As the elements of self-defense necessarily negate a required element of reckless endangerment, a self-defense instruction, if generated, is relevant to a charge of reckless endangerment.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Our holding today comports with the policy underlying \u00a7 12A-2. The General Assembly obviously enacted the reckless endangerment statute to deter reckless conduct. <em>Minor, </em>85 Md.App. at 314, 583 A.2d at 1106. The test that we use to determine if a defendant\u2019s conduct was reckless is whether the conduct, viewed objectively, constitutes a gross departure'from the type of conduct that an law-abiding citizen would observe under similar circumstances. <em>Albrecht, </em>336 Md. at 501, 649 A.2d at 348. Viewed objectively, an act taken in self-preservation, that otherwise satisfies all the elements of self-defense, is not a gross departure from the conduct of a law-abiding citizen under the circumstances. Rather, reasonable steps taken to avoid death or serious injury to one\u2019s self are justifiable under our law. <em>Dykes, </em>319 Md. at 210-11, 571 A.2d at 1254; <em>Faulkner, </em>301 Md. at 485, 483 A.2d at 761. The legislature sought to deter reckless behavior. It did not intend expressly to abrogate the common law right of a person to defend himself or herself when faced with an imminent, assaultive attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENTS OF THE Circuit Court FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY AS TO THE RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT CONVICTIONS AND REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL ON THE RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT COUNTS ONLY; COSTS TO BE PAID BY PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b516-6\">.
