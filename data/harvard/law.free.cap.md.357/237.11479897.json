In addition, the proposed amendment would have required the removal of any previously installed speed bump within one year of the amendment\u2019s effective date, unless seven of the nine county council members approved the retention of the bump subsequent to a public hearing on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">On September 9, 1998, Douglas Mitchell and several other individuals filed in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. The plaintiffs alleged that the charter amendment proposed by Save Our Streets was unconstitutional and that, therefore, the Board of Election Supervisors should be enjoined from placing the amendment on the general election ballot. The case was tried before the Circuit Court on September 22, 1998. At the conclusion of the trial, the Circuit Court declared that the \u201cproposed Speed Bump Amendment\u201d was \u201ccontrary to Article XI-A of the Maryland Constitution\u201d and enjoined the Board of Election Supervisors from placing the proposed amendment on the general election ballot. Save Our Streets and the Board of Election Supervisors immediately noted appeals to the Court of Special Appeals. On September 23, 1998, prior to any proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals, this Court issued a writ of certiorari. <em>Save Our Streets v. Mitchell, </em>351 Md. 284, 718 A.2d 233 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">On August 10, 1998, an organization named Friends of Harford County, Inc., submitted to the Board of Supervisors of Elections of Harford County a petition to place a proposed amendment to the Harford County Charter on the 1998 general election ballot.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Board of Election Supervisors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>reviewed the petition and found that it contained the requisite number of signatures. The proposed amendment would have added new sections pertaining to land-use planning and zoning, to be numbered \u00a7\u00a7 710 and 711 of Article VII of the county charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The proposed new \u00a7 710, entitled \u201cAdequate Public Facilities,\u201d would have established various adequacy standards for \u201cincreased or more intensive use or development of public and/or private property\u201d in the County. To implement these standards, \u00a7 710 would have imposed a one-year moratorium on approval by the County of any development proposal. The moratorium would have been comprehensive, including, <em>inter </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number><em>alia, </em>prohibitions on the issuance of building permits and grading permits as well as approval of subdivision plats and site plans. After the one-year moratorium would have expired, \u00a7 710 would have prohibited any development that did not meet the adequacy standards. These standards concerned school capacity for residential development and capacity regarding roads, police, fire, and emergency medical response services, and recreational facilities and public open space for both residential and commercial development. Section 710 would have permitted exemptions to its limitations if a proponent of development could prove, by clear and convincing evidence,' that the proposed development would \u201cnot impact or affect the adequacy standards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The proposed new \u00a7 711 would have granted standing, in any proceeding involving zoning, land \u25a0 use, development or construction, to any community association representing property owners who own property within two miles of any property involved in a proceeding and to any non-profit corporation in the County formed to represent the interests of citizens relating to zoning, land use, or development. In addition, proposed \u00a7 711 would have entitled any such community association or non-profit corporation which prevailed in a proceeding to be reimbursed by the County for attorneys\u2019 and experts\u2019 fees. To provide funds for such reimbursement, \u00a7 711 would have required the County Executive and Council to levy fees on the issuance of concept plans, preliminary subdivision plans, and grading and building permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The proposed charter amendment was forwarded to the Harford County Council for the Council to decide on the language of the ballot question which would describe both sections of the amendment. On August 17, 1998, the Council voted for the specific wording to be used on the ballot. The approved language for the ballot question differed in several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>respects from the original draft prepared for the Council by an assistant county attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Two actions were filed in the Circuit Court for Harford County on September 18, 1998, challenging the propriety of placing the proposed charter amendment on the general election ballot. The first was a petition for a writ of mandamus filed by the Friends of Harford County, which alleged that the ballot description of the proposed amendment was misleading to the public and that the Council should be compelled to reinstate the original language prepared by an assistant county attorney. The second was an action for a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief filed by the Harford County Chamber of Commerce and several other plaintiffs against the Board of Election Supervisors, the County Council, and the County. The Chamber of Commerce alleged that the proposed charter amendment was invalid under Article XI-A of the Maryland Constitution and should not be placed on the general election ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The trial of both cases was held in the Circuit Court on September 22, 1998, at which time the court granted appellant Grace Hiter\u2019s motion to intervene as a party defendant in the action filed by the Chamber of Commerce. Ms. Hiter was coordinator of the petition drive for the Friends of Harford County and chairman of the Ballot Issue Committee organized to support the placement of the proposed amendment on the general election ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The Circuit Court on September 23, 1998, issued an extensive declaratory judgment, declaring that proposed \u00a7\u00a7 710 and 711 were \u201clegislative in nature\u201d and therefore could not validly be included in the Harford County Charter. This declaration rendered moot the action filed by the Friends of Harford County to reinstate the ballot language as originally drafted. The Circuit Court\u2019s declaratory judgment, however, went on to discuss and rule upon the question of whether the Friends of Harford County would have had standing to maintain its action if the action were not moot. In addition to the declaratory judgment, the Circuit Court issued two orders. First, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>enjoined the Board of Election Supervisors from placing the proposed charter amendment on the ballot. Second, it dismissed as moot the action filed by the Friends of Harford County. On September 24, 1998, Ms. Hiter timely noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and, on the same day, this Court issued a writ of certiorari. <em>Hiter v. Harford County Chamber of Commerce, </em>351 Md. 284, 718 A.2d 233 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The oral arguments in both the Montgomery County and the Harford County appeals were heard by this Court on September 29, 1998. At the conclusion of oral arguments, we issued an order affirming the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. We also issued an order affirming that portion of the judgment of the Circuit Court for Harford County which enjoined the Board of Election Supervisors of Harford County from placing on the ballot the proposed \u00a7\u00a7 710 and 711 charter amendment. We now shall set forth the reasons for these orders, and we shall dispose of the remainder of the appeal in the Harford County cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">The plaintiffs attacked the proposed charter amendments in Montgomery and Harford Counties on essentially the same grounds. The plaintiffs argued that the proposed amendments contained legislative schemes and thus were not proper charter material under Article XI-A of the Maryland Constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Relying on <em>Board v. Smallwood, </em>327 Md. 220, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>608 A.2d 1222 (1992), <em>Griffith v. Wakefield, </em>298 Md. 881, 470 A.2d 345 (1984), and <em>Cheeks v. Cedlair Corp., </em>287 Md. 595, 415 A.2d 255 (1980), the plaintiffs asserted that a charter amendment must address the \u201cform and structure\u201d of county government. They argued that a proposed charter amendment which is essentially local legislation in disguise exceeds the power of the voters to amend their county charter because the Maryland Constitution does not permit voters to initiate local legislation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>The defendants, relying upon <em>Smallwood, </em>argue that charter amendments placing limits on governmental powers address the form and structure of county government and are valid under Article XI-A of the Constitution. They contend that the proposed amendments here involved place limitations upon governmental powers and, therefore, constitute proper charter material under our opinion in the <em>Smallwood </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">This Court has \u201crepeatedly explained that a county charter is equivalent to a constitution.\u201d <em>Smallwood, </em>327 Md. at 237, 608 A.2d at 1230. <em>See Haub v. Montgomery County, </em>353 Md. 448, 450, 727 A.2d 369, 370 (1999); <em>Bd. of Election Laws v. Talbot County, </em>316 Md. 332, 341, 558 A.2d 724, 728 (1989); <em>Griffith v. Wakefield, supra, </em>298 Md. at 385, 470 A.2d at 347-348; <em>County Exec., Prince Geo\u2019s Co. v. Doe, </em>291 Md. 676, 680, 436 A.2d 459, 461 (1981); <em>Cheeks v. Cedlair Corp., supra, </em>287 Md. at 606, 415 A.2d at 261; <em>Ritchmount Partnership v. Board, </em>283 Md. 48, 58, 388 A.2d 523, 530 (1978), and cases there cited. Therefore, the \u201cbasic function\u201d of a charter is \u201cto distribute power among the various agencies of government, and between the government and the people who have delegated that power to their government.\u201d <em>Smallwood, </em>327 Md. at 237, 608 A.2d at 1230. As Chief Judge Murphy stated for the Court in <em>Cheeks, </em>287 Md. at 607, 415 A.2d at 261:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">\u201cA charter is thus a permanent document intended to provide a broad organizational framework establishing the form and structure of government in pursuance of which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>political subdivision is to be governed and local laws enacted. It is the organic, the fundamental law....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">Although \u00a7 6 of Art. XI-A of the Maryland Constitution reserves to the people of a charter county the power to amend the charter, this power is limited by \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3. <em>See Cheeks, </em>287 Md. at 608-610, 415 A.2d at 262. Section 2 specifies that the General Assembly shall, \u201cby public general law,\u201d grant \u201cexpress powers\u201d to the governments of charter counties and that such powers \u201cshall not be enlarged or extended by any charter formed under the provisions\u201d of Article XI-A.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 3 provides that each charter county shall have a county council, which is \u201can elective legislative body in which shall be vested the law-making power\u201d of the county. Section 3 of Article XI-A goes on to state that the county council shall have \u201cfull power to enact local laws ... upon all matters covered by the express powers granted\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 2. Therefore, in <em>Cheeks, </em>and again in <em>Griffith, </em>we \u201ccontrasted\u201d the ability to adopt or amend a charter, which is the \u201cpower to organize a local government, reserved to the people of a charter county ... under Article XI-A,\u201d with the power to enact legislation. <em>Griffith, </em>298 Md. at 385, 470 A.2d at 348. In <em>Cheeks, </em>we explained in detail that the county council alone, and not the voters of the county, has the power to initiate local legislation. 287 Md. at 612-614, 415 A.2d at 264-265. Furthermore, we held that such legislative power cannot be exercised by means of an amendment to the charter (287 Md. at 607, 415 A.2d at 261):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">\u201c[A] charter amendment within the context of Art. XI-A is necessarily limited in substance to amending the form or structure of government initially established by adoption of the charter. A charter amendment, therefore, differs in its fundamental character from a simple legislative enactment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Its content cannot transcend its limited office and be made to serve or function as a vehicle though which to adopt local legislation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Accordingly, in both <em>Cheeks </em>and <em>Griffith, </em>we invalidated \u201cattempts by the voters to initiate detailed legislation through the guise of charter amendments.\u201d <em>Smallwood, </em>327 Md. at 289, 608 A.2d at 1231. In <em>Smallwood, </em>however, we upheld those portions of proposed charter amendments that were sufficiently fundamental in nature to be included in a charter. A brief review of the facts of each case illustrates the distinction between proposed charter amendments which delineate the basic form and structure of the local government and are, therefore, proper charter material, and those proposed charter amendments which are legislative in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\"><em>Cheeks </em>involved a proposed amendment to the Baltimore City Charter that would have established a tenant-landlord commission to implement a comprehensive system of rent control.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The proposed charter amendment prescribed \u201cin lengthy detail, the powers and duties of the Commission in administering the system of rent control.\u201d <em>Cheeks, </em>287 Md. at 602, 415 A.2d at 258. The Court held that the amendment was \u201cessentially legislative in character\u201d as it constituted an exercise of governmental power \u201cin all respects similar to the enactment of a local law.\u201d <em>Cheeks, </em>287 Md. at 608, 415 A.2d at 262. Thus, we held that the proposed amendment was not proper charter material; rather, it was an attempt to \u201cdivest\u201d the City Council of \u201cits acknowledged ... power to legislate on the subject of rent control.\u201d <em>Cheeks, </em>287 Md. at 609, 415 A.2d at 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">In <em>Griffith, </em>we invalidated a proposed charter amendment to create a comprehensive system of collective bargaining and binding arbitration for Baltimore County and a single group of county employees, firefighters. The proposed amendment set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>forth a \u201ccomplete and specifically detailed legislative scheme\u201d that left \u201cnothing for the determination of the ... County Council.\u201d 298 Md. at 386, 388, 470 A.2d at 348, 349. The \u201cbinding arbitration feature of the amendment\u201d would have \u201cdivest[ed] the elected officials of Baltimore County of any discretion in reaching an agreement on \u2018the wages, benefits, hours and working conditions\u2019 of the fire fighters.\u201d 298 Md. at 388, 470 A.2d at 349 (quoting the proposed amendment). The Court held that the amendment was invalid because, like the proposed amendment in <em>Cheeks, </em>it was \u201c \u2018essentially legislative in character.\u2019 \u201d 298 Md. at 388, 470 A.2d at 349, quoting <em>Cheeks, </em>287 Md. at 608, 415 A.2d at 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">In <em>Smallwood, </em>however, this Court upheld the facial validity of proposed charter amendments that would have placed a percentage cap on the amount by which the Anne Arundel and Baltimore County Councils could raise the local property taxes in their respective counties. In explaining that such amendments were not essentially legislative in nature, we relied on a distinction that we had made previously in <em>Griffith </em>between proposed charter amendments that \u201c \u2018authorize, or preclude, specified types of enactments by legislative bodies,\u2019 \u201d and thus are ordinarily valid, and those that constitute specific legislative schemes, and thus are ordinarily invalid. 327 Md. at 239, 608 A.2d at 1231, quoting 298 Md. at 389, 470 A.2d at 350. Unlike the proposed amendments in <em>Cheeks </em>and <em>Griffith, </em>the proposed amendments in <em>Smallwood </em>were \u201cnot back-door attempts by the voters\u201d to \u201cenact detailed legislation.\u201d 327 Md. at 240, 608 A.2d at 1232. The Court noted that they did not \u201cdivest the county councils of the ability to set the property tax rates.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Instead, the proposed amendments \u201cwould have merely precluded a particular type of enactment by the legislative body.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The <em>Smallwood </em>opinion also pointed out that \u201c[ljimitations imposed by the people on their government are fundamental elements of a constitution.\u201d 327 Md. at 237-238, 608 A.2d at 1230-1231, and authorities there cited. The proposed amendments in <em>Small-wood, </em>were fundamental in nature because they \u201cdirectly involved the relationship between the people and the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>ment by limiting the power of the government to tax.\u201d 327 Md. at 237, 608 A.2d at 1230. Accordingly, we held \u201cthat a provision in a county charter placing restrictions upon the county council\u2019s revenue raising authority is a fundamental aspect of the form and structure of government and thus is proper charter material.\u201d 327 Md. at 241, 608 A.2d at 1232.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">It is important to stress that our holding in <em>Smallwood </em>was precisely phrased. We did not state that any proposed charter amendment which is articulated as a limitation on governmental power is valid under Article XI-A. Nor did we state that the proposed amendments addressed in <em>Smallwood </em>were constitutional merely because they were expressed as limitations on governmental power.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Rather, they were constitutional limitations because they pertained to \u201ca fundamental aspect of the form and structure of government.\u201d 327 Md. at 241, 608 A.2d at 1232. The distinction between the fundamental, general nature of a charter and the specificity characteristic of county council legislative enactments authorized by a charter framework, is essential to the system of representative democracy provided for in Article XI-A of the Maryland Constitution. County charters are, in effect, constitutions for county governments, and Article XI-A contemplates that they should reflect the broad outlines of governmental powers and limitations. Under Article XI-A, the enactment of specific legislation is left to the elected legislative bodies.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>The proposed charter amendments in the case at bar are not analogous to the percentage tax caps upheld in <em>Smallwood </em>because they do not impose general and fundamental limitations on a governmental power such as the power to tax. Instead, they are analogous to the proposed charter amendments invalidated in <em>Cheeks </em>and <em>Griffith </em>because they amount to specific legislative schemes. The appellants Save Our Streets and Hiter seem to suggest that the <em>Smallwood </em>decision created an exception to the principles set forth in <em>Cheeks </em>and <em>Griffith. </em>To the contrary, the percentage tax cap provisions upheld in <em>Smallwood </em>exemplify the distinction emphasized in <em>Griffith </em>between a legislative scheme, which may only be enacted by the county council, and an authorization or preclusion of a county council\u2019s power to enact a type of legislation, which is proper charter material.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">Although both <em>Cheeks </em>and <em>Griffith </em>involved legislative schemes that were lengthy and detailed, thereby furnishing some indication of ordinary legislation under the guise of charter amendments, nevertheless the length and detail of a proposed charter amendment are not dispositive as to whether the proposed amendment constitutes legislation or proper charter material. An important consideration is the degree to which the county council retains discretion and control regarding an area under its authority pursuant to Article XI-A of the Maryland Constitution. The charter amendments proposed by Save Our Streets and Hiter would as completely remove any meaningful exercise of discretion from the County Councils as would have the amendments in <em>Cheeks </em>and <em>Griffith.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>What this Court said about the proposed charter amendment in <em>Griffith, </em>is fully applicable to the proposed amendments in the cases at bar. We there explained (298 Md. at 389-390, 470 A.2d at 350):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">\u201cThe flaw in [the defendant\u2019s] argument is the failure to distinguish between \u2018authorization\u2019 on the one hand and a detailed local enactment on the other hand. It is common for constitutions or charters to authorize, or preclude, specified types of enactments by legislative bodies. This is quite different from a charter itself containing all of the ... provisions concerning the subject.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">\u201cIf the proposed Baltimore County charter amendment had merely <em>authorized </em>the Baltimore County Council to enact a system of binding arbitration with regard to the compensation of Baltimore County employees, and if, pursuant to that authorization, the Baltimore County Council had exercised its discretion to enact <em>an ordinance </em>containing provisions similar to those in the proposed charter amendment now before us, the present case would be distinguishable from <em>Cheeks. </em>... In the present case, however, the proposed charter amendment did not authorize the County Council to enact binding arbitration legislation for county employees. It did not authorize any decisions by the constitutional legislative body. Instead, under the proposal, the charter itself would contain all of the law on the subject, and the Baltimore County Council would be deprived of all decision-making authority concerning the subject.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">As pointed out in the above-quoted language, an authorization or preclusion of a type of legislative enactment allows for the council\u2019s exercise of discretion and, thus, is ordinarily proper charter material. In <em>Smallwood, </em>the percentage cap provisions imposed a broad limit on the County Councils\u2019 power to levy property taxes. As explained previously, the provisions did not set specific tax rates but merely imposed a ceiling under which the county councils could exercise their discretion. Moreover, the provisions did not direct to what particular purposes property tax revenues would be expended. Similarly, if the proposed charter amendment in <em>Griffith </em>had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>simply authorized the Baltimore County Council to enact specific legislation regarding collective bargaining and binding arbitration between the County and the firefighters\u2019 union, the proposed amendment would not have been invalid under Article XI-A of the Maryland Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"> The proposed charter amendments in the present cases are neither broad authorizations nor similar to general limits on a county\u2019s taxing power. The proposed Speed Bump amendment would narrowly mandate that the County Council could not authorize new speed bumps and must remove existing speed bumps. Although Hiter argues that \u00a7 710 of the proposed amendment to the Harford County Charter \u201cimplicitly\u201d authorizes the County Council to enact legislation to establish adequate facilities standards, we fail to understand where or how such authorization is made. Section 710 repeatedly refers to the \u201cadequacy standards\u201d explicitly \u201cestablished\u201d and \u201cdefined\u201d by its own paragraphs 3 and 4. For example, the purpose of the moratorium on development described in paragraph 1 is to \u201cimplement the adequacy standards established\u201d by paragraphs 3 and 4. Thus, the amendment proposed by Hiter, like that proposed by Save Our Streets, leaves virtually no room for an exercise of discretion by the County Council. As the Circuit Court for Harford County correctly concluded, \u201c[i]n reality, the provisions of Section 710 are an attenuated form of an adequate public facilities ordinance that, by its terms, is intended to impose various limitations on prospective developments. As such, it is legislative in nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">As stated previously, our order of September 29, 1998, affirmed the declaratory judgment issued and the injunctive relief granted by the Circuit Court for Montgomery County in the case involving the proposed \u201cSpeed Bump\u201d amendment.

Smallwood, </em>327 Md. 220, 234-236, 608 A.2d 1222, 1229-1230 (1992), we held that the voters of a county, whether by original charter provision or amendment, cannot expressly reserve to themselves the power to initiate legislation, even though they can submit to referendum legislation which has been duly enacted by a county council. Although the processes of initiative and referendum may both require a petition to submit legislation to the electorate, they are distinct with respect to the role they assign to elected government: \"Initiative refers to the process by which the electorate petitions for and votes on a proposed law. Referendum is the process by which legislation passed by the governing body is submitted to the electorate for approval or disapproval.\u201d <em>Smallwood, </em>327 Md. at 232, n. 6, 608 A.2d at 1228, n. 6, and authorities there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">The power to initiate local legislation is repugnant to Art. XI-A, \u00a7 3, of the Maryland Constitution, which vests a charter county\u2019s \"full\u201d lawmaking power in the county council. Under the Maryland Constitution, however, county voters do have a right to reserve to themselves the power to petition for a referendum on legislation previously enacted by a county council. <em>See Ritchmount Partnership v.

XI-A conferred on the citizens of Anne Arundel County the right to reserve to themselves by express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>charter provision the power to refer legislation enacted by their County Council). In <em>Smallwood, </em>we reiterated the distinction between the powers of referendum and initiative (327 Md. at 235, 608 A.2d at 1229, quoting <em>Cheeks, </em>287 Md. at 613, 415 A.2d at 264):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-8\">\" 'The powers of referendum and initiative, though each may affect the form or structure of local government, are otherwise distinctly different. Under the referendum power, the elective legislative body, consistent with \u00a7 3, continues to be the primary legislative organ, for it has formulated and approved the legislative enactment referred to the people.

Most of these express powers are enumerated in Maryland Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol., 1999 Supp.), Art. 25A, \u00a7 5, commonly known as the Express Powers Act. Of particular relevance to the case at bar are the powers to regulate the condition and use of roads <em>(See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 5(K) &amp; (T)) and to enact local laws pertaining to land-use planning and zoning (\u00a7\u00a7 5(U),(X), (BB), and (EE)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b354-9\">.

Virtually any legislative scheme could be phrased as a limitation on governmental power. For example, the proposed charter amendment which this Court invalidated in <em>Griffith </em>could have stated that Baltimore County would be prohibited from resolving contract disputes between the county government and the firefighters union by .any means other than by the binding arbitration scheme set forth in the amendment. Merely expressing the binding arbitration scheme as a limitation on the County Council\u2019s power would not save it from being essentially legislative in nature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b356-7\">. As Chief Justice John Marshall emphasized early in our nation\u2019s history, a constitution necessarily provides a broad framework which both empowers and limits a legislature in its enactment of specific laws <em>(M'Culloch v. </em>Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 407, 4 L.Ed. 579, 601 (1819)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number><em>\"A </em>constitution, to contain an accurate detail of all the subdivisions of which its great powers will admit, and of all the means by which they may he carried into execution, would partake of the prolixity of a legal code, and could scarcely be embraced by the human mind.
