She presents two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">1. Does a party seeking an award of sole custody place their mental health at issue, so as to require the disclosure of privileged mental health records?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">2. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in requiring the disclosure of wife\u2019s privileged mental health records?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">The parties were married in 1985. They resided in New York for two years, then moved to Talbot County in 1987. Petitioner was, at the time of the marriage, a paralegal; respondent was then, and is now, an attorney. At the time of their marriage, petitioner had a history of psychiatric treatment. Shortly after the start of their marriage, petitioner, at respondent\u2019s request, continued in psychiatric treatment. In 1990, the parties had a son. They separated in 1991, reconciled in 1993, and in that year had another son. During the summer and fall of 1994, both parties saw a psychiatrist jointly, Dr. Richard Greenbaum. They separated again in 1995, with respondent moving to Baltimore and living with his secretary and petitioner remaining in the Talbot County home with the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">At the time of their 1995 separation, they prepared and executed an agreement that, as relevant here, provided for joint guardianship, care and custody of the children, but with petitioner to have primary residential care of the children. Thereafter, petitioner filed a complaint for divorce, and then an amended complaint for divorce in which she sought sole custody of the children. In his answer to petitioner\u2019s amended complaint, respondent sought sole custody of the children. Accordingly, by the time of the hearing below, both parties sought sole legal custody of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">At the trial level, respondent sought discovery of treatment records relating to petitioner\u2019s past mental health treatment. At a deposition, respondent attempted to question petitioner about her past mental health treatment. She refused to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>answer the questions, invoking the psychotherapist-patient privilege contained in Maryland Code (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.), section 9 \u2014 109(b) of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Respondent then filed a Motion to Compel Discovery. Petitioner answered with a Motion for Protective Order, and a Motion to Quash the subpoenas directed to her past and present treating mental health psychiatrists, psychologists, and counselors.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The circuit court denied, in part, respondent\u2019s Motion to Compel Discovery, initially reserving, however, the issue of whether it would permit subpoenas, which respondent had caused to be issued to certain of petitioner\u2019s health care providers, to be utilized to require the production of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>records to respondent. The trial court, in its ruling, noted that the scope of the subpoenas was limited to current records in the possession of the providers that \u201care reasonably related to matters addressing [petitioner\u2019s] current parental fitness for custody of the Parties[\u2019] two minor children.\u201d As to these records, it directed that the post-1994 records be delivered to the court under seal for the court\u2019s inspection <em>in camera, </em>with access initially denied to all parties. It also directed that no other documents listed on the subpoenas needed to be produced at that time. Additionally, it found that petitioner had not waived the psychiatrist/psychologist-patient privilege by attempting to obtain sole custody of the children.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Respondent noted an interlocutory appeal in respect to that portion of the trial court\u2019s ruling precluding discovery of all of the wife\u2019s mental health records. In the meantime, petitioner had complied with the trial court\u2019s order by submitting the required records under seal with the trial court. Respondent\u2019s interlocutory appeal was dismissed by the Court of Special Appeals as premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Approximately a year later,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the trial court, as we have indicated, modified its previous order and required the production of all of the petitioner\u2019s mental health records from January of 1995 forward. Petitioner produced those records several days before the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">A separate Motion for Psychological Evaluation was filed by respondent after the trial court\u2019s initial ruling that certain of petitioner\u2019s records be submitted <em>in camera. </em>Petitioner responded to the motion for a psychological examination of the family by requesting it be denied, because, in her opinion, the trial court had already ordered the production of sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>records, which made a further evaluation unnecessary. She also proffered that, should a review of the records not be sufficient, the trial court had the inherent power to require another evaluation. She stated in her answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-4\">1. This matter has previously been resolved pursuant to Plaintiffs Motion for a Protective Order ... in which this Honorable Court ordered that certain records requested by the Defendant and pertaining to Plaintiffs mental health be produced for review, in camera. If, based upon a review of those records, this Honorable Court deemed it necessary and appropriate to require an independent medical/psychological evaluation, same would be forthcoming, pursuant to this Court\u2019s inherent ability to so order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">The trial court denied the Motion for Psychological Evaluation. After reviewing the records it had required to be submitted <em>in camera, </em>the trial court did not revisit the issue of a psychological evaluation, nor did respondent either then, or after the trial court had reviewed the initial records and ordered <em>all </em>of the post-1994 records to be furnished to respondent, renew his request for such an evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">At the conclusion of the merits hearing, the trial court awarded sole legal custody of the children to petitioner, saying: \u201cSole legal custody is awarded to Mrs. Laznovsky primarily because both of the parties testified that they are unable to communicate.\u201d Respondent appealed that decision (along with several other rulings of the trial court) to the Court of Special Appeals.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>As relevant to the issues presented to us, respondent asserted to the Court of Special Appeals that petitioner, by claiming to be a fit and proper person to have sole legal custody of the children, had placed her mental condition at issue and thus had waived the psychiatrist/patient privilege created by Maryland Code (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.), section 9-109 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article. The Court of Special Appeals agreed and, in a 2-1 decision, reversed the circuit court on that issue. It held, in relevant part, that as to the privilege granted in respect to mental health treatment records by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>section 9 \u2014 109(b)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and by Maryland Code (1974,1994 RepLVol., 1998 Cum.Supp.), section 4-307 of the Health-General Article, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-5\">These rights must be balanced against the best interests of the children in a contested custody case. Fitness is the dominant consideration in a custody case; the mental and emotional state of a parent is most material and relevant ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">... [W]ide latitude must be given in discovery to allow a litigant to develop his or her case. The trial court\u2019s failure to allow the appellee to adduce the status of the appellee\u2019s mental health, her diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, and its effect on her ability to parent the children and serve as the sole custodial parent, constituted an abuse of discretion. While it is rare to reverse a trial court on a discovery ruling, where a party\u2019s case was prejudiced by the failure to produce records that would clearly develop a relevant line of cross-examination and the basis for an expert\u2019s opinion as to the fitness of a party to be a custodial parent, it constituted reversible abuse of discretion)[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] [Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">We disagree and reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>II. Privilege</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">In this review, we must consider whether a statutory privilege is applicable in this custody case. In that process, we must consider the balancing that occurs, or may occur, when a legislatively created privilege appears to conflict with a court-created standard for determinations in custody matters. Our first step is to look at the privilege statutes. What is now Maryland Code (1974, 1998 RepLVol.), section 9-109(b) of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was initially adopted as 1966 Maryland Laws, Chapter 503. Senate Bill 118, the bill which became Chapter 503, as initially filed and presented, did not include any exception permitting a trial court to compel disclosure of mental health records in child custody cases, although it did have other exceptions, including one for when a person places his or her mental condition in issue. The child custody exception was amended into Senate Bill 118 prior to its passage. As initially <em>enacted, </em>it contained specific language that permitted a trial judge in a custody proceeding to compel the disclosure of otherwise privileged mental health records, if the judge believed that such disclosure was \u201cnecessary to a proper determination of the issue of custody.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This prior exception is in accord with the position now taken by respondent and the majority opinion of the Court of Special Appeals below: that if a trial judge, in the exercise of his or her discretion, determines that such records are necessary in order to determine custody matters, then the privilege may be deemed to be overcome by the trial court, on its own motion or on motion of an opposing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Since the original enactment of the law, additional exceptions have been added. In 1976, in House Bill 1, the Legislature created another exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>(II) After the patient\u2019s death, his mental condition is introduced by any party claiming or defending through or as a beneficiary of the patient[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">1976 Md. Laws, Chap. 363. In 1981, another exception was clarified when House Bill 766 was enacted, specifying that the privilege is waived when authorized representatives of the patient make claims against certain mental health care providers. <em>See </em>1981 Md. Laws, Chap. 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">There has been only one instance where an exception, previously a part of this privilege statute, has been removed or repealed. It relates to the issue squarely before this Court. The exception to the privilege for child custody matters stayed in the law until 1977. At that time, Senate Bill 90 was passed, repealing and reenacting section 9-109 of the privilege statute. Its title stated that it was \u201cF[or] the purpose of eliminating an exception to the privilege to refuse to disclose communications relating to a patient\u2019s mental or emotional disorder as related to a psychiatrist or a psychologist.\u201d 1977 Md. Laws, Chap. 685. Senate Bill 90 removed the exception permitting trial judges to compel disclosure in child custody matters. This was the only change provided in Senate Bill 90. The child custody exception was not, therefore, inadvertently omitted as part of some general attempt at recodification. It was specifically repealed. The repeal of the exception was an essential element, and the only purpose, of the bill. The legislative history of Senate Bill 90 confirms that its purpose was to ensure the confidentiality of psychiatrist-patient treatment communications and records, <em>even in child custody cases. </em>That legislative history permits no other reasonable inferences. The bill file, for instance, includes a Fiscal Note from the Department of Fiscal Services noting that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-7\">This bill removes from existing law concerning a patient[\u2019]s mental disorder as related to a psychiatrist or psychologist, an exception to the privilege to refuse disclosure of communications between patient and physician when custody of children is involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Additionally, handwritten summaries of the bill\u2019s effects are included in the bill file:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-5\">[Section] 9-109(b) Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings provides for the general privilege to refuse to testify as to communications between a patient and his psychiatrist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-6\">The single exception to this privilege is in [section] 9-109(c) which provides that a judge may compel disclosure in custody cases. SB 90 attempts to delete this exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-7\">Purpose for this bill is to eliminate circumstances where psychiatrists are called into court, thereby eliminating the therapeutic relationship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-8\">Examples are: patient with severe mental disorder and collateral custody battle may be in position to realize that psychiatric relationship will be disclosed; thereby closing possibility of further treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-9\">Dr. Jonas Rappeport, Chief Medical Officer advises that when [General] Assembly enacted psych, privilege in 1966, Model Connecticut law upon which this [section] is based did not have this exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-10\">Judge Liss stated in letter re 90 that to compel disclosure is \u201cnot fair either to the professional person involved nor to his patient, who should be able to speak frankly without fear of disclosure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">The National Organization for Women, in a position letter to the committee, dated January 27,1977, stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADp\">The National Organization for Women supports Senate Bill 90, concerning Psychiatrist \u2014 Patient Privilege.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-12\">The marital discord which precedes divorce and custody actions is often of such an emotional nature as to lead one or both parties to seek professional psychiatric counselling in attempting to restructure their lives. It is the dependent spouse, more often the wife, who faces the greater changes during this period, and who views the prospects of economic and emotional independence perhaps for the first time. The desire for psychiatric consultation during this transition is understandable, and it is our feeling that such efforts should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>not be used against one in custody proceedings, as they may be now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-5\">It is furthermore, deleterious to the therapeutic relationship, which must have as its basis trust and confidentiality, to know that a judge may compel disclosures of a most intimate nature, and that such disclosures may affect the outcome of a custody case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">More important, the Chairman of the Judicial Proceedings Committee, Senator J. Joseph Curran (now Attorney General of Maryland), addressed a letter dated January 20, 1977, to Judge Anselm Sodaro of the Supreme Bench of Baltimore, which invited comment from other judges. In his letter, Senator Curran stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-7\">At the Committee hearing on this bill, questions were posed as to how often in child custody cases does a judge compel disclosure. We understand the need to encourage a full and frank discussion between the patient and the psychiatrist, and want to enact laws to meet this end. However, I would very much like to receive opinions as to how often this information is needed in custody cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">Judge Solomon Liss, then a member of the Court of Special Appeals, wrote a letter, dated January 25, 1977, to the committee, replying, in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-9\">[I]n the eight years I spent on the trial bench, I never found it necessary to compel the testimony of a psychiatrist or psychologist in a child custody case. Of course, those of us on the Supreme Bench ... had available the services of ... Dr. Jonas Rappeport and his staff....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-10\">... I would be reluctant to urge compelled disclosure except as a last resort. Such an edict is not fair either to the professional person involved nor to his patient, who should be able to speak frankly without fear of disclosure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXe\">Judge Watts, replying to the letter from Senator Curran, stated in a letter dated January 26,1977:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-11\">For three years I presided in the Domestic Relations Court of Baltimore City. During the present term I hear domestic cases regularly in addition to my normal case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>assignment. On the basis of this experience, I can tell you that there have been very few occasions on which I have had to compel an individual to produce psychiatric information. In fact, I can recall only four or five cases where this was necessary. When an individual is under psychiatric treatment, he is usually willing to bring this information to the attention of the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Dr. Jonas R. Rappeport also responded to Senator Curran by letter dated January 24, 1977, stating in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVe\">As you know, I was involved in the development of the initial psychiatrist/psychologist privilege legislation and worked very strongly for its passage in the 60s. It was with reluctance that our committee of the Maryland Psychiatric Society accepted the child custody exception. However, because of general concerns about the entire concept of this special privilege, we recognized the need to go along with this amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-6\">In practice, since the passage of this original legislation, the child custody exception has caused some hardships. Several colleagues have reported to me the extreme difficulty that they have in working with parents in psychotherapy when the parent is made aware of the .fact that anything that they mention in the therapeutic sessions may be brought out in a custody proceedings if the judge feels that such information is germane to his decision. Just a few weeks ago I personally saw a patient for a consultation who currently has custody of his children and felt it necessary to warn him of the fact that anything that he told me might be revealed in court should the judge deem it necessary when and if there was an attempt to gain custody of his children by his former wife. As a result thereof he hesitated about accepting my recommendation for continued treatment with me although I am happy to report that he has accepted my recommendation for treatment and is seeing me. While his feeling was that he would have to take his chances, I have no way of knowing how much this threat of public exposure to the very sensitive psychiatrist/patient relationship will interfere with treatment. In the past I have known of one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>patient who has elected not to have treatment in view of this particular problem. Several other psychiatrists have reported to me that they feel that this exception to the psychiatrist/patient privilege does prevent very needy parents, that is, people in need of psychiatric treatment, from obtaining it and, therefore, in fact may eventually place the children at a disadvantage. If their parents cannot be \u201ccured\u201d, then the child continues to be exposed to an emotionally disturbed parent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-5\">While I recognize that custody decisions are exceedingly difficult ones for the court to make in that the judge needs all the help that he can obtain under such circumstances, I believe that such help can be obtained from other sources. No matter how honestly and openly a psychiatrist subpoenaed into court to testify about his relationship with his patient may wish to be, we can clearly understand that he may not either present or even know all of the information that might be available to independent examiners.... [W]e believe we have served the court very well by having the same psychiatrist and psychologist examine all parties in question to custody battles and thereby have an opportunity for a very well balanced view of the situation.... [W]e feel that we are much more capable of rendering an unbiased, overall view of the situation and presenting recommendations that are truly in the best interest of the child than we might be able to do should we be involved with only one parent whether it be a long term therapeutic relationship or merely an evaluation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\">For these reasons stated above I feel that the benefits to society of having confidential and privileged treatment available to troubled parents far outweighs the limitations placed upon the court by not having such information revealed against the parents\u2019 wishes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">It is clear to us that the Legislature was fully aware of the ramifications of the child custody exception amended into the statute during its original enactment. At the time the exception was repealed, with the information furnished and available to the Legislature through the proceedings of its commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>tee, it is evident that they were being asked to consider the balancing of the interests in the psychiatrist/psychologist-patient privilege with the need of the courts to have such information in assessing the best interests of the children in custody cases.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The psychiatrist/psychologist-patient privilege prevailed as the Legislature elected to remove the exception that had theretofore permitted the courts to hold the privilege inapplicable in child custody cases. Thus, the Legislature balanced the interests and made the determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Of some interest is the importance of confidentiality in other mental health treatment privilege statutes in which the Legislature has not included any exceptions for child custody cases, although it has created other exceptions. Maryland Code (1974, 1994 Repl.Vol., 1998 Cum.Supp.), section 4-307(h)(l)(v) of the Health-General Article provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-5\">(h) ... (1) A health care provider shall disclose a medical record without the authorization of a person in interest:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-6\">(v) In accordance with service of compulsory process or a discovery request, as permitted under \u00a7 9-109(d), \u00a7 9-109.1(d), or \u00a7 9-121(d) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, or as otherwise provided by law, to a court, an administrative tribunal, or a party to a civil court, administrative, or health claims arbitration proceeding....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2T\">Subsection 9-109(d) of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article, relating to the psychiatrist-patient privilege, is the exception provision under the statute we address in the case at bar. Subsection 9-109.1(d) relates to the patient-psychia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>trist mental health nursing specialist privilege; subsection 9-121(d) relates to exceptions in respect to a licensed social worker-client privilege. In none of the other statutes is there a child custody exception. At the time of their enactment, the same concerns expressed at the time of the enactment of 1977 Maryland Laws, Chapter 685 were expressed. Section 9-109.1 was enacted as 1990 Maryland Laws, Chapter 300. The bill file for that enactment indicates that the position of the Maryland Nurses\u2019 Association was made available to the Legislature in a letter dated January 17, 1999. The association said, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-5\">This is a Patients\u2019 Rights bill to ensure that the communication between a client and a psychiatric mental health nursing specialist has the full protection of privileged communication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-6\">The essence of this bill is not new. The precedent has been established in the following sections of the Annotated Code of Maryland (9-109) and (9-121)....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-7\">Passage of this bill would provide parity for clients of psychiatric-mental health nursing specialists with those of the other core mental health disciplines including psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-8\">Currently, citizens in Maryland being treated by psychiatric-mental health nursing specialists have had their records accessed in judicial proceedings without their consent. To say this places these clients at a gross disadvantage is an understatement. All citizens seeking psychiatric-mental health treatment should be assured that their client/provider communications are equally protected under the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">Even more relevant are some of the communications made available when section 9-121(d) was enacted by Senate Bill 420, just six years after the 1977 repeal of the child custody exception in section 9-109. 1983 Md. Laws, Chap. 531. The bill file contains several pertinent references. First, it contained the testimony of a licensed social worker, Torpley M. Richards, LCSW, which provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Several years ago a physician referred to me a man who was distressed by severe marital problems. This man and his wife had previously been in couples therapy but they had not been able to resolve their many differences. They decided to have a trial separation and to seek individual support during this difficult time. When Mr. A was referred to me for treatment, his wife, Mrs. A was referred to a psychiatrist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-5\">One year later, Mrs. A decided to file for divorce. She asked for sole custody of the couples\u2019 three children claiming that Mr. A was \u201cunfit\u201d to have custody. Mrs. A\u2019s lawyer was well aware that at this time social workers are not protected by law for privileged communication. Mrs. A\u2019s lawyer could have questioned me directly about confidences shared with me by Mr. A, under oath, in a court of law, without Mr. A\u2019s permission. At the same time, Mrs. A enjoyed the protection of privileged communication. Fortunately for Mr. A, this case never came to trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">In communications and testimony before the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, the same committee through which 1977 Maryland Laws, Chapter 685 had previously passed, other comments even more directly pointed out the importance of the privilege in child custody cases. A letter dated February 22, 1983, from the Administrator of the Family Counseling Services of Associated Catholic Charities, Inc., provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-7\">The protection of privileged communication is especially important in cases of separation and divorce, contested child custody ... suits, and employers seeking information on employees. A typical example of the protection privileged communication provides follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-8\">A mother, who was concerned about the effects of a recent separation on her children, sought counseling with our agency. Her husband, who was fighting the terms of the divorce settlement, sought information from Associated Catholic Charities which would prove her incompetence as a parent. In fact, this mother was seeking to help her children, who were suffering as a result of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>adversarial position of their parents. If we had been required to give information to this husband, the wife would have left counseling, and the children would have continued to suffer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-5\">For these reasons, Associated Catholic Charities supports SB 420.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">There was additional testimony on behalf of Associated Catholic Charities, Inc., by Ms. Cheryl Lynch, dated February 24, 1983:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-7\">This confidentiality is important in establishing the trust necessary for the client to reveal personal information in order to receive help.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-8\">As a family service agency, Catholic Charities serves approximately 300 families a month through its Counseling Services. The protection of privileged communication is especially important in cases of separation and divorce, contested child custody, and employers seeking information on employees. People who are struggling with difficult or emotional problems have to know that they can speak freely to a counselor with the understanding that the information they disclose is held in confidence. From these private disclosures, many people find relief from their suffering and help in resolving their difficulties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">It is clear that the issue of whether there should be an exception from mental health privilege statutes for child custody cases has repeatedly been presented to the Legislature since 1977. In fact, the need for the privilege in child custody cases has been proffered to the Legislature as an important, special reason for the necessity of the privilege. The Legislature, by enacting these subsequent privilege statutes, has not created any exemption for child custody cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">We emphasize again that we are not faced with a privilege statute that has always been silent as to whether a court could compel the production of otherwise confidential communications in child custody cases. The Maryland statute was originally enacted with a specific exception permitting a court to compel such information in such a circumstance, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>exception remained intact for eleven years. In 1977, addressing the concerns of the mental health profession, the Legislature repealed that provision. The intention of the Legislature is clear. It made a public policy choice not to exempt child custody cases from the scope of the privilege, and has continued to preserve the privilege even in child custody cases in its enactment of other privilege statutes in the mental health area.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Additionally, Maryland Code (1974, 1994 Repl.Vol., 1998 Cum.Supp.), section 4-302 of the Health-General Article provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 A health care provider shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOV\">(1) Keep the medical record of a patient or recipient confidential; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-9\">(2) Disclose the medical record only:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-10\">(i) As provided by this subtitle; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-11\">(ii) As otherwise provided by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-12\">Thereafter, there are several exceptions crafted in the Health-General Article. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1974, 1994 RepLVol., 1998 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 4-305, 4-306, 4-307. None contain a child custody exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-13\">As is clear from the legislative history above, the Legislature knows how to craft exceptions to confidentiality privileges. Section 9-109 itself contains several exceptions, as do section 9-109.1 and section 9-110, which deals with the ac-countani/client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-14\">Maryland Code (1974, 1998 RepLVol.), section 5-609 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article affords protection from causes of action for mental health providers when patients subsequently exhibit violent behavior, unless the provider \u201cknew of the patient\u2019s propensity for violence\u201d or the patient had indicated to the provider an intention to inflict injury on another. If the provider knows of the propensity, or the patient indicates the intent to injure another, the provider can only avail himself or herself of the immunity protection if he or she has done certain things, including informing appropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>ate law enforcement agencies of the patient\u2019s propensities or intentions to inflict injury. That statute then provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-4\">(d) <em>Patient confidentiality. </em>\u2014 No cause of action or disciplinary action may arise under any patient confidentiality act against a mental health care provider or administrator for confidences disclosed or not disclosed in good faith to third parties in an effort to discharge a duty arising under this section according to the provisions of subsection (c) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-5\"><em>See also </em>Md.Code (1974, 1998 RepLVol.), \u00a7 9-112 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cPrivileged communications \u2014 News media.\u201d); <em>compare </em>section 9-105 (confidentiality of spousal communications) <em>with </em>section 9-106 (providing exceptions in criminal cases involving abuse of minors, and also providing that the privilege is waived if previously the spouse asserted the privilege and refused to testify against the other spouse in a spousal assault case).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Additionally, the Legislature, by a subsequent statute first enacted in 1987, has expressly exempted certain matters relating to reporting allegations of child abuse from the prohibitions against compelled disclosure of psychiatrist-patient diagnosis and treatment records. Maryland Code (1984, 1991 RepLVol., 1998 Cum.Supp.), section 5-704 of the Family Law Article (enacted as 1987 Maryland Laws, Chapter 635) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">\u00a7 5-704. Reporting of abuse or neglect \u2014 By health practitioner....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-8\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 (1) <em>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, including any law on privileged communications, </em>each health practitioner, ... acting in a professional capacity, who has reason to believe that a child has been subjected to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-9\">(i) abuse, shall notify the local department or the appropriate law enforcement agency; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-10\">(ii) neglect, shall notify the local department.... [Some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>emphasis added.][<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">There may well be other privilege statutes containing exceptions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> What is clear is that the Legislature knows how to create privileges, and how to create exceptions and how to repeal exceptions. Its decision to repeal the child custody exception at issue in the case <em>sub judice </em>was a clear policy statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">When attempting to discern the intention of the Legislature in enacting a particular statute, we have recently said in <em>Edgewater Liquors, Inc. v. Liston, </em>349 Md. 803, 709 A.2d 1301 (1998):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-7\">\u201cIn construing the meaning of a word in a statute, the cardinal rule is to ascertain and carry out the real legislative intention.\u201d <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 73, 517 A.2d 730, 731 (1986); <em>see also Marriott Employees Fed. Credit Union v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>346 Md. 437, 444, 697 A.2d 455, 458 (1997). Legislative intent generally is derived from the words of the statute at issue. \u201cWe are not constrained, however, by ... \u2018the literal or usual meaning\u2019 of the terms at issue.\u201d \u201cFurthermore, we do not read statutory language \u2018in isolation or out of context [but construe it] in light of the legislature\u2019s general purpose and in the context of the statute as a whole.\u2019 \u201d \u201cThe \u2018meaning of the plainest language\u2019 is controlled by the context in which it appears.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 807-08, 709 A.2d at 1303 (some citations omitted). We commented in an earlier case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>When we pursue the context of statutory language, we are not limited to the words of the statute as they are printed in the Annotated Code. We may and often must consider other \u201cexternal manifestations\u201d or \u201cpersuasive evidence,\u201d including a bill\u2019s title and function paragraphs, <em>amendments that occurred as it passed through the legislature, its relationship to earlier and subsequent legislation, and other material that fairly bears on the fundamental issue of legislative purpose or goal, which becomes the context within which we read the particular language before us in a given case.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-5\"><em>... </em>Thus, in <em>State v. One 1983 Chevrolet Van, </em>309 Md. 327, 524 A.2d 51 (1987), ... [although we did not describe any of the statutes involved in that case as ambiguous or uncertain, we did search for legislative purpose or meaning \u2014 what Judge Orth, writing for the Court, described as \u201cthe legislative scheme.\u201d... <em>See also Ogrinz v. James, </em>309 Md. 381, 524 A.2d 77 (1987), in which we considered legislative history (a committee report) to assist in construing legislation that we did not identify as ambiguous or of uncertain meaning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-6\"><em>Kaczorowski v. Mayor and City Council, </em>309 Md. 505, 514-15, 525 A.2d 628, 632-33 (1987) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the amendment during passage of the original bill that had inserted a child custody exception, the subsequent repeal of the exception, the failure to include child custody exceptions in similar statutes, and the legislative history of the various statutes indicates that the Legislature intended that there be no express exception to the privilege in child custody cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">There is little case law on the exact issue presented here among our sister states. Several courts that have addressed the issue have dealt with exemption statutes similar to the exemption repealed in this state by 1977 Maryland Laws, Chapter 685. Accordingly, they do not sufficiently address the issue before us to be particularly helpful although we shall discuss cases from two of the states (Alabama and Louisiana) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>to indicate the view contrary to the one that we adopt here. These states include Alabama, <em>Harbin v. Harbin, </em>495 So.2d 72 (Ala.Civ.App.1986); Alaska, <em>In the Matter of D.D.S., </em>869 P.2d 160 (Alaska 1994) (exception for CINA cases); Louisiana, <em>Carney v. Carney, </em>525 So.2d 357 (La.Ct.App.), <em>writ denied, </em>530 So.2d 88 (La.1988); Michigan, <em>LeGendre v. Monroe County, </em>234 Mich.App. 708, 739 n. 18, 600 N.W.2d 78, 94 n. 18 (1999) (sex discrimination case in which the child custody exception was mentioned); Missouri, <em>In re Marriage of Daneshfar, </em>953 S.W.2d 95 (Mo.Ct.App.1997); <em>In Interest of S.J., </em>849 S.W.2d 608, 610-11 (Mo.Ct.App.1993) (exception in termination of parental rights case); Texas, <em>Smith v. Gayle, </em>834 S.W.2d 105 (Tex.App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 1992). The exception language from the other states\u2019 cases are similar to the language of Maryland\u2019s repealed exception. For example, the Alabama statute provides: \u201cThere is no privilege ... in a child custody case in which the mental state of a party is clearly an issue and a proper resolution of the custody question requires disclosure.\u201d Ala. R. Evid. 503(d)(5). The language of the exception formerly contained in section 9-109 stated: \u201cthe presiding judge of a court of record may compel such disclosure in cases involving the custody of children, if, in his opinion, such disclosure is necessary to a proper determination of the issue of custody.\u201d 1966 Md. Laws, Chap. 503. Overall, few states have resolved the issue presented in respect to the psychiatrist/psychologist-patient privilege in child custody cases. Moreover, we have found in our research no case in which a foreign state\u2019s legislative body has specifically balanced the competing interests of the needs of proper mental health and the needs for courts to have such information in child custody matters, by first enacting a child custody exception and then repealing it, in order to ensure confidentiality of mental health records.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">In our review of the law of other states, we look also to the cases in respect to the related physician-patient privilege. We start our review of the foreign authorities by considering privilege cases in respect to petitioner\u2019s first question: \u201cDoes a party seeking an award of sole custody place their mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>health at issue, so as to require the disclosure of privileged mental health records?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The other states are divided on the issue. Those that answer the question affirmatively generally follow the Alabama approach. Those that answer the question negatively generally follow the Florida approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">As we have indicated above, there is a child custody exception in Alabama\u2019s privilege statute. It is couched in terms of applying where a party\u2019s mental state is clearly an issue. In <em>Thompson v. Thompson, </em>624 So.2d 619, 620 (Ala.Civ.App.1993), the father had alleged that the mother was \u201cnot fit\u201d to be a parent because she was an alcoholic. The intermediate appellate court held that the father\u2019s allegation alone was sufficient to place the mother\u2019s mental state in issue: \u201cWhen the issue of the mental state of a party to a custody suit is clearly in controversy, and a proper resolution of the custody issue requires disclosure of privileged medical records, the psychiatrist-patient privilege must yield.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There are several other Alabama intermediate appellate court decisions that have held similarly. <em>See Black v. Black, </em>625 So.2d 450 (Ala.Civ.App.1993); <em>Harbin, </em>495 So.2d 72. The Alabama cases are cited often by the courts of other states that have reached a similar holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">The Indiana Supreme Court perhaps has gone further than any other court in holding that the mere filing of a custody action places a parent\u2019s mental health at issue, thus waiving the privilege for that proceeding and all subsequent custody proceedings. In <em>Owen v. Owen, </em>563 N.E.2d 605, 608 (Ind.1990), the court, in reversing the judgment of an intermediate appellate court, held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-8\">Christine placed her mental condition in issue when she petitioned for and was granted custody under the original order, and that condition remains in issue for the purposes of custody questions during the children\u2019s minority. Therefore, her blanket assertion of the physician-patient privilege regarding her mental condition and treatment was not justified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>When a party-patient places a condition in issue by way of a claim, counterclaim, or affirmative defense, she waives the physician-patient privilege as to all matters causally or historically related to that condition, and information which would otherwise be protected from disclosure by the privilege then becomes subject to discovery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">In <em>Dawes v. Dawes, </em>454 So.2d 311, 312-13 (La.Ct.App.), <em>writ denied, </em>457 So.2d 18 (La.1984), the court held that a statutory enactment in respect to custody, passed after the date of passage of the privilege statute, created a specific exception to the privilege because it required the evaluation of the mental and physical health of the parents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-6\">The hospitalization and prescription records which are maintained at DePaul and Oschner Hospitals appear to fall within the protective confines of this statute [\u201cd\u00f3ctor/patient privilege\u201d]. However, we hold that the doctor/patient privileges protected by R.S. 13:3734, et seq., are subject to the additional exception created by the subsequent enactment of the joint custody provisions of C.C. Art. 146 which specifically require the evaluation of the mental and physical health of the parents. The trial court has the power to preserve the confidentiality of this information by the usual methods of sealing the records, taking testimony in chambers, etc. as may be done in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-7\">... In reaching its conclusion [a Louisiana Supreme Court decision holding that the privilege was not waived in respect to the issue of separation], the Court reasoned that the legislature had not delineated separation suits as one of the exceptions to the doctor/patient privilege....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-8\">However, in this case we find that the plaintiffs physical and/or mental conditions are essential elements to his action for joint custody. That is, there exists a rebuttable presumption that joint custody is in best interest of the child. However, the presumption may be rebutted by a showing that it is not in the best interest of the child. In order to make such a showing, evidence may be introduced regard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>ing the fitness of the parent to care for the child, including among other factors, the moral fitness of the parties involved as well as the mental and physical health of the parties. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Even in some of those states that have held that the mere seeking of custody places a parent\u2019s mental health at issue sufficient to operate as a waiver of statutorily enacted privileges, the courts sometimes impose limitations on the disclosure. In <em>Clark v. Clark, </em>220 Neb. 771, 775, 371 N.W.2d 749, 752-53 (1985), the Supreme Court of Nebraska held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-6\">As to the confidential relationship, if any, between Dr. Tatay and Mrs. Clark, she has waived any privilege she had in her conversations with Dr. Tatay by the filing of her petition alleging her fitness to have custody of her child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-7\">As we have stated, we agree with the trial court that by placing her fitness to have custody of her child in issue, Mrs. Clark did waive any physician-patient privilege that existed between herself and Dr. Burlingame and between herself and Dr. Tatay. However, in view of the personal and confidential communications made between a patient and a psychiatrist (see <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>222 F.2d 398, 401 (D.C.Cir.1955), \u201c \u2018The psychiatric patient confides more utterly than anyone else in the world ... \u2019 \u201d), when a litigant seeks custody of a child in a dissolution of marriage proceeding, that action does not result in making relevant the information contained in the file cabinets of every psychiatrist who has ever treated the litigant. The determination as to the admissibility of the evidence to which the waiver applies is to be initially entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">There is one case that appears to be in between the holdings of the two primary lines of cases. In <em>Kinsella v. Kinsella, </em>150 N.J. 276, 325-30, 696 A.2d 556, 582-85 (N.J.1997), the court appears to have held that such privileged treatment records were discoverable in child custody cases, but then used strong language discouraging such discovery. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>However, by contesting.custody or visitation, a parent does not automatically put information contained in records of therapy with such professionals \u201cin issue.\u201d In regard to therapy records, which are at the heart of the psychologist-patient privilege, the courts must strike a balance between the need to protect children who are in danger of abuse or neglect from unfit custodians and the compelling policy of facilitating the treatment of parents\u2019 psychological or emotional problems.[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] Such a balance is in the best interest of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Therefore, the first source of information about the parents\u2019 mental health should be the independent experts appointed by the courts or hired by the parties for the purpose of litigation, rather than the professionals who have established relationships with the parties. In most cases, the assistance provided by independent experts should be sufficient. Only when the court perceives, after consideration of all of the evidence, that the information gained from independent evaluations is inadequate, should the court consider piercing the psychologist-patient privilege to compel disclosure of prior treatment records to the court and the parties. The decision to order such disclosure must be based on independent evidence of potential for harm to the child, for example, the fact of a recent hospitalization, the opinion of an expert, or the court\u2019s own observations....</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">... Allegations alone, however, cannot be adequate to justify piercing the psychologist-patient privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 327-28, 696 A.2d at 583. After directing that the child custody issue be remanded to the trial court for it to conduct a balancing analysis between the competing interests the court went on to suggest to the trial court certain limitations it should utilize in that balancing process.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-4\">Courts should be mindful that, although New Jersey\u2019s psychologist-patient privilege is modeled on the attorney-client privilege, the public policy behind the psychologist-patient privilege is in some respects even more compelling. ... The psychologist-patient privilege further serves to protect an individual\u2019s privacy interest in communications that will frequently be even more personal, potentially embarrassing, and more often readily misconstrued than those between attorney and client. Made public and taken out of context, the disclosure of notes from therapy sessions could have devastating personal consequences for the patient and his or her family, and the threat of such disclosure could be wielded to unfairly influence settlement negotiations or the course of litigation. Especially in the context of matrimonial litigation, the value of the therapist-patient relationship and of the patient\u2019s privacy is intertwined with one of the most important concerns of the courts \u2014 the safety and well-being of children and families. Therefore, only in the most compelling circumstances should the courts permit the privilege to be pierced. [<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZJa\"><em>Id. </em>at 329-30, 696 A.2d at 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Cases that hold that the mere filing of a custody action do not place a parent\u2019s mental and physical health at issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>sufficient to waive the psychiatrist/psychologist/doctor-patient privilege include <em>Peisach v. Antuna, </em>539 So.2d 544, 546 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1989), in which a father, among other things, sought custody of the minor child due to an allegation that his former wife was psychologically unstable and suffered from migraine headaches, which prevented her from being a fit parent. The wife admitted that she had received psychiatric treatment seven years earlier right after the divorce between the parties. Additionally, the wife was willing to undergo a current mental examination pursuant to the lower court\u2019s order. The husband sought to depose the psychiatrist who had treated the wife seven years before as well as three gynecologists who had treated her. The court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-5\">At issue, therefore, in custody modification proceedings are the parents\u2019 present circumstances.... Because the wife has agreed to submit to a psychological examination, the husband and the court will be adequately apprised of her present psychological condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-6\">Moreover, the trial court\u2019s order ... runs afoul of the psychotherapist-patient privilege, section 90.503, Florida Statutes (1987). The husband claims that the wife waived that privilege by denying allegations of mental instability and stating that the short-term therapy seven years ago had made her an even better parent_ The husband\u2019s argument is without merit. Mere allegations that the custodial parent is mentally unstable are not sufficient to place the custodial parent\u2019s mental health at issue and overcome the privilege. Likewise, the custodial parent\u2019s denial of allegations of mental instability does not operate as a waiver of the patient-psychotherapist privilege. To hold otherwise would eviscerate the privilege; a party seeking privileged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>information would obtain it simply by alleging mental infirmity. [Citations omitted.] [Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 546; <em>see also Mohammad v. Mohammad, </em>358 So.2d 610, 613 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1978) (holding that mere denial of mental instability does not operate to waive the privilege).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The Florida courts have further examined how a person places his or her mental condition in issue in a domestic case, albeit not a custody case, and in the process furnished an example of how mental condition is placed in issue. <em>Davidge v. Davidge, </em>451 So.2d 1051, 1051-52 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1984), distinguishes between a specific assertion of a mental condition in support of a claim, from the general assertion of fitness typically made or implied in a child custody dispute. <em>Davidge </em>involved an attempt to get a property settlement agreement reopened on the grounds of the husband\u2019s mental capacity at the time of the execution of the agreement. The husband alleged that \u201che had been emotionally and mentally incapable of entering into a valid contract\u201d at the time the agreement was made. Id. at 1051. At trial, he presented expert and lay opinions \u201cconcerning his mental condition before, during and after the time of execution of the agreement.\u201d Id. at 1051-52. The trial court, however, had refused to allow the wife to present testimony of a psychiatrist who had treated both her and her husband shortly before the execution of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">The appellate court first noted part of its opinion in <em>Roper v. Roper, </em>336 So.2d 654 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>345 So.2d 426 (Fla.1977), in which the issue of a party\u2019s mental condition was raised by an opposing party. \u201cThe trial court would be faced with an entirely different situation if the wife should offer the testimony of her treating psychiatrist to prove her mental condition. In that event the door would have been opened and the privilege waived.\u201d <em>Davidge, </em>451 So.2d at 1052 (quoting <em>Roper, </em>336 So.2d at 657). The Florida privilege statute had an exception similar to one of Maryland\u2019s present exceptions. It provided that there was no privilege for communications relevant to the mental condition of a patient in a proceeding \u201cin which he relies upon the condition as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>element of his claim or defense.\u201d Fla. Stat. ch. 90.503 (1983). The court held that Mr. Davidge was relying specifically on his mental condition at the time the agreement was made in his attempt to get the agreement overturned, and had, accordingly, waived the privilege. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">In <em>State ex rel. Husgen v. Stussie, </em>617 S.W.2d 414, 416-17 (Mo.Ct.App.1981), <em>superseded by statute as stated in Roth v. Roth, </em>793 S.W.2d 590 (Mo.Ct.App.1990), the parties in a divorce proceeding were contesting the custody of three minor children. The wife sought mandamus relief in the appellate court in respect to discovery of certain of the husband\u2019s past and present psychiatric treatment. The Missouri privilege statute, Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 491.060 (1978), afforded physician-patient protection. The husband alleged that his conduct had been exemplary. The court framed the issue: \u201cThe question thus raised is whether the husband, by seeking custody of the children, has placed his mental health in issue such that he has waived' his physician-patient privilege.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The wife relied on a statute that specifically stated that in custody matters the mental and physical health of all individuals involved was to be one of the factors in custody disputes. The court, adopting the position of the Florida courts, and essentially expressing the same concerns that Dr. Rappeport expressed in 1977 to the Maryland Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee in regards to Senate Bill 90, held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-7\">Thus, the <em>Roper </em>court held that the mere request of custody is not sufficient to waive the physician-patient privilege.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-8\">An examination of the facts and law involved in this case reveals that the approach taken by the Florida court is the proper one. By merely seeking custody, the husband has not made his mental health an element of his claim or defense. The psychiatrist-patient relationship involves a high degree of candor not existent in other relationships. This relationship would be seriously compromised if one waives such a privilege whenever, regardless of degree, mental health is a factor. This does not mean that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>privilege cannot be waived in a child custody proceeding but there is no waiver here....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-4\">Finally, the physician-patient privilege embodies the legislature\u2019s balancing of societal interests of confidentiality in furthering full disclosure [to the mental health provider] thereby facilitating treatment[,] and [the] interests served by disclosure of such information in court. If a new balance is to be struck in child custody cases, this is the proper role for the legislature and not for this court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 416-17 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The Connecticut privilege statute involved in <em>Cabrera v.

Gen.Stat. \u00a7 52-146c (1990)). The wife had been counseled by marriage counselors and examined by psychologists for treatment purposes in the past, but had also been currently evaluated by a psychiatrist.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The evaluating psychiatrist did not have available to him the records of the previous mental health treatment of the wife. The trial court, however, credited the report of the evaluating psychiatrist, and awarded custody to the mother. On appeal, the father asserted that all of the prior mental health treatment records should not have been excluded pursuant to the privilege statute. He alleged that because the prior treating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>mental health providers had shared some of the communications relating to their treatment of his wife with him as a part of that treatment, confidentiality had been destroyed and thus the privilege had been waived. The husband asserted other grounds for waiver, including that the wife had put her own mental health at issue by calling the evaluating psychiatrist to the stand. The court responded to this allegation by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFoa\">It was the defendant [husband] himself who sought the introduction of the family relations report. It was that report that made an issue of the plaintiffs mental health and that entitled the plaintiff to introduce the testimony of her own expert, Zucker, to rebut it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-5\">The defendant\u2019s claim that the testimony of Joondeph [the treating mental health provider] should have been admitted because her [the spouse\u2019s] mental health was automatically at issue under \u00a7\u00a7 46b-81 and 46b-82 is also unavailing. While it is true that the plaintiffs health, like that of the defendant, is automatically in issue under \u00a7\u00a7 46b-81 and 46b-82, those sections do not either specifically or implicitly override the provisions of \u00a7 52-146c [the privilege statute]. Rather, as is the general rule in construing statutes that appear to be in conflict, we read them, whenever possible, so as to give effect to both. In this case, this is easily done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">Although information about an individual\u2019s mental health may indeed be relevant to the award of alimony and the distribution of property, as it surely is to the award of custody, the sources of information are limited by the provisions of \u00a7 52-146c- The provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 46b-81 and 46b-82 do not, however, render the plaintiffs privilege unavailable in her communications with Joondeph.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 339, 341, 580 A.2d at 1233,1234.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>there is no conflicting statute. There has been no relevant statute enacted since the repeal of the statutory exception for child custody cases, which has created any subsequent provision for child custody cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>amounting to a statutory waiver of the privilege such as occurred in <em>Dawes. </em>To the extent it can be reasonably argued that the Maryland case law in child custody cases supports a parental mental and physical health requirement, it does not conflict with the Maryland statutory privilege, which controls one of the sources of information that would otherwise be available to the trial courts in determining the best interests of children.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">This does not mean that the trial courts will never have access to such information. In many, if not most, cases the trial court will have some information. If, in a given case, a party has waived the privilege, that information will be available. If the trial court has before it past mental health treatment information voluntarily furnished by one parent tending to indicate parental fitness, but has no past mental health treatment information in respect to the other parent, because that parent has exercised a psychiatrist-patient privilege, the trial court will have to render its decision on the basis of the evidence it has before it. In some instances, the party exercising the privilege may be at a disadvantage because the portion of the party\u2019s own treatment records that is favorable to him or her may not be available to the trial court. Of course, the trial courts also have the option, in their discretion, to order current evaluations of the mental and physical health of the parents and children.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The trial court, of necessity, must render its custody decisions on the basis of the evidence before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">None of the cases we have discussed, neither the Alabama nor the Florida lines of cases, have dealt with an important aspect of this issue that exists in Maryland. As noted, <em>supra, </em>prior to 1977 there existed an express exception in the relevant Maryland privilege statute. In 1977, the Legislature addressed that exception, and repealed it. As we perceive the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>balancing that occurred at that point, the Legislature made a policy decision that the importance of the need for confidentiality for mental health treatment communications, and the records generated in part by the communications, were of sufficient importance to outweigh any exception for child custody matters. We are unwilling to ignore that policy statement by holding to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">Moreover, as we view the differing points of view of the two lines of cases noted, <em>supra, </em>we perceive the Florida line, from the Florida cases mentioned to the Connecticut case of <em>Cabrera </em>to be more persuasive.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We accordingly hold that, while the mental and physical health of a party is an issue to be considered by the trial court, a person seeking an award of child custody that claims to be a fit parent, does not, without more, waive the confidential psychiatrist/psychologist-patient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>privilege in respect to her or his past mental health \u201cdiagnosis and treatment\u201d communications and records. Fitness of parents is a fundamental and primary element of child custody litigation. It is present even if not stated. It is no more present when it is stated by one party or the other. An assertion that one is fit is merely an assertion that one meets the qualifications to be awarded custody. If it were the law in Maryland that anyone seeking custody of children specifically placed their mental condition in issue, there would be no psychiatrist-patient privilege in custody disputes. The Legislature clearly established a contrary public policy. It chose to preserve the privilege in custody cases. We answer petitioner\u2019s first question in the negative. In answering petitioner\u2019s first question in the negative, we, of necessity, answer her second question in the affirmative. There was no cross-petition for certiorari filed by respondent; therefore, our consideration is limited to the questions presented by petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">It is necessary to remand the case to the Court of Special Appeals for a consideration of the issues it declined to address in its opinion. Under the circumstances, it may chose to await the result of the independent mental evaluation it has directed the trial court to order, and the subsequent reconsideration by the trial court of its custody determination after the trial court has available to it that evaluation. Realizing that the question of whether an independent evaluation is necessary is discretionary with a trial court and, given that the trial court had available to it four years of the mental health records of petitioner, the Court of Special Appeals may also want to reconsider that aspect of its judgment. Such a remand, given the positions of the parties, will almost surely result in additional appeals adding to the already tortuous process of this matter in the courts, to the potential detriment of all involved.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Concerning the two issues presented to us, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED IN PART; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF THE OTHER ISSUES PRESENTED TO IT, BUT NOT ADDRESSED IN ITS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY RESPONDENT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b693-6\">.

Prior to the hearing on the merits, the trial court directed that all of the post-1994 mental health records of petitioner, not only those the trial court had examined <em>in camera, </em>be produced to respondent. Accordingly, shortly before the merits hearing, respondent had access to four years of petitioner\u2019s mental health records.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b694-9\">. The hearing on the merits had been delayed by the illness of respondent\u2019s counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b695-7\">.

Whether a wife in a custody dispute that has received psychological counseling and treatment for emotional problems during the entire course of the couple's 12 year marriage from eight different psychologists, that alleges that she is a fit and proper person to have the sole care and custody of the couple\u2019s two minor children for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>purpose of changing the couple\u2019s separation agreement which provides for joint custody of the minor children, in order to facilitate her move with the children to New York, has put her mental condition in issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-6\">III.

Whether [the trial court] abused his discretion by awarding sole custody of the couple's two minor children to the mother in view of overwhelming evidence that it was in the best interests of the children that their custody be awarded to the father.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-9\">[VI.] Whether [the trial court] abused his discretion by awarding indefinite alimony to a self-supporting 37 year old paralegal that earned $30,000 annually, where the husband was 50 years old and where the parties have lived separate and apart for five (5) of the thirteen (13) years they had been married.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">When the Court of Special Appeals rephrased respondent\u2019s issues, it left out questions I, IV, and V altogether. Moreover, it did not address either of those issues in its resolution. Upon remand, the Court of Special Appeals will, of necessity, have to answer questions I, IV, and V, except to the extent those decisions may await the remand to the trial court for independent psychological evaluations consistent with the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals. Petitioner did not present the issue of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 ruling on the necessity of an independent psychological review to us in her Petition for Writ of Certiorari. <em>See generally Walston v. Sun Cab Co., </em>267 Md. 559, 298 A.2d 391 (1973). Additionally, respondent did not file a cross-petition in respect to the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 determination in respect to indefinite alimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b697-8\">.

In footnote 1 of the majority opinion of the Court of Special Appeals, the author attempted to distinguish one of that court\u2019s recent opinions, <em>In re Matthew R., </em>113 Md.App. 701, 688 A.2d 955 (1997), by stating it did not apply because in the present case it was petitioner who was seeking a change in custody.

Hooks, </em>296 Md. 123, 126-27, 460 A.2d 49, 51 (1983), was a case concerning who would be qualified, as a representative of a minor child, to waive the psychiatrist/patient privilege in respect to such records relating to mental health treatment of the child in a child custody case pursuant to section 9-109(b). Commenting on the 1977 repeal of the child custody exception, the Court said: \"That provision was eliminated by the legislature in 1977 ... for some unexplained reason, and is thus not the law today.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 127, 460 A.2d at 51. Our current review of the legislative history surrounding the repeal, to a large extent, suggests the Legislature\u2019s intention in repealing the exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b710-9\">. <em>But see </em>section 5-707 of the Family Law Article and its confidentiality provisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b710-10\">. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we are concerned with whether a statutory privilege can be asserted in a child custody case. We are not concerned with the issue of such privileges in a criminal case context. In <em>Goldsmith v. State, </em>337 Md. 112, 129, 651 A.2d 866, 874 (1995), we stated: \"[W]e recognize that the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights at trial may outweigh the victim\u2019s right to assert a privilege.\u201d There exist other cases in this state, and in other jurisdictions, concerning the assertion of the privilege in criminal cases that we do not here address.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b716-7\">. The medical history in a mental health situation relies on a patient\u2019s memory and many other mental processes, including fantasies, imagi-national aspects, delusions, and other factors that are not objective in nature. Physical health situations rely, as we perceive it, primarily on more objective factors relating to past physical health characteristics. There would appear to be even more of a need for confidentiality in mental health situations than in physical health situations. For example, a physician can look at a compound fracture and see the bone piercing the skin \u2014 the injury is readily apparent. However, in many instances a psychiatrist or psychologist must delve into the mind and mental history of a patient to find the sources, and treatment, for the mental health problems presented \u2014 the injury or illness is not readily apparent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b717-6\">. One of the better comments on the importance of confidentiality of psychiatrist-patient communications is found in <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>United States, </em>222 F.2d 398, 401 (D.C.Cir.1955), where, albeit in a criminal case, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-7\">In regard to mental patients, the policy behind such a statute is particularly clear and strong. Many physical ailments might be treated with some degree of effectiveness by a doctor whom the patient did not trust, but a psychiatrist must have his patient\u2019s confidence or he cannot help him. \u201cThe psychiatric patient confides more utterly than anyone else in the world. He exposes to the therapist not only what his words directly express; he lays bare his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>entire self, his dreams, his fantasies, his sins, and his shame. Most patients who undergo psychotherapy know that this is what will be expected of them, and that they cannot get help except on that condition. * * * It would be too much to expect them to do so if they knew that all they say \u2014 and all that the psychiatrist learns from what they say \u2014 may be revealed to the whole world from a witness stand.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b721-7\">. Generally, when considering psychiatrist/psychologist-patient privilege issues in child custody matters, the term \u201ctreatment\u201d refers to communications and records relating to a patient seeing a mental health professional for the purpose of determining whether the patient has a mental problem, and if so, a diagnosis of what the problem is, and what the proper course of treatment should be. In other words, a patient is seeking to be cured of a mental health problem the patient believes does, or possibly does, exist. The term \u201cevaluation\" of mental (or physical) health matters, in the context of child custody cases, refers to a process of examination to determine whether a problem exists and to report to the court the opinions of the evaluator as to the state of a person\u2019s mental health as it might relate to parental fitness. Though both involve mental examinations, the purposes of each is different.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b723-6\">. As indicated, <em>supra, </em>the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 judgment includes a remand to the trial court for it to order an independent psychological evaluation. That part of the judgment of the intermediate appellate court was not presented to us in the Petition for Writ of Certiorari.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b724-5\">. There is a contempt case involving the compelled disclosure of treatment records of a juvenile that has held that the doctor-patient privilege did not preclude disclosure, but, nonetheless held that the records were not discoverable because compelled disclosure would violate the patient\u2019s constitutional right of privacy. In <em>In re \"B\u201d; Appeal of Roth, </em>482 Pa. 471, 484, 485, 486, 394 A.2d 419, 425, 426 (1978), the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ultimately held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-6\">We conclude that in Pennsylvania, an individual\u2019s interest in preventing the disclosure of information revealed in the context of a psychotherapist-patient relationship has deeper roots than the Pennsylvania doctor-patient privilege statute, and that the patient\u2019s right to prevent disclosure of such information is constitutionally based. This constitutional foundation emanates from the penumbras of the various guarantees of the Bill of Rights, <em>Griswold v. Connecticut, </em>[381 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1678, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965) ], as well as from the guarantees of the Constitution of this Commonwealth....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-7\">The nature of the psychotherapeutic process is such that disclosure to the therapist of the patient\u2019s most intimate emotions, fears, and fantasies is required.... In laying bare one\u2019s entire self, however, the patient rightfully expects that such revelations will remain a matter of confidentiality exclusively between patient and therapist. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-8\">We recognize that our holding may, in some cases, make it more difficult for the court to obtain all the information it might desire regarding members of the juvenile's family, or about the juvenile\u2019s friends, neighbors, and associates. The individual\u2019s right of privacy, however, must prevail in this situation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">We do not directly address the constitutional right of privacy aspects of this case as it is not necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b725-5\">. We note again that this case was appealed prematurely by the husband to the Court of Special Appeals and dismissed by that court. Then the husband appealed again to that court after a final judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>had been rendered. It has been reviewed by this Court and reversed and remanded for consideration of unaddressed issues. It is possible that if the Court of Special Appeals remands the case to the trial court for an independent evaluation, the trial court's subsequent decision will again be appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. The decision of the Court of Special Appeals, whatever it may be, could be petitioned to this Court and reviewed again, and, perhaps, given the wealth of information the trial court had at its disposal at the time of the original hearing, reversed again by this Court. In short, we doubt there was reversible error on the part of the trial court in the first instance in choosing not to utilize an independent evaluation given the four years of records it had available, but do not reach the issue at this time because of the limitations of the certiorari questions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
