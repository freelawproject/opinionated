At issue is the ultimate recipient of the proceeds. After interpreting the insurance contract to provide for payment to relatives of the husband as contingent beneficiaries, the Court of Special Appeals, in <em>Diep v. Rivas, </em>126 Md.App. 133, 727 A.2d 448 (1999), then applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>the slayer\u2019s rule to disqualify the contingent beneficiaries from receiving payment and awarded the proceeds to the wife\u2019s father. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">The murder and suicide took place during an argument at the marital home in Howard County on April 2, 1996. There were no children of the marriage. The murder victim, Maria Rivas, is survived by her father, the respondent, Dr. Hector Rivas, and the murderer/ suicide, Xuang Ky Tran (Tran), is survived by his brother and sister, the petitioners, An Diep and Vanessa Diep.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Tran was employed by IIT Research Institute (IIT) which was the holder of a group accidental death and dismemberment benefit policy (the Policy) issued by Continental Casualty Company (CNA) and effective January 1, 1990. Insofar as relevant to the instant matter, the Policy is comprised of the application for the master policy and the master policy. The record also contains the form certificate issued to IIT employees who were covered by the Policy. By its terms the certificate is not the Policy but \u201cis merely evidence of insurance provided under the [PJolicy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Following the death of Maria Rivas, CNA was confronted with conflicting claims for the benefits payable upon her death.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The petitioners and the respondent sought payment based on their respective interpretations of the \u201cPayment of Claim\u201d provision applicable, where, as here, no beneficiaries had been specially designated. That policy provision reads in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-7\">\u201cBenefits for loss of life of the Insured will be payable in accordance with the beneficiary designation in effect at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>time of payment. If no such designation is in effect at that time, the benefits shall be paid to the surviving person or persons in the first of the following classes of successive preference beneficiaries of which a member survives the Insured:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-5\">\u201cThe Insured\u2019s (a) spouse; (b) children, including legally adopted children; (c) parents; (d) brothers and sister[s]; or (e) estate.... If two or more persons become entitled to benefits as preference beneficiaries, they shall share equally-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-6\">\u201cBenefits for loss of life of any insured family member will [be] payable to the Insured, if living, otherwise in the same manner as above.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">The respondent contends that the applicable classes of successive preference beneficiaries are the relatives of Maria Rivas, while the petitioners contend that the applicable classes of successive preference beneficiaries are the relatives of Tran. The respondent further contends that, if the applicable classes of successive preference beneficiaries are the relatives of Tran, then they are disqualified by the slayer\u2019s rule from taking the insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">CNA responded to the conflicting claims by interpleading the claimants in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. There were cross-motions for summary judgment. The circuit court agreed with the respondent\u2019s construction of the Policy and, in <em>dicta, </em>commented that the slayer\u2019s rule did not apply. The Court of Special Appeals agreed with the petitioners\u2019 construction of the Policy, but held that the slayer\u2019s rule did apply. <em>Diep, </em>126 Md.App. at 141, 727 A.2d at 452. This Court issued the writ of certiorari. <em>Diep v. Rivas, 355 </em>Md. 610, 735 A.2d 1105 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">The essence of the circuit court\u2019s interpretation is the following part of that court\u2019s opinion from the bench.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>\u201cThere are definitions within the policy. For example, the definitions say \u2018insured\u2019 means eligible person. Under \u2018eligible person\u2019 the family members are included.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-5\">\u201cThe policy states under the caption of eligible persons, all persons described in Statement 2 are eligible for insurance under this policy. Included in Statement 2 are an insured employee, an insured spouse, and insured dependent children.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">This interpretation fails to distinguish between the \u201cInsured\u201d and an insured under the Policy. To demonstrate our conclusion requires a dissection of the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">In the master policy persons who are \u201celigible for insurance\u201d under the Policy are defined as \u201celigible persons,\u201d and they are \u201c[a]ll persons described in ... the Application.\u201d The \u201cApplication\u201d states that all \u201c[a]ctive, full-time employees\u201d of IIT were eligible for the insurance program. Tran was an \u201celigible person\u201d who became a participant in the program. Under the definitions in the Policy he thereby became an \u201cInsured\u201d (\u201c \u2018Insured\u2019 means the eligible person whose insurance is in force under the terms of this policy.\u201d). Under the definitions of the form certificate, Tran thereby became a \u201cYou\u201d (\u201c \u2018You\u2019, \u2018Your\u2019 and \u201cYours\u2019 mean the person to whom this certificate is issued and whose insurance is in force under the terms of the policy.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">The master policy further provided that \u201c[t]he eligible persons becoming insured under this policy may also insure their eligible family members.\u201d \u201cEligible family members\u201d were described in the \u201cApplication.\u201d The \u201cApplication\u201d specified such persons to be \u201c[t]he spouse, age 18 through age 70[,] of [an] insured employee\u201d and certain unmarried dependant children of an \u201cInsured (or spouse of the Insured).\u201d Under the master policy Maria Rivas became an \u201cInsured Person.\u201d The master policy defines \u201c \u2018Insured Person\u2019 [to] mean[ ] the Insured and the insured family members of the Insured.\u201d In the certificate \u201c \u2018Insured Person\u2019 means You and any of Your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>eligible family members who are covered under the policy.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Under the \u201cPayment of Claim\u201d provision of the master policy, set forth above, \u201c[b]enefits for loss of life of any insured family member will [be] payable to the Insured, if living, otherwise in the same manner as above.\u201d For purposes of this case the parties have asked that we accept as fact that Maria Rivas predeceased Tran. Applying the Policy\u2019s definitions to the facts of this case, the \u201cinsured family member\u201d was Maria Rivas, and the \u201cInsured\u201d was Tran. But Tran was the slayer of Maria Rivas and disqualified. Consequently, under the Policy, the benefits for the loss of life of Maria Rivas were payable \u201cin the same manner as above.\u201d The \u201cmanner as above\u201d deals with the \u201c[b]enefits for loss of life of the Insured.\u201d Those benefits are payable to \u201cthe surviving person or persons in the first of the following classes of successive preference beneficiaries of which a member survives the Insured,\u201d namely, \u201c[t]he Insured\u2019s (a) spouse; (b) children ...; (c) parents; (d) brothers and sisters; or (e) estate.\u201d Maria Rivas did not survive the \u201cInsured.\u201d Accordingly, the Policy proceeds are not payable to her estate. There were no children of the \u201cInsured\u201d and no surviving parents of the \u201cInsured.\u201d Consequently, the petitioners, Tran\u2019s brother and sister, who comprise the first class of successive preference beneficiaries surviving the \u201cInsured\u201d receive the benefits pursuant to the Policy, if the terms of the Policy control.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>Respondent finds support for his construction of the policy in <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co. v. Molloy, </em>291 Md. 139, 433 A.2d 1135 (1981). <em>Molloy </em>had cited with approval the following language set forth in <em>Howell v. Ohio Casualty Insurance Co., </em>130 N.J.Super. 350, 327 A.2d 240, 243 (App.Div.1974):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-5\">\u201c \u2018[T]here is much to commend the view that, unless the terms [of an insurance policy] are plainly to the contrary ... the obligation of the carrier should be considered several as to each person insured, and the fraud or misconduct of one insured should not bar recovery by the innocent co-insureds to the extent of their respective interests in the property involved.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-6\"><em>Molloy, </em>291 Md. at 153, 433 A.2d at 1142 (second alteration in original). Respondent also relies on <em>Rent-A-Car Co. v. Globe &amp; Rutgers Fire Insurance Co., </em>158 Md. 169, 148 A. 252 (1930), for the proposition that Maryland courts have construed insurance contracts as providing coverage to insured interests separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">In both of these property insurance cases there were co-insureds to whom the policies had been issued. In <em>Molloy </em>a homeowners\u2019 policy designated \u201c \u2018Charles J. Molloy and Diane M. Molloy,\u2019 \u201d a husband and wife, as the \u201c \u2018named insured.\u2019 \u201d 291 Md. at 152, 433 A.2d at 1142. Likewise, in <em>Rent-A-Car Co. </em>a fire policy covering a fleet of rental automobiles that were security for a purchase money loan specifically listed both the owner-debtor and the secured party as the assured. 158 Md. at 173, 148 A. at 254. The <em>Molloy </em>and <em>Rent-A-Car Co. </em>cases would have some relevance if the Policy in the instant matter provided, for example, that on the death of an insured person the death benefit would be paid one-half to Tran and one-half to some other beneficiary. If the other beneficiary were innocent, Tran\u2019s crime would not disqualify that person. <em>Molloy </em>and <em>Rent-A-Car Co., </em>however, are not authority for altering the precise definitions in the Policy to convert the single \u201cInsured,\u201d Tran, into two \u201cInsureds,\u201d or to alter \u201cInsured\u201d into the separately defined term, \u201cInsured Person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">By following the definitional trail that we have set forth above, the Court of Special Appeals also concluded that the Policy directed payment to classes of contingent beneficiaries that were relatives of Tran. That court next addressed the petitioners\u2019 contention that the circuit court had erred in failing to grant summary judgment in favor of the petitioners. There was no error, the appellate court held, because the <em>petitioners </em>were barred by the slayer\u2019s rule. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">In Maryland, the slayer\u2019s rule exists as a matter of public policy embodied in the common law. This Court first applied the doctrine in <em>Price v. Hitaffer, </em>164 Md. 505, 165 A. 470 (1933), a case in which a husband murdered his wife and almost immediately thereafter committed suicide. The wife died intestate, and an orphans\u2019 court excluded the heirs and personal representatives of the murderer from the distribution of the victim\u2019s estate. The Court stated the issue to be: \u201cCan a murderer, or his heirs and representatives through him, be enriched by taking any portion of the estate of the one murdered?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 506,165 A. at 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\"><em>Price </em>held that the statutes of descent and distribution must be construed in light of the strong public policy represented by</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-8\">\u201c[o]ne line of decisions [that] apply the common-law principle of equity that no one shall be permitted to profit by his own fraud, to take advantage of his own wrong, to found any claim upon his own iniquity, or to acquire property by his own crime, and hold that provisions of a will and the statutes of descent and distribution should be interpreted in the light of those universally recognized principles of justice and morality; that such interpretation is justified and compelled by the public policy embraced in those principles or maxims, which must control the interpretation of law, statutes, and contracts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">The slayer\u2019s rule was applied in <em>Chase v. Jenifer, </em>219 Md. 564, 150 A.2d 251 (1959), to disqualify a wife who was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>named beneficiary of insurance on her husband\u2019s life from receiving the death benefits where the wife had killed the husband under circumstances constituting voluntary manslaughter, because \u201cthe killing [was] both felonious and intentional.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 570, 150 A.2d at 255. There appears not to have been any contingent beneficiary named in the policy involved in <em>Chase. </em>The contest was between the victim\u2019s personal representative and the slayer, and the proceeds were paid to the victim\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Whether the slayer\u2019s rule applies to homicides under circumstances constituting involuntary manslaughter was answered in the negative in <em>Schifanelli v. Wallace, </em>271 Md. 177, 815 A.2d 518 (1974). We explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-6\">\u201c[t]he rule which prevents a beneficiary who has intentionally killed the insured from recovering on an insurance policy is grounded on the public policy against permitting a wilful and felonious killer to profit by his felony. Thus, it has no application where even though the acts of the beneficiary cause death, they are without the intent to do so; where the death is the result of accident, or even when caused by such gross negligence on the part of the beneficiary that he is guilty of involuntary manslaughter, the beneficiary may still recover.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 188, 315 A.2d at 519 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">More recently, in <em>Ford v. Ford, </em>307 Md. 105, 122, 512 A.2d 389, 398 (1986), we held that the slayer\u2019s rule does not apply to a person who was not criminally responsible within the meaning of Maryland Code (1982, 1985 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 12-108(a) of the Health-General Article. In <em>Ford </em>a daughter had murdered her mother who left a will under which the daughter was the sole beneficiary. <em>Id. </em>at 107, 512 A.2d at 390. The contest was between the slayer and her brother who was a contingent beneficiary under the will <em>Id. </em>Inasmuch as the holding in <em>Ford </em>permitted the daughter to inherit under the will, the alternate disposition to the brother did not come into effect. <em>Id. </em>at 125, 512 A.2d at 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>In the instant matter the Court of Special Appeals extended the slayer\u2019s rule to the petitioners for two reasons, the first of which is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-5\">\u201cThe Dieps also state, and we agree, that they are not guilty of any wrongdoing. That fact, however, has no bearing on eligibility. If the law provided that innocent secondary beneficiaries were not excluded by the Slayer\u2019s Rule, the public policy reason for the rule would be eroded significantly and, arguably, the murder/suicide statistics would increase dramatically.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-6\"><em>Diep, </em>126 Md.App. at 143, 727 A.2d at 453. This rationale conflicts with the principle underlying the slayer\u2019s rule. The rule is designed to prevent one from taking \u201cadvantage of his own wrong\u201d or acquiring \u201cproperty by his own crime.\u201d Price, 164 Md. at 506, 165 A. at 472. Inasmuch as the not criminally responsible murderer, see <em>Ford, supra, </em>and the person who kills another unintentionally, but through gross negligence, see <em>Schifanelli, supra, </em>may acquire property as a result of homicides committed by them, the petitioners, who are completely blameless in the murder of Maria Rivas, are not precluded from taking the Policy proceeds resulting from her death. Indeed, to visit the consequences of Tran\u2019s crime on his brother and sister conjures up the ghosts of corruption of the blood which is prohibited by Article 27 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">The Court of Special Appeals also based its extension of the slayer\u2019s rule to the petitioners on an erroneous interpretation and application of a statement by this Court in <em>Ford. </em>In an introductory section of the <em>Ford </em>opinion, we summarized the Maryland law on the slayer\u2019s rule into two principles, and then stated that \u201c[t]hese principles apply not only to the killer but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>to those claiming through or under him.\u201d 307 Md. at 112, 512 A.2d at 392.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> From the preceding sentence the Court of Special Appeals concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-5\">\u201cTran never having acquired any right to the proceeds, the secondary beneficiaries have no interest to assert because their claim is through Tran as surviving brother and sister.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-6\">\u201cThe holding in <em>Ford </em>states expressly that the Slayer\u2019s Rule is applicable to those claiming \u2018through or under\u2019 the slayer. Tran\u2019s brother and sister are without question claiming through and under Tran, who was the insured as defined in the policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-7\"><em>Diep, </em>126 Md.App. at 143, 727 A.2d at 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">The sentence in <em>Ford </em>on which the Court of Special Appeals relies reiterates one aspect of the holding in <em>Price. Price </em>involved the slayer\u2019s claim to a husband\u2019s fifty percent share, under the facts of that case, in the victim\u2019s intestate estate. 164 Md. at 507, 165 A. at 471. There, although the husband committed suicide almost immediately after the murder, there was a brief interval during which he survived his murdered wife so that the claim to the fifty percent share was asserted by the heirs and personal representatives of the deceased slayer. The claim of the heirs and personal representatives was by and through the slayer because they claimed in the right of the slayer as surviving spouse. The Court rejected the claim by and through the briefly surviving spouse, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>because the heirs and personal representatives were disqualified themselves by the slayer\u2019s rule, but because the slayer, at the instant of the murder, lost his interest in the victim\u2019s estate. <em>Id. </em>at 508,165 A. at 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">The foregoing is made plain by the passage in the <em>Price </em>opinion in which the Court rejects an argument that application of the slayer\u2019s rule violated Article 27 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The opinion in <em>Price </em>in relevant part reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-6\">\u201cIn the view that we take of the case, the constitutional and statutory prohibition against corruption of blood and forfeiture of estate by conviction has no application, because by reason of his murderous act the husband never acquired a beneficial interest in any part of his wife\u2019s estate. These provisions apply to the forfeiture of an estate held by the criminal at the time of the commission of the crime, or which he might thereafter become legally or equitably entitled to. In other words, it is a constitutional declaration against forfeiture for a general conviction of crime. There can be no forfeiture without first having beneficial use or possession. One cannot forfeit what he never had. The surviving husband in the case before us, never having acquired any interest in his wife\u2019s estate, there is nothing upon which the constitutional or statutory prohibition can operate. By virtue of his act he is prevented from acquiring property which he would otherwise have acquired, but does not forfeit an estate which he possessed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-7\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">In the instant matter the petitioners do not claim through or under or in the right of Tran. Because Tran murdered Maria Rivas, he never acquired the right to collect the death benefits, just as the murderer in <em>Price </em>never acquired the right to take as surviving husband under the inheritance statutes. Further, if the insurance policy in the instant matter named Tran as the sole beneficiary, and his personal representative sought to collect from CNA on Tran\u2019s purported contract right, the \u201cthrough or under\u201d language from <em>Ford </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>would be applicable. Similarly, the \u201cthrough or under\u201d language could ordinarily be applicable if Tran were the sole beneficiary, had murdered his wife but did not commit suicide, and then assigned his purported claim to the Policy proceeds to an innocent third party. Tran could not assign that which he did not possess.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Here, the facts do not fall within the \u201cthrough or under\u201d statement from Ford. The petitioners do not claim in the right of Tran. They claim based on the promise made by CNA to pay \u201cthe surviving person or persons in the first of the following classes of successive preference beneficiaries of which a member survives the Insured.\u201d Their claim is in their own right as contingent beneficiaries under the contract of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">In cases involving life insurance, where the policy provides both for a primary beneficiary and a contingent beneficiary and where the primary beneficiary is disqualified under the slayer\u2019s rule, the majority rule awards the policy proceeds to an innocent contingent beneficiary. In these cases typically the contest is between the estate of the insured and the contingent beneficiary. <em>See, e.g., Life Ins. Co. v. Cashatt, </em>206 F.Supp. 410 (E.D.Va.1962); <em>Spencer v. Floyd, </em>30 Ark.App. 230, 785 S.W.2d 60 (1990); <em>Beck v. West Coast Life Ins. Co., </em>38 Cal.2d 643, 241 P.2d 544 (1952) (opinion by Justice Traynor); <em>Seidlitz v.

In these cases the courts reason, expressly or impliedly, that looking to the terms of the contract best effectuates the intent of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">The minority position is that if the primary beneficiary survives the insured, but is disqualified under the slayer\u2019s rule, then the insured\u2019s estate recovers, rather than the contingent beneficiary, because the contingency that the primary beneficiary predecease the insured has not been satisfied. <em>See Beck v. Downey, </em>191 F.2d 150 (9th Cir.1951), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>343 U.S. 912, 72 S.Ct. 646, 96 L.Ed. 1328, <em>reaff'd, </em>198 F.2d 626, <em>cert. denied, </em>344 U.S. 875, 73 S.Ct. 170, 97 L.Ed. 678 (1952); <em>Webb v.

Coleman, </em>726 S.W.2d 9 (Tex.1987) (based on statute); <em>Dowdell v. Bell, </em>477 P.2d 170 (Wyo.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">In the instant case the condition for payment to any contingent beneficiary has not been met because Tran, the \u201cInsured,\u201d briefly survived his spouse. As a matter of substance, however, Tran, because of his suicide, cannot benefit in any way from an award of the proceeds to the petitioners. Compare <em>Prudential Ins. Co. of America v. Athmer, </em>178 F.3d 473, 478, 476 (7th Cir.) (opining that Illinois rule \u201crequir[ing] the trial court to make a factual determination whether allowing a relative of the murderer to take ... is likely to confer a substantial benefit on [the murderer] ... requires an inherently speculative judgment about the future and an investigation of family relations quite likely to be of Faulknerian opacity\u201d and \u201cimpress[es] on the benefits a kind of reverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>constructive trust placing them forever beyond the murderer\u2019s reach\u201d), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Athmer v. Hill, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 120 S.Ct. 342, 145 L.Ed.2d 267 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">Most of the cases that follow the majority rule differ from the instant matter in that the insured-victim was also the owner of the policy and selected the contingent beneficiaries. Here Tran, by not specially designating beneficiaries, left in effect as contingent beneficiaries the classes of persons predetermined in the Policy. This is not a difference of substance under the facts of this case. Tran\u2019s default selection of contingent beneficiaries seems to have been made more than five years before the murder. What is more important, there is not a suggestion that the petitioners were accomplices in that crime. Further, even if one assumes that a motive on the part of the murderer to benefit innocent contingent beneficiaries were relevant, there is no evidence of such a motive presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">A distinction was drawn between the naming of contingent beneficiaries by the insured-victim and the naming of contingent beneficiaries by the slayer-owner in <em>Estate of Jeffers, </em>134 Cal.App.3d 729, 182 Cal.Rptr. 300 (1982). There a wife, approximately six months after designating a trust for the benefit of her children as the contingent beneficiary of a policy on her husband, murdered her husband and then committed suicide. The court held that the proceeds were payable to the estate of the insured, reasoning that \u201cthe primary beneficiary who killed the insured should be denied the right <em>by any means </em>to specify the recipient of the insurance proceeds and thereby profit from [her] own wrong.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">The rule enunciated in <em>Estate of Jeffers </em>outruns the reach of the Maryland public policy underlying the slayer\u2019s rule in this State. This Court, in <em>Price, </em>164 Md. at 511-12, 165 A. at 472-73, quoted extensively from the opinions in <em>Cleaver v. Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association, </em>1 Q.B. 147 (1892). The reach of the slayer\u2019s rule in Maryland substantially coincides with the statement found in the opinion of Lord Justice Fry in <em>Cleaver </em>where he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>\u201c[T]he rule of public policy should be applied so as to exclude from benefit the criminal and all claiming under her, but not so as to exclude alternative or independent rights.... In a word, it appears to me that the crime of one person may prevent that person from the assertion of what would otherwise be a right, and may accelerate or beneficially affect the rights of third persons, but can never prejudice or injuriously affect those rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 159-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">In its opinion in the instant matter the Court of Special Appeals, when directing that the insurance proceeds be paid to the respondent, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-8\">\u201cThe payment provisions for loss of life of an insured family member ... are payable to the insured, if living, \u2018otherwise in the same manner as above.\u2019 A reasonable interpretation of the phrase \u2018in the same manner as above\u2019 means to follow the schedule of successive beneficiaries of the deceased family member. It does not mean to select the next in line of the insured\u2019s family.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-9\"><em>Diep, </em>126 Md.App. at 145, 727 A.2d at 454. We do not read the above-quoted passage to set forth an interpretation of the Policy, absent imposition of the slayer\u2019s rule. That reading would conflict with the interpretation of the Policy by the Court of Special Appeals described in Part I, <em>supra, </em>with which we agree. Further, if the above-quoted passage represented the interpretation of the Policy, absent the slayer\u2019s rule overlay, there would have been no need for the Court of Special Appeals to apply the slayer\u2019s rule to the petitioners, and that court would have awarded the respondent the proceeds by the terms of the Policy. Rather, we read the above-quoted passage to be a \u201creasonable interpretation\u201d when, in the view of the Court of Special Appeals, the petitioners were disqualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>Our prior rulings in this opinion require rejection of the solution applied by the Court of Special Appeals. First, the petitioners are not barred under the slayer\u2019s rule.

For reasons not material here, CNA had not deposited the contested $150,-000. in the registry of the circuit court after the court authorized that deposit. Thus the circuit court included in its final judgment an order to CNA to pay interest on the death benefits from the time that the circuit court had authorized or directed deposit of the proceeds in the registry to the time when the order was signed that resulted in the final judgment. Petitioners contend that additional prejudgment interest should have been awarded for the period from the petitioners' demand on CNA for payment to the time when prejudgment interest began to run as ordered by the circuit court. This prejudgment interest issue was not included by the petitioners in their petition for certiorari, and we do not consider it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
