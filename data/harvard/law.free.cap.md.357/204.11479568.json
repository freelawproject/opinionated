At trial Hernandez testified in Spanish, through an interpreter. Hernandez here contends that the trial court improperly refused to propound his requested <em>voir dire </em>question sixteen, reading, \u201cIs there any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>member of the panel who would be prejudiced against a defendant because of any defendant\u2019s race, color, religion, sexual orientation, appearance, or sex?\u201d As more fully explained below, because prejudice based on race was raised by the request, but the trial court did not inquire specifically as to that possible bias, we shall order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">The State proved that Hernandez had vaginal intercourse with the then nine year old daughter of the woman with whom he lived. Hernandez testified that, in 1990, he came to the United States from El Salvador where he had been raised and that he speaks English poorly. In this Court, he describes the victim as Hispanic.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The Spanish interpreter who assisted Hernandez throughout the trial was introduced to the prospective jurors prior to the <em>voir dire, </em>as was Hernandez. In its opening remarks to the venire, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">\u201cWhat we are looking for is jurors who will approach this case with an open mind, and who are willing to listen closely to all of the evidence presented by either side. We are looking for jurors who will render a fair and impartial verdict based on the evidence presented in this courtroom and the law as it pertains to this case. Jurors must be as free as humanly possible from prejudice, sympathy, and preconceived ideas for or against either party.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The court also asked whether any of the prospective jurors \u201chave any bias or prejudice either for or against the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Later in the <em>voir dire </em>process, during a bench conference, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Also [Question] No. 16 the defendant because of his race, color, religion, sexual orientation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-10\">\u201cThe Court: I already asked them if there was any reason \u2014 do you have any bias or prejudice either for or against the defendant? I think that has been covered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-11\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: That is okay. I am just checking.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>After discussing other voir dire questions, the prosecutor returned to the proposed question on bias, raising concerns about question sixteen:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-5\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: If I can say one thing, Your Honor, this is out of an abundance of caution. I think I have seen some cases that dealt with No. 16 basically saying [that] if they ask, they shall receive. I know your Honor asked a broader question, but ... just so there is not an issue at all, I would urge the Court to go ahead and ask No. 16 in terms of <em>the racial question. </em>I think I have seen an appellate opinion to do with voir dire on that, and that makes me a little bit nervous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">\u201cThe Court: Well I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: I know you asked it in a general sense of bias, but I think this might help to be a little more specific just to insulate the record. Maybe you could throw in against the defendant or the witness. I mean, <em>you could put the race </em>on the other side also.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-8\">\u201cThe Court: Well, I have already asked them, Do you have any. bias or prejudice either for or against the defendant? And what you are asking me to do is ask the question, \u2018Is there anybody who would be prejudiced against the defendant because of his race, color, religion, sexual orientation\u2019?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-9\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: I am not saying you should have to. I am just saying out of an abundance of caution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-10\">\u201cThe Court: I think it is clearly covered.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">Three months after the jury found Hernandez guilty, his motion for a new trial was heard. While conceding that \u201c[question sixteen] may not be the most artfully drafted question,\u201d Hernandez argued that it sufficiently \u201ctouch[ed] on the key issue ... [of] racial prejudice.\u201d He submitted that, under Maryland law, when \u201cthe judge is asked to do something along specifically racial grounds, there is no more ... discretion. It is something that has to be done.\u201d He did not believe, however, that \u201cit goes so far [as] to say, \u2018Is anyone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>prejudiced against African Americans or Hispanic or anything like that.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">It was at this argument on the motion for a new trial that Hernandez was first expressly referred to as being of the \u201cHispanic\u201d race. That reference was by the State. Basically, the State argued that an accused ordinarily is entitled to a <em>voir dire </em>question directed to the race of the accused only if the accused \u201cclaims meaningful ethnic differences between himself and the victim.\u201d That rule, the State submitted, did not apply to the prosecution of Hernandez, because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-5\">\u201cwhat you have in this case was a complete hodge-podge when you talk about the racial components of this case. The State called black witnesses, white witnesses, Hispanic witnesses \u2014 the victim and the eye witness being Hispanic. The defense called Mr. Hernandez, called some coworkers that were Hispanic, called coworkers that were white. I mean, we were all over the place in terms of the racial mix. And it is kind of an offensive notion to have to delve into that, because ... there is no evidence of racial prejudice [creeping] in.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The judge denied the motion on the ground that potential prejudice was adequately covered by the questions asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">On appeal, Hernandez raised, among other issues, whether \u201cthe trial court err[ed] by refusing to propound a requested question on <em>voir dire </em>relating to racial bias.\u201d In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed. That court noted that, although \u201c[i]t would be an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion to fail when requested to propound a question regarding racial bias,\u201d it is not an abuse of discretion \u201cif the substance of the information sought by the defense is fairly covered by another question asked by the court.\u201d The court held that \u201cthe measures taken by the [trial] court, considering the identification of the defendant and use of an interpreter, sufficiently covered the substance of [Hernandez\u2019s] proposed instruction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Hernandez petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, framing the question presented as whether \u201ca non-specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>question regarding bias [is] sufficient <em>voir dire </em>in the trial of a Hispanic defendant when both the defense and the prosecution request that the court propound a specific question designed to elicit racial bias?\u201d We granted the writ. <em>Hernandez v. State, </em>354 Md. 570, 731 A.2d 969 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">In this Court, Hernandez contends that \u201c[t]he <em>voir dire </em>inquiry proposed by the defense was directed to a specific cause for disqualification, bias against an Hispanic defendant on account of his race.\u201d Alternatively, he contends that, under <em>Contee v. State, </em>223 Md. 575, 165 A.2d 889 (1960), the trial court erred by not itself formulating a proper question. On the other hand the State contends that the circumstances of this particular case do not require a <em>voir dire </em>question concerning prejudice against Hispanic persons and that the questions actually asked were sufficient. The State does not directly challenge Hernandez\u2019s assumption that Hispanic persons comprise or are recognized as an identifiable race.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The contentions of both parties are best answered by reviewing the evolution of federal and Maryland law on <em>voir dire </em>concerning racial prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">A. Federal Case Law</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">At the federal level, the development of <em>voir dire </em>with respect to the issue of race began in <em>Aldridge v. United States, </em>283 U.S. 308, 51 S.Ct. 470, 75 L.Ed. 1054 (1931). In that capital case, the Court reversed the conviction by a white jury of an African-American man, who had been found guilty of shooting a white police officer, because the trial court had refused the defendant\u2019s request to propound a \u201cquestion relative to racial prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 310, 51 S.Ct. at 471, 75 L.Ed. at 1056. Speaking in the language of its time, the Court reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-10\">\u201cBut the question is not as to the civil privileges of the negro [such as serving on juries, permitted at that time in the District of Columbia], or as to the dominant sentiment of the community and the general absence [therein] of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>disqualifying prejudice, but as to the bias of the particular jurors who are to try the accused.... [I]f any one of them was shown to entertain a prejudice which would preclude his rendering a fair verdict, a gross injustice would be perpetrated in allowing him to sit. Despite the privileges accorded to the negro, we do not think that it can be said that the possibility of such prejudice is so remote as to justify the risk in forbidding the inquiry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 314, 51 S.Ct. at 473, 75 L.Ed. at 1058 (footnote omitted). Thus, the \u201cessential demands of fairness\u201d required the trial court to propound the requested question in light of the non-remote possibility of disqualifying prejudice in the individual members of the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 310, 51 S.Ct. at 471, 75 L.Ed. at 1056.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">In <em>Ham v. South Carolina, </em>409 U.S. 524, 93 S.Ct. 848, 35 L.Ed.2d 46 (1973), the Court, noting that <em>Aldridge </em>\u201cwas not expressly grounded upon any constitutional requirement,\u201d first addressed a requested, race-oriented <em>voir dire </em>question as a constitutional issue. <em>Id. </em>at 526, 93 S.Ct. at 850, 35 L.Ed.2d at 50. In that case, a South Carolina jury convicted an African-American man of possession of marijuana; the defendant, who asserted that he had been framed by the police in retaliation for his civil rights activity, requested two <em>voir dire </em>questions that \u201csought to elicit any possible racial prejudice against Negroes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 525, 93 S.Ct. at 850, 35 L.Ed.2d at 49. The trial judge refused to propound these questions on the ground that this issue was covered by more general questions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Supreme Court reversed. Noting that one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>purpose of the Due Process Clause is, in the language of <em>Aldridge, </em>\u201cto insure these \u2018essential demands of fairness,\u2019 \u201d and that the \u201cFourteenth Amendment was [adopted] to prohibit the States from invidiously discriminating on the basis of race,\u201d the Court held that constitutional due process requires that \u201cunder the facts shown by this record the petitioner be permitted to have jurors interrogated on the issue of racial bias.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 526-27, 93 S.Ct. at 850, 35 L.Ed.2d at 50. By reversing the conviction, the Court indicated that, despite its recognition of a trial judge\u2019s broad discretion as to the number and form of <em>voir dire </em>questions, the more general questions propounded by the South Carolina trial court failed adequately to address the issue of racial bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Three years later, the United States Supreme Court limited the reach of <em>Ham </em>to cases in which the circumstances of the crime \u201csuggest a significant likelihood that racial prejudice might infect [a defendant\u2019s] trial.\u201d <em>Ristaino v. Ross, </em>424 U.S. 589, 598, 96 S.Ct. 1017, 1022, 47 L.Ed.2d 258, 265 (1976). In <em>Ristaino, </em>the Court upheld the conviction of an African-American defendant for the assault and battery and armed robbery of a white security guard. The trial judge had propounded general questions on bias, which resulted in the elimination of one veniremember for racial prejudice, but had denied the defendant\u2019s request that the venire \u201cbe questioned specifically about racial prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 590, 96 S.Ct. at 1018, 47 L.Ed.2d at 261. The Court asserted that <em>\u201cHam </em>did not announce a requirement of universal applicability,\u201d but instead applies when \u201cunder all of the circumstances presented there [is] a constitutionally significant likelihood that, absent questioning about racial prejudice, the jurors would not be as \u2018indifferent as [they stand] unsworne.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 596, 96 S.Ct. at 1021, 47 L.Ed.2d at 264 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Coke on Littleton </em>155b (19th ed. 1832)). By contrast to <em>Ham, </em>which involved a civil rights worker whose defense of police retaliation was \u201clikely to intensify any prejudice that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>individual members of the jury might harbor,\u201d <em>Ristaino </em>involved \u201c[t]he mere fact that the victim of the crimes alleged was a white man and the defendants were Negroes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597, 597, 96 S.Ct. at 1021, 1022, 47 L.Ed.2d at 264, 265. According to the <em>Ristaino </em>Court, this fact was not sufficient to require, as a constitutional matter, that a requested <em>voir dire </em>question on the issue of racial bias be propounded to the venire panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Despite the assertion that <em>Ham </em>had not announced a rule of universal applicability, the <em>Ristaino </em>Court\u2019s reasoning indicated a narrowing of precedent. <em>Ham </em>articulated the principle that, if a juror is racially biased, then the jury\u2019s decision cannot be impartial. This principle implies that a requested, racially specific <em>voir dire </em>question is warranted, so long as there is a non-remote possibility that a juror could be biased, regardless of the circumstances of the case. By contrast, Ristaino\u2019s decision that a trial judge is required to grant a racially specific <em>voir dire </em>question only under special circumstances implies that a juror could \u201charbor\u201d prejudice, but that this prejudice would only become operative if the facts of the case were likely \u201cto intensify\u201d that prejudice. In other words, the <em>Ristaino </em>Court viewed racial prejudice as a latent attitude that becomes effective only under particular, racially-charged circumstances.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">In 1981, as a matter of federal common law, a plurality of the United States Supreme Court opined that a <em>voir dire </em>question directed specifically at racial bias should be required \u201cin certain circumstances in which such an inquiry is not constitutionally mandated.\u201d <em>Rosales-Lopez v. United States, </em>451 U.S. 182, 190, 101 S.Ct. 1629, 1635, 68 L.Ed.2d 22, 30 (1981) (plurality opinion).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In that case, the Court upheld the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>conviction of a man \u201cof Mexican descent\u201d for illegally transporting aliens across the Unites States border. The trial court had refused the defendant\u2019s request to ask prospective jurors if they would \u201c \u2018consider the race or Mexican descent of [the defendant] in [their] evaluation of this case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 185, 101 S.Ct. at 1633, 68 L.Ed.2d at 26. Although the \u201cindications of the likelihood of racial or ethnic prejudice\u201d were not substantial enough to \u201camount to an unconstitutional abuse of discretion,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 190, 101 S.Ct. at 1635, 68 L.Ed.2d at 29, the plurality would require the <em>voir dire </em>question as a matter of federal common law when there is a \u201c \u2018reasonable possibility' that racial prejudice would influence the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192, 101 S.Ct. at 1636, 68 L.Ed.2d at 31. The plurality noted that this is always so when a violent interracial crime is involved, but that it was not so in the case of the \u201cvictimless crime[ ][of] aiding members of [the defendant\u2019s] own ethnic group to gain illegal entry into the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The plurality seemed to reject a rule of per se harmful error on the ground that determining the nonconstitutional standard of mandatory <em>voir dire </em>questions \u201cinvolv[es] the [issue of the] appearance of justice in the federal courts,\u201d and that \u201crequiring an inquiry in every case is likely to create the impression \u2018that justice in a court of law may turn upon the pigmentation of skin [or] the accident of birth.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190, 101 S.Ct. at 1635, 68 L.Ed.2d at 30 (last alteration in original) (quoting <em>Ristaino, </em>424 U.S. at 596 n. 8, 96 S.Ct. at 1021 n. 8, 47 L.Ed.2d at 264 n. 8).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">In summary, under current federal law, a defendant has a Fourteenth Amendment right to have a trial court propound a requested <em>voir dire </em>question, specifically directed to uncovering racial bias, if the case involves special circumstances, of the sort in <em>Ham, </em>in which \u201cracial issues [are] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>\u2018inextricably bound up \"with the conduct of the trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rosales-Lopez, </em>451 U.S. at 189, 101 S.Ct. at 1635, 68 L.Ed.2d at 29 (quoting <em>Ristaino, </em>424 U.S. at 597, 96 S.Ct. at 1021, 47 L.Ed.2d at 264). Moreover, a defendant has a nonconstitu-tional right in a federal criminal trial to have such a question propounded when there is a \u201c \u2018reasonable possibility\u2019 that racial prejudice would influence the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192, 101 S.Ct. at 1636, 68 L.Ed.2d at 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">B. Maryland Case Law</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">From a rule that apparently universally required <em>voir dire </em>inquiry into racial prejudice, Maryland law moved to a limitation on the rule to cases in which racial bias is more likely to be an issue. This Court\u2019s most recent decision, however, in <em>Hill v. State, </em>339 Md. 275, 661 A.2d 1164 (1995), returns to a more expansive rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">In <em>Brown v. State, </em>220 Md. 29, 150 A.2d 895 (1959), the Court reversed the conviction of an African-American defendant for shooting a police officer because the trial court had refused \u201cto ask any [of the requested] questions as to the bias or prejudice which jurors might have as to a Negro, and as to whether the jury could give the defendant as fair and impartial a trial as they could a white man.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34, 150 A.2d at 897. Relied upon was the reasoning of <em>State v. Higgs, </em>143 Conn. 138, 120 A.2d 152 (1956), a case involving the alleged rape of a white woman by an African-American man, which held that the state constitutional right to trial by an impartial jury required that, \u201cif there is any likelihood that some prejudice is in the juror\u2019s mind which will even subconsciously affect his decision of the case, the party who may be adversely affected should be permitted questions designed to uncover that prejudice.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>220 Md. at 35, 150 A.2d at 897-98 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Higgs, </em>120 A.2d at 154). The Court also relied upon the similar reasoning of <em>Aldridge, </em>which conceived the issue \u201cnot as ... [turning on] the dominant sentiment of the community and the general absence of disqualifying prejudice, but ... [on] the bias of the particular jurors who were to try the accused.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>220 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Md. at 35-36, 150 A.2d at 898. Thus, <em>Brown </em>required a trial judge to propound a criminal defendant\u2019s requested <em>voir dire </em>question when it was designed to uncover racial bias \u201c[s]o long as race prejudice exists, even in a relatively few persons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35, 150 A.2d at 898 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Higgs, </em>120 A.2d at 154).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">In <em>Contee v. State, </em>223 Md. 575, 165 A.2d 889 (1960), an African-American man was convicted of raping a white woman. The conviction was reversed because, under circumstances described in Part II, <em>infra, </em>the trial court should have asked \u201ca proper question designed to ascertain the existence of cause for disqualification on account of racial bias or prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 580, 165 A.2d at 893. Although we characterized this case as one \u201clikely to have aroused some racial feelings,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 580, 165 A.2d at 892, nothing in the reasoning of <em>Contee </em>suggested that <em>Brown, </em>on which <em>Contee </em>relied, was limited to cases of this nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\"><em>Humphreys v. State, </em>227 Md. 115, 175 A.2d 777 (1961), also involved the conviction of an African-American man for raping a white woman. The trial court propounded four of the defendant\u2019s requested <em>voir dire </em>questions, which asked specifically about \u201cprejudice against the Negro,\u201d but refused to propound even more specific questions concerning prejudice with respect to the rape of a white woman by an African-American. <em>Id. </em>at 119, 175 A.2d at 778-79. The Court held that, even if such specific questions were required, the overall context \u2014 including the introduction of the defendant at trial to the jurors, the statement of the charge at the beginning of the case, and the actually propounded <em>voir dire </em>questions concerning racial prejudice \u2014 was such that \u201cthe jurors could not fail to understand ... that the case involved the rape of a white woman by\u201d an African-American defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 120, 175 A.2d at 779. Although we characterized the rule in <em>Contee </em>and <em>Brown </em>to mean that inquiry into racial prejudice is proper \u201cin a case where prejudice against the Negro race may be a factor in determining a prospective juror\u2019s attitude toward a particular defendant,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 118, 175 A.2d at 778, this case did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>not expressly require that such an inquiry be limited to this type of situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Indeed, ten years later, in <em>Tunstall v. State, </em>12 Md.App. 723, 280 A.2d 275 (1971), the court reversed the conviction of two African-American defendants for armed robbery on the ground that the trial judge refused to propound the requested <em>voir dire </em>question concerning whether a juror would \u201cbe more likely to believe a white witness rather than a Negro witness?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 726, 280 A.2d at 277. The court did so without identifying the race of the victim(s) or the witness(es), and without identifying any particular, racially-charged circumstance that would warrant the requested <em>voir dire </em>question. <em>Id. </em>at 726-27, 280 A.2d at 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Subsequent to <em>Ham v. South Carolina, </em>409 U.S. 524, 93 S.Ct. 848, 35 L.Ed.2d 46 (1973), however, the Court of Special Appeals began to limit the application of the rule first articulated in <em>Brown. </em>In <em>Thornton v. State, </em>31 Md.App. 205, 355 A.2d 767 (1976), the court overturned the conviction of an African-American defendant for receiving stolen goods on a ground unrelated to a requested <em>voir dire </em>question. Nonetheless, the court addressed the defendant\u2019s requested question, concerning whether a juror would \u201cnot believe a witness because that witness was black.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217, 355 A.2d at 773. The court reasoned that, in light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Ham </em>and <em>Ristaino, </em>and in light of the Court of Appeals\u2019 language, noted above, in <em>Humphreys </em>(\u201cwhere prejudice against the Negro race may be a factor\u201d) and in <em>Contee </em>(\u201ca case of this type ... is likely to have aroused some racial feelings\u201d), then \u201c[i]n the absence of some special circumstance warranting an inquiry as to racial prejudice, such examination is not mandated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 215, 355 A.2d at 773. Explicitly limiting <em>Tunstall, </em>the Court of Special Appeals concluded that \u201c[i]t is the circumstances of the case which cause dormant prejudices to stir.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 216, 355 A.2d at 773. This reasoning comports with the view implicit in <em>Ristaino, </em>that a juror could \u201charbor\u201d prejudice, but that this prejudice would only become operative if the facts of the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>were likely \u201cto intensify\u201d that prejudice. <em>See Ristaino, </em>424 U.S. at 597, 96 S.Ct. at 1021, 47 L.Ed.2d at 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Similarly, in <em>Holmes v. State, </em>65 Md.App. 428, 501 A.2d 76 (1985), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>310 Md. 260, 528 A.2d 1279 (1987), the Court of Special Appeals noted that \u201cspecial circumstances warranting <em>voir dire </em>as to racial bias must exist before such examination is mandated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438, 501 A.2d at 80-81. Reviewing previous cases, the court found that these special circumstances exist when \u201cthe issue of racial prejudice [is] fairly generated,\u201d and that this occurs \u201cwhen the complainant and the witnesses for the State are of a different race than the defendant, and the crime involves victimization of another person and the use of violence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438-39, 501 A.2d at 81 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">This Court rested its rationale heavily on special circumstances in <em>Bowie v. State, </em>324 Md. 1, 595 A.2d 448 (1991). There we reversed the conviction of an African-American defendant for first degree murder and other charges because the trial court had refused to propound a racially specific <em>voir dire </em>question. Citing <em>Holmes, </em>we then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">\u201c[I]t is patent that the trial court erred in refusing to inquire concerning possible racial prejudice. All but one of the victims and most of the witnesses for the State were white. On the other hand, appellant is an African-American. Moreover, this case involves the violent victimization of other persons. Consequently, under our cases, inquiry into juror racial bias should have been made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 15-16, 595 A.2d at 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">Thus, at the time of <em>Borne, </em>this Court\u2019s jurisprudence was consistent with that of the United States Supreme Court. That Court has noted, however, that \u201c[t]he States ... are free to allow or require <em>[voir dire </em>] questions not demanded by the [United States] Constitution.\u201d <em>Ristaino, </em>424 U.S. at 597 n. 9, 96 S.Ct. at 1022 n. 9, 47 L.Ed.2d at 265 n. 9. This Court began to do so in <em>Hill v. State, </em>339 Md. 275, 661 A.2d 1164 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">In <em>Hill, </em>an African-American defendant was convicted by a jury of possession of cocaine and possession with intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>distribute. The State\u2019s only witness was a white police officer. <em>Id. </em>at 277, 661 A.2d at 1165. The defendant challenged the conviction based on the trial court\u2019s refusal to inquire into racial bias during <em>voir dire. </em>In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals had affirmed on the ground that the charges did not reflect the use of violence and thus, under <em>Holmes, </em>failed to present special circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 278, 661 A.2d at 1166. We reversed, despite the lack of interracial violence, holding that \u201cas a matter of Maryland nonconstitu-tional criminal law, ... the refusal to ask a <em>voir dire </em>question on racial or ethnic bias or prejudice under the circumstances of this case constituted reversible error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 285, 661 A.2d at 1169. In so doing, we embraced \u201cin total[ ] the <em>Aldridge </em>analysis,\u201d and held that \u201c[t]o the extent that our cases and those of the Court of Special Appeals are to the contrary, they are, to that extent, overruled.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The <em>Aldridge </em>analysis, as noted, hinged the necessity of inquiry into racial bias, not on the notion that the factual circumstances of the case generate the issue, but on the possibility of \u201cthe bias of the particular jurors who are to try the accused.\u201d <em>Aldridge, </em>283 U.S. at 314, 51 S.Ct. at 473, 75 L.Ed. at 1058. As the Court stated, \u201cif any one of [the jurors] was shown to entertain a prejudice which would preclude his rendering a fair verdict, a gross injustice would be perpetrated in allowing him to sit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the focus of <em>Aldridge </em>is on the possible bias of the individual jurors and not on the factual circumstances of the case, our embrace of the <em>Aldridge </em>analysis in <em>Hill </em>was simultaneously a rejection of the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d limitation that had developed in both federal and Maryland case law. This return to our earlier jurisprudence responds to at least four factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">First, the cases that the <em>Aldridge </em>Court discussed in arriving at the proposition that a requested <em>voir dire </em>question on racial bias is mandatory were not limited to special circumstances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Prior to <em>Rosales-Lopez, </em>the United States Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Appeals for the Fourth Circuit recognized this. <em>See United States v. Gore, </em>435 F.2d 1110, 1111, 1112 (4th Cir.1970) (stating that <em>\u201cAldridge </em>does not expressly limit its holding to crimes of interracial violence,\u201d and noting that \u201cthe Court derived the rule it announced from sources that did not attach controlling significance to whether or not the crime involved persons of the same race\u201d); <em>see also Rosales-Lopez, </em>451 U.S. at 197, 101 S.Ct. at 1639, 68 L.Ed.2d at 34 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (noting that <em>Aldridge </em>\u201cfollowed a long line of state-court decisions,\u201d and that neither <em>Aldridge </em>itself nor \u201cthe reasoning in the state-court opinions ... relied on such special circumstances\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The second reason concerns how the racial bias of jurors might impact a verdict. Under the <em>Ristaino </em>rule, it is thought that a juror could be biased, and yet that this juror could evaluate a case involving a minority defendant fairly, unless \u201c[rjacial issues ... [are] inextricably bound up with the conduct of the trial,\u201d or unless special circumstances exist that would \u201cintensify any prejudice that individual members of the jury might harbor.\u201d <em>Ristaino, </em>424 U.S. at 597, 96 S.Ct. at 1021, 47 L.Ed.2d at 264. <em>Aldridge, </em>by contrast, assumes that it is worthwhile to inquire into prejudice because the risk of its presence is not remote, and because \u201cif any one of [the jurors] was shown to entertain a prejudice which would preclude his rendering a fair verdict, [then] a gross injustice would be perpetrated in allowing him to sit.\u201d <em>Aldridge, </em>283 U.S. at 314, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>51 S.Ct. at 473, 75 L.Ed. at 1058. It is more realistic to believe that bias will impair impartiality whether the case presents special circumstances or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Third, the <em>Ristaino </em>special circumstances limitation rests in part on the ground that \u201crequiring an inquiry in every case is likely to create the impression \u2018that justice in a court of law may turn upon the pigmentation of skin [or] the accident of birth.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rosales-Lopez, </em>451 U.S. at 190, 101 S.Ct. at 1635, 68 L.Ed.2d at 30 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Ristaino, </em>424 U.S. at 596 n. 8, 96 S.Ct. at 1021 n. 8, 47 L.Ed.2d at 264 n. 8). This Court struck \u201ca different balance.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>339 Md. at 284, 661 A.2d at 1168. When a minority defendant requests an inquiry into racial bias on <em>voir dire, </em>the defendant seeks to exclude those who might be influenced by such factors. This process creates the impression, not that \u201cjustice in a court of law may turn upon\u201d race, but instead that racial bias will not be tolerated in members of a jury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Fourth, not requiring \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d facilitates the ultimate disposition of cases. Circuit court judges need not concern themselves over whether the facts of the case meet the special circumstances standard. Further, under the procedures we announce in Part IV, <em>infra, </em>the burden of making the inquiry ordinarily will be slight, particularly in comparison to the expenditure of resources involved in a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">C. The State\u2019s Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">The State contends that, although <em>Hill </em>\u201cwent beyond the standard previously stated by the Supreme Court and prior Maryland cases by eliminating the violent crime requirement,\u201d the decision \u201cwas nevertheless tethered to \u2018the circumstances of this case,\u2019 i.e., the fact that the State\u2019s sole witness was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>white and the defendant was African-American.\u201d Brief of Respondent at 8-9. The State cites <em>Davis v. State, </em>333 Md. 27, 633 A.2d 867 (1993), for the proposition that \u201c[b]ias on the part of prospective jurors will never be presumed, and the challenging party bears the burden of presenting facts ... which would give rise to a showing of actual prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38, 633 A.2d at 872 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Borman v. State, </em>1 Md.App. 276, 279, 229 A.2d 440, 441-42 (1967)).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">In <em>Davis, </em>a defendant charged with distribution of cocaine and heroin, who contended that at trial \u201cthe sole issue ... [was] the credibility of the police officer as [o]pposed to [the defendant],\u201d <em>id. </em>at 35, 633 A.2d at 871 (ellipsis, and second and third alterations, in original), requested the following <em>voir dire </em>question: \u201c[W]hether anyone on the jury has been a member or is a member of the law enforcement community or whether they have a close relative or friend who is such a member.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33, 633 A.2d at 870. The trial judge did ask whether \u201cany of the jurors is likely to give more or less weight to the testimony of a police officer merely because that person is a police officer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>We rejected Davis\u2019s argument that the trial court erred in refusing to propound his requested question because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">\u201cthe professional, vocational, or social status of a prospective juror is not a dispositive factor establishing cause to disqualify. Rather, the proper focus is on the venire person\u2019s state of mind, and whether there is some bias, prejudice, or preconception. Short of those instances where there is a demonstrably strong correlation between the status in question and a mental state that gives rise to cause for disqualification, mere status or acquaintance is insufficient to establish cause for disqualification of a prospective juror.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 37, 633 A.2d at 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">The portion of <em>Davis </em>on which the State relies simply means that a prospective juror\u2019s <em>status, </em>whether that be professional, social, or whatever, is not by itself a sufficient ground for disqualifying the juror, and that therefore it is within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>discretion of the trial court to deny a requested <em>voir dire </em>question directed to the issue of status. We explicitly distinguished status from \u201cthe venire person\u2019s state of mind,\u201d in which could inhere some \u201cbias, prejudice, or preconception,\u201d that would render the person partial and hence unfit as a juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Accordingly, we reject the State\u2019s reliance on a reduced version of a special circumstances requirement when racial prejudice is the concern to which <em>voir dire </em>is sought to be directed. Based on <em>Hill, </em>Hernandez was entitled to a question on <em>voir dire </em>directed to racial prejudice, if properly requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">In <em>Contee v. State, </em>223 Md. 575, 165 A.2d 889 (1960), an African-American defendant requested questions on racial bias that were improper because \u201cnone was reasonably calculated to elicit or ascertain such bias or prejudice as would disqualify a prospective juror from rendering a fair and impartial verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 580, 165 A.2d at 892. Nonetheless, this Court reversed the conviction because \u201cthe [trial] court failed to ask <em>on its own motion, </em>as it should have done, a proper question designed to ascertain the existence of cause for disqualification on account of racial bias or prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 580, 165 A.2d at 893 (emphasis added). The trial court ought to have done so because the requested questions, although improper, \u201cfully apprised [the trial court] of the essence of what the defendant was seeking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The requested improper questions were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">\u201c3. Whether any juror had ever \u2018belonged to or been affiliated with any organization that had to do with segregation of the races?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">\u201c4. Whether any juror believed \u2018in segregation?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-9\">\u201c5. Whether any juror had \u2018an opinion as to\u2019 the impropriety of \u2018people of the white race\u2019 having \u2018sexual intercourse with people of the colored race?\u2019 and if so \u2018whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>the opinion was adverse to the race\u2019 of the defendant, who was a Negro?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-4\">\u201c6. Whether any juror would \u2018believe a woman of the white race over the statement of a man of the colored race?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">\u201c8. Whether any juror had \u2018ever been involved personally or through close family association in any criminal matter\u2019 concerning \u2018the prosecution of a colored man\u2019 for an act of violence?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 579,165 A.2d at 892.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Here, question sixteen referred, among other things, to racial bias. After Hernandez had excepted to the failure to ask question sixteen, the State specifically directed the court\u2019s attention to the issue of race, saying, \u201cI think I have seen some cases that dealt with No. 16 basically saying [that] if they ask, they shall receive,\u201d and \u201cI would urge the Court to go ahead and ask No. 16 in terms of the racial question.\u201d The request and exception by the defense, coupled with the State\u2019s clarification, were sufficient to trigger the <em>Contee </em>duty on the trial court to submit a question related to race.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Although, if requested, a <em>voir dire </em>question specifically referring to possible racial bias against the accused must be asked, the question need not be limited exclusively to possible racial bias. Trial courts have a discretion to include, along with the inquiry specifically addressing racial bias, inquiry concerning one or more other possible biases. A trial judge may conclude that a multiple-choice form of question directed to the entire venire may be more effective in eliciting an affirmative response, and that the specifics then can be inquired into when affirmatively responding veniremembers are questioned on an individual basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">A question related to racial bias against Hernandez would have left to the eye of the beholder the matter of identifying Hernandez to a race. Hernandez was introduced to the venire, as was the interpreter. The record does not inform us what Hernandez looks like. He may be a direct descendent of people indigenous to Central America, or of Spanish conquis-tadores, or of people from sub-Saharan Africa, or of some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>combination of the above, or of none of the above. A question related to racial bias would have left the respective venire-members who might be so disposed free to associate Hernandez with that veniremember\u2019s concept of race based on the subjective impression that Hernandez had made on that particular veniremember. Any particular veniremember who bore a bias against persons of the \u201crace\u201d in which that veniremember categorized Hernandez would have been obliged to answer affirmatively a question related to race.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">We hold therefore that a <em>voir dire </em>question as to bias against persons of the defendant\u2019s race should have been asked. This holding does not rest on, and is not limited to, cases where the accused is a member of a cognizable minority group. Under the <em>Aldridge </em>analysis that we adopted in <em>Hill, </em>any defendant, of whatever race, is entitled to have the trial court propound a requested <em>voir dire </em>question specifically directed at uncovering racial bias. The focus under our analysis is the potential bias of a prospective juror. Without regard to the race with which the accused self-identif\u00edes, racial bias can be directed at an accused based on the race to which a prospective juror subjectively assigns the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Whether Hernandez was entitled to a more specific <em>voir dire </em>question as to bias against Hispanics is an issue that we address in Part IV, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">The State argues that, even if Hernandez was entitled to a question on racial bias, the circumstances of the <em>voir dire </em>in this case were such that the trial court fairly covered racial bias. Principal among the circumstances to which the State refers are that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-9\">\u201c[djuring the <em>voir dire, </em>the court asked defense counsel to introduce Hernandez and have him stand. With an interpreter present and translating, he did so. After asking if anyone knew Hernandez, the court asked, \u2018Do any of you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>have any bias or prejudice either for or against the defendant?\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Brief of Respondent at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The cases reviewed in Part I, however, demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s general question on bias was not sufficient to cover racial bias. <em>See Ham, </em>409 U.S. at 526 &amp; n. 3, 93 S.Ct. at 850 <em>&amp; </em>n. 3, 35 L.Ed.2d at 49 &amp; n. 3 (reversing a conviction where the trial court refused to ask specifically about racial bias, but did ask whether prospective jurors were \u201cconscious of any bias or prejudice for or against\u201d the defendant); <em>Hill, </em>339 Md. at 278, 661 A.2d at 1165 (reversing a conviction where the trial court refused to ask specifically about racial bias, but did ask \u201cwhether any member of the jury panel \u2018knew of anything that would keep her or him from giving a fair and impartial verdict\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">As we have stated previously:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">\u201cMerely asking general questions, such as, \u2018is there any reason why you could not render a fair and impartial verdict,\u2019 is not an adequate substitute for properly framed questions designed to highlight specific areas where potential jurors may have biases that could hinder their ability to fairly and impartially decide the case. Those <em>voir dire </em>questions, however, should be framed so as to identify potential jurors with biases which are cause for disqualification, rather than merely identifying potential jurors with attitudes or associations which might facilitate the exercise of peremptory challenges.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-8\"><em>Davis, </em>333 Md. at 47, 633 A.2d at 877.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">Inasmuch as the concern of both the defense and the State was with racial prejudice, the trial court should have asked a question that was designed to have the veniremembers search their respective consciences as to any bias based on the race to which they had subjectively assigned Hernandez.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">As explained in Parts I, II, and III, <em>supra, </em>the trial court erred in not propounding a question related to race. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>State does not contend that, if the trial court erred, the error can be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, our mandate is a reversal for a new trial. Nevertheless, we are constrained to address another argument for the guidance of the trial courts generally in this important area of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">The entire thrust of the Hernandez brief in this Court is that the trial court should have inquired concerning bias against Hispanics. In its brief, the State meets Hernandez on that ground, without directly challenging the step in the argument that moves from a request concerning race to a question concerning Hispanics. The trial court was not obliged, under <em>Contee </em>or otherwise, to take that step absent a specific request from the defendant that incorporated that step.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">To hold otherwise would open a very large can of worms for circuit courts. Although the term \u201cHispanic\u201d in Maryland anti-discrimination law denotes a class of minority persons who are statutorily protected, <em>see </em>Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 9 \u2014 301(d)(2)Cv) of the State Government Article, and although individual prospective jurors could have biases against Hispanic persons, trial courts should not treat \u201cHispanic\u201d as describing a race unless the accused so requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">In <em>Commonwealth v. De La Cruz, </em>405 Mass. 269, 540 N.E.2d 168 (1989), the court considered whether its case law requiring individual <em>voir dire </em>of jurors in certain interracial crimes applied where a Hispanic male was charged with sexually assaulting an eight year old \u201cwhite\u201d girl. 540 N.E.2d at 169. The court held that the rule did not apply because \u201c[ejxcept where the defendant and the alleged victim are clearly members of different races in the traditional sense, we think that the judge on the scene ordinarily is in the best position to determine whether justice and the appearance thereof are best served by individual voir dire of potential jurors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171. Undertaking to explain the \u201ctraditional sense\u201d of race, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\">\u201cThe word, \u2018race,\u2019 has historically referred to any of the three primary divisions of humanity as distinguished by skin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>color: Caucasian, Mongolian, and Negro. Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary 352 (1970). <em>Id. </em>at 69, 278, 288. Thus, this case involves a defendant and an alleged victim of different ethnic backgrounds, not of different races in the traditional sense. The word \u2018Hispanic,\u2019 ordinarily refers, not to race, but to national origin. <em>See Commonwealth v. Aponte, </em>391 Mass. 494, 509, 462 N.E.2d 284 (1984). The term, \u2018Hispanic,\u2019 may refer to persons with various national origins, such as Puerto Rican, Mexican, Cuban, and Spanish, <em>id. </em>at 495 n. 3, 462 N.E.2d 284.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 170. <em>See also Commonwealth v. Burgos, </em>36 Mass.App. Ct. 903, 627 N.E.2d 471, 473 (1994); <em>Commonwealth v. Ramos, </em>31 Mass.App.Ct. 362, 577 N.E.2d 1012, 1014 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The view that \u201cHispanic\u201d is not a race is in accord with the federal government\u2019s scheme for racial and ethnic classification in agency reporting. In the 1970s, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) instituted classifications for the purpose of standardizing the collection of racial and ethnic data among federal agencies. <em>See </em>Transfer of Responsibility for Certain Statistical Standards from OMB to Commerce, Dep\u2019t of Commerce, Directives for the Conduct of Federal Statistical Activities, Directive No. 15, Race and Ethnic Standards for Federal Statistics and Administrative Reporting, 43 Fed.Reg. 19,260, 19,269 (1978) [the Directive]. The Directive listed the following races: (1) American Indian or Alaskan Native; (2) Asian or Pacific Islander; (3) Black; and (4) White. The Directive also listed two ethnicities: (1) Hispanic origin; and (2) Not of Hispanic origin. Allowing for the possibility of using a \u201ccombined format ... to collect racial and ethnic data,\u201d the Directive specified the minimum categories on this approach as follows: (1) American Indian or Alaskan Native; (2) Asian or Pacific Islander; (3) Black, not of Hispanic Origin; (4) Hispanic; and (5) White, not of Hispanic origin. In either case, the OMB defined Hispanic as \u201c[a] person of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American or other Spanish culture or origin, <em>regardless of race.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>While the Directive has been changed in order to allow multi-racial respondents to check more than one box when identifying their race,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it has preserved the same definition of Hispanic just noted. Thus, for over twenty years, the federal government has distinguished \u201cHispanic\u201d as an ethnicity, not a race.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The very attempt to determine whether \u201cHispanic\u201d is a race or ethnicity is difficult in light of conflicting views on the nature of race. Some researchers interpret race to be, not a biological phenomenon, but a social construct. <em>See, e.g., </em>A. Littlefield et al., <em>Redefining Race: The Potential Demise of a Concept in Physical Anthropology, </em>23 Current Anthropology 641, 641 (1982) (noting that \u201cthe race concept has been attacked as invalid because populations of humans separated by significant reproductive barriers and/or exhibiting concordant combinations of variable physical traits cannot be shown to exist\u201d); F.B. Livingstone, <em>On the Non-Existence of Human Races, </em>3 Current Anthropology 279, 279 (1962) (acknowledging that there exists \u201cbiological variability between the populations of organisms which comprise a species,\u201d but advocating that the concept of race be abandoned because \u201cthis variability does not conform to the discrete packages labelled races\u201d); <em>see also Saint Francis College v. Al-Khazraji, </em>481 U.S. 604, 610 n. 4, 107 S.Ct. 2022, 2026 n. 4, 95 L.Ed.2d 582, 590 n. 4 (1987) (citing sources in anthropology for the proposition that \u201crace\u201d is more a sociopolitical concept than a biological one).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Other researchers recognize biological phenomena that are the referent of the concept \u201crace,\u201d but doubt the utility of this concept as a scientific category or classificatory scheme. <em>See, e.g., </em>T. Dobzhansky, <em>Comment, </em>3 Current Anthropology 279, 279-80 (1962) (rejecting the view that \u201cmankind has no races,\u201d but acknowledging that classification of \u201cracially distinct populations\u201d is \u201ca matter of convenience and hence of judgment\u201d); T. Dobzhansky, <em>Introduction, in Science and the Concept of Race </em>77, 78 (M. Mead et al. eds.1968) (acknowledging the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>that \u201cinhabitants of different parts of the world are often visibly different\u201d as the \u201cessence of race as a biological phenomenon,\u201d but doubting the usefulness of race as a scientific category).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Others have argued that race is a biological phenomenon, and- attempt to classify distinct races. <em>See, e.g., </em>C.S. Coon, <em>The Origin of Races </em>3 (1967) (employing a \u201cconservative and tentative classification of the living peoples of the world into five basically geographical groups: the Caucasoid, Mongoloid, Australoid, Congoid, and Capoid\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Although researchers use different classifications, this Court\u2019s brief review has disclosed no classification that employs \u201cHispanic\u201d as a race. <em>See </em>S. Molnar, <em>Race, Types, and Ethnic Groups </em>12-22 (1975) (reporting the racial classification schemes used by various anthropologists, none of which identifies \u201cHispanic\u201d as a distinct race). The most common list of races seems to consist of three categories: Caucasoid, Negroid, and Mongoloid. <em>See, e.g., </em>P.W. Hedrick, <em>Genetic Populations </em>17 (1983) (reporting a study on \u201c[a]llelic frequencies for four different blood groups in three different racial groups,\u201d which study identified the groups as Caucasoid, Negroid, and Mongoloid). Even researchers who express some hesitation as to this list use it. <em>See, e.g., </em>D.L. Hartly &amp; A.G. Clark, <em>Principles of Population Genetics </em>301-06 (2d ed.1989) (adopting the concept of \u201cthe three major human groups \u2014 Caucasoid, Negroid, Mongoloid,\u201d but also noting as a possible inference of a genetic population study that \u201cthere is much more genetic variation <em>within </em>than <em>among </em>human races\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Here, Hernandez argues that the trial court should have taken that part of his broad request that related to racial prejudice to mean prejudice against Hispanics. Adopting that argument would put the courts in the business of resolving the dispute between anthropologists as to what \u201crace\u201d means, and then assigning an accused to the race that the court thinks is appropriate. This is not the role of a court, in any but the most extraordinary case in which that might be the issue to be decided. The trial court was not required under <em>Contee </em>to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>propound a <em>voir dire </em>question in which the court, on its own initiative, identified Hernandez as Hispanic.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">We recognize that, for purposes of the unconstitutionally discriminatory use of peremptory challenges in jury selection under <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), and its progeny, Hispanics or Latinos/as are a \u201ccognizable group.\u201d <em>Mejia v. State, </em>328 Md. 522, 530 &amp; n. 4, 616 A.2d 356, 359 <em>&amp; </em>n. 4 (1992). <em>See also Hernandez v. New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (1991) (petit jury); <em>cf. Castaneda v. Partida, </em>430 U.S. 482, 97 S.Ct. 1272, 51 L.Ed.2d 498 (1977) (grand jury composition). Similarly, Hispanic or Latino persons should be considered to be a cognizable group for purposes of inquiring on <em>voir dire, </em>upon request, whether any veniremember is prejudiced against that particular cognizable group. The distinction between the peremptory challenge cases and the instant matter is that in the former the party objecting to the use of peremptory challenges identifies the cognizable group that is allegedly being excluded, in order to make a record, while, here, Hernandez never particularized his question beyond a reference to race generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">In the instant matter, it was not even suggested until argument on the motion for new trial that the cultural background of Hernandez was the true object of question sixteen. If Hernandez sought a <em>voir dire </em>question directed to prejudice against Hispanic persons, it was his obligation to identify himself as such and to request an inquiry on bias against Hispanics. Had he done so, he would have been entitled to having that question asked, without the need for special circumstances, in the same manner as if the request related to race.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">The result of our holdings above is that the accused has a tactical option concerning <em>voir dire </em>questions directed to race, but not as to ethnicity or cultural heritage. With respect to race, the accused may have a racial bias question submitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>which does not identify the accused to a race and which will leave identification to race to whatever conclusion any particular veniremember might draw based on physical observation. Alternatively, the accused may request a question in which the accused identifies himself or herself to a particular race. With respect to ethnicity or cultural heritage, however, the accused must identify the particular cognizable group and include himself or herself in that group. In none of these three scenarios is the trial court obliged to assign the accused to a race, ethnicity, or cultural heritage. When the accused has self-identified to a race, ethnicity, or cultural heritage, the trial court should make clear to the venire that the identification of the accused to the particular cognizable group has been made by the accused. Where a <em>voir dire </em>question has been properly requested and directed to bias against the accused\u2019s race, ethnicity, or cultural heritage, the trial court ordinarily will be required to propound such a question, regardless of the existence of special circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.
