Waicker and Diane L. Waicker, appellants, appeal from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, in favor of Mystic Investments, Inc. (Mystic or Mystic Investments), appellee, finding that Mystic\u2019s lien had priority over a misindexed lien of appellants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants present one issue: \u201cWhether the judgment held by appellants Gary and Diane Waicker has priority over the judgments to which appellee Mystic Investments, Inc., have been subrogated.\u201d We respond to appellants\u2019 issue in the negative, and accordingly affirm the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">On or about April 28, 1998, appellants, Gary W. Waicker and Diane L. Waicker, sought to have a deficiency judgment they held from the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against appellees Fabio K. Banegura and Olive K. Banegura, as husband and wife, recorded in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. When the Waickers\u2019 judgment was indexed and recorded by the Clerk of the Baltimore County Circuit Court, it was misindexed under the name Baneguna rather than Banegura. The Baltimore County Notice of Recordation, dated April 28,1993, was mailed to appellants and showed that the judgment had been indexed improperly.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">This cause of action arose when appellants sought to enforce their judgment against the property, then owned by Fabio K. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Banegura, known as 6612 Loch Raven Boulevard, Baltimore County, Maryland, the property encumbered by Mystic\u2019s Deed of Trust lien.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the time the Waicker judgment was recorded (and misindexed) in Baltimore County, there was a preexisting deed of trust lien on the property in the principal amount of $52,699.01. This mortgage had been previously granted by both Mr. and Mrs. Banegura. Additionally, there were three judgment liens recorded in Baltimore County against Fabio Banegura, individually, that predated recordation of appellants\u2019 judgment in Baltimore County. As of September, 1997, these judgments and their payoff balances were: (1) the Taylor judgment, dated May 14, 1985, in the sum of $3,600.00; (2) the Household Bank judgment, dated April 21, 1986, in the sum of $4,000.00; and (3) the O\u2019Connor, Piper and Flynn judgment, dated November 21, 1986, in the sum of $700.00. Because these three judgments were against Fabio Banegura individually, they were not liens against the property owned by Fabio and Olive Banegura as tenants by the entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">On or about September 25, 1997, the Baneguras refinanced their property through Mystic Investments. As part of this planned refinancing, the Baneguras transferred the property to Fabio Banegura, individually, to be deeded immediately by deed of trust to Mystic.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> During the process leading up to this simultaneous transaction, Mystic Investments conducted a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>search for judgments entered against Fabio and Olive Bane-gura in Baltimore County. Because it had been indexed improperly and recorded under the name Baneguna, appellants\u2019 judgment was not discovered during Mystic Investments\u2019 search. The Refinance Deed of Trust was in the principal sum of $92,000.00, of which $64,533.87 was used to satisfy the original mortgage lien on the property, and an additional $8,300.00 was used to satisfy the three aforementioned judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Believing that their judgment was superior to Mystic Investments\u2019 Deed of Trust, appellants sought to enforce their judgment by execution and judicial sale of the property. Upon learning of appellants\u2019 enforcement action against the property, Mystic Investments filed a Motion to Stay Proceeding and/or Release of Property From Levy pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-643(e). In its motion, Mystic asked the circuit court to enter an order declaring that it had a priority lien on the property to the extent of the prior first mortgage and the three additional judgments under the doctrine of equitable subrogation. Mystic Investments further alleged that it was entitled to a priority lien because the Waicker judgment had been misindexed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">At the hearing on September 11, 1998, appellants argued that, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that equitable subrogation applied, their judgment lien was senior to the judgments paid by Mystic Investments because only their judgment was against the Baneguras jointly and had attached when the Baneguras <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>owned the property as tenants by the entirety. Mystic argued, in relevant part:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">THE COURT: In this case, you are suggesting there wasn\u2019t even negligence, because the judgment was not indexed correctly, so even\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">MR. GILLISS [Mystic\u2019s attorney]: Exactly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">THE COURT: \u2014so even exercising due diligence, your client could not have found it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-8\">MR. GILLISS: That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-9\">But even if there was negligence, it doesn\u2019t make a difference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">And later, Mystic argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-11\">I think that the facts, themselves, call out for the court to accept that Mystic had no actual knowledge of that Waicker lien, because if they had, they would have paid it off, as they paid off the others, and there has been an explanation as to why it [the lien] wasn\u2019t discovered[, i.e., the misindexing].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">The Circuit Court for Baltimore County issued an order on September 28, 1998, granting Mystic Investments\u2019 motion and giving Mystic a priority interest in the property. In its ruling, the trial court stated, in part: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Appellants submitted a Motion to Alter, Amend and/or Revise the Judgment, which was denied.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-13\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>The fourth consideration concerns the lack of responsibility of Mystic to search the land records. Mystic did do a title search as indicated by the inclusion of a search report by Chicago Title Insurance Company dated 9/19/97. The reason the Waicker judgment was not found by its search is because the judgment was incorrectly filed under the name Baneguna, not Banegura. Given that Mystic did perform an adequate title search that did not find the misfiled judgment, Mystic cannot be said to have failed in its responsibility to search the land records.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Appellants do not dispute that Mystic Investments is entitled to equitable subrogation to the extent of the deed of trust lien and the three judgments it paid off as part of the refinancing. The issue before the Court is whether the Circuit Court for Baltimore County erred in holding that Mystic Investments\u2019 Deed of Trust lien has priority over appellants\u2019 judgment lien because appellants\u2019 judgment was misindexed under the name Baneguna rather than the name of the title owners as reflected in the land records of Baltimore County\u2014 Banegura \u2014 and therefore never attached to the property in Baltimore County titled in the land records to the Baneguras.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">We hold that generally, absent evidence of actual knowledge, when a judgment is indexed and recorded under a name different than the name of the title holder as reflected in the land records,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it fails to become a lien against that real property in respect to subsequent lien-holders or purchasers without actual knowledge. Notice will be found for judgments, which are indexed under incorrect or misspelled names only when the facts and circumstances are such that a party has actual knowledge that the judgment has been indexed under an incorrect or misspelled name or has actual knowledge that the debtor used or was known under the misnomer. The Circuit Court for Baltimore County correctly ruled that Mystic Investments had a priority interest over appellants because appellants\u2019 judgment was indexed improperly under the surname<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Baneguna rather than Banegura and because they failed to present any evidence that Mystic actually knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>the judgment was indexed under any name other than Bane-gura.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">II. Analysis and Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The fundamental purpose of this present action is to determine the priority of judgment liens against a particular piece of real estate. Maryland Code (1974, 1998 RepLVol.), \u00a7 ll-402(e) of the Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings Article is critical in making this determination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">(c) <em>Judgment of another court. </em>\u2014 If <em>indexed and recorded as prescribed by the Maryland Rules, </em>a money judgment constitutes a lien on the judgment debtor\u2019s interest in land located in a county other than the county in which the judgment was originally entered, except a lease from year to year or for a term not more than live years and not renewable. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">The relevant provisions of the Maryland Rules are Rules 2-621(b) and 2-623(a). They state, respectively:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-9\">(b) <em>Other counties. </em>Except as otherwise provided by law, a money judgment that is recorded and indexed pursuant to Rule 2-623(a) constitutes a lien from the date of recording in the amount of the judgment and post-judgment interest on the defendant\u2019s interest in land located in the county of recording.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">Md. Rule 2-621 (b).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-11\">(a) <em>Judgment of another court. </em>Upon receiving a copy <em>of </em>a judgment of another court, certified or authenticated in accordance with these rules or statutes of this State, or of the United States, the clerk shall record and index the judgment if it was entered by ... (c) another circuit court of this State....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">Md. Rule 2-623(a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The primary goal of section ll-402(c), and Maryland Rules 2-621(b) and 2-623(a) is to provide clear-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>cut rules for the indexing and recording of judgment liens. Although appellants had a deficiency judgment in Baltimore City against the Baneguras (or Banegunas),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> it would not constitute a lien against real property titled to the Baneguras among the land records in Baltimore County unless filed and correctly indexed in Baltimore County. Such a requirement is not new in Maryland. \u201c[A] judgment is not a lien on land in another county until a certified copy of the docket entries in the case taken from the court where the judgment was rendered shall be recorded.\u201d <em>Brunsman v. Crook, </em>130 Md. 661, 663, 101 A. 1019, 1020 (1917) (quoting 2 <em>Poe on Practice </em>\u00a7 377 (3d ed.)). Only if appellants correctly indexed and recorded the judgment in the Circuit Court of Baltimore County under the name Banegura would their judgment rendered and entered in the Baltimore City Circuit Court normally become a lien on property titled to the Baneguras among the land records in Baltimore County. \u201cIt is the duty of a person offering an instrument for record to see that it is both properly recorded and properly indexed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Roberts, </em>392 Pa. 572, 586, 141 A.2d 393, 400 (1958); <em>see In re 250 Bell Road, </em>479 Pa. 222, 228 n. 3, 388 A.2d 297, 300, n. 3 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The system of indexing and recording judgment liens is designed, at least in part, to provide an organized and efficient method by which the general public can effectively determine whether there are money judgments that act as liens on a particular parcel of land. In the absence of actual knowledge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>indexing and recording give constructive notice of any and all liens that may affect real property. To promote this goal, judgment liens are indexed and recorded alphabetically by surname. If there is more than one judgment indexed under the same surname against different persons, then they are organized alphabetically by first name. Additionally, if there is more than one judgment indexed under the same surname and first name against different persons, they are organized alphabetically by middle name. In other words, indexing and recording is done in basic alphabetical order. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1974, 1996 RepLVol.), \u00a7 3-302(a) of the Real Property Article (\u201cThe clerk of the circuit court ... shall make and maintain a full and complete general alphabetical index of every deed, <em>and other instrument </em>in a well-bound book in his office.\u201d (Emphasis added.)). The indexing requirement of alphabetizing of names in judgment indexes is the foundation by which judgment liens are researched. The reason is simple. If a judgment is not indexed in the proper fashion, i.e., in alphabetical order, a searcher may never find it.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">By looking at their plain and unambiguous language we interpret the coordinated workings of section 11-402 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article and Maryland Rules 2-621(b) and 2-623(a), to mean that a money judgment constitutes a lien on the judgment debtor\u2019s interest in real property titled in the land records of a particular county only if <em>correctly </em>indexed and recorded in the name of the owner of record of the property against which the lien is sought to be imposed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See In re Humphrey, </em>165 B.R. 578, 580 (Bankr.D.Md.1993); <em>Kroop &amp; Kurland v. Lambros, </em>118 Md.App. 651, 664, 703 A.2d 1287, 1293 (1998). This interpretation makes obvious sense because of the nature of the alphabetized recording system. The key word here is \u201ccorrectly\u201d; if a party, or the clerk of a court, for whatever reason, indexes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>judgment under a name that is not identical to the name in which real property in the county is held of record, the general public will not be on constructive notice that a judgment lien exists against that particular piece of real estate. There is no designation of, or reference to, any requirement for a property description in the judgment lien index under the Maryland statutes or rules; therefore, correct indexing and recording <em>of names </em>is essential in the Maryland scheme of providing notice of possible liens against a person\u2019s property and may play an integral part in a party\u2019s decision to invest in, or allow credit on, a piece of real property. \u201c[I]t is a well settled rule of law that a judgment is a general lien on all the real estate which the judgment debtor owns at its date, and that it attaches to all that he may thereafter acquire.. .. \u201d <em>Ahern v. White, </em>39 Md. 409, 417 (1874).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">A money judgment entered in one county constitutes a lien on the judgment debtor\u2019s interest in real property titled in his or her name in the land records of another county only if the names of the judgment debtors are indexed and recorded correctly in the other county. Thus, absent actual knowledge of the incorrect indexing by the subsequent party, a judgment indexed under an incorrect name or misnomer generally will not be enforceable as a lien against the property. Moreover, a court\u2019s ability to ascertain the existence of actual knowledge is limited to the evidence that is presented. We hold that a judgment indexed under an incorrect name of the judgment debtor is presumed to be insufficient to provide notice of a lien on real property titled in the land records under the correct name of the judgment debtor. This presumption will be rebutted only if the facts and circumstances indicate that a party, against whom the alleged prior lien is sought to be enforced, had actual knowledge of the misnomer. In the absence of any such evidence, such an incorrectly indexed judgment will not be accorded priority against innocent third persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">In <em>Messinger v. Eckenrode, </em>162 Md. 63, 158 A. 357 (1932), Susanna Messinger conceded that she never conducted a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>search of the judgment index, that the judgment was indexed under the correct surname and correct middle names of the judgment debtors (although not under the correct first name), and that she knew that the parties commonly went by their middle names under which the judgment was indexed. In other words, Messinger would have had actual knowledge that the indexing was wrong had she conducted a title examination. Under the facts of that case, we held that there was sufficient evidence presented that Messinger, <em>because of her actual knowledge, </em>would have found the judgment if a proper search of the judgment index had been conducted. Crucial to our interpretation was not only that no search was conducted, but that Messinger actually knew the property owners by the names under which the judgment was indexed: \u201cIf any one had inspected the index in the clerk\u2019s office, he would have found the name \u2018Heagy\u2019 and the Christian names <em>by which they were knoum to the </em>appellant.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69, 158 A. at 359 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">In other words, a court may employ a subjective test to consider the independent knowledge of an involved party. Whether a party has <em>actual </em>knowledge that a judgment is indexed under an alternative spelling or incorrect name is the primary factor a court should consider in determining whether, had a title examination been conducted, the party would have found the specific judgment. If the party has actual knowledge that the judgment was indexed, or likely to be indexed, under an incorrect name, the party has a duty to search under that incorrect name because, due to the party\u2019s actual knowledge, the party presumably would have discovered the misindexed judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">In <em>Messinger, </em>Susanna Messinger was aware that J. Edward Heagy and Mary Edith Heagy went by the names Edward Heagy and Edith Heagy, under which the judgment was indexed; therefore, she had actual notice of the alternate names and would have known that the judgment constituted a lien had she conducted a title examination. In the case at bar, there is absolutely no evidence of any actual knowledge on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>part of Mystic Investments. If a party has knowledge that a judgment debtor is known by more than one name, the party has the duty to examine, or cause to be examined, the records under all names known to them. If he or she has no such knowledge, their obligation in examining the judgment records is fulfilled by examining the indexes and records under the name of the title owner of the property as that name is reflected in the land records of the particular county.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">In <em>Frederick Ward </em>Associates, <em>Inc. v. Venture Inc., </em>99 Md.App. 251, 636 A.2d 496 (1994), the Court of Special Appeals dealt with a fact pattern similar to <em>Messinger </em>and the case <em>sub judice. </em>In <em>Frederick Ward, </em>the Court of Special Appeals considered the effect misnomers in first and middle names had on the indexing and recording of judgment liens. That court held that a judgment indexed and recorded against the name \u201cChris Walker\u201d did not constitute a lien against \u201cJohn C. Walker.\u201d The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">The sole function of a name is to identify the person whom it is intended to designate, and therefore all that is legally necessary in the docketing and indexing of judgments is that the defendant should be individuated with a degree of accuracy sufficient either to lead a reasonably careful searcher to conclude that he is the person who is the object of the search, or to suggest to the searcher the wisdom of inquiry to ascertain the fact. Where there is enough to put an ordinarily prudent person upon guard, inquiry becomes a duty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 257, 636 A.2d at 498-99 (quoting <em>Russeck v. Shapiro, </em>170 Pa.Super. 89, 92, 84 A.2d 514, 515 (1951) (quoting <em>Coral Gables, Inc. v. Kerl, </em>334 Pa. 441, 447, 6 A.2d 275, 278 (1939))).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">In <em>Frederick Ward, </em>the Court of Special Appeals noted that \u201cappellant produced no evidence that appellee should have known, at the time the property was conveyed, that John C. Walker and Chris Walker were the same person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 256, 636 A.2d at 498.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-9\">In the case before us, the court made a factual determination that the judgment against Chris Walker was not prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>erly indexed so as to provide notice to subsequent bona fide purchasers of property titled to John C. Walker. We cannot conclude that this determination was clearly erroneous. Rule 8-131(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 258, 636 A.2d at 499 (some citations omitted); <em>see Department of Pub. Assistance v. Reustle, </em>358 Pa. 111, 114-15, 56 A.2d 221, 224 (1948); <em>Coral Gables, </em>334 Pa. at 447, 6 A.2d at 278; <em>Susquebanc Lease Co. v. Lucchesi, </em>707 A.2d 540, 542 (Pa.Super.1998); <em>Russeck, </em>170 Pa.Super. at 92, 84 A.2d at 515. Frederick Ward Associates had no indication that a judgment against John C. Walker could have been indexed under the name Chris Walker. While the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 specific holding in <em>Frederick Ward </em>was couched in terms of lack of constructive notice, it was also clear that there was no actual knowledge of the misnomer; therefore, the judgment did not constitute a lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">With our holding in the case <em>sub judice, </em>we limit the holding of <em>Frederick Ward </em>to require, when a judgment lien is misindexed, evidence of actual knowledge of alternate names, or actual knowledge of the misindexing itself by the party against whom the misindexed lien is asserted, in order for the misindexed judgment lien to take priority over subsequently recorded and correctly indexed liens, or to follow the property after transfer by the judgment debtor to a bona fide purchaser for value who does not have actual knowledge of the misindexed lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">No one concise rule can be established concerning the status of a misnomer in a judgment lien by looking to the caselaw of our sister states. As one court has said: \u201cThere are in the books many cases dealing with judgments against debtors whose names are entered in abbreviated or incorrect forms, but it is difficult, if not impossible, to deduce from them a simple rule which furnishes the key to a ready solution of each and every case.\u201d <em>Coral Gables, </em>334 Pa. at 444, 6 A.2d at 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Our neighboring states of Pennsylvania and New Jersey offer insight into the problems of judgments improperly indexed under incorrect first names, with Pennsylvania appar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>ently treating the issue differently depending upon the case. In <em>Jaczyszyn v. Paslawski, </em>147 Pa.Super. 97, 24 A.2d 116 (1942), John Paslawski had a judgment against <em>Nikolai </em>Borys that was entered incorrectly in the judgment index under the name <em>Mikola </em>Borys.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Mrs. Jaczyszyn\u2019s attorney searched the judgment index but found no record in favor of Mr. Paslawski against Nikolai Borys. The Pennsylvania Superior Court ruled in Mrs. Jaczyszyn\u2019s favor, holding that the judgment indexed under Mikola Borys did not constitute constructive notice of a judgment against Nikolai Borys. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-4\">It was the duty of the plaintiff in the judgment, Mr. Paslawski, to see that [the name recorded in the judgment index] was correctly entered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">There was no duty resting on Mrs. Jaczyszyn, or her attorney, to search the records for any other name than the one Borys was always called and known by, <em>Nikolai </em>Borys.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATU\"><em>Id. </em>at 101, 24 A.2d at 118 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">In <em>Russeck, </em>170 Pa.Super. 89, 84 A.2d 514, the Pennsylvania Superior Court again was faced with an incorrectly indexed judgment. In that case, the defendant had a judgment against <em>Abraham </em>and Edith Wagner, which was indexed incorrectly under the names <em>Albert </em>and Edith Wagner. The court held that such an indexing failed to constitute constructive notice because of the distinct origins of the names:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">Albert is an Anglo-Saxon name of Teutonic origin, and by no process can it be demonstrated that it is a variant of the ancient Semitic name of Abraham. There is no similarity in either the spelling or in the sound which in the use of one might suggest the other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 92, 84 A.2d at 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">The New Jersey Superior Court has also considered whether judgments indexed under incorrect first names are sufficient to attach a lien to property. In <em>Jones v. Parker, </em>107 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>N.J.Super. 235, 258 A.2d 26 (1969), Jones held a judgment against Asa C. Parker, which was indexed incorrectly under the name Ace Parker. Subsequently, Parker placed a mortgage against the property and another subsequent judgment was recorded against Parker. The court held that the incorrectly indexed judgment had no priority in respect to the subsequent liens, saying \u201c[ujnless the judgment entered is against the same name as that in which record title to real estate stands, ... no lien exists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 242, 258 A.2d at 30. Similarly, in <em>Venetsky v. West Essex Building Supply Co., </em>28 N.J.Super. 178, 100 A.2d 291 (1953), that court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">A judgment indexed under a first name different and distinct from the real first name of the judgment debtor does not constitute a lien upon the debtor\u2019s real estate as against a subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer for value without notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">Judgments being indexed alphabetically in the office of the Clerk of the Superior Court, it is not to be supposed that a proper and adequate judgment search against Clarence F.

In the language of the court in <em>[Lembeck &amp; Betz Eagle Brewing Co. v.

Collectively, they might support a majority position among the other states of some type of <em>de minimis non curat lex </em>standard, in respect to imposing a duty to find closely related (or sometimes not so closely related) names in respect to misnomer judgments or misindexed judgments. They mainly are determined on a case-by-case factual basis with little clear guidance, and offer, in our view, little support for the reliance on statutorily required recordation and correct indexing that we believe to be of paramount importance to the process of property transfers in this state. That process is vital in assuring the accuracy of titles in Maryland; accuracy is important itself in guaranteeing the marketability of property, and thus the value of property in our state.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">While few of the out-of-state decisions specifically state that they are relying on the doctrine of <em>idem </em>sonas,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> they appear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>to be based, at least in appreciable part, on similar principles. In <em>Susquebanc Lease Co., </em>707 A.2d 540, for instance, the Pennsylvania Superior Court considered whether a judgment against Camill <em>Louis </em>Lucchesi, which was indexed under Camill <em>Lewis </em>Lucchesi was sufficiently similar to constitute a lien against real estate. The court said that \u201cappellate courts have resolved such cases on the basis of the factual circumstances and practical considerations present in each case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 542. The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-5\">\u201cCamill Lewis Lucchesi\u201d appear[s] on the very same .or adjacent page as other entries against the name Lucchesi, which did not include the middle name \u201cLewis.\u201d Two judgment liens had been recorded ... against \u201cLucchesi.\u201d Another was filed against \u201cC.L. Lucchesi, a/k/a C. Louis\u201d_ These several judgments filed against an individual with a name very similar to that of the seller of the property on the same or adjacent pages should have alerted a reasonably careful searcher to verify the identity of the judgment debtor rather than relying solely on the name as listed in the judgment index.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 542-43. <em>See Reustle, </em>358 Pa. at 117, 56 A.2d at 224 (holding that a judgment indexed in the name of Rosie Reustle constituted notice of a judgment against Rosie C. Reustle); <em>Coral Gables, </em>334 Pa. at 448, 6 A.2d at 278 (holding that a judgment indexed in the name of Caroline Kerl constituted notice of a judgment against Caroline C. Kerl). <em>But see Garner v. Cluck, </em>209 Ark. 912, 916, 193 S.W.2d 661, 663 (1946) (\u201cWhere an initial is employed instead of the first name of the judgment debtor, an error therein is as fatal as it would be in the name itself. In regard to the middle initial, some authorities hold that if a middle initial is used, it must be the proper one, especially when there are other persons in the district who have a similar name.\u201d). These cases indicate that those courts are generally less inclined to hold a mistake in a middle name or initial to as high of a standard as a mistake in a first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>name. Thus, an error in a middle name, according to those courts, is less likely to hinder constructive notice and be fatal to lien priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Whether a judgment lien is indexed and recorded incorrectly if listed under a misspelled surname is a case of first impression in this Court. When looking to our sister states, as indicated, <em>supra, </em>most cases concerning misspelled surnames appear to have been decided on <em>idem sonans </em>principles, which means that \u201ca mistake [or variance] in spelling the name of a party is immaterial if both modes of spelling have the same sound.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>National Packaging Corp. v. Belmont, </em>47 Ohio App.3d 86, 88 n. 1, 547 N.E.2d 373, 374 n. 1 (1988); <em>see also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>744 (6th ed. 1990) (\u201cUnder the rule of \u2018idem sonans,\u2019 variance between allegation and proof of a given name is not material if the names sound the same or the attentive ear finds difficulty in distinguishing them when pronounced.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">This Court has hesitated to embrace this doctrine and applied it only in two older cases. <em>See State v. Warfield, </em>139 Md. 74, 76, 114 A. 835, 836 (1921) (holding that an indictment using the word \u201ctract\u201d instead of \u201ctrack\u201d would be saved by the doctrine of <em>idem </em>sonans); <em>Elliott v. Knott, </em>14 Md. 121, 135 (1859) (\u201cThe names <em>\u2018Penryn </em>\u2019 and <em>\u2018Pennyrine </em>\u2019 should be regarded, in the absence of all proof to show they belong to different tracts of land, as applicable to the same, and as <em>idem sonans.\u201d). </em>Both <em>Warfield </em>and <em>Elliott </em>are distinguishable from the case <em>sub judice. </em>Neither of them involved the priority of liens arising out of misindexing. Additionally, neither involve the misspelling of a party\u2019s name, much less the misspelling of a party\u2019s name in a judgment index in which the only way to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>find the judgment is alphabetically by the judgment debtor\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">We hold that the doctrine of <em>idem soncms </em>generally does not apply to the indexing and recording of judgment liens. To hold otherwise, in the absence of additional evidence of the facts and circumstances relating to a party\u2019s actual knowledge, would lessen the functional necessity of the alphabetized recording system to the free marketability of property titles in Maryland. We note that the Court of Appeals of Ohio rejected the doctrine in <em>National Packaging Corp., </em>47 Ohio App.3d 86, 547 N.E.2d 373, in dealing with a fact pattern similar to the case <em>sub judice. </em>In that case, a judgment against Michael Bol\u00e1n was indexed and recorded under the incorrect name Michael Bolen, a similar misspelling to that in the case at bar. That court first noted the position of the judgment lien holder:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">[I]t argues that the certified judgment filed under a similar sounding but incorrect spelling of the debtor Bolan\u2019s name, retaining the same initial letters as the correctly spelled name, should have been held to give rise to a valid hen for the benefit of NPC and to provide the appropriate constructive notice to title searchers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Id. at 88, 547 N.E.2d at 374. The Ohio court then discussed several old Ohio cases of various types in which the doctrine of idem sonans had been applied, noting that in each case there was other evidence from which a proper identification of the relevant party would have been actually known: Lessee <em>of Pittsburg v. Dugan\u2019s Administrator, </em>9 Ohio 117 (1839) (involving a petition for partition sale in which the notice contained a description of the property); <em>Buchanan v. Roy\u2019s Lessee, </em>2 Ohio St. 251 (1853) (dicta regarding the misspelling of a party\u2019s name in a publication notice in a quiet-title action); and <em>Turpin v. State, </em>19 Ohio St. 540 (1869) (involving a variance in the spelling of a forged signature in an exhibit and the indictment, when there was other evidence of the identity of the person whose name was forged). <em>See National Packaging Corp., </em>47 Ohio App.3d at 88-89, 547 N.E.2d at 374-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>The Ohio court also noted a 1936 and a 1943 case, both cited by one of the parties, which it declined to follow, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APp\">We note, however, that in <em>Rauch [v. Immel, </em>55 Ohio App. 71, 8 N.E.2d 569 (1936),] the doctrine was applied to a misnomer in a notice of a lawsuit, and in <em>Horton [v. Matheny, </em>72 Ohio App. 187, 51 N.E.2d 41] (1943) it was applied to a misspelling in a deed description. In these two cases, as in <em>Pillsbury, Buchanan, </em>and <em>Turpin,, </em>the error did not involve misspellings in a name index.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 89, 547 N.E.2d at 375. The court then noted another 1930 case applying the doctrine that appeared to be closer factually, but, nonetheless, declined to follow it, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\">In the matter <em>sub judice, </em>three experts have given affidavits stating that the doctrine of <em>idem sonans </em>should not be applied today as a standard for determining the marketable title of real estate on the basis of irregularities in last names or surnames, and that by custom it is not applied by abstractors in southwestern Ohio.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 89, 547 N.E.2d at 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">The court rejected the doctrine, noting its inapplicability in modern society in respect to misspelled names in judgment indexes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-9\">We hold that the doctrine of <em>idem sonans </em>is inapplicable to names that are misspelled in judgment-lien name indexes. We are not a frontier society of pioneers with little education or an absence of precedent and system. Since the [Ohio] Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>Pillsbury, </em>we have experienced a tremendous growth in the population and the economy, and those developments have spawned countless real estate sales and a volume of litigation resulting in an abundance of indexed judgment liens. In modern society we cannot overlook matters of form by continuing to indulge the outmoded premises of our societal infancy. To impose rigidly the doctrine of <em>idem sonans </em>to name indexes now maintained for judgment liens would tax all land ab-stractors beyond reasonable limits and require them to be poets, phonetic linguists, or multilingual specialists. The additional time necessary to examine name indexes under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>such a stringent doctrine would make the examinations financially prohibitive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">The appellees, in their brief, demonstrate the difficulty in applying the doctrine of <em>idem, sonans </em>to the range of spellings implicated in the instant case: Bol\u00e1n, Bolen, Bolin, Bowlin, Bowlan, Bowlen, Bolun; the addition of double \u201c1,\u201d \u201cein,\u201d and \u201cien\u201d spellings does not even exhaust all conceivable spelling possibilities. The impossibility of the task created by the doctrine of <em>idem sonans </em>is further illustrated by the fact that we, as a society and state, are no longer a small homogeneous population primarily of European abstraction. Since our infancy, we have added Asian, African, South American, Oriental and Arabic surnames. The spelling, sound, and pronunciation of our population\u2019s surnames create an insurmountable burden for an abstractor to face in appreciating all the possible variations_ [A] strict application of the doctrine [of <em>idem sonans </em>] today would leave a real estate purchaser with a lingering fear that misspelled lien-holders, either negligently or deliberately, might be lurking under the <em>idem sonans </em>doctrine in the judgment-debtor indexes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 90, 547 N.E.2d at 375-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">Allowing for misnomers even in the form of minor misspellings would undermine the entire indexing system of judgment liens. A minor misspelling may render a judgment \u201cundiscoverable\u201d by even the most prudent of searchers. As in <em>Belmont, </em>in the case at bar the name at issue, Banegura, could be misspelled in an almost inexhaustible number of ways: Baneguna, Baneguma, Banegupa, Baneguha, B\u00e1negure, Baneguri, Baneguro, Banguro, Beneguro, Binegua, Benigura, Benegara, ad infinitum. As we stated, <em>swpra, </em>one of the purposes of the alphabetized index and records system of judgment liens is to provide an organized and efficient method by which the general public can easily and effectively research money judgments acting as liens on a particular parcel of land. It serves, if done properly, to give constructive notice to subsequent purchasers, encumbrancers, or others who may deal with the title to the real estate, of any and all judgments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>that constitute liens on real property. It does so by providing a method whereby title examiners can examine the judgment index under the name of the title owner, as that name is recorded among the land records of a particular jurisdiction. The only way constructive notice is sufficient is if the correct name of the title owner of the land against which the lien is sought to be enforced is indexed and recorded in the judgment lien indexes. \u201c[T]o constitute notice to ... encumbrancers, a judgment must be properly docketed by the correct [first] name and surname of the judgment debtor.\u201d <em>Venetsky, </em>28 N.J.Super. at 187, 100 A.2d at 295. In the case of judgment liens there is no designation of, or reference to, the property in question to aid in the conveying of notice to the searcher. The only way to conduct research in the judgment lien index is by the name of the title holder of the land as that name is reflected in the land records \u2014 this is why the information included, especially the surname, needs to be accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">We hold that notice will be found for judgment liens against a particular property, which are indexed under incorrect or misspelled names only when the facts and circumstances are such that the subsequent party has <em>actual </em>knowledge that the judgment is indexed under an incorrect or misspelled name, or has <em>actual </em>knowledge that an owner of property being subject to search has, or is commonly known by, the alternate name. In the instant case, appellants failed to proffer any evidence to establish that Mystic Investments had any reason to know to search for the judgment under any name other than Banegura. In the absence of such information we cannot say that the decision by the trial judge was clearly erroneous and we are unable to reverse the decision. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 8 \u2014 131(c).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Appellants simply have not presented any evidence that Mystic had actual knowledge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>the misnomer. The Circuit Court for Baltimore County correctly ruled that Mystic Investments had a priority interest over appellants\u2019 lien because appellants\u2019 judgment was indexed incorrectly under the name Baneguna rather than Banegura.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The spelling mistake appears to be comparatively minor in the case <em>sub judice, </em>as it was the seventh letter in an eight letter name that was incorrect and the names may have been indexed on the same page or adjacent pages of an index; however, it would have been an entirely different story if it was the first or second letter of the surname that was incorrect. Canegura or Bwnegura might never have been found, even by the most prudent of searchers. It could be pages, or scores of pages, from the correct position in the index, or even in a different index book or different room of the clerk\u2019s office. The next error brought to this Court\u2019s attention may be greater, and the one after, more so.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Considering that a misspelling might render a judgment impossible to find, in the absence of evidence of actual knowledge of the misspelling or misnomer, there is a presumption that a judgment indexed under an incorrect or misspelled name will not be found by a party examining title to property under the correct name as reflected in the land records.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">As one court has said, \u201c[i]t is the duty of a person offering an instrument for record to see that it is both properly recorded and properly indexed.\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>392 Pa. at 586, 141 A.2d at 400; <em>see In re 250 Bell Road, 479 </em>Pa. at 228 n. 3, 388 A.2d at 300 n. 3. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellants failed to correct the incorrect indexing of the judgment in the Baltimore County Circuit Court under the name Baneguna. The Baltimore County Clerk\u2019s Office put appellants on notice that their judgment had been indexed under the name Baneguna rather than Banegura. In the four years that elapsed as appellants waited for the judgment to be enforced, they never attempted to correct this error.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> They were the only party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>who knew or could have known, and who should have known, of this error; they were the only party in the position to correct this error, and they failed to do so. Between the parties, only appellants had notice of the incorrect indexing.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">A party who records a judgment in a judgment index has the duty of ensuring that the name entered into the index is spelled correctly and indexed correctly in order to protect the priority of their lien. Future persons involved with the property simply have no way to ensure the accuracy of indexing.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">We hold that the risk falls on the person who has the power to avoid it: the judgment lienholder who submits the judgment for recordation and indexing. As the Pennsylvania Superior Court held in <em>Jaczyszyn, </em>147 Pa.Super. at 101, 24 A.2d at 118:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-7\">It was the duty of the plaintiff in the judgment, Mr. Paslawski, to see that [the name recorded in the judgment index] was correctly entered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-8\">There was no duty resting on Mrs. Jaczyszyn, or her attorney, to search the records for any other name than the one Borys was always called and known by, <em>Nikolai </em>Borys.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1G\">Similarly, it was the duty of appellants to see that their judgment against Fabio and Olive Banegura was entered correctly. In the absence of actual knowledge, there was no duty resting on Mystic Investments when conducting, or having conducted, a title examination of the property at issue to search the records under any other name than Fabio and Olive Banegura, the title owners of the property at issue. Imposing such a duty would require searchers \u201cto be poets, phonetic linguists, or multilingual specialists.\u201d <em>National Packaging Corp., </em>47 Ohio App.3d at 90, 547 N.E.2d at 376. This Court is not prepared to create such an undue burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">We hold that the Circuit Court for Baltimore County correctly ruled that Mystic Investments had a priority interest because appellants\u2019 judgment lien was misindexed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Generally, absent evidence of actual knowledge, when a judgment is indexed under an incorrect or misspelled name rather than the \u201ccorrect name,\u201d it fails to operate as constructive notice in respect to subsequent lien holders or purchasers without actual knowledge. Notice will be found for judgments that are indexed under incorrect names only when the facts and circumstances indicate that a party had actual knowledge that the judgment was indexed under an incorrect name, or had actual knowledge that the debtor used or was known under the misnomer. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellants presented no evidence that Mystic Investments knew that a judgment against Fabio and Olive Banegura would be indexed under any names other than Fabio and Olive Banegura. Accordingly, we affirm the ruling of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-11\">.

Mystic Investments also argued at trial that the doctrine of equitable subrogation applied to give its lien priority over the alleged judgment lien of appellants.

We are concerned in the case <em>sub judice </em>with the priority of <em>judgment </em>liens. Different sections of the Maryland Code apply to conveyancing. <em>Standard Finance Co. v. Little, </em>159 Md. 621, 152 A. 264 (1930), con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>cerned an action for damages against a clerk of court who had failed to index a mortgage accepted for recordation. We held for the clerk on the basis that the indexing provisions were not, at that time, part of the recordation statutes; thus, the plaintiff had not suffered any loss because it had not lost the priority of its mortgage. Later, in <em>Frank v. Storer, </em>308 Md. 194, 517 A.2d 1098 (1986), we, based solely upon the <em>Standard Finance </em>holding, held that instruments correctly recorded, but not correctly indexed, did. not lose the priority accorded them by the recordation statutes. (The clerk declined to index the document modifying a mortgage because the document contained no correct reference to the mortgage being modified.) Our decision in <em>Frank </em>was based in large part on <em>Standard Finance </em>and our reluctance to depart from it when there had been no apparent legislative attempt to modify it.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\"><em>Standard Finance, </em>however, was an unusual case. It did not involve a contest as to priorities between competing lien holders as in the case at bar. It was a case of a lienholder presuming it had lost its priority by reason of the clerk's failure to index its instrument, and suing the clerk for the damages it presumed it had sustained. Moreover, the <em>Standard Finance </em>Court based its position that indexing should not affect the priorities of recording on the fact that indexing requirements at that time were found in a completely unrelated area of the Maryland Code. Recording matters were found in Article 21 and indexing matters were found in Article 17.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">\"The lien of a mortgage is preserved under the statutory provisions that deeds shall, in order to pass title, be executed, acknowledged and recorded, and that mortgages shall be executed, acknowledged and recorded as is required with respect to deeds.

It is in article 17 of the Code, concerning clerks of courts, that the provisions for an index are found. Sections 59, 61 and 62_ It is the general index from which, according to the allegations, the entry was omitted in this instance.... [I]t seems to the court that the indexing has not been conceived of as part of that recording.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-10\"><em>Standard Finance, </em>159 Md. at 622-23, 152 A. at 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-11\">The Court went on to recognize the danger of misindexing, but ultimately deferred to the Legislature to address the problem:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A02\">\"The argument for including the indexing within the recording, as an essential part of it, is based upon the importance of the indexing and the danger of losses to persons dealing with property if there may be instruments completely effective to pass title without mention in the indexes.
