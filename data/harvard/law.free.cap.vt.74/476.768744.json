V. S. 1298. Non-suit is capable of three interpretations:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-14\">1. Verdict directed by the court when plaintiff fails to appear when called.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-15\">2. Verdict entered by the plaintiff himself, by leave of court, when he wishes to reserve the right to bring another suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-16\">3. Verdict directed by the court when plaintiff fails to make out a case, neglects to proceed to trial when called, or is misjoined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>Non-suit in the sense of all three of these interpretations existed under the <em>Common </em>Law of England when it was adopted by this state in 1787. <em>Lindon </em>v. <em>Hooper, </em>Cowp. 414; <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Bailey, Id. </em>597; <em>Paaton </em>v. <em>Popham, </em>10 East 366; <em>Atkinson </em>v. <em>Pocok, </em>1 Exch. 796; <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>4 Wheat. 73; <em>Searls </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>18 Minn. 316; <em>Gottstein </em>v. <em>St. lean, </em>79 Minn. 232; <em>Yell </em>v. <em>Outlaws, </em>14 Ark. 621; <em>Mallory </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>90 Va. 348; 17 How.

Austin </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-8\">The plaintiff elected to waive trial in the justice court, allowing the defendant to have judgment, and take his appeal. This the defendant insisted he could not do, and caused the justice to make the record as it appears in the exceptions. The case was appealable. V. S. 1298. If the justice had rendered a judgment of non-suit, the case would have been appealable. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Grane, </em>12 Vt. 487. Under the circumstances of this case, a judgment of non-suit could not properly have been entered.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b493-9\">Munson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AoI\">The plaintiff appeared but declined to proceed, and the justice dismissed the suit for want of evidence. Was the plaintiff entitled to an appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">V. S. 1286 fixes the time for appearance, and provides that judgment may be entered on non-suit or default against th'e party who does not appear. V. S. 1298 provides that no appeal shall be allowed when a judgment is rendered by non-suit or default. It is said in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Crane, </em>12 Vt. 487, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>a non-suit is a neglect of the plaintiff to appear and prosecute his suit, or a voluntary withdrawal from the suit after appearance. The defendant contends that, if the plaintiff appears and fails to prosecute, it amounts to a voluntary withdrawal and justifies an entry of non-suit. It is true that in most courts a judgment of non-suit is proper upon a failure to prosecute after appearance. But we think that in the statute regulating appeals in justice cases the term has reference only to the want of appearance, and that when the plaintiff appears and remains in court, no judgment not consented to can be entered against him that will disentitle him to an appeal. We understand that our justice practice has always been in accordance with this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
