They testified to the price of board in the neighborhood. Before they could so testify, it should have appeared, affirmatively, that they had the requisite knowledge. They were not called as experts. No foundation for their testimony was laid. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>47 Vt. 233; <em>Kelsey </em>v. <em>Kelley, et al, </em>63 Vt. 45.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-10\">It was error to\u00a1 exclude the cross-examination of the defendant in regard to his charge for cleaning out the drain.

The defendant\u2019s answer would have made probable the fact that he was acting of his own volition. <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Noble, </em>55 Vt. 428; <em>Randall </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>52 Vt. 198; <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Jarvis, </em>55 Vt. 348.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-12\"><em>J.

The preliminary question is for the court, and is largely a matter of discretion. It will not be revised here, x Greenl. on Ev. 577, arid note c.; <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>47 Vt. <em>222; Perkins </em>v. <em>Stickney, </em>132 Mass. 217; <em>Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Branhcsm, </em>33 L. R. A. 395.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-6\">The exclusion of the question asked defendant as to the cleaning of the drain was proper. It was manifestly unfair, and an attempt to get an immaterial matter before the jury, on which to base an argument. <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>46 Vt. 409; 1 Rice on Ev. 599.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b72-7\">Tyler, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2\">This action was brought to recover the amount of certain items claimed by the plaintiff to be due him from the defendant. The controversy seems to have been over the defendant\u2019s account in offset, items of which were for board of the plaintiff himself, his daughter and her husband, which the plaintiff was liable for, though the price had not been agreed upon. The question was, what was a reasonable price per meal and by the week?</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">H. E. Marcey was called as a witness, and in answer to questions by the defendant\u2019s counsel testified, without objection, that he lived a mile from the Watriss place where the board was furnished, and that he knew the price of board in district No. 6. The question was then repeated if he knew the price of board in that district, when the plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected, and the answer was admitted, under his exception, that it was worth 25 cents a meal \u201cif they were to run in by odd jobs.\u201d The witness being told to answer the question directly, the following was asked: \u201cSuppose he was there every meal, * * * what was the price of board in that neigh<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>borhood ?\u201d and the witness answered, under plaintiff\u2019s general objection and exception, that it was worth $3.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Mrs. Marcey, called by the defendant, testified, without objection, that she lived three-fourths of a mile from the Watriss place; that she had kept boarders, and knew the price of board in that neighborhood. . The witness then being asked what the price was, answered, under the plaintiff\u2019s objection and exception, that it was worth $3.50. On cross-examination she said that she kept boarders twenty-five years ago, and that she based her answer upon the price of board at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The trial court evidently found that the witnesses lived in the vicinity of the place where the board was furnished, and knew the price. These facts were testified to without objection, and the witnesses were competent to&gt; give their opinions, within the rule in <em>Kelsey </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>63 Vt. 41, 22 Atl. 597, 13 L. R. A. 640; <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Tupper, </em>58 Vt. 409, 5 Atl. 387; <em>Cavendish </em>v. <em>Troy, </em>41 Vt. 108. It was the right of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to1 insist, before the witnesses were asked to give their opinions, that they had not shown themselves competent; but this was not done; only a general exception was taken to the questions and answers in respect to the price, and objection to the competency of the witnesses was therefore waived. No objection having been made at this point, it was in the court\u2019s discretion to1 receive the opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The preliminary question whether a witness offered as an expert has the necessary qualification is for the court to decide, and it is largely in its discretion, and unless it appears that there was no evidence of such qualification, the admission of the evidence will not be revised in this court. <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Stickney, </em>132 Mass. 217; 1 Greenl. Ev. 573, notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">In the present case, there was evidence that the witnesses had such-knowledge upon the subject that their opinions might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>be received, and, no objection being made as to their competency, it was clearly in the discretion of the court whether to receive them or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">An item in the defendant\u2019s account in offset was $1.50 for cleaning a drain in the cellar of the house leased by him of the plaintiff. The defendant testified that he did the work at the plaintiff\u2019s request, and upon his promise to pay for it, which the plaintiff denied. On cross-examination he said he dug out the ditch to clean the cellar, and he was then asked, \u201cDid you care enough about the health of your family to dig it out without he asked you to?\u201d which question was excluded, and the plaintiff excepted. The degree of care the defendant had for the health of his family was immaterial. If'he had been permitted to answer, and had said that he did or did not care, the answer would have thrown no&gt; light upon the question whether he did the work at the plaintiff\u2019s request and upon his promise to pay. Therefore the question was properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
