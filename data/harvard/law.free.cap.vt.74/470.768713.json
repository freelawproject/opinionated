The contract is silent as to the kind and character of the letters of the inscription. The writing was not intended to cover the whole contract; SO' parol evidence may be admitted. <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>Blond\u00edn, </em>58 Vt. 689; <em>Alder </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>49 Vt. 109; <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Martin, id. </em>266; <em>Green </em>v. <em>Randall, </em>51 Vt. 67; <em>Winn </em>v. <em>Chamberlain, </em>32 Vt. 318; <em>Dunkleev.

If the party wrongfully refuses to receive it, the action must be upon the contract for such refusal. <em>Boardman </em>v. <em>Keeler, </em>21 Vt. 78; <em>Hodges </em>v. <em>Pox,, </em>36 Vt. 81.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b487-5\"><em>L.

The defendant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>was permitted to show by parol evidence that at the time of making and signing the contract, it was agreed by the parties that some part of the inscription should be in raised rather than sunken letters. From this evidence, the referee finds that the word \u201cMother\u201d was to have been in raised letters, and makes the question of recovery dependent upon the admissibility of this evidence, and upon the fact that certain abbreviations in lettering were made that is not now urged as an objection to a recovery. The referee has, in effect, found that the work was executecl in a good, workmanlike manner. This is all that was required of the plaintiffs by the terms of the written agreement, and their undertaking could not be varied or enlarged by an oral agreement made at the time of the execution of the written contract. Therefore, the oral evidence from which the referee found that the word \u201cMother\u201d was to be cut in raised letters was inadmissible. <em>Daggett </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>49 Vt. 345; <em>Pictorial League </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>69 Vt. 162, 37 Atl. 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-3\">The defendant insists that the action should have been special assumpsit, and that no recovery can be had under the general counts. This objection is not sustained. The cause having been referred, and it not appearing that this question was raised in the court below, nor that the report was objected to on this ground, it is considered that the defendant has waived this objection to the form of the declaration. In <em>Lyndon Grmite Co. </em>v. <em>Parrar, </em>53 Vt. 585, under like conditions, it was so considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
