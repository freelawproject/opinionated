The mortgagors gave no direction as to the application of this credit. <em>Held, </em>that the mortgagee could apply this credit on the unsecured note.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b231-15\">The amount of this credit, as found by the referee, being more than the amount of the unsecured note, it was proper for the court to apply thereon so much as was required to extinguish that note and the balance on the mortgage note.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Trover for certain trees cut on land mortgaged to the plaintiff. Plea, the general issue. Heard on a referee\u2019s report and the defendants\u2019 motion to recommit the same, at the October Term, 1901, Essex County, Taft, C. J., presiding. Motion denied and judgment for the plaintiff. The defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-5\">The plaintiff held a properly recorded, overdue mortgage on a certain piece of land, from which the mortgagors cut a quantity of timber and sold it to the defendants, who paid them for it, manufactured it into lumber, and converted it to their own use. The plaintiff also held an unsecured note against the mortgagors. The plaintiff had the benefit of the timber cut by one Wyman on a portion of the mortgaged land, under an agreement with the mortgagors to account to them for it. He applied the avails of the Wyman timber on the unsecured note. The suit is brought to recover the stumpage value of the timber converted by the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b232-6\"><em>May '&amp; Simonds </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-7\">The motion to recommit the report should have been granted. The referee has fallen into' error in certain material findings. An opportunity for correction should have been allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-8\">The plaintiff claims title by virtue of a stumpage lien, reserved \u2014 not in his deed to S'tevens and Gallup \u2014 but in their mortgage back to him. Such a lien is ineffective. The reservation is of \u201ctwo- dollars stumpage,\u201d etc. \u201cStumpage\u201d relates to the sum to be paid the owner of the land by the party who has a right to enter and cut the timber. It is the price of a license. <em>Spofford </em>v. True, 33 Mje. 283; <em>Blood </em>v. <em>Drummone, </em>67 Me. 476. The reservation did not amount to' a valid lien. <em>Dickermm </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>55 Vt. 65; 38 Vt. 185. The record does not show that the mortgage was overdue at the time the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>timber was cut. No demand was made upon the defendants, and the suit must fail on this ground. 62 Vt. 312.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-5\">The circumstances clearly show that the parties understood that the Wyman stumpage should go on the mortgage debt; therefore no other application is proper. 21 Vt. 331; <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>49 Ark. 508. The intent of the debtor prevails over that of the creditor, and may appear by implication. 55 Vt. 542; 57 Vt. 647. The cutting was done with the plaintiff\u2019s consent and trover will not lie. 50 Vt. 57; 53 Vt. 145; 38 Vt. 185.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b233-7\"><em>Harry Blodgett </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-8\">The refusal of the court below to recommit the report was a matter of discretion. <em>Wilkinson\u2019s Admr. </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>61 Vt. 411; <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Beers, </em>51 Vt. 359; <em>Puller </em>v. Wright, 10 Vt. 514. The plaintiff owned the logs. He had a stumpage lien upon them, and besides his mortgage on the land was overdue. The defendants were chargeable with notice of these facts by the record of the mortgage. Trover is the plaintiff\u2019s remedy. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Lake, </em>30 Vt. 206; <em>Morey </em>v. <em>McGuire, 4 </em>Vt. 327; <em>Lull </em>v. <em>Matthews, </em>19 Vt. 322; <em>Langdon </em>v. <em>Paul, </em>22 Vt. 205; <em>Hagar </em>v. <em>Brasinerd, </em>44 Vt. 294.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-9\">The application of the Wyman stumpage was correct. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>70 Vt. 424; <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>66 Vt. 574.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b233-10\">Watson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASJ\">The overruling of the motion to recommit the report was a matter of discretion, and not revisable in this court. <em>Wilkinson\u2019s Admr. </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>61 Vt. 409, 17 Atl. 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">The record of the mortgage was constructive notice to the defendants that the land on which the logs purchased by them were cut, was encumbered by such a mortgage to secure the payment \u00f3f a note to the plaintiff, of the same date as the mortgage and for $156.51 with interest annually. The defendants were thereby put upon inquiry, and they were chargeable with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>knowledge that the note and mortgage were overdue; for inquiry of the plaintiff would have disclosed that fact. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>73 Vt. 222, 50 Atl. 1092.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The defendants manufactured the logs into lumber and converted it to their own use. That the mortgagee may maintain trover for wood or timber cut upon the mortgaged premises after condition broken, and converted, is well settled. <em>Langdon </em>v. <em>Paul, </em>22 Vt. 205; <em>Morey </em>v. <em>McGuire, </em>4 Vt. 327; <em>Lull </em>v. <em>Matthews, </em>19 Vt. 322; <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Lake, </em>30 Vt. 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The plaintiff told the mortgagors, Stevens and Gallup, that he would account to them for the lumber taken off by Wyman ; but there was nothing said how or on what he would so account. The mortgagors gave no directions concerning the application. The plaintiff then held their unsecured note for $35.88, and he indorsed thereon $25, which he thought to be the value of the Wyman lumber. The referee found the value to be $40.85. After deducting therefrom the $25, the balance was applied by the County Court in full payment of the small note, and the rest upon the note secured by the mortgage. The small note represented a debt which, accrued earlier than that evidenced by the mortgage note. The plaintiff had a right to apply the $25 as he <em>did, </em>\u2014 Hicks\u2019 <em>Estate </em>v. <em>Blanchard, </em>60 Vt. 673, 15 Atl. 401, \u2014 and the application made by the court was i-n accordance with the -long settled rule stated in <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Atkins, </em>71 Vt. 422, 45 Atl. 1037.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">This being decisive of the case, there is no necessity for considering the other questions argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">\u25a0 <em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
