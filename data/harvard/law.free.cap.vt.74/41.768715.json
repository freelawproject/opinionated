Plea, the general issue. Trial by jury at the June Term, 1901, Windsor County, <em>Start, </em>J., presiding. Verdict ordered for the defendant and judgment thereon. The plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b58-3\"><em>Gilbert A. Davis </em>and <em>D. M. Read </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-4\">Upon all the facts and circumstances, the selectmen, as reasonable beings, fairly understood that the notice was given by the person injured, <em>because </em>she claimed damages. This is a <em>notice. </em>.A <em>notice </em>is to give information of something. The selectmen must have understood that the plaintiff would claim damages. The clause relating to claim of satisfaction is not a condition precedent. It is a directory provision of the statute merely.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-5\">A verdict should not have been ordered. The notice was but a step in the proof. In <em>Ranney </em>v.

Ene. 402.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-8\">The notice was defective because it did not state that the plaintiff would claim satisfaction of the town. This is an essential element of the notice and has been required since 1855.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-9\">The notice was also defective because it did not state that it was the duty of the defendant to keep in repair the culvert where the accident happened. <em>Barnsworth </em>v. <em>Mt. Holly, </em>63 Vt. 293; <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Cabot, </em>54 Vt. 242; <em>White </em>v. <em>Stowe, </em>54 Vt. 510.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b58-10\">Taft, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJA\">Any town in this State is liable for its neglect to keep in repair any bridge or culvert, if any person is injured thereby. In order to maintain an action to recover damages for such injuries, notice must be given within a cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>tain time to the town. V. S. 3492. One provision of the statute with reference to the notice is, that it shall state \u201cthat such person will claim satisfaction of the town.\u201d It further provides that unless such notice is given, \u201cno action shall be maintained in any court.\u201d In this case the plaintiff, within the required time, gave the defendant notice of the accident and of her injury, but omitted to state therein that she would \u201cclaim satisfaction of the town.\u201d There is nothing in the notice to that effect, nor from which it can be reasonably inferred. It being defective in that respect, no action can be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-3\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
