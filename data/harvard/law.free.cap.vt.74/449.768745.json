Plea, not guilty. Trial by jury at the December Terml, 1901, Windsor County, <em>Stafford, </em>J., presiding. Verdict, guilty. Judgment and sentence thereon. The respondent excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-13\">That part of the charge excepted to- is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-14\">\u201cIf you find the defence, or attempted defence, is a false one, of course he knows it, and,if you should.be satisfied it is false, that would be evidence tending to show that he is guilty, because if he were not guilty, he would not attempt, probably, to put in a false defence. So whenever an <em>alibi </em>is attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>to be proved and is false, it may be treated by the jury as positive evidence of guilt. But it is a question for you to say whether upon the evidence you have a reasonable doubt about his having been there at the time claimed, and if you have a reasonable doubt, as I said before, he is entitled to the benefit of it, and entitled to be acquitted.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b466-5\"><em>Gilbert A. Davis </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-6\">It was error to charge that the attempt to prove an <em>alibi </em>and that attempt failing, was \u201cpositive\u201d evidence of guilt. \u201cPositive\u201d evidence, is evidence to the precise point in issue, as in the case of homicide, that the accused caused the death. <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>5 Cush. 310; <em>People </em>v <em>Cronin, </em>34 Cal. 202; <em>People </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>60 Cal. 144, 2 Rice Ev. 767.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-7\">As said by RedEiEed, C. J., in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>27 Vt. 726, the introduction by the respondent of a fabricated <em>alibi </em>\u201chas no direct tendency to establish the main charge.\u201d To the same effect is <em>State </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>61 Vt. 194; 1 Best on Ev. s. 27; 1 Greenl. Ev. 13.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b466-8\"><em>Chas. P. Tarbell., </em>State\u2019s Attorney, for the State.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-9\">A false <em>alibi </em>is evidence of guilt and has been too many times so held to be successfully questioned now. The charge was correct. Whar. Crim. Law, 715; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>27 Vt. 724; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>61 Vt. 153; <em>State </em>v. <em>Totten, </em>72 Vt. 73.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b466-10\">RowEEE, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6R\">The prisoner set up an <em>alibi. </em>The court charged that if he fabricated it, the jury had a right to consider that as positive proof of guilt. Although there may be no erroneous statement of legal principle in this, it was such a failure adequately to present the law\u2019s view of a fabricated <em>alibi </em>as criminative evidence as to call for a reversal, for it was calculated to mislead the jury into supposing that in the event named it was bound to convict. The law says that a fabricated <em>alibi </em>is a criminative circumstance, and an inferential admission of guilt, but not conclusive. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>61 Vt. 153, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>194, 17 Atl. 483. Mr. Bishop says that a failure in the proof of an <em>alibi, </em>while in special circumstances, such as where it discloses an attempt to mislead by false evidence, it may justly prejudice the prisoner\u2019s case,- \u2014 is not otherwise more significant than the like failure in any other part of his proof. 1 Bish.
