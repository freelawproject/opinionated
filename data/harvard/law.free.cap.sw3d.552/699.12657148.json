We affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Baldridge is a C4-C6 quadriplegic\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   due to a car accident when he was sixteen years old in approximately 1976. He has no functional hand movement, limited upper body strength and use, and no use of his lower extremities. He has used a power wheel chair for mobility for over forty years and uses a customized splint on his arm for limited writing tasks. Baldridge has a bachelor's degree from University of Arizona, a master's degree in Arts and Teaching from Drake University, and a master's degree in Community Health from University of Missouri-Kansas City. Baldridge was hired by KCPS in 2002 to work as a counselor at an alternative school program for students who were suspended from classes for short or long-term periods. During Baldridge's first position with KCPS he worked in an alternative setting where he worked in a room with two co-employees that were available to assist him with tasks whenever it was necessary. When that program was discontinued, KCPS reassigned Baldridge to a traditional school guidance counselor position at James Elementary. Due to Baldridge's inability to scan, copy, and write, he was provided with a dedicated paraprofessional to assist him with tasks he could not perform due to his disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Betty Hatcher (\"Hatcher\") replaced Baldridge's original dedicated paraprofessional in 2008. When Hatcher was assisting Baldridge she would retrieve disruptive or distressed students from classrooms, console them or escort them to the office to meet with Baldridge, review folders and ensure compliance with guidelines, help create the curriculum, set up a room for agitated students to come in and cool off, prepare materials for instruction, arrange lesson plans, take notes, write on whiteboards, and file. Hatcher also assisted Baldridge in attaching his arm brace at various times so he could eat and drink, administering personal medication, adjusting his chest brace, and at the end of each day securing him into his vehicle with a seatbelt and attaching a brace to his arm that allowed him to steer his vehicle. She did not counsel students and was not present during any of Baldridge's confidential counseling sessions with students. Hatcher had other duties outside of assisting Baldridge such as filling in for the school secretary on the secretary's lunch break and monitoring classrooms in case a teacher had to leave due to an emergency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In December 2012, Baldridge experienced a workplace injury which is not at issue in this case but did require him to be off of work for an extended period of time. In the summer of 2013, he was due to return to work for the 2013-2014 school year. He was advised by KCPS Employee and Labor Relations Specialist Marilyn Overton (\"Overton\") that KCPS was reviewing his accommodations and she needed him to complete some paperwork. Baldridge provided Overton information regarding his physical limitations. Baldridge also suggested that KCPS obtain a vocational assessment from the Rehabilitation\n   Institute of Kansas City (\"RIKC\") to assist in evaluating alternative accommodations to meet his needs, which KCPS agreed to do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After reviewing Baldridge's current accommodations and learning the scope of Hatcher's duties, KCPS' Human Resources Director Mary Laffey (\"Laffey\"), KCPS' interim superintendent Al Tunis (\"Tunis\"), and Overton decided to withdraw the accommodation of Baldridge's dedicated paraprofessional. On October 2, 2013, Baldridge and Hatcher were called into a meeting with Overton, a representative for the teachers' union Andrea Flinders, Principal Jo Nemeth (\"Nemeth\"), and Assistant Superintendent of School Leadership Darrell Davis (\"Davis\"). Baldridge was told that his paraprofessional accommodation was being removed immediately and that other options would need to be explored, although those new accommodations had yet to be determined. He was placed on administrative leave with pay, effective immediately, and both Baldridge and Hatcher were ordered to pack up their belongings and leave school property. He also received a subsequent letter from KCPS that he was not to enter upon any KCPS properties or he would risk violating KCPS policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Pending the vocational assessment at RIKC, Laffey identified a modified assignment at East High School for Baldridge that did not require the same clerical responsibilities as his previous position. She developed a plan with Baldridge for the spring semester so that he could return to work after the winter break. Baldridge accepted the new position. The position was not a counseling position but instead he was assigned to work with severely disabled students. When suggesting the position to Baldridge, Laffey stated that she thought the disabled children might be more comfortable with him due to his own disability. During his time at East High School, he was not included in any professional level development seminars or meetings, was isolated from the counseling department, and was not provided with any formal accommodations. He was also not included in an email regarding a professional development day scheduled for late January 2014. Due to not being informed that it was a professional development day, Baldridge waited outside the school in the cold for a significant period of time for someone to let him into the building. After a custodian let him into the building, Baldridge sat in his assigned classroom for several hours, where he was physically unable to obtain food or drink, remove his coat, or turn on the lights. Finally, he texted his supervisor indicating he needed someone to let him out of the building so that he could return home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 14, 2014, Erin Brown (\"Brown\") of RIKC conducted Baldridge's vocational assessment. Brown recommended the following list of accommodations to assist Baldridge in fulfilling his job duties:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   a. Use of AudioNote iPad app, or another recording device for meetings if a note taker is unavailable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   b. Converting as much paper to electronic format to allow Mr. Baldridge independent access through a computer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   c. Placement in a school that does not require use of an elevator.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   d. Use of a paraprofessional or administrative assistant to assist with the management of paper that can't be digitized, as well as being available to assist students to and from the classroom if an elevator is required. This position would not need to be full-time if other accommodations were met.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   e. Use of headset or Bluetooth headset for phone conversations. Someone would need to be available to put the headset on at the start of the day and take it off at the end of the day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   She also recommended a paraprofessional be available to assist him with some of his other job responsibilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Following Brown's assessment, KCPS reassigned Baldridge to a school guidance counselor position at Phyllis Wheatley Elementary (\"Wheatley\") for the 2014-2015 school year. This remained his position at the time of trial. KCPS limited his initial assignment to students in classrooms on the same floor as Baldridge's office to avoid use of an elevator. KCPS also implemented a \"team-approach\" accommodation at Wheatley. Whenever Baldridge needed assistance he was told to contact the Principal, Jose Verduzco (\"Verduzco\"), who would send someone to assist Baldridge. However, when Baldridge would text or email Verduzco, Baldridge would be told that someone would come help him when they became available. Baldridge never knew which person would be sent to help him and was unsure how long he would have to wait to receive assistance. KCPS also routed Baldridge's computer to the main office printer so the staff there could retrieve printed materials for him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As a result of Baldridge's transfer to Wheatley, that school had more counselors than the applicable regulations required. This resulted in Baldridge sharing an office with Shirley Washington (\"Washington\"), another counselor at Wheatley. Over time, Washington voluntarily assumed some daily tasks assisting Baldridge in addition to her own responsibilities. However, KCPS instructed Washington that she could not assist Baldridge with getting into his vehicle and putting on his seatbelt because they were concerned about the potential risk of harm to Baldridge and the public. Baldridge also did not always have assistance in putting on his hand brace for eating, resulting in him sometimes skipping lunch or being only able to eat certain cold foods that he could eat without his brace. He was unable to open doors for himself, which required him to call ahead to the classroom or bang his wheelchair into the classroom door until someone opened the door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   While at Wheatley, Baldridge made multiple unanswered requests for a Bluetooth headset to remedy the telephone issue. Baldridge did receive the software he requested but was not provided the training to utilize it. Overton stated at trial that a training date for the software was set up but Baldridge was absent under the Family Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\") at the time it was offered. His position at Wheatley eventually required frequent use of an elevator as he was assigned children on other floors, and he often had to escort children in distress without assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   During the time following Baldridge's workplace injury, he experienced additional unrelated absences. During the 2013-2014 school year, Baldridge missed approximately 15 days, excluding the time he was on paid administrative leave. During the 2014-2015 fall semester, Baldridge missed approximately 15 days. Baldridge missed all of the 2014-2015 spring semester except for the first two weeks. Baldridge missed approximately 58 days in the 2015-2016 school year. Many of the absences were approved under the FMLA or general leave of absence allowed under KCPS policy. KCPS never disciplined Baldridge for his absences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On June 12, 2014, Baldridge filed suit against KCPS, alleging disability discrimination under the Missouri Human Rights Act, section 213.010\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"MHRA\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   and seeking punitive damages. At the close of Baldridge's evidence, KCPS filed a motion for directed verdict. The trial court granted in part KCPS' motion for directed verdict by directing out the portion of Baldridge's claim based on the 2015 spring semester when he was unable to work and the portion of his punitive damages claim based on his period of paid administrative leave. At the close of all evidence KCPS filed another motion for directed verdict. The trial court sustained in part KCPS' second directed verdict motion by directing out the portion of Baldridge's claim based upon a dedicated paraprofessional or the removal of the dedicated paraprofessional as a reasonable accommodation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After the directed verdict rulings and during the jury instruction conference, KCPS offered limiting instructions pursuant to MAI 34.06 concerning the withdrawal of the claims regarding the dedicated paraprofessional in October 2013, Baldridge's period of paid administrative leave, and the 2015 spring semester when Baldridge was unable to work. The trial court accepted them as instruction numbers 10, 11, and 12 respectively. However, the next morning prior to closing arguments, the trial court reversed its ruling on issuing any formal, written withdrawal instructions to the jury. The trial court instead authorized counsel to argue the content of the rejected withdrawal instructions during closing arguments. Baldridge's counsel also argued during rebuttal, \"[h]ow in the world are they going to-if they truly, sincerely and meaningfully want to figure out what he needs, do you send him home?\" After objection to this argument by KCPS, the trial court then gave an oral instruction to the jury that \"there is no claim in this case for damages based upon the plaintiff being placed on paid administrative leave or a claim for damages for the time he was off work and on paid administrative leave.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Also at the instruction conference, the trial court prepared its own verdict director, which was instruction number six.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court's verdict director was based on a claim of hostile work environment rather than discrimination based on a failure to provide reasonable accommodation as requested by Baldridge. Both parties objected to the court's proposed verdict director. KCPS objected because it wanted the third element of the hostile work environment claim to reflect the language in\n   <em>\n    Fuchs v. Department of Revenue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6905913\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/447/727/#p733\">\n    447 S.W.3d 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 733 (Mo. App. W.D. 2014). Baldridge objected because \"this is not a hostile work environment-type case in the way that the case has been traditionally presented\" and \"the verdict director imposes too high of a threshold on the plaintiff.\" Baldridge further argued that the \"severe and pervasive language that is more appropriate in a harassment-type case rather than a discrimination case based on the failure to accommodate.\" The trial judge then asked \"so everybody except me is objecting to the verdict director; is that right?\" The trial judge then\n   stated \"Me against all yous [sic]. All right. Your objections are all noted and overruled.\" The jury was presented with the verdict director as drafted by the trial judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The jury found in favor of Baldridge and awarded $230,000 in compensatory damages and $576,075 in punitive damages. On June 10, 2016 KCPS filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding verdict (\"JNOV\") or, in the alternative, motion for new trial or remittitur with suggestion in support. The trial court granted KCPS' motion in part by awarding a new trial. The trial court's grounds for granting the new trial, as set forth in the trial court's order, were that it erroneously allowed Baldridge to present evidence regarding the removal of the dedicated paraprofessional, it erroneously allowed Baldridge to present evidence of several actions on the part of KCPS which did not legally constitute unlawful or unreasonable lack of accommodation, it erroneously allowed Baldridge's claim of failure to provide accommodations for eating and drinking assistance as proof of hostility and cruelty, the evidence did not support submission of a punitive damage claim, and the court erroneously failed to allow the withdrawal instructions submitted by KCPS relating to the claims involving the withdrawal of the dedicated paraprofessional accommodation and paid administrative leave. The trial court denied all other forms of relief requested by KCPS. This timely appeal followed with cross appeals by both parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Baldridge's Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Baldridge raises three points on appeal. In Baldridge's first point on appeal, he argues that the trial court erred in ordering a new trial on the basis that it was error to allow the previously provided disability accommodations into evidence because regulations under the MHRA\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   provide that prior accommodations should be considered in determining the reasonableness of current accommodations and hostile work environment claims require the jury to consider the totality of the evidence, including all conduct of the employer, whether or not the conduct involves the provision or deprivation of a reasonable accommodation. In Baldridge's second point on appeal, he argues that the trial court erred in ordering a new trial on the basis that Baldridge failed to make a submissible case for punitive damages because the remedy for failure to make a submissible case for punitive damages is not to grant a new trial. In Baldridge's third point on appeal, he argues that the trial court erred in ordering a new trial on the basis that it was error not to have allowed KCPS' withdrawal instructions on the withdrawal of Baldridge's prior accommodations and his placement on administrative leave because the instructions misstated the law and failure to allow the instructions did not result in prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"A trial court has great discretion in determining whether to grant a new trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Duckett v.

KCPS argues that because the accommodation of a full time dedicated paraprofessional was not reasonable in the first place, the removal of that unreasonable accommodation cannot be considered in determining if the removal was discriminatory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even using KCPS' definition,\n   there is no support for the proposition that the only conduct relevant to establishing a hostile work environment in the case of disability discrimination is the removal of (or failure to provide) reasonable accommodations. Paragraph third of the verdict director prepared by the trial court required the jury to determine whether Baldridge was subjected to \"conduct that was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms, conditions, or privileges of [Baldridge's] employment by having the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with plaintiff's work performance.\" Paragraph fourth of the verdict director then required the jury to determine whether Baldridge's \"disability was a contributing factor in such conduct.\" The question for the jury was whether Baldridge's disability was a contributing factor behind KCPS'\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     conduct\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , which plainly included the removal of accommodations Baldridge once had. The question for the jury, as the case was submitted to them by the trial court, was not whether KCPS' conduct was (or was not) the removal or failure to provide a reasonable accommodation. Though paragraph third required the jury to find that the totality of KCPS' conduct \"unreasonably interfered\" with Baldridge's work performance, again, given the tempering effect of paragraph fourth, which requires a finding that Baldridge's disability was a contributing factor in KCPS' conduct, it does not follow that \"unreasonably interfering with work performance\" is limited as a matter of law to the removal (or failure to provide) reasonable accommodations. In short, the removal of a paraprofessional (whether dedicated or fulltime) who had been provided by KCPS for over eight years was plainly \"conduct.\" It was for the jury to decide if this, and other conduct by KCPS was sufficiently severe and pervasive as to alter the terms, conditions, or privileges of Baldridge's employment by having the purpose of unreasonably interfering with his work performance. And it was for the jury to decide if Baldridge's disability was a contributing factor in KCPS' conduct. We find that the removal of Baldridge's dedicated paraprofessional, which had been provided to him by KCPS for over eight years, is conduct the jury could consider in determining if Baldridge was subjected to a hostile work environment. It was error as a matter of law, and thus an abuse of discretion, for the trial court to conclude to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Next Baldridge argues that the trial court erred in granting a new trial on the basis that it was error to allow him to argue that failure to provide him assistance in eating and drinking created a hostile work environment, when evidence was provided by KCPS that an employee was designated to help him with these tasks and there was no evidence that he was ever denied the needed assistance. The trial court cited to\n   <em>\n    Rask v. Fresenius Medical Care North America\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3328045\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/509/466/\">\n    509 F.3d 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 2007), in finding that providing assistance to Baldridge for eating and drinking was not a reasonable accommodation and therefore not actionable or admissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Baldridge testified that during times when his job duties required him to assist students over the lunch hour he would have nobody to assist him later in the day to eat and he would have to miss his lunch on those days. He also testified that he felt like he had to fend for himself even with things like eating lunch. For the reasons we have already explained, it was for the\n   jury to determine whether the removal of Baldridge's paraprofessional unreasonably interfered with his work performance-an assessment which permitted consideration of the practical effect on Baldridge of deprivation of a dedicated paraprofessional. Slow or no response to an employees' request for assistance, whether it is a reasonable accommodation to provide such assistance or not, is conduct that the jury may consider when determining if KCPS created a hostile work environment, as it is the employers motivation in doing so which is relevant. It was legal error, and thus an abuse of discretion, for the trial court to conclude to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Lastly Baldridge argues that the trial court erred in granting a new trial on the basis that it was error to allow him to present evidence that he was forced to use a speakerphone in a room where his conversations would be overheard by other persons. He argues that his position as a counselor required him to be able to confidentially communicate regarding student's needs. The trial court found that such an arrangement was not unreasonable or unlawful and therefore should not have been admitted as proof of a hostile work environment. However, as was previously pointed out there is no authority for the proposition that the jury can only consider conduct amounting to the withdrawal or refusal of reasonable accommodations in determining whether a disabled employee has been subjected to a hostile work environment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   It was legal error and an abuse of discretion for the trial court to grant a new trial based on the erroneous conclusion that regarding Baldridge's prior accommodations were inadmissible and on the erroneous conclusion that the only conduct relevant for the jury's consideration was conduct amounting to the refusal to afford reasonable accommodations. Point One is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    Point Two\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In Point Two, Baldridge argues that the trial court erred in granting a new trial on the grounds that he failed to make a submissible cause of action for punitive damages because failure to make a submissible cause of action is not grounds for a new trial. Baldridge further argues that there was clear and cogent circumstantial evidence to submit a claim for punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Section 213.111 permits the recovery of punitive damages in an action brought under the MHRA.\n   <em>\n    Ellison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6863392\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/463/426/#p435\">\n    463 S.W.3d at 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Whether there was sufficient evidence to support an award for punitive damages is a question of law which is review\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Poage v.

The evidence offered to support the underlying substantive claim is not mutually exclusive from that evidence which supports the plaintiff's additional claim for punitive damages and may be used in determining whether the defendant acted with evil motive or reckless indifference.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6863392\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/463/426/#p435\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The trial court found that Baldridge's punitive damage claim could not be supported by the removal of his dedicated paraprofessional because it was not a reasonable accommodation in the first\n   place. However, since the removal of Baldridge's dedicated paraprofessional can be considered in determining if a claim of hostile work environment has been established, it can be considered in connection with a claim of punitive damages. Further, there was additional evidence presented regarding Baldridge's treatment by KCPS including his exclusion from professional development, his lack of inclusion as a staff member, lack of information regarding when the school would be closed causing him to sit outside in the cold unable to get into the building, Baldridge's continued unanswered requests for further accommodations, his placement on paid administrative leave due to the removal of his paraprofessional with no plan as to what accommodations may be used to replace the withdrawn accommodation, notifying him that if he entered KCPS property he was subject to discipline and his placement in a position different from the one he held for over ten years. We find this evidence sufficient to establish a submissible claim for punitive damages to the jury. As a result, we need not address whether the appropriate remedy in the face of insufficient evidence to support a punitive damage award is a new trial, as opposed to the grant of a motion notwithstanding the verdict. Point Two is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    Point Three\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Baldridge argues in his third point on appeal that the trial court erred in granting a new trial on the basis that it should have allowed KCPS' withdrawal instructions on the withdrawal of Baldridge's prior accommodations and placement on administrative leave because the failure to allow these instructions did not prejudice KCPS. Baldridge argues that KCPS was not prejudiced because Baldridge's prior paraprofessional accommodation was evidence that the jury should have been allowed to consider and the jury received oral limiting instructions from the trial court regarding Baldridge's administrative leave claims, therefore KCPS was not prejudiced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \"Withdrawal instructions may be given when evidence on an issue has been received, but there is inadequate proof for submission of the issue to the jury; when there is evidence presented which might mislead the jury in its consideration of the case as pleaded and submitted; when there is evidence presented directed to an issue that is abandoned; or when there is evidence of such character that might easily raise a false issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Brizendine v.

There is no authority that requires the jury to only consider the removal of reasonable accommodations to determine if a hostile work environment was present. Limiting instructions regarding the removal of Baldridge's paraprofessional would not have been appropriate under the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   However, even if limiting instructions were necessary, KCPS was not prejudiced\n   because it was allowed to argue in closing that the removal of Baldridge's paraprofessional was not to be considered. In closing KCPS stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   [T]here are two things that have been discussed heavily; his paid leave and not being awarded a full-time para. Him being placed on paid leave, the Court has decided that you cannot consider that in making your-you cannot consider that because that was not a discriminatory act. Placing him on paid leave was not a discriminatory act. And the Court has decided that. Secondly, not awarding him a full-time para is not discrimination. The Court has also decided that. So those are two things the Court has told-the Court is telling you are not basis for discrimination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   KCPS reiterated later in its closing argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   I'm telling you and the Court is telling you, taking away his full-time paraprofessional, placing him on paid leave is not discrimination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Further, the trial court gave an oral limiting instruction from the bench regarding Baldridge being placed on administrative leave.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, even if limiting or withdrawal instructions had been proper, Baldridge was not prejudiced because the trial court gave a verbal limiting instruction regarding the paid administrative leave and KCPS was provided the opportunity to argue that the removal of Baldridge's paraprofessional was not to be considered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Point Three is granted.

KCPS argues in its second point on appeal that the trial court erred in denying its motion for JNOV because Baldridge failed to present substantial evidence in support of every element of a claim for hostile work environment since Baldridge never pled a claim of hostile work environment.

KCPS cannot argue that it was not given an opportunity to prepare for a claim of hostile work environment because it was pled by Baldridge and the evidence supported its submission.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Point Two is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    Point Three\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In Point Three, KCPS argues that the trial court erred in dismissing its motion for JNOV because Baldridge failed to present substantial evidence in support of every element of a claim for punitive damages since there was no evidence of evil motive or reckless indifference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   We address this argument in our analysis of Baldridge's third point on appeal.

KCPS argues that to require a fulltime employee to solely provide assistance to Baldridge does not legally constitute a reasonable accommodation. Baldridge appears to define a \"dedicated paraprofessional\" as having the same person provide the assistance he needs each day, while allowing that person to perform other tasks unrelated to providing assistance to him. He argues that this does constitute a reasonable accommodation under these facts.

Baldridge had been provided a paraprofessional for eight years and there was evidence that the cost of providing the paraprofessional to Baldridge was miniscule when compared to the KCPS budget. We do not have to reach the issue of whether the providing of a dedicated paraprofessional was a reasonable accommodation under either party's definition of that term as the question in this case required the jury to consider the collective conduct that Baldridge was subjected to by KCPS and the motivation of KCPS in engaging in that conduct, including the removal of that accommodation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    To support its argument that a full time dedicated paraprofessional was per se an unreasonable accommodation, KCPS cites to\n    <em>\n     Jewell v.

Baldridge has elected to stand with his verdict, notwithstanding this seemingly unfair turn of events at trial. But that fact does not warrant a corollary conclusion that KCPS was prejudiced. To the contrary.
