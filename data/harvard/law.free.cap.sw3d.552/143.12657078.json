We affirm the judgment of the trial court as herein modified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   MPO is a Missouri limited liability company which was formed to build and operate a medical office building in Lee's Summit, Missouri. The medical office building was to be constructed on ground owned by DSII, also a Missouri limited liability company. Davis is the sole member of DSII. In connection with the arrangement, Davis was made a 40% member of MPO, and was named as MPO's managing member.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   MPO and DSII signed a ground lease in October 2004 (\"Ground Lease\"). The Ground Lease was amended on March 4, 2005 to extend to MPO an absolute option to purchase the ground on which the medical office building was being constructed for the agreed upon amount of $650,000. Davis signed the Ground Lease and the amendment on behalf of MPO and DSII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   By 2012, disputes had arisen between Appellants and MPO regarding (among other things) the fact that Davis, in his capacity as managing member of MPO, had been paying DSII more monthly rent than was owed under the Ground Lease. In addition, Appellants had assigned the Ground Lease rents to BMO Harris Bank as security for a loan unrelated to MPO's\n   operations. The assignment of Ground Lease rents had exposed MPO and its members to a lawsuit filed by BMO Harris Bank to enforce the assignment of rents. As a result of these disputes, the members holding a majority interest in MPO removed Davis as the managing member on September 24, 2012, and named Mitchell Fiser (\"Fiser\") as the new managing member. Appellants then initiated a lawsuit against MPO and its individual members seeking dissolution of MPO, partition, and damages for breach of the Ground Lease for nonpayment of rent. MPO asserted counterclaims against Davis and DSII alleging breach of fiduciary duty, misappropriation of funds, and breach of MPO's operating agreement. In the meantime, MPO was required to interplead Ground Lease rent payments into court because BMO Harris Bank was claiming it had the right to collect the rents at the same time that Appellants were suing MPO for the rents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 27, 2013, MPO, all of the members of MPO, Davis, and DSII entered into a written settlement agreement to resolve their disputes (\"Settlement Agreement\"). Relevant to this case, the Settlement Agreement required MPO to immediately authorize the release of $59,800 in interpleaded rent payments to BMO Harris Bank to facilitate a settlement between BMO Harris Bank, Davis, and DSII. It is uncontested that MPO performed this term of the Settlement Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Settlement Agreement expressed that MPO's monthly rent obligation under the Ground Lease should always have been $3,520, and that Davis had been causing MPO to overpay rent for the period from October 2012 through October 2013, resulting in an overpayment in the total amount of $14,040.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Commencing with the November 2013 rent payment, DSII agreed to credit MPO's monthly Ground Lease rent obligation by $1,500 per month until the overpaid rent amount was recouped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Central to the Settlement Agreement was Davis's agreement to be removed as a member of MPO. Section 1.D of the Settlement Agreement described the agreed upon process for acquiring and calculating the value of Davis's member interest as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Jess Davis agrees to sell his interest in Medical Plaza for 40% of the net asset value of Medical Plaza, which includes the funds in the Medical Plaza bank account at time of closing, subject to Sections 1.E through 1.H below, and the net equity in the building, less accrued real estate taxes at time of closing. The net equity in the building will be determined by an appraisal of the building. The appraisal shall be a fair market value appraisal prepared by a qualified appraiser selected by a lending institution chosen by the Manager of Medical Plaza, Mitchell S. Fiser, using his discretion to find a lending institution providing the best terms for the potential refinancing to obtain the funds to purchase Davis'[s] interest in Medical Plaza; and all of the members of Medical Plaza will sign a Unanimous Written Consent in lieu of a meeting of the members, authorizing Medical Plaza to enter into this Agreement and to take all steps necessary to implement the terms of this Agreement. Each member of Medical Plaza, including Davis, may make recommendations\n   to Mitchell S. Fiser concerning potential lenders to fund the purchase of Davis'[s] interest in Medical Plaza.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When the Settlement Agreement was entered into, MPO's members knew that MPO owed approximately $2,680,360 on a loan for which the building served as collateral, and as to which MPO's members, including Davis, were personal guarantors. MPO's members, including Davis, were thus aware that MPO's net equity in the building would be determined by subtracting this loan balance from the building's appraised value. Though the evidence suggested that MPO's members anticipated that the building's appraised value would exceed the outstanding balance on MPO's loan, Section 1.D of the Settlement Agreement did not condition Davis's obligation to sell his 40% member interest in MPO on receiving a building appraisal that exceeded MPO's outstanding loan balance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Settlement Agreement did not expressly state that MPO would be exercising the purchase option in the Ground Lease in connection with Davis's sale of his 40% member interest in MPO. However, the Settlement Agreement referred to the Ground Lease in provisions that suggested the parties expected the severing of relations between Davis and MPO would also include the severing of relations between MPO and DSII. The Settlement Agreement provided that should Davis fail to timely close on the sale of his 40% member interest, MPO would be permitted to offset the price to be paid upon exercise of the purchase option in the Ground Lease by amounts Davis owed MPO (Section 1.H of the Settlement Agreement). The Settlement Agreement also included a provision that addressed the Appellants' agreement to correct a scrivener's error that had resulted in Appellants' erroneous conveyance of a portion of the land legally described in the Ground Lease to an unrelated entity. (Section 1.I of the Settlement Agreement). With respect to this provision, Appellants agreed to take steps to remediate the error \"such that the Leased/Option Property is included as a portion of the property to be conveyed to [MPO] (as set forth in the Ground Lease) and may be included in any deed of trust obtained by [MPO] in connection with its exercise of the Option to Purchase.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Pursuant to Section 1.D of the Settlement Agreement, and in order to determine MPO's net equity in the building, Fiser contacted lenders who might be willing to fund the purchase of Davis's member interest in MPO and the purchase of the land from DSII. Consistent with the discretion afforded Fiser by the Settlement Agreement, Fiser chose First Citizens Bank as the potential lender. First Citizens Bank then employed processes required by law to select an independent appraiser to value MPO's building and the land. First Citizens Bank selected Valbridge Property Advisors (\"Valbridge\") as the appraiser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   When Davis learned the identity of the appraiser, he expressed disapproval, characterizing Valbridge as too conservative. Davis did not contend, however, that Valbridge had been selected through a process that failed to comply with Section 1.D of the Settlement Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Valbridge's appraisal determined the fair market value of MPO's building and the land on which it was constructed to be $2,660,000. The value assigned to the land was $650,000, as that was the value agreed upon by the parties in connection with the absolute purchase option set forth in the Ground Lease. Subtracting the value of the land from the total appraised value yielded an appraised value for MPO's building of $2,010,000. When netted against MPO's outstanding loan balance,\n   the building had a negative net equity value of $670,360.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Section 1.D of the Settlement Agreement provided that the value of Davis's 40% interest in MPO was to be calculated by offsetting amounts Davis owed MPO (as described in Sections 1.E, 1.F, 1.G, and 1.H of the Settlement Agreement) against Davis's 40% share of MPO's net asset value, an amount that included the building's net equity value. The building's negative net equity value virtually ensured that MPO had a negative net asset value. Because Davis's 40% interest in MPO's negative net asset value was a negative number, the \"offset\" of that amount by additional amounts Davis owed MPO pursuant to Sections 1.E, 1.F, 1.G, and 1.H of the Settlement Agreement meant that Davis would be required to pay MPO in order to be removed as a member of MPO and as a personal guarantor on MPO's loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Davis was unwilling to accept the building's appraised value determined by Valbridge. He advised Fiser that Integra Realty Resources (\"Integra\") had performed an appraisal of the building and land in 2010 and had arrived at a fair market value of $3,600,000. Though the Settlement Agreement did not obligate MPO to do so, Fiser contacted Integra and arranged for a second appraisal of MPO's building and the land on which it was constructed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In the meantime, the Settlement Agreement had anticipated a closing date of February 28, 2014. Given MPO's willingness to secure a second appraisal, the parties entered into an addendum to the Settlement Agreement on February 26, 2014, extending the closing date by forty-five days to April 14, 2014, and substituting \"April 14, 2014\" for \"February 28, 2014\" in Sections 1.E, 1.F, 1.G, and 1.H of the Settlement Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Integra appraisal determined the fair market value of MPO's building and the land on which it was located to be $2,650,000, using $650,000 as the agreed upon value for the land. The Integra appraisal thus yielded an appraised value for MPO's building that was $10,000 less than had been determined by Valbridge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On April 14, 2014, counsel for MPO sent a letter to counsel for Davis and DSII outlining MPO's intention to move forward to close on the transactions anticipated by Settlement Agreement. In the letter, MPO expressed its willingness to work cooperatively with Davis to \"select a final closing date to afford both parties the opportunity to consider final numbers and transaction documents.\" The letter noted that the delay in securing the Integra appraisal had interfered with the parties' ability to close by April 14, 2014, the closing date set forth in the addendum to the Settlement Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The April 14, 2014 letter calculated the value of Davis's 40% member interest in MPO. Using the formula set forth in Section 1.D of the Settlement Agreement, the letter added amounts Davis owed MPO pursuant to Sections 1.E, 1.F, 1.G, and 1.H of the Settlement Agreement to Davis's 40% share of MPO's negative asset value to determine that Davis was required to pay MPO $256,200 in order to be removed as a member of MPO and as a personal guarantor on MPO's loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The April 14, 2014 letter exercised MPO's purchase option as described in the Ground Lease, and netted $650,000, the agreed purchase price for the land, against the amount Davis owed MPO to be removed as a member of MPO, resulting in a net amount of $393,800 to be paid by MPO to Appellants at closing in order to acquire Davis's 40% member interest in MPO and the land owned by DSII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Appellants did not respond to MPO's April 14, 2014 letter. On April 22, 2014, MPO's counsel again wrote to Appellants' counsel advising that MPO intended to proceed to closing, and noting that Appellants' cooperation was required. The April 22, 2014 letter advised that if Appellants did not cooperate to facilitate closing, MPO would proceed accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In subsequent email communications, the parties' counsel settled upon May 22, 2014 as an agreed closing date for the transactions anticipated by the Settlement Agreement. Appellants' counsel continued to advise, however, that Davis did not agree that an accurate fair market value had been determined for MPO's building. Davis did not otherwise challenge the calculations set forth in MPO's April 14, 2014 letter, and did not challenge that MPO had exercised the purchase option described in the amendment to the Ground Lease. Davis confirmed during later trial testimony that he had no disagreement with the calculations set forth in the April 14, 2014 letter other than the building's appraised value; that he was satisfied with the manner in which MPO had exercised the Ground Lease purchase option; and that he had always anticipated that MPO would buy the land on which the building was located at the same time he was removed as a 40% member in MPO, as the parties' objective had been to sever all business relationships between them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Beyond agreeing to May 22, 2014 as an extended closing date, Davis made no further efforts to close on the transactions anticipated by the Settlement Agreement. Davis contended that he had no obligation to close because the building appraised at an amount that was less than the balance owed on MPO's loan, and because it was never anticipated that he would have to pay MPO in order to be removed as a member. After the May 22, 2014 closing date passed, MPO ceased paying rent under the Ground Lease from and after June 1, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On May 30, 2014, MPO filed a lawsuit against Davis and DSII in the Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri. Davis and DSII filed counterclaims in response, and joined Fiser as a third-party defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   By the time of trial, MPO's claims against Davis and DSII were set forth in a first amended petition as follows: Count I (seeking specific performance of the Settlement Agreement); Count II (seeking damages for breach of the Settlement Agreement); and Count III (seeking damages for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in the Settlement Agreement). Davis and DSII's counterclaims were set forth in a pleading styled \"second amended counterclaims\" as follows: Count I (seeking damages from MPO for breach of the Ground Lease for non-payment of rent); Count II (seeking a declaratory judgment terminating the Ground Lease); Count III (seeking damages from MPO and third-party defendant Fiser for breach of the Settlement Agreement based on use of an appraisal that did not fairly calculate the building's value); Count IV (seeking damages from third-party defendant Fiser for breach of fiduciary duty); and Count V (seeking a declaratory judgment directing MPO and third-party defendant Fiser to afford access to records for inspection and copying).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Prior to trial, the parties agreed that MPO's Count I (seeking specific performance of the Settlement Agreement) and Appellants' counterclaims Count II (seeking a declaratory judgment terminating the Ground Lease) and Count V (seeking a declaratory judgment to inspect records) would be determined by the court in equity. The parties agreed to try all other\n   claims to the jury, leaving the equity claims to be determined post-jury verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   After all evidence had been presented to the jury, the trial court entered a directed verdict in favor of third-party defendant Fiser on Counts III and IV of Appellants' counterclaims. Davis and DSII contemporaneously agreed to voluntarily dismiss with prejudice Count V (the equity claim seeking a declaratory judgment to inspect records). As a result, at the close of the evidence, MPO's Counts II and III remained to be determined by the jury; Counts I and III of Appellants' counterclaims (against MPO only) remained to be determined by the jury; MPO's Count I remained to be determined by the court in equity; and Count II of Appellants' counterclaims remained to be determined by the court in equity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The jury returned verdicts in favor of MPO and against Appellants on MPO's Count II for breach of the Settlement Agreement, and on MPO's Count III for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The jury awarded MPO $150,000 in damages on each count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The jury returned a verdict in favor of DSII and against MPO on Count I of Appellants' counterclaims for breach of the Ground Lease for nonpayment of rent, and awarded damages of $54,000. The jury returned a verdict in favor of MPO and against Appellants on Count III of the counterclaims which sought damages for breach of the Settlement Agreement for using an appraisal that did not determine fair market value of the building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Following the jury verdicts, the parties extensively briefed the remaining issues to be determined by the court in equity. Ultimately, the trial court entered its judgment dated January 11, 2017 (\"Judgment\"). The Judgment incorporated the jury verdicts, and entered judgment in favor of MPO and against Appellants on Count I, MPO's claim for specific performance of the Settlement Agreement. The Judgment also entered judgment in favor of MPO on Count II of Appellants' counterclaims which had sought a declaration terminating the Ground Lease and ordering the payment of attorneys' fees for MPO's breach of the Ground Lease by not paying rent. With respect to Appellants' declaratory judgment claim, the trial court found that Davis and DSII were the first to breach the Ground Lease when they failed to close on the transactions anticipated by the Settlement Agreement, and that the failure to close was not in good faith and warranted the denial of equitable relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In connection with the judgment in favor of MPO ordering specific performance, the Judgment ordered Davis and DSII to close on the sale of Davis's member interest and on the sale of the land described in the Ground Lease pursuant to the calculations set forth in MPO's letter dated April 14, 2014, which was attached to and incorporated into the Judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Judgment ordered that MPO's monetary obligations to Appellants: (i) for $54,000 in unpaid rent due (based on the jury's verdict), (ii) for the amount calculated by the April 14, 2014 letter to acquire Davis's 40% interest in MPO and the land owned by DSII, and (iii) for a $1,000 discovery sanction, would be offset/reduced by $150,000, the damages\n   the jury awarded MPO on its claim for breach of contract,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that this net amount would be paid to Appellants in exchange for Davis's 40% interest in MPO and for DSII's conveyance of the land described in the Ground Lease by warranty deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Davis and DSII filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and/or for new trial which was denied by the trial court. This appeal follows. Other facts will be discussed as pertinent to the points on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    Summary of Issues on Appeal and our Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Appellants assert eight points on appeal.

Appellants' contention is strained and ignores that in this case, there was plainly a civil case or controversy before the trial court. As a part of resolving the civil case before it, the trial court reached a conclusion about which Appellants now complain. Appellants' complaint does not implicate the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction, and amounts to no more than a claim of legal error subject to traditional appellate review. \"Mere error does not deprive a court of jurisdiction it otherwise possesses.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Because the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to enter judgment in this case, including a judgment that made a finding that Appellants contend exceeded the pleadings, the first point on appeal is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   It is worth noting that, in any event, the premise of Appellants' first point on appeal-that Appellants' breach of the Ground Lease was not before the trial court for determination-is flawed for several reasons. First, Appellants moved for directed verdict at the close of MPO's evidence and at the close of all of the evidence, arguing on both occasions that their breach of the Ground Lease had not been pleaded by MPO. The trial court denied the motion on both occasions. The trial court found that though breach of the Ground Lease was not pleaded by MPO as a part of its claim seeking damages for breach of the Settlement Agreement (Count II of the first amended petition), MPO did plead breach of the Ground Lease in connection with its equitable claim seeking specific performance of the Settlement Agreement (Count I of the first amended petition).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court thus found that Appellants' breach of the Ground Lease was an issue to be determined in connection with claims being tried to the court in equity.

Appellants concede in their Reply Brief that MPO pleaded breach of the Ground Lease as an affirmative defense to Appellants' equitable claim seeking to terminate the Ground Lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Third, Appellants injected in their own pleadings the issue of whether the purchase option described in the amendment to the Ground Lease should have closed. In Count III of Appellants' counterclaims, which sought damages for MPO's alleged breach of the Settlement Agreement by using an appraisal that did\n   not fairly calculate the value of the building, Appellants alleged that MPO's failure to perform the Settlement Agreement caused Appellants damage by delaying MPO's purchase of the land subject to the Ground Lease.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Finally, a cursory review of the transcript reflects that Appellants' breach of the Ground Lease was tried by implied consent, even assuming the issue was not pleaded. \"Trial by implied consent allows for issues not raised in the pleadings to be determined by the trial court when the party raising the issue offers evidence without objection by another party.\"\n   <em>\n    Bone v.

Davis testified that he had always expected that MPO would acquire the land from DSII at the same time it acquired Davis's 40% member interest in MPO, as the entire point of the Settlement Agreement had been to sever all business relationships between the parties. Davis's testimony was elicited by MPO without objection. In fact, Appellants' counsel also elicited testimony from Davis about the Ground Lease, and in particular, about the steps MPO was required to follow to exercise the purchase option in the Ground Lease. This evidence had no relevance other than to tend to prove or disprove whether Appellants breached the Ground Lease by failing to close.

Despite this ruling, Appellants did not argue that their alleged breach of the Ground Lease was a question of fact that should be determined by the jury. Appellants made no effort to submit this fact issue to the jury by special interrogatory.

The letter was not sent via certified mail. And the letter was not sent to DSII, but was instead sent to DSII's counsel.

Davis testified that MPO was permitted to express its intent to exercise the purchase option in an informal manner. Davis testified that MPO had sufficiently notified him of its intention to exercise the purchase option by virtue of the April 14, 2014 letter. Davis testified that had the April 14, 2014 not incorporated a building appraisal with which he disagreed, he \"would sign [a] document [conveying the land to MPO] right now.\" Davis and Fiser testified that all parties anticipated that MPO would acquire the land at the same time it acquired Davis's 40% member interest in MPO, testimony borne out by the Settlement Agreement's references to the Ground Lease. Consistent with the parties' collective and uncontested understanding, the Valbridge appraisal and the Integra appraisal did not merely appraise the building MPO owned, but also appraised the land DSII owned. That was also the case with a third appraisal later commissioned by Davis. Davis testified that he wanted Valbridge to know that MPO was going to acquire the land pursuant to its purchase option because Davis believed that information would be beneficial to the appraised value of the building. Finally, as previously noted, Appellants' counterclaims alleged that Appellants' were damaged because MPO's breach of the Settlement Agreement delayed MPO's acquisition of the land described in the Ground Lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The trial court's finding that MPO adequately exercised the purchase option effectively recognized that even though the option was not exercised in strict compliance with the procedure described in the Ground Lease, Appellants were free to waive the technical requirements for exercise of the purchase option.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Pilla v.

The trial court found that Appellants' breach of the Ground Lease occurred as of MPO's April 14, 2014 letter. Alternatively, the evidence supports that the latest date on which the Appellants' breached the Ground Lease was May 22, 2014-the extended closing date agreed upon by the parties' counsel. Regardless the date used, Appellants' breach of the Ground Lease preceded (and precipitated) MPO's decision to stop paying rent on June 1, 2014.

MPO responded that it was entitled to ask the jury to award damages MPO incurred because Appellants did not timely close, as described in Sections 1.E-H of the Settlement Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Sections 1.E-H of the Settlement Agreement reflect the parties' agreement that Appellants owed MPO three amounts: $100,107 representing damages attributable to Davis's failure to lease property in MPO's building as promised at the commencement of the parties' relationship (\"Failure to Rent\" damages); $27,500 in attorneys' fees MPO incurred in the BMO Harris Bank litigation (\"Attorneys' Fees\" damages); and any overpaid rent paid to DSII and not yet recouped by MPO, which was in the amount of $6,540 by the time of the April 14, 2014 letter (\"Overpaid Rent\" damages). These provisions of the Settlement Agreement incentivized Appellants to timely close by noting that the Failure to Rent damages would be reduced to $60,064.20 if closing occurred by the date anticipated by the Settlement Agreement. In the event of a timely closing, the Settlement Agreement provided that the\n   <em>\n    reduced\n   </em>\n   amount of Failure to Rent damages, the Attorneys' Fees damages, and the Overpaid Rent damages would \"offset\" the amount calculated as Davis's 40% share of MPO's net asset value. However, if closing did not occur by the date set forth in the Settlement Agreement, and if the delay was attributable to Davis, Section 1.H of the Settlement Agreement provided that the\n   <em>\n    full\n   </em>\n   amount of the Failure to Rent Damages, the Attorneys' Fees damages, and the Overpaid Rent damages would be aggregated, and: (i) the collective amount would be offset first against distributions otherwise owed by MPO to Davis; and then (ii) any amount unrecovered by a distribution offset would be subject to a 6% interest rate and set off at the rate of $1,500 a month against MPO's monthly Ground Lease rent obligation; and then (iii) against the purchase price due for Davis's 40% member interest presuming a delayed closing, and then (iv) against the purchase price to be paid for the land pursuant to the Ground Lease purchase option, until the full damage amount was recouped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In light of these Settlement Agreement provisions, MPO argued that Appellants' breach of the Settlement Agreement entitled\n   MPO to monetary damages as contemplated in Section 1.H, given a failure to timely close attributable to Appellants. The trial court overruled Appellants' motion for directed verdict in reliance on MPO's argument. Consistent with this ruling, in arguing the breach of contract and implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims to the jury during closing, MPO discussed the three categories of damage contemplated in Section 1.H of the Settlement Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The jury awarded MPO monetary damages for breach of the Settlement Agreement in the amount of $150,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   This monetary award does not, however, adequately compensate MPO for Appellants' breach of the Settlement Agreement. Davis admitted that the purpose of the Settlement Agreement was to ensure Davis's extrication from MPO and the severing of all business ties between the parties. Fiser testified that, following the first lawsuit between the parties, it was obvious that MPO and Appellants needed to completely cut ties. Fiser stated that MPO wanted to sever ties with the Appellants because it was \"an untenable situation to continue as is\" and the differences between the parties were irreconcilable. All parties agreed that it was their anticipation that following closing on the Settlement Agreement, Davis would no longer be a member of MPO, and MPO would own the land that had been the subject of the Ground Lease. A money judgment for damages based on Appellants' failure to timely close on the transactions anticipated by the Settlement Agreement does not afford MPO the full benefit of its bargain-the severing of the parties' business relationships. The trial court's Judgment thus properly found that the monetary damages MPO sought from the jury for breach of the Settlement Agreement were inadequate and incomplete to afford MPO an adequate remedy at law. We reject Appellants' claim that it was error to permit MPO to obtain both monetary damages and specific performance for their breach of the Settlement Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   We are sympathetic, however, to Appellants' second contention that the monetary damages verdict and specific performance judgment had the effect of awarding MPO a double recovery. The judgment enforcing the Settlement Agreement directed performance of the Settlement Agreement \"in accordance with the calculations of [the April 14, 2014 letter].\" The calculations in the April 14, 2014 letter presumed a timely closing. The April 14, 2014 letter thus calculated the amount to be paid Appellants by first calculating the value of Davis's 40% interest in MPO's net asset value; by then offsetting that amount by the\n   <em>\n    reduced\n   </em>\n   Failure to Rent damages, the Attorneys' Fees damages, and the Overpaid Rent damages; and by then offsetting that amount by $650,000, the agreed upon value of the land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   By ordering Appellants to perform the Settlement Agreement per the terms of the April 14, 2014 letter, while at the same time ordering that the amount owed to Appellants pursuant to the April 14, 2014 letter should be reduced by the $150,000 jury verdict for breach of contract,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   the trial court afforded MPO a\n   double recovery for that portion of the Section 1.H damages already reflected as offsets in the April 14, 2014 letter. This was error. \"[P]laintiffs are not entitled to a double recovery of compensatory damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Echols v.

App. W.D. 2010). Specifically, the offsets for the\n   <em>\n    reduced\n   </em>\n   Failure to Rent damages, the Attorneys' Fees damages, and the Overpaid Rent damages set forth in the April 14, 2014 letter, which totaled $94,104, were necessarily a part of the damages awarded to MPO by the jury. The offsets totaling $94,104 cannot be considered in calculating the amount to be paid to specifically perform the transactions anticipated by the Settlement Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   We therefore conclude that although MPO was entitled to recover both monetary damages and a judgment specifically performing the Settlement Agreement,\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   it was error to order that the amount to be paid by MPO to Appellants for Davis's 40% member interest and the land should be calculated per the April 14, 2014 letter, and then reduced \"by the unpaid judgment on Count I\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   and interest thereon, as set forth above and awarded herein, for $150,000.\" Instead, the amount MPO is required to be pay Appellants for Davis's 40% member interest and the land should be calculated per the April 14, 2014 letter without regard to the $94,104 in offsets therein described, and then reduced \"by the unpaid judgment on Count I\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   and interest thereon, as set forth above and awarded herein, for $150,000.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Point Six is denied in part and granted in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    Point Seven\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In Point Seven, Appellants claim that the trial court erred in refusing a proposed jury instruction-a special interrogatory that would have required the jury to determine the fair market value of MPO's building. The instruction at issue is marked \"Interrogatory 18,\" and reads: \"We, the undersigned, find that in February and March, 2014, the fair market value of the Medical Place One Building, excluding the land, was $[blank].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Appellants' argument that Interrogatory 18 should have been submitted to the jury is not preserved for our review. \"Proper preservation of [instructional] error requires that objections be made at the instruction conference and renewed in a motion for a new trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Syn, Inc. v.

App. W.D. 2006). Appellants did not ask the trial court to submit the Interrogatory 18 to the jury. Instead, when discussing Interrogatory 18 at the jury instruction conference, Appellants proposed to the trial court \"that we submit everything but [Interrogatory 18] to the jury and then send them back with\n   [Interrogatory 18] after their verdicts are returned.\" Appellants acknowledged that the jury's verdict on Appellants' claim for breach of the Settlement Agreement (Verdict D), which claimed that MPO breached the Settlement Agreement by failing to determine an accurate fair market value for the building, would affect whether Interrogatory 18 needed to be submitted. Based on this discussion, the trial court decided that \"[t]he plan is, if [Interrogatory 18] is submitted at all, it will be after the verdicts are returned and after it's revisited.\" After the verdicts were returned, and the jury found in favor of MPO on Appellants' claim for breach of the Settlement Agreement, Appellants obviously had no reason to request submission of Interrogatory 18 submitted to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   It is thus a mischaracterization of the record for Appellants to argue that the trial court refused to submit Interrogatory 18 to the jury.
