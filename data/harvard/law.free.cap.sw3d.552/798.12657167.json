Haight appeals the Judgment of the Circuit Court of Clay County, Missouri, denying his Rule 29.15 motion in which he sought to vacate his conviction and sentence for forcible rape ( \u00a7 566.030, RSMo Cum. Supp. 2010) on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, we have instead provided a memorandum of law to the parties. The judgment is affirmed. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
