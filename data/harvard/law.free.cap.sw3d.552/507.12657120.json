STANZIANO-SPARKS, Movant\n  <br/>\n  v.\n  <br/>\n  KENTUCKY BAR ASSOCIATION, Respondent\n </parties>\n <docketnumber id=\"p-2\">\n  2018-SC-000259-KB\n </docketnumber>\n <court id=\"p-3\">\n  Supreme Court of Kentucky.\n </court>\n <decisiondate id=\"p-4\">\n  ENTERED: August 16, 2018\n </decisiondate>\n <p id=\"p-5\">\n  <strong>\n   <em>\n    OPINION AND ORDER\n   </em>\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-6\">\n   Movant, Bethany L. Stanziano-Sparks, was admitted to practice law in the Commonwealth of Kentucky on May 1, 2006. Her Kentucky Bar Association (\"KBA\") member number is 91179 and her bar roster address is 414 Public Square, Columbia, Kentucky, 42728. Pursuant to SCR 3.480(2), she moves this Court to enter a negotiated sanction imposing a public reprimand with conditions that she successfully complete the next Ethics and Professionalism Enhancement Program (EPEP) offered by the Office of Bar Counsel and return $2,581.00 to her client in three equal installments of $860.33 paid monthly over a 90-day period. The KBA has no objection. Finding this sanction to be the appropriate discipline for her misconduct, we grant Stanziano-Sparks's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Daniel Lay met with Stanziano-Sparks to discuss one of the two district court child custody cases in which he was involved. Lay was interested in appealing an adjudication and disposition order in one of the two cases. Stanziano-Sparks quoted a fee of $4,500.00 to Lay for representation in the custody case. Lay paid Stanziano-Sparks a $2,500.00 deposit which she placed into her operating account. Later, Stanziano-Sparks discovered Lay had provided her with the wrong juvenile custody case number and called the court clerk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Stanziano-Sparks filed a formal entry of appearance and a motion for continuance of a hearing scheduled for the next day, stating that she would be out of state. Lay was informed that he and his wife did not need to attend the hearing because it had been continued. The entry of appearance and the motion for continuance were file stamped three days after the hearing had occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Lay made numerous attempts to contact Stanziano-Sparks, by both calling and going to her office. Stanziano-Sparks failed to inform Lay of the status of his case despite these attempts. Further, Stanziano-Sparks failed to file the notice of appeal by the deadline. Lay filed a small claims court action against Stanziano-Sparks and obtained a default judgment against her for the $2,500.00 fee plus the $81.00 filing fee. Stanziano-Sparks has yet to pay Lay pursuant to this judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Inquiry Commission filed a four-count charge against Stanziano-Sparks. The four counts allege that Stanziano-Sparks\n   violated: SCR 1.130(1.3) by failing to timely obtain the proper court record, to timely file and follow up on the motion for continuance, and to file the notice of appeal; SCR 1.130(1.4)(a) by failing to keep Lay informed of the status of his case and not complying with his requests for information; SCR 1.130(1.15) by depositing Lay's fee into her operating account instead of a trust account until she earned the money; and SCR 1.130(1.16)(d) by not refunding the unearned fee to Lay when her representation ended. Stanziano-Sparks has admitted to each of the four rule violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In agreeing to the negotiated sanction, the KBA cited four cases,\n   <em>\n    Kentucky Bar Ass'n v.
