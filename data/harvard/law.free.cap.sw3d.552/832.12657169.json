BIVINS, CHIEF JUSTICE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We granted permission to appeal in this case in order to determine whether the exclusionary rule should be applied to a blood sample drawn from an individual pursuant to a search warrant because the arresting officer failed to leave a copy of the warrant with the individual. The Defendant, Angela Faye Daniel, was arrested for driving under the influence. The arresting officer obtained a search warrant and transported the Defendant to a medical facility for a blood draw. The officer failed to give the Defendant a copy of the search warrant. The trial court granted the Defendant's motion to suppress the evidence obtained pursuant to the warrant on the basis of the exclusionary rule set forth in Tennessee Rule of Criminal Procedure 41. The State sought and was granted an interlocutory appeal, and the Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed. We hold that, under the facts and circumstances of this case, a good-faith exception should be applied to Rule 41 's exclusionary rule. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment below and remand this matter to the trial court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Factual and Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 6, 2014, Officer Megan Valentin of the Franklin Police Department stopped the Defendant for suspected driving under the influence. The Defendant admitted to consuming alcohol but refused to participate in any field sobriety tests. Officer Valentin arrested the Defendant and then obtained a search warrant for a blood draw. Officer Valentin transported the Defendant\n   to Williamson County Medical Center, and Sherry Buie\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   withdrew a blood sample from the Defendant. The Defendant subsequently was indicted for driving under the influence of an intoxicant in violation of Tennessee Code Annotated section 55-10-401 (Supp. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained pursuant to the search warrant on the basis that she was not given a copy of the warrant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the ensuing evidentiary hearing, Officer Valentin testified that it was her normal practice to provide a copy of search warrants to the persons affected. However, she did not remember specifically giving a copy of the search warrant at issue in this case to the Defendant. She stated that she did not have a reason to withhold the copy from the Defendant, that she did not purposefully withhold the copy from the Defendant, and that, if she had withheld it, it was due to a mistake on her part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Defendant testified that she recalled being arrested on June 6, 2014, and that she recalled being taken to the hospital and having blood taken from her. The Defendant stated that she was given the pink copy of the Implied Consent Form. When asked if she had received \"a copy of a search warrant or anything that said search warrant on it?\" the Defendant replied, \"I did not.\" When asked on cross-examination whether there was a possibility that she did not remember correctly, the Defendant stated, \"I didn't get the copy.\" When asked the same question a second time, the Defendant answered, \"There is not a possibility, I didn't get the paperwork.\" She based her certainty on her clear memory of the events at issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On the basis of this testimony, the trial court found as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The testimony from [the Defendant] is that she was not given a copy of the search warrant. She was very adamant about that. The testimony from Officer Valentin is that she simply did not recall, but in most situations she does. And let me say, you know, I applaud Ms.-Officer Valentin, that she was-she was honest both in General Sessions and in this Court and this proceeding when she just said I cannot prove in this particular case that I-I gave her a copy, and I just don't remember. And I appreciate [Officer Valentin's] honesty.... [I]n this case, the defense has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that [the Defendant] was not given a copy of the search warrant. [ Rule 41 ] is pretty clear ... [that] if a copy is not given to the accused then any evidence has to be suppressed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Based on these findings and conclusions, the trial court ruled that, pursuant to Tennessee Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(g)(6), Officer Valentin's apparent failure to give the Defendant a copy of the warrant at the time of its execution required suppression of the evidence obtained pursuant to the warrant. The trial court further concluded that Officer Valentin's failure to provide the Defendant with a copy of the search warrant was not a \"clerical error\" as defined by the Exclusionary Rule Reform Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2040-6-108\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-6-108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (\"the ERRA\"). Accordingly, the\n   ERRA did not apply so as to exempt the evidence from suppression under Rule 41. Therefore, the trial court granted the Defendant's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Subsequently, the State sought and obtained an interlocutory appeal. The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment.\n   <em>\n    State v.

At the time the Defendant was arrested, that Rule provided that a magistrate issuing a search warrant \"shall prepare an original and two exact copies\" of the warrant. Tenn. R. Crim. P. 41(d) (2014). The Rule further required the magistrate to keep one copy as a part of his or her official records while another copy \"shall be left with the person or persons on whom the search warrant is served.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7091637\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/406/526/#p532\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Rule also provided that \"[t]he officer executing the warrant shall: (A) give to the person from whom or from whose premises the property was taken a copy of the warrant and a receipt for the property; or (B) shall leave the copy and receipt at a place from which the property was taken.\" Tenn. R. Crim. P. 41(e)(4). Finally, as relevant to this case, the Rule provided as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   A person aggrieved by an unlawful or invalid search or seizure may move the court pursuant to Rule 12(b) to suppress any evidence obtained in the unlawful search or seizure. If property was unlawfully seized, the aggrieved person may move for the return of the property.\n   <em>\n    The motion shall be granted\n   </em>\n   -except as to the return of contraband-if the evidence in support of the motion shows that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (6) the serving officer-where possible-did not leave a copy of the warrant with the person or persons on whom the search warrant was served.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Tenn. R. Crim. P. 41(g) (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In large part, our Rule 41 closely resembles its federal counterpart.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Crim. P. 41. Particularly relevant to this case, the federal rule provides, similarly to ours, that \"[t]he officer executing the\n   [search] warrant must give a copy of the warrant and a receipt for the property taken to the person from whom, or from whose premises, the property was taken or leave a copy of the warrant and receipt at the place where the officer took the property.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(f)(1)(C). Unlike our Rule 41, however, the federal rule does not contain a provision mandating suppression of evidence upon a proper motion where the proof demonstrates that the officer executing the warrant did not comply with this provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Crim. P. 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Indeed, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has recognized that \"although the procedural steps enumerated in [ Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(f)(1)(C) ] are important and should not be disregarded, they are ministerial and '[a]bsent a showing of prejudice, irregularities in these procedures do not void an otherwise valid search.' \"\n   <em>\n    Frisby v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9044935\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/79/29/#p32\">\n    79 F.3d 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 32 (6th Cir. 1996) (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Sixth Circuit also has recognized that its rule requiring the delivery of a warrant to the person searched is \"a statutory rule that is not required by the Fourth Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Crumpton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324067\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/593/#p617\">\n    824 F.3d 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 617 (6th Cir. 2016) (citing\n   <em>\n    Frisby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9044935\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/79/29/#p32\">\n    79 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   32 ). Accordingly, the federal appellate court held in\n   <em>\n    Crumpton\n   </em>\n   that, even if the officer had failed to leave a copy of a search warrant at the premises searched in contravention of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(f)(1)(C), the defendant was not entitled to suppression.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9044935\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/79/29/#p32\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court reasoned that, where the defendant had been shown a copy of the warrant at the scene of the search, it was \"difficult to imagine what prejudice he could have suffered if the agents did not leave a copy of the warrant at the house as well.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9044935\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/79/29/#p32\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We also have reviewed other states' rules of criminal procedure regarding the execution of search warrants. Although many states, like Tennessee and the federal government, require that an officer executing a warrant leave a copy of the warrant with the person whose premises are searched (or leave a copy of the warrant in the premises if the person is not available),\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   we have found no other state that has a rule mandating the suppression of evidence (on proper motion) when this requirement is not met.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tennessee appears unique in this regard. As noted by one scholar, the prevailing view is that the requirement that an officer leave a copy of the search warrant with the person searched is ministerial and that an officer's accidental failure to comply with this ministerial requirement does not void an otherwise\n   valid search, absent a showing of prejudice. LaFave,\n   <em>\n    2 Search &amp; Seizure\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4.12(a) (5th ed.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   For instance, in Florida, a defendant tried to suppress evidence gathered pursuant to a search warrant on the basis that the officer gave him a copy of only the first page of the warrant.\n   <em>\n    Harden v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7649044\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/433/1378/#p1379\">\n    433 So.2d 1378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1379 (Fla.

Stat. 933.11 (1981) ). The Florida appellate court determined that \"[m]ost other courts which have considered the question have held that the failure to serve a copy of the search warrant at the time of execution does not invalidate the seizure in the absence of a showing of prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7649044\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/433/1378/#p1379\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    McKenzie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"813767\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/446/949/#p954\">\n    446 F.2d 949\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

The judge signed and dated each iteration of the warrant and indicated the time of its issuance on each copy. However, the judge correctly indicated \"AM\" on two of the copies and erroneously indicated \"PM\" on the third. Although there was no factual dispute about when the warrant was actually issued and executed, the defendant moved to suppress the evidence collected pursuant to the warrant because the discrepancy rendered the warrant noncompliant with Rule 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As we did in\n   <em>\n    Davidson\n   </em>\n   , we created in\n   <em>\n    Lowe\n   </em>\n   a narrow good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule otherwise mandated by Rule 41.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lowe\n   </em>\n   , 552 S.W.3d at ----. In\n   <em>\n    Lowe\n   </em>\n   , the judge who had issued the warrant testified at the suppression hearing that the AM/PM discrepancy was the result of a simple clerical error on his part. The trial court found that the Rule 41 violation \"was the result of a good faith mistake or technical violation ..., [and] that this error was an unintentional clerical error.\" It was undisputed that a copy of the warrant was left at the residence searched and that the search had commenced before the \"PM\" time indicated on the copy containing the error. There was no contention that the defendant had suffered any particular prejudice as a result of the error. We determined that this technical failure to meet Rule 41 's requirement that three \"exact\" copies of each warrant be prepared resulted from an unintentional clerical error by the issuing magistrate and that the resulting variation between the three copies of the warrant was inconsequential.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at ----. Echoing our concern in\n   <em>\n    Davidson\n   </em>\n   that societal interests are not advanced by the application of the exclusionary rule in such circumstances, we held that \"a good-faith clerical error that results in an inconsequential variation\n   between the three copies of a search warrant required pursuant to Rule 41, in and of itself, does not entitle the moving party to suppression of the evidence collected pursuant to the warrant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 859.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In this case, the error arose not during the preparation of the search warrant but rather after the warrant was issued.

Since the Defendant testified that she recalled clearly being arrested, being transported to the hospital, and having her blood drawn, it is obvious that the Defendant was conscious during the search. It is also obvious that the Defendant knew exactly what property was being seized, by whom, at what time, and for what purpose. Since the blood was taken for testing procedures, it was not available to be returned to the Defendant. Under these sharply circumscribed facts and circumstances, it is apparent that Officer Valentin's failure to leave a copy of the warrant with the Defendant did not cause any particular or specific harm or prejudice to the Defendant, and the Defendant does not contend that she suffered any such particular or specific prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Officer Valentin testified that it was her practice to provide a copy of search warrants to the persons subjected to them but that she could not specifically recall providing one to the Defendant. She also testified that she had no reason to withhold a copy of the warrant from the Defendant, had not purposefully withheld the copy, and, if she had failed to give a copy to the Defendant, it was a mistake. The trial court explicitly found Officer Valentin to be an \"honest\" witness, and we have discerned no indication in the record that Officer Valentin's failure to leave a copy of the warrant with the Defendant was the result of anything other than a simple, inadvertent oversight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Based upon the record before us, particularly the trial court's finding that Officer Valentin's testimony was truthful, we conclude that Officer Valentin's oversight occurred in good faith. We also conclude that Officer Valentin's oversight caused no prejudice whatsoever to the Defendant. The Defendant is not contending before this Court that Officer Valentin's failure to give her a copy of the warrant constituted any violation of her constitutional rights. Rather, Officer Valentin's mistake resulted in a violation of one of Rule 41 's technical requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   We emphasize that the policy considerations underlying Rule 41 's requirement that a copy of the search warrant be left with the relevant individual are not implicated in this case. We also emphasize that the record supports the inference that Officer Valentin's mistake was anomalous.

When a defendant has demonstrated that a search warrant or its supporting affidavit is noncompliant with the technical requirements of Rule 41 or other relevant statute(s), the burden shifts to the State to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) the technical noncompliance was the result of a good-faith error and (2) the error did not result in any prejudice to the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Although the term \"good faith\" is not subject to precise definition, a good faith error is one that is characterized by simple, isolated oversight or inadvertence. A good faith mistake does not include conduct that is deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent, nor does it include multiple careless errors. Furthermore, where a finding of good faith depends on the credibility of one or more witnesses, the trial court should set forth its assessment of that factor to facilitate appellate review. If the State carries its burden of proving both prongs, the trial court then may consider, in the trial court's sound discretion, whether the technical noncompliance was sufficiently inadvertent and inconsequential to qualify for the narrow good-faith exception to Rule 41 's exclusionary rule that we have adopted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In sum, given the specific facts of this case in which the Defendant was aware of the blood draw and the fact that no property of the Defendant was seized as a result of the warrant which could later be returned, we hold that a good-faith exception to Rule 41 's technical requirement that the officer executing a search warrant leave a copy of the warrant with the person searched should apply in this case.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crumpton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324067\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/593/#p617\">\n    824 F.3d at 617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that officer's failure to leave a copy of warrant at residence in contravention of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(f)(1)(C) would not entitle defendant to suppression when defendant was shown a copy of the warrant at scene of search, rendering it \"difficult to imagine what prejudice he could have suffered if the agents did not leave a copy of the warrant at the house as well\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Nevertheless, we remind law enforcement officers that their utmost attention to detail is required when seeking and executing search warrants.
