BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Husband and Wife were married on June 22, 1994. Two children were born of the marriage and remained unemancipated at the time of trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wife filed her petition for dissolution of marriage on April 23, 2015; Husband answered and filed a cross-petition for dissolution on June 8, 2015. Wife then filed her amended petition for dissolution of marriage on August 5, 2016. On November 2, 2016, following a three-day bench trial, the trial court issued a judgment of dissolution of marriage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Husband filed a post-trial motion to set aside, amend, or clarify the judgment, or alternatively, a motion for new trial asserting,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the trial court erred in ordering him to pay Wife $5,000 per month in maintenance. The trial court heard arguments related to Husband's post-trial motion and took the matter under submission on January 9, 2017. On January 23, 2017, the trial court entered its Amended Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage (\"Judgment\"). In relevant part, the Judgment found Wife's reasonable expenses to be $5,000 per month, imputed potential employment income to Wife in the amount of $2,667 per month, and ordered Husband to pay Wife $5,000 per month in maintenance. Husband appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Relevant Facts and Analysis of Husband's Point on Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   During the dissolution proceedings, Wife requested the court to award her $7,500 per month in maintenance. Wife submitted to the trial court statements of her income and expenses, with the most recent statement including monthly expenses totaling $9,262. Additionally, the court heard testimony regarding Wife's claimed expenses. During such testimony, Wife acknowledged the court could properly find the amount of Wife's reasonable needs was lower than her stated expenses if it decided to subtract amounts claimed for vacations and the children's expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Although Wife had earned a master's and a bachelor's degree, she had not worked outside the marital residence since 1996. Wife received income from one of the\n   two businesses Husband owned during the marriage, but the trial court found Wife provided no services for the business. During his testimony, Husband's vocational expert opined, based on Wife's background including her lack of experience in the field in which she received her degrees, that Wife could earn between $28,000 and $36,000 per year working in \"a non-degreed position.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the trial court included the following relevant findings of fact and conclusions of law in its Judgment. The court decided the appropriate amount for Wife's reasonable monthly expenses was $5,000. In accordance with the testimony of Husband's vocational expert, the court imputed income to Wife in the amount of $32,000 per year, or $2,667 per month, as her potential employment income. The trial court then declared, \"Having previously found Wife's reasonable expenses to be approximately $5,000[,] she is in need of maintenance to meet these expenses. After considering the imputed salary, [t]he [c]ourt awards Wife $5,000 per month in maintenance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Herein lies the dispute giving rise to this appeal. Under the preceding declarations, Wife's monthly income is $2,667 from potential employment and $5,000 from maintenance, for a total of $7,667. This figure exceeds Wife's reasonable needs of $5,000 by $2,667. As such, Husband contends the trial court erred in awarding Wife an amount of maintenance that substantially exceeds her reasonable needs. In contrast, Wife maintains that based on the statement, \"\n   <em>\n    After considering the imputed salary\n   </em>\n   , [t]he [c]ourt awards Wife $5,000 per month in maintenance[,]\" the court found her reasonable needs to be $7,667, or $5,000 over and above the imputed salary. (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Our review of the Judgment leads us to conclude the court's findings setting out how it determined the amount of Wife's maintenance award are inconsistent or conflicting. On the one hand, the trial court could have properly found from the evidence that Wife's reasonable expenses were $5,000 per month. This is supported by Wife's statement of income and expenses as well as her testimony as to her reasonable needs. However, such a result renders Wife's maintenance award of $5,000 improper because, (1) it does not account for the potential employment income the trial court imputed to Wife; or (2) it exceeds Wife's reasonable monthly expenses by $2,667, i.e., fifty-three percent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7318646\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/351/681/#p690\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (a maintenance award substantially exceeding the reasonable needs of the spouse seeking maintenance is not supported by substantial evidence and constitutes an abuse of the court's discretion).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the other hand, the court could have concluded Wife's reasonable expenses totaled $7,667 per month, which also may have been fairly contemplated under the\n   evidence and would have supported the maintenance awarded. Nevertheless, this amount is clearly inconsistent with express language included twice in the Judgment that the court found Wife's reasonable expenses to be $5,000 per month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Because the Judgment is based on inconsistent and ambiguous findings, we find it necessary to reverse and remand the maintenance award.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McGahan v.
