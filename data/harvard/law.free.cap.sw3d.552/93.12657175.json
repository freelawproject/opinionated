The petition filed in 2018-CA-000279 requests relief from what Petitioners believe to be a sealed gag order and further seeks access to the circuit court record in Marshall Circuit Court Case No. 18-CR-00030.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The standards for evaluating a petition for a writ of prohibition or mandamus under each class are stated in\n   <em>\n    Hoskins v.

On March 1, 2018, this Court entered an order granting the motions for intermediate relief. The order prohibited the Respondent from closing any further proceeding in the case which would ordinarily be open to the public. The order also prohibited the Respondent from sealing any records in the case, except upon motion of a party followed by compliance with the applicable procedures mandated by its cited jurisprudence. The order was to remain in effect pending the adjudication of the petitions for writ of mandamus by a three-judge panel of this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This Court recognized when granting intermediate relief in this case that it would \"ring a bell\" that could not be unrung after review by the three-judge panel. For the same reasons this Court found that the actions of the Respondent presented immediate and irreparable harm and warranted granting the motions for intermediate relief, the petitions for writ of mandamus and prohibition are hereby GRANTED.

Several factual assertions in the petitions bear upon issues that are no more than tangential to the question we must answer now. For example, resolution of Petitioners' motions here does not require us to determine the propriety of the circuit court's appointment of the Department of Public Advocacy to represent the Real Party in Interest prior to \"the initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings-whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.\"\n   <em>\n    McNeil v.

When the public is aware that the law is being enforced and the criminal justice system is functioning, an outlet is provided for these understandable reactions and emotions.

If the evidence to be introduced at the pretrial hearing is found to be of a kind that would not be admissible at the trial itself, and if this evidence is not otherwise already known generally to the press and public, and the trial court\n   reasonably believes that is dissemination to the public will probably irreparably damage the constitutional rights of the accused, then closure should be ordered. Many factors bear upon the danger of irreparable damage in any given case, and each must be considered on its own merits. Before ordering closure, however, the trial judge should consider the utility of other reasonable methods available to protect the rights of the accused short of closure. Of course, at the time the motion for closure is made or heard any member of the public or press who is then present and objects must be given an opportunity to be heard on the question.

[b]efore ordering closure.... [T]he trial judge should consider the utility of other reasonable methods available to protect the rights of the accused short of closure, and ... any member of the public or press who is then present and objects (at the time the motion for closure is made or heard) must be given an opportunity to be heard on the question. If closure is ordered, specific findings should be made setting out the need for closure. As Chief Justice Burger stated in\n   <em>\n    Richmond Newspapers\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    , Inc. v.Virginia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787572\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/448/555/\">\n    448 U.S. 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787572\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/448/555/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 2814\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787572\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/448/555/\">\n    65 L.Ed.2d 973\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980) ] ... \"Absent an overriding interest articulated in findings, the trial of a criminal case must be open to the public.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (2) At the hearing to decide the question of closure, the accused who seeks closure has the burden of persuasion. The burden of proof is on those who would infringe the First Amendment right of access, not on those who assert it. However, whether this means that the accused is required to present any evidence, and if so what evidence, depends on the circumstances of the particular case. A distinction must be made as to whether a given proceeding historically has been opened or closed. Individual voir dire of prospective jurors out of the hearing of their fellow jurors, when appropriate, is only appropriate because of the same type of considerations that apply to the traditional bench conference. If the scope of the right of access is partly defined by the history of openness of criminal procedures, then its historical limits as regards openness also have to be considered as part of its definition. In the case of traditional bench conferences or historically accepted use of in-camera proceedings, the presumption with respect to such proceedings, or parts of proceedings, which have been traditionally closed, is that the denial of public access is legitimate. In such cases the burden of proof has not shifted to the press or public and the preliminary findings that must first be made have not been dispelled. But in such instances the public or press opposing the closure must show particular public policy reasons for access strong enough to overcome the tradition of closure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (3) The burden of proof on the accused when he would infringe the public and press right of access is threefold: (a) He must show that the right or interest he wishes to protect is sufficiently important to warrant the\n   extraordinary protection of the closed court. The right to a neutral jury qualifies as such a right or interest. (b) He must show that the asserted right or interest probably cannot be adequately protected by less restrictive alternatives to closure. (c) He must show that it is probable that the right or interest he seeks to protect, in this case his right to an impartial jury, will be protected by a closed proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    Meigs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9944761\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/660/658/#p663\">\n    660 S.W.2d at 663-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnotes and some internal citations omitted).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   In this case, Respondent failed to conduct the hearing required by\n   <em>\n    Meigs\n   </em>\n   and closed the arraignment without making specific findings. And, obviously, Respondent gave no consideration to less restrictive measures.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Without the hearing required by\n   <em>\n    Meigs\n   </em>\n   , there is no justification for closing any hearings and no justification for sealing any records. As noted, the burden is on the party seeking to close hearings or seal records to prove the constitutional right to a fair criminal trial outweighs the public's and the press's right of access to hearings and records. Not only has that burden not been carried, the claim that it can be carried has yet to be asserted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Finally, Petitioners assert that the trial court has imposed an improper gag order. Without an open record, this Court cannot review this claim. We simply note the representations of the Respondent and counsel for Parker that no such gag order is in place. We must presume there is no gag order. However, we repeat the suspicion expressed in\n   <em>\n    Peers\n   </em>\n   that \"perhaps it is the fact that the litigants wanted the file closed which suggested that there might be need for public scrutiny.\"\n   <em>\n    Peers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9966228\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/747/125/#p127\">\n    747 S.W.2d at 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We simply remind the Respondent that, not unlike the open hearings and open records protection described in\n   <em>\n    Meigs\n   </em>\n   , there must be a hearing, consideration of less restrictive means, and specific findings before a gag order can be imposed.\n   <em>\n    James v.
