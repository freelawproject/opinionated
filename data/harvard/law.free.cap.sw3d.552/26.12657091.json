GRUBER, Chief Judge\n   Virginia attorney Daniel Goodwin and the Goodwin Law Firm, PLLC (Goodwin), appeal from the judgment of the Baxter County Circuit Court entered after a bench trial finding him liable for conversion and assessing damages of $500,000 in favor of appellee Magness Oil Co. Goodwin argues that he lacks sufficient minimum contacts with the State of Arkansas to enable the circuit court to exercise jurisdiction over him. We agree. Accordingly, we reverse and dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Magness Oil is an Arkansas-based, family-owned corporation that owns a series of convenience stores in Arkansas and other states. On April 10, 2009, Magness Oil and Piedmont Fields, LLC, a Georgia limited liability company, entered into a letter of intent for Magness Oil to sell twenty-three convenience stores in Arkansas to Piedmont.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On April 23, 2009, Piedmont and USA Global Holdings Business Trust (USAG), a Nevada registered business trust represented by Goodwin, entered into an \"Escrow Presentation Hypothecation Agreement\" whereby USAG would use $500,000 provided by Piedmont to generate the funds to make a $45 million loan to Piedmont in order for it to purchase Magness Oil. The escrow/hypothecation agreement also provided that if the hypothecation process was unsuccessful, USAG would contact Piedmont and either attempt to hypothecate the deposit for a lesser amount or rescind the escrow/hypothecation agreement and return the money to Piedmont.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Also, on April 23, 2009, Goodwin emailed a letter to Piedmont in Georgia directing it to wire transfer the $500,000 to his trust account \"in connection with [Piedmont's] acquisition of Magness Oil.\" The money was wired to Goodwin in Virginia as requested. Goodwin later wired $495,000 to a third-party account owned by a USAG subsidiary in Nevada and transferred $5,000 to his firm's operating account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 13, 2009, Magness Oil and Piedmont entered into the purchase agreement called for in the letter of intent. The purchase price was to be $42.5 million, plus the actual costs of constructing another store in Mountain View, Arkansas. The purchase agreement required Piedmont to tender $500,000 earnest money and expressly stated that Piedmont had already delivered the money to USAG, who would hold the money as the escrow agent in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement. The agreement also provided for a \"Feasibility Period\" of up to 120 days from the execution of the letter of intent for Piedmont to conduct its due diligence. After the expiration of the feasibility period, the earnest money became nonrefundable. Closing of the sale was to be on September 7, 2009. The agreement also provided that if Piedmont failed to meet its obligations, the earnest money\n   was to be distributed to Magness Oil. The purchase agreement contained a forum-selection/choice-of-law provision that stated: \"This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Arkansas. Any action shall be adjudicated in the Circuit Court of Baxter County, Arkansas.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The sale was not closed within the time specified by the purchase agreement because USAG could not secure the necessary funding. When USAG and Goodwin were not forthcoming with the earnest money after demands by Piedmont and Magness Oil, Magness Oil filed this suit in Baxter County Circuit Court against Goodwin, Piedmont, and USAG to recover the $500,000 earnest money. The complaint alleged conversion and breach of fiduciary duty against Goodwin and his law firm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Goodwin filed a motion to dismiss, asserting that he lacked sufficient minimum contacts with the State of Arkansas as would enable the circuit court to exercise jurisdiction over him. Following a hearing on Goodwin's motion to dismiss, the circuit court ruled from the bench, denying Goodwin's motion. The court found that Goodwin had sufficient minimum contacts with the State of Arkansas. In making its ruling, the court relied on the role Goodwin played in facilitating the transactions to raise the money to fund the purchase agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following entry of a default judgment against USAG and summary judgment against Piedmont, a bench trial was held on Magness Oil's claims against Goodwin. The circuit court ruled from the bench, finding that Goodwin and USAG acted in concert for the purposes of committing conversion of the earnest money and that Goodwin was liable for the full amount. Once a final order was entered, this appeal and cross-appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Although Goodwin argues seven points on appeal, the dispositive point is whether the circuit court lacked personal jurisdiction over him. There, he argues that he lacked sufficient \"minimum contacts\" with Arkansas for the circuit court to exercise personal jurisdiction over him and his law firm. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We begin our analysis with our long-arm statute, which provides in pertinent part, \"The courts of this state shall have personal jurisdiction of all persons, and all causes of action or claims for relief, to the maximum extent permitted by the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ark.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2016-4-101\">\n    Ark.

But it should be noted that Piedmont's wiring the funds to Goodwin's account was consistent with the Escrow/Hypothecation Agreement between Piedmont and USAG, which contains a provision stating that it is to be interpreted under Nevada law. However, there is no evidence that Magness Oil was a party to that agreement or otherwise contacted in Arkansas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The only Arkansas-based entity involved in this case was Magness Oil; all the other parties were from other states-Virginia, Nevada, or Georgia. Goodwin acted as counsel for the out-of-state escrow agent-USAG. We therefore cannot say that Goodwin \"purposefully availed\" himself of the \"benefits and protection\" of the laws of Arkansas. While the dissent concedes that Goodwin's contacts with Arkansas are not substantial, it attempts to bolster its conclusion that Goodwin nevertheless has sufficient minimum contacts with Arkansas by attributing USAG's admittedly more substantial contacts to Goodwin. However, \"a defendant's relationship with a ... third party, standing alone, in an insufficient basis for jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/#p1781\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Neither Goodwin nor his client initiated contact with Arkansas or entered into the contract to purchase an Arkansas business. Goodwin himself did not enter into any contracts nor did he conduct any business on his own behalf. Rather, he acted solely as an attorney representing a client, USAG. And although USAG was mentioned as escrow agent in the purchase agreement, USAG, Goodwin, and Goodwin's law firm were not signatories to that agreement, which was between Piedmont, a Georgia company, and Magness Oil. The fact that the purchase agreement contained a forum-selection clause providing for an Arkansas forum is irrelevant to Goodwin, who was not a party to that agreement. The role Goodwin may have played in the purchase agreement is pure speculation. The record provides no evidence that Goodwin played any role at all. In any case, the claims against Goodwin were not based on the purchase agreement. Instead, Goodwin was sued in tort for breach of fiduciary duty and conversion.

USAG, Goodwin's client, was a party to the escrow-hypothecation agreement, the stated purpose of which was for the acquisition of Magness Oil and its multiple Arkansas properties. Magness Oil and its properties were expressly referenced and discussed in the escrow-hypothecation agreement, wherein Piedmont agreed to pay USAG $500,000. This agreement was a prerequisite for the purchase agreement between Magness Oil and Piedmont. Further, USAG, Goodwin's client, was specifically mentioned in the purchase agreement between Magness Oil and Piedmont as the escrow agent and was assigned the responsibility of holding the $500,000 \"in accordance with the terms and provisions of this agreement.\" The purchase agreement contained a choice-of-forum clause wherein the parties agreed to be governed by the laws of the State of Arkansas. Moreover, Goodwin, in an April 23, 2009 letter to Piedmont, directed it to wire the $500,000 to his trust account. This letter specifically references the acquisition of the Arkansas business and properties and expressly states that the funds are being wired to him for that purpose.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    Goodwin continued his contacts with Arkansas by emailing Magness Oil regarding the funds that he had allegedly converted. Specifically, Goodwin emailed Benny Magness, a Magness Oil principal, on eight occasions from April 22, 2011, to August 5, 2011, offering reasons for the delay in the funding for the purchase agreement and requesting more time for the funding to come through. Goodwin's August 5 email to Benny Magness advised that the $500,000 was gone.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    As for the second factor, I concede that Goodwin did not have substantial contacts with the State of Arkansas. But under the law, his contacts do not have to be substantial. A state can exercise specific personal jurisdiction even if the nonresident defendant's contacts with the forum are slight.\n    <em>\n     John Norrell Arms, Inc. v.

On the fourth factor, Arkansas has a strong interest in providing its businesses with a forum to redress disputes, especially those premised on fraud and those in which the nonresident initiated the alleged misconduct.\n    <em>\n     Pritchett\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6958463\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/430/223/\">\n     2013 Ark.

Finally, it is naturally more convenient for Magness Oil, an Arkansas business, to have redress in Arkansas. And though Goodwin is from Virginia, it is a small inconvenience for him to appear here in a dispute involving his decision to entangle himself in the legitimate sale of an Arkansas business in an\n    effort to convert the earnest money from that sale.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    I liken this case to\n    <em>\n     Hotfoot Logistics.\n    </em>\n    There, our supreme court ruled that a bill of lading raised a factual question regarding Arkansas's personal jurisdiction over one defendant alleged to have breached a contract.\n    <em>\n     Hotfoot Logistics\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6905192\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/447/592/\">\n     2014 Ark. 460\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at 8,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6905192\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/447/592/\">\n     447 S.W.3d at 597\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Our supreme court further held that the Arkansas circuit court had personal jurisdiction over two other defendants, who had never entered Arkansas and had never directly contacted the plaintiff, based on circumstantial evidence that they conspired to commit fraud against Hotfoot Logistics.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6905192\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/447/592/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6905192\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/447/592/\">\n     447 S.W.3d at 597\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Like the defendants in\n    <em>\n     Hotfoot Logistics\n    </em>\n    , Goodwin did not enter Arkansas and did not directly contract with Magness Oil. Also like the defendants in\n    <em>\n     Hotfoot Logistics\n    </em>\n    , the defendants in the instant case are from other states. Nevertheless, Goodwin did have contacts with the State of Arkansas. His client was expressly named as the escrow agent in Magness Oil's contract with Piedmont. Goodwin's client was a named party in the escrow-hypothecation agreement, wherein its stated purpose was the acquisition of Magness Oil. But Goodwin's role in the alleged conversion consisted of more than just his representation of USAG. He also acted as the escrow agent, who personally directed that the escrow funds be wired to his trust account. Furthermore, Goodwin himself contacted Magness, via email, multiple times to communicate information regarding the whereabouts of the funding for the purchase agreement and the earnest money. Finally, as in\n    <em>\n     Hotfoot Logistics\n    </em>\n    , there was circumstantial evidence that Goodwin and USAG conspired to convert Magness Oil's funds. This evidence demonstrates that Goodwin's contacts with the State of Arkansas were not limited to his relationship with his client, USAG; rather, the evidence establishes that he had direct contacts with Arkansas.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Based on the standards discussed above, I would hold that the facts presented demonstrate sufficient contacts to warrant personal jurisdiction over Goodwin. Goodwin should not have been surprised to be haled into court in Arkansas because he and his client, USAG, entered into one contract and were escrow agents for another contract-both for the stated purpose of the sale of an Arkansas business and multiple Arkansas real properties. When a defendant has deliberately engaged in significant activities within a state or has created continuing obligations between himself and residents of the forum, he has manifestly availed himself of the privilege of conducting business there.\n    <em>\n     Hotfoot Logistics\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6905192\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/447/592/\">\n     2014 Ark. 460\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at 10,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6905192\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/447/592/\">\n     447 S.W.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    598 (citing\n    <em>\n     Burger King, supra\n    </em>\n    ).
