Accordingly, we withdraw our September 29, 2016 opinion and judgment, and we substitute the following opinion and judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We address two primary issues in this appeal. First, whether the \"Contractual Maintenance\" provision in Kenneth and Appellee Teresa Waldrop's agreed divorce decree is purely contractual or is spousal maintenance governed by chapter 8 of the family code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons set forth below, we hold that the Waldrops' Contractual Maintenance provision is purely contractual, and we affirm the trial court's final order in this regard. And second, whether the language of the Waldrops' Contractual Maintenance provision authorizes\n   the trial court to modify or terminate Kenneth's maintenance obligation by court order based on a change in Kenneth's circumstances affecting his maintenance obligation. For the reasons set forth below, we answer this query in the affirmative. We therefore reverse the trial court's final order in this regard and remand this case to the trial court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 26, 2007, the trial court signed Kenneth and Teresa's agreed divorce decree. The agreed decree contained a provision stipulating that it was enforceable as a contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Contractual Maintenance provision in the agreed decree-which is at the heart of this appeal-requires Kenneth to make monthly payments of $3,000 to Teresa. It provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Contractual Maintenance\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court finds that under the circumstances presented in this case, Teresa Waldrop is eligible for maintenance under the provisions of Texas Family Code Chapter 8.001 et seq[.] and that the parties have agreed that Kenneth Ray Waldrop will pay maintenance to Teresa Waldrop as set out below. The parties have further agreed that Teresa Waldrop shall have all the rights and remedies afforded under the Texas Family Code, Chapter 8.001 et seq. Accordingly, Kenneth Ray Waldrop is ordered to pay as maintenance the sum of $3,000.00 per month to Teresa Waldrop, with the first payment being due on February 1, 2007, and a like amount being due the first day of each consecutive month thereafter until the earliest of one of the following events occurs:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   1. death of either Petitioner or Respondent;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   2. remarriage of Teresa Waldrop;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   3. further orders of the Court affecting the spousal maintenance obligation, including a finding of cohabitation by Teresa Waldrop[;]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   4. [t]he first day of the month following the day that Teresa Waldrop becomes eligible to receive and begins to receive her portion of the Kimberly Clark pension awarded to her ... above. In this event, Kenneth Ray Waldrop is ORDERED to pay to Teresa Waldrop as maintenance the difference each month between $3,000.00 and the amount of the benefit received from the Kimberly Clark pension, due and payable on the first day of the first month immediately following the date that Teresa Waldrop becomes eligible to receive and does receive her portion of the Kimberly Clark pension and continuing thereafter until the next occurrence of one of the events 1-3 above. It is the intent of the parties that the $3,000.00 maintenance paid to Teresa Waldrop by Kenneth Ray Waldrop be reduced each month in an amount equal to the amount of the monthly pension benefit received by Teresa Waldrop from Kimberly Clark.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Approximately six years later, Kenneth initiated litigation concerning the Contractual Maintenance provision. Kenneth contended that the agreed decree's Contractual Maintenance provision imposed chapter 8 spousal maintenance and was therefore\n   modifiable by the court upon a showing that Kenneth's circumstances had materially and substantially changed\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, that in any event, he could petition the trial court to modify or terminate his maintenance obligation for reasons other than the four reasons set forth under paragraph one-either party's death, Teresa's remarriage, a finding of cohabitation by Teresa, or Teresa's receipt of payments from the Kimberly Clark pension. Teresa, on the other hand, argued that the Contractual Maintenance provision was a contractual provision made outside the family code and was not modifiable by the trial court except upon the four circumstances set forth under paragraph one. Ultimately, following a bench trial on Kenneth's declaratory judgment claim and a subsequent hearing on attorney's fees, the trial court signed a final order and made findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The trial court declared that the agreed decree's Contractual Maintenance provision was purely contractual in nature and not subject to the provisions of chapter 8 and that the \"further orders of the Court\" language limited the trial court's authority to modify or terminate Kenneth's maintenance obligation to the specific circumstances of Kenneth's or Teresa's death, Teresa's remarriage or cohabitation, or Teresa's receipt of payments from the Kimberly Clark pension. The trial court alternatively held that although chapter 8's \"material and substantial change in circumstances does not apply here,\" even if it did, \"a material and substantial change in circumstances was not proven by [Kenneth].\" The trial court ordered that Kenneth continue making payments under the Contractual Maintenance provision and ordered that he pay Teresa $28,590.53 in attorney's fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Kenneth perfected this appeal and raises four issues complaining that the trial court erred by concluding that the Contractual Maintenance provision was contractual in nature and was not subject to the provisions of chapter 8 of the family code, by finding that the Contractual Maintenance provision could not be modified by further court order except in the four specifically identified circumstances, by finding that a material and substantial change in his circumstances had not occurred, and by awarding attorney's fees to Teresa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Analysis of the Waldrops' Contractual Maintenance Provision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Kenneth argues that a plain reading of the divorce decree makes it clear that the Contractual Maintenance provision\n   provides for chapter 8 spousal maintenance and not contractual alimony. He points to the fact that the term \"alimony\" is never used in the decree, while the term \"maintenance\" is used fourteen times. He also points to three references to chapter 8 contained in the Contractual Maintenance provision-that Teresa was eligible for maintenance under \"Chapter 8.001 et seq[.],\" that she would have \"all rights and remedies afforded under ... Chapter 8.001 et seq[.],\" and that \"a copy of subchapter E of chapter 8\" was to be attached to the decree-as evidence that the decree provides for chapter 8 spousal maintenance rather than contractual alimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Teresa counters that the terms of the Contractual Maintenance provision are \"clearly ... outside the bounds of Chapter 8 maintenance\"-an indication that the divorce decree is governed by contract rather than chapter 8. She argues that the duration of the payments contemplated by the decree violates chapter 8 because it allows for payments to continue for more than the three-year limit imposed by the version of section 8.054 applicable when she and Kenneth signed their agreed decree.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%208.054\">\n    Tex.

Our majority reverses the trial court, holding that \"further orders of the court\" is not ambiguous and not so limited. But in so holding, we stopped short of explaining what the further-orders-of-the-court phrase-which, according to the majority, has \"a certain and definite legal meaning\"-actually means.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   If the clause has a \"certain and definite legal meaning,\" then certainly we should be able to articulate its meaning sufficient to direct the trial court as to the standard that is to be applied on remand. Instead, the majority gives the trial court broad marching orders, remanding the case back to determine \"whether Kenneth's maintenance\n   obligation should be modified or terminated\" and to determine \"the amount, if any, of a modification.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   A trial court will commit an abuse of discretion if it acts without reference to guiding rules or principles.\n   <em>\n    Low v.

And that raises one last, uncomfortable question: on review, how are we to assess whether the trial court erred or abused its discretion by granting or denying such modification? If we cannot articulate that standard to the trial court on remand, how are we to determine it for ourselves when this matter presents itself to us again for review?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   If it is the majority's view that this question should be avoided at this juncture, then we should have affirmed the\n   trial court's decision on the narrower grounds identified in the original opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   PITTMAN, J., and LEE ANN DAUPHINOT (Senior Justice, Retired, Sitting by Assignment), join.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCURRING OPINION ON EN BANC RECONSIDERATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    The Waldrops' agreed divorce decree was entered on April 26, 2007.

We would like to assist the trial court by enunciating criteria for its consideration in whether to terminate or to modify Kenneth's maintenance obligation. But, although Kenneth's pleadings in the trial court expressly sought such a declaration, the trial court correctly did not rule on it. The Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act gives the trial court no power to pass upon hypothetical or contingent situations or to determine questions not then essential to the decision of an actual controversy, even though such questions may in the future require adjudication.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Riner v.

App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2013, no pet.). Because the trial court declared that \"further orders of the Court\" could be entered only upon either party's death, Teresa's remarriage, a finding of cohabitation by Teresa, or Teresa's receipt of payments from the Kimberly Clark pension, it had no power to pass on the hypothetical, contingent situation of what equitable or legal criterion it might apply if the \"further orders of the Court\" language did authorize it to terminate or modify Kenneth's maintenance obligation. Because the trial court did not address this aspect of Kenneth's request for declaratory relief, because the trial court's judgment does not rule on it, because the trial court made no findings of fact or conclusions of law on it, and because the parties did not brief it on appeal, it is simply not teed up for our disposition in this appeal. Therefore, we decline to address it.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2037.010\">\n     Tex.

However, instead of directing the trial court on remand to determine the criteria to be applied in making any judicial modification authorized by the \"further orders of the Court\" language contained in the Contractual Maintenance provision, I would hold that the standard to apply in arriving at a \"further order[ ] of the court\" should be as follows: \"Has there been a material change in Kenneth's circumstances that warrants a modification of the contractual maintenance payment terms?\" This standard is a lesser test than the \"material and substantial change\" mentioned in the trial court's conclusion of law 8.
