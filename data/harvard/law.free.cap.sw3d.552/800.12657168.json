Maryland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    373 U.S. 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    83 S.Ct. 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    10 L.Ed.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1963). Without asking the State for a response to the\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   petition and without an evidentiary hearing, the trial court dismissed the petition in part because it was filed long after expiration of the one-year statute of limitations and demonstrated no reason for equitable tolling of the statute of limitations. The Court of Criminal Appeals declined to consider the statute of limitations because the State had not pled it as an affirmative defense, but affirmed the dismissal because the petition did not present newly discovered evidence warranting\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   relief. On appeal, we initially clarify that an error\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   proceeding is not the appropriate procedural vehicle for obtaining relief on the ground that the petitioner suffered a constitutional due process violation under\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   . As to the petition, we hold that (1)\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   petitions with insufficient allegations are susceptible to summary dismissal on the face of the petition, without discovery or an evidentiary hearing; (2) Tenn. R. Civ. P 8.03 does not apply to a petition for writ of error\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   ; (3) timeliness under the statute of limitations is an \"essential element\" of a\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   claim that must be demonstrated on the face of the petition; and (4) if the petitioner seeks equitable tolling of the statute of limitations, the facts supporting the tolling request must likewise appear on the face of the petition. Applying this standard, we find no error in the trial court's decision to dismiss the\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   petition and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In February 1998, a Shelby County jury convicted Petitioner/Appellant Tommy Nunley of aggravated rape of his thirteen-year-old female cousin on January 17, 1996.

It dismissed the petition on several bases. First, the trial court found that the issues Nunley raised had been raised before and fully litigated-first in Nunley's trial, then in his petition for post-conviction relief, and then again in his petition for post-conviction DNA testing. Second, the trial court held that Nunley had not established that there is \"newly discovered evidence that would give rise to relief\" under the\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   statutes. It commented, \"All the alleged evidence in this application has been the subject of litigation for over 17 years.\" Third, the trial court noted that a petition for\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   relief must be filed within one year of the conviction, and held that Nunley had \"shown no good reason for the one year statute of limitations to be tolled in this case,\" adding, \"The petition should be dismissed as time barred.\" For all of these reasons, the trial court dismissed Nunley's petition for writ of error\n   <em>\n    coram nobis.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Nunley appealed.

It held that the one-year statute of limitations set out in the statutes governing\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   is an affirmative defense, so it had to be specifically raised by the State. Under the facts of this case, the appellate court said, \"the State did not plead the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense in the trial court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For this reason, the appellate court declined to address whether Nunley's petition was timely and went on to address his assertion that he is entitled to relief under the\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   statutes \"on grounds that the State [ ] violated his constitutional rights by withholding exculpatory evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After examining all of the exhibits, including the prosecutor's memo to the file, the Court of Criminal Appeals found that the test results discussed in the memo \"are no different than those available to petitioner prior to his trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.

Instead, we will analyze his petition by reference to the statutes and caselaw regarding writs of error\n   <em>\n    coram nobis.\n   </em>\n   With this framework in mind, we go on to consider whether Nunley's petition should be dismissed as time-barred even though the State was not given an opportunity to respond to the petition at the trial court level and consequently did not assert the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense in the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Statute of Limitations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   To briefly review, the trial court dismissed Nunley's\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   petition as time-barred. Nunley filed his petition approximately seventeen years after expiration of the one-year limitations period, over eighteen years after his conviction. The trial court reviewed his petition and, without asking the State to respond, concluded that it was filed well after expiration of the limitations period and that Nunley had demonstrated no good reason for equitable tolling of the statute of limitations. Consequently, it dismissed the petition, and Nunley appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Court of Criminal Appeals acknowledged the trial court's conclusion that Nunley's petition was time-barred but nevertheless considered the petition on its merits because the State had not pled the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense prior to the trial court's dismissal of the petition.\n   <em>\n    Nunley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20838241\">\n    2017 WL 838241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. It held this even though the State was not brought into the\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   proceedings at the trial level. The effect of the intermediate appellate court's holding was that the trial court could not dismiss the\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   petition as untimely unless the State affirmatively raised the statute of limitations, and the State was likewise precluded from raising the statute of limitations at the appellate level even though it was the State's first opportunity to raise it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Nunley argues that the Court of Criminal Appeals was correct on the statute of limitations issue and that the trial court erred in dismissing his petition as untimely because the State did not raise the statute of limitations issue to the trial court. In support, he cites this Court's holding in prior decisions that, in\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   cases, \"[t]he State bears the burden of raising the bar of the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

If the State is permitted to argue on appeal that his petition is not timely, Nunley claims that he is entitled to equitable tolling of the statute of limitations under\n   <em>\n    Workman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11105791\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/41/100/\">\n    41 S.W.3d at 101-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He asserts he is entitled to it because the trial court should have recognized the late date on which he claims to have become aware of the evidence\n   (in July 2014), or should have at least conducted a hearing to determine whether due process required a tolling of the statute of limitations. Ultimately, Nunley seeks a new trial on the basis of the alleged\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation purportedly evidenced by the prosecutor's memo to the file, but in the alternative, he asks us to remand the case to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the State had exculpatory DNA test results in this case. While Nunley's counsel denied at oral argument that he is requesting discovery, we find his request on brief that \"an evidentiary hearing needs to be conducted in order to determine whether the State possessed exculpatory DNA results in this case,\" is in effect a request for discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In response, the State asks us to reject our prior holding that the State bears the burden in\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   cases of raising the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense. It asks us to hold instead that timeliness is an element that must be shown by the petitioner on the face of his\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   petition. In short, the State asks us to reconsider our holding in\n   <em>\n    Sands\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Harris I\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Harris II\n   </em>\n   that the State must affirmatively raise the statute of limitations at the trial court level or else be barred from raising it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State contends that the trial court acted within its discretion to hold that Nunley's request for\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   relief was time-barred. It maintains that Nunley has made no showing as to why the petition, filed many years after the judgment of conviction was entered, should be deemed timely under the doctrine of equitable tolling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Regarding the request in Nunley's petition for an evidentiary hearing on a possible\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation, we reiterate that a\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   proceeding is not the appropriate venue to determine whether Nunley's constitutional rights under\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   were violated. Therefore, in evaluating the issues pertaining to the timeliness of Nunley's petition, we focus on the statutes and caselaw governing writs of error\n   <em>\n    coram nobis.\n   </em>\n   Specifically, while the late discovery of supposed new evidence purportedly withheld by prosecutors may factor into an analysis of equitable tolling, we evaluate the issue based on the\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   statutes and the caselaw interpreting them, not under the standards for finding a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   As referenced by both parties, this Court has stated on more than one occasion that the State bears the burden of affirmatively raising the statute of limitations as a defense to a petition seeking\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   relief. The issue first arose in\n   <em>\n    Sands\n   </em>\n   , in which the defendant filed a pro se petition for post-conviction relief and for a writ of error\n   <em>\n    coram nobis.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sands\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10005645\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/903/297/#p299\">\n    903 S.W.2d at 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
