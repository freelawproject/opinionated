Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 22.01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (West Supp. 2017). We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises from a domestic dispute between Appellant and his wife, Lien Lam. In the evening of February 22, 2013, Lam ran to her neighbor Raquel Ruiz's house and rang her doorbell. Ruiz testified at trial that when she answered the door, Lam was crying, she appeared nervous and panicky, and there was \"fresh blood\" on her face. According to Ruiz, Lam told her that Appellant had beaten her up by grabbing her hair and forcing her head into the toilet a couple times. Ruiz also testified that Lam told her that Appellant threatened to kill Lam-a threat that Lam apparently did not take lightly, because Appellant had allegedly stabbed a mattress with a knife during the incident. Ruiz and her husband called 911.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On the other hand, Lam testified that she remembered very little about the night of February 22. Testifying through an interpreter-Lam primarily spoke Vietnamese and could not read or write in English-Lam recalled that Appellant had been drinking that night, that he became angry when he discovered that some of his money was missing, and that he accused her of taking it. She also remembered running to Ruiz's house. Because of her lack of memory, the State also offered Lam's statement to her daughter. At the time Lam gave her statement, Lam's daughter wrote out the statement in English, read it back to Lam in Vietnamese, and then Lam signed it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The statement read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   I came home from work when I notice that my husband has been drinking (but I don't know when.) My daughter, Sanya [illegible] he was crying. I asked why they are crying. He said \"nothing.\" I went to the kitchen &amp; took away his whiskey shot. He keeps wanting it back, I denied it, then he went in the shower. He came back after the shower, looked in his wallet, &amp; accused the family of taking his money. He said, \"Whoever took it better give it back to me before I kill everyone.\" I got so scared, I ran out the back door, he grabbed me, pull[ed] me back, and bang my head ... against the ground. I finally ran out through the backdoor to the front yard. He got into his truck &amp; left. About 30 mins later, he came back &amp; continues ... talking about his money. He wanted to hit me, so I ran to my neighbor's house. That's when he left again. My neighbor ... Carlos called the cops. I wanted to call, but I thought, \"I always keep calling the cops ... I don't know if I should.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Officer Gary McCraw responded to the 911 dispatch. Officer McCraw offered testimony related to previous allegations of family violence at Appellant's residence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [State]. Okay. Did you do a family violence investigation on February 22nd of 2013?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   A. I did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Q. And where was that located at?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   A. The assault had occurred at [Appellant's address].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Q. Okay. And what did you know going into that call?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   A. I was familiar with the household, as I had worked previous family violence calls there in the past before this.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Appellant's attorney immediately requested a bench conference, and one was held off the record. The jury was then excused, and the trial court spoke with Officer McCraw directly, on the record. The trial court admonished Officer McCraw, through a series of questions, that he should not have mentioned previous family violence calls involving Appellant. Appellant's counsel moved for a mistrial; the trial court denied the motion. The trial court offered to give an instruction to the jury to disregard Officer McCraw's statement, but Appellant's counsel declined the offer, explaining that she felt such an instruction would draw too much attention to Officer McCraw's statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Once the jury returned, Officer McCraw continued testifying. He recounted how Lam appeared \"[v]ery excited, very upset\" that night and appeared to have been crying. He testified that Appellant was not on the scene when he arrived but the couple's children and grandchild, ranging in age from 2 to 18 years old, were at the house and some of them had witnessed the altercation. Officer McCraw interviewed both Lam and Ruiz on the scene but stated that neither of them had made any allegation that Appellant put Lam's head in the toilet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Officer McCraw also identified photographs depicting the couple's home and Lam's injuries that were admitted into evidence. In the photos of Lam, blood is visible on her sweater and on her hands and an injury to the top of her head is also visible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Photos of the inside of the house depicted blood droplets on the floor of the kitchen and leading out the back door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Appellant was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. In addition to the above-described evidence and testimony, Appellant's prior conviction for family-violence assault in March 2011 was admitted into evidence. The jury found Appellant guilty of felony family-violence assault and assessed a nine-year sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Appellant brings three issues on appeal. In his first issue, he argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion for mistrial. In his second issue, he argues that the trial court erred by admitting Exhibit 2-Lam's written statement-because it was inadmissible hearsay. And in his third issue, Appellant argues that his trial counsel was deficient to the extent that he was denied effective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Denial of mistrial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In his first issue, Appellant argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion for mistrial following Officer McCraw's statement that he was familiar with Appellant's household because he \"had worked previous family violence calls there in the past before this.\" Although there is no objection in the record to Officer McCraw's statement, immediately following the statement, Appellant's counsel requested a bench conference. The conference that followed was held off the record, but judging from the trial court's statements and questions of Officer McCraw immediately afterward, the trial court understood Appellant's objection as relating\n   to inadmissible evidence of extraneous offenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. R. Evid. 404(b). This is also the argument Appellant puts forth on appeal, and the State does not dispute that this was the concern expressed by Appellant during the conference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   At the conclusion of the conference, the trial court-without ruling on any objection-denied Appellant's motion for mistrial. But the trial court also offered to instruct the jury to disregard Officer McCraw's statement, an offer that Appellant's counsel declined, expressing a desire to avoid drawing more attention to the statement. Instead, the following instruction was included in the jury charge: \"If you have heard evidence of offenses committed by the defendant other than the one he is on trial for, you may not consider those as evidence of guilt in this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Assuming, without deciding, that Appellant's motion for mistrial was sufficient to preserve error for review,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   we review the trial court's denial of the motion for mistrial for an abuse of discretion and will uphold the ruling if it is within the zone of reasonable disagreement.\n   <em>\n    Coble v.

And after Officer McCraw was admonished by the trial court to avoid any reference to \"any other offenses that might have occurred with [Appellant],\" he made no further mention of such extraneous offenses. No details were provided regarding the \"previous family violence calls\" Officer McCraw had responded to at the residence. The limited nature of Officer McCraw's statement therefore weighed against a mistrial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vickery v.

Ruiz testified to Lam's panicked state when she showed up, bloody and crying, on Ruiz's doorstep and told Ruiz that Appellant had beaten her. The jury was also presented with Exhibit 2-the written statement of Lam's recitation of the events to her daughter on the night of the incident-that described how Appellant threatened to \"kill everyone\" and then, when Lam tried to escape the house, he grabbed her, pulled her back, and banged her head against the ground. And the jury was shown photos of Lam with an injury to her head and blood on her face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Based on the record before us, we do not believe that Officer McCraw's comment rose to the level of an \"extreme\" or incurable error such that a mistrial was warranted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jenkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6784972\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/493/583/#p612\">\n    493 S.W.3d at 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Admission of State's Exhibit 2\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Appellant argues in his second issue that the trial court erred by admitting Exhibit 2-Lam's purported statement written by her daughter-because it was inadmissible hearsay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Like our review of the trial court's decision to deny a mistrial, we will review the trial court's admission of evidence for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Henley v.

Tex. R. Evid. 801(d). Hearsay is generally inadmissible unless it falls within one of the enumerated exceptions. Tex. R. Evid. 802 (providing general rule against hearsay), 803 (providing exceptions applicable regardless of whether the declarant is available as a witness), 804 (providing exceptions applicable when the declarant is unavailable as a witness).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Appellant admits that if the statements in Exhibit 2 belong to Lam, they are admissible under at least two exceptions to the hearsay rule-the excited utterance exception and the recorded recollection exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. R. Evid. 803(2) (providing for the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule), 803(5) (providing for the\n   recorded recollection exception to the general hearsay rule). But the crux of his argument against the admission of Exhibit 2 is that the circumstances do not support a conclusion that Lam made or adopted the statements as her own because she could not read English and she-and the jury-had to trust that Lam's daughter had correctly translated the contents of the statement her daughter had written in English when she read the statement back to Lam in Vietnamese and received confirmation from Lam that the statement was accurate. In other words, according to Appellant, the State failed to prove that the words in the statement were Lam's, as opposed to her daughter's. Thus, Appellant argues, the statements did not meet the hearsay exception for a recorded recollection. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Pursuant to rule 803(5), a recorded recollection is a record that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (A) is on a matter the witness once knew about but now cannot recall well enough to testify fully and accurately;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (B) was made or adopted by the witness when the matter was fresh in the witness's memory; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (C) accurately reflects the witness's knowledge, unless the circumstances of the record's preparation cast doubt on its trustworthiness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Tex. R. Evid. 803(5). In interpreting the predecessor of rule 803(5), the court of criminal appeals has held that the proponent seeking admission of a recorded recollection must satisfy four elements: (1) the witness must have had firsthand knowledge of the event, (2) the written statement must be an original memorandum made at or near the time of the event while the witness had a clear and accurate memory of it, (3) the witness must lack a present recollection of the event, and (4) the witness must vouch\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   for the accuracy of the written memorandum.\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

App. 1998).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant's argument challenges the fourth element. In\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , the court of criminal appeals recognized that the fourth element can be met by a witness's testimony that she remembers recognizing the writing as accurate when she read it at an earlier time.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11833008\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/967/410/#p416\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And, \"[a]t the extreme, it is even sufficient if the individual testifies to recognizing her signature on the statement and believes the statement is correct because she would not have signed it if she had not believed it [to be] true at the time.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11833008\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/967/410/#p416\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Lam's testimony met these requirements. First, Lam testified that she could not remember the night's events. Next, she testified that she told her daughter what happened and her daughter wrote down her description of the incident. Then Lam testified that her daughter then interpreted the statement and read it back to her, and Lam agreed it was accurate and signed it. Finally, when Appellant's counsel asserted, \"And so there was no way for you to verify what [your daughter] put in the statement, [was] there?\" Lam replied, \"Because when the incident happened, I told her the story and then that detail that I provided to her, so she put it in the statement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As to the question of whether the circumstances of the recording of Lam's statement here \"cast doubt on its trustworthiness,\" courts and scholars agree that this particular phrase in rule 803(5) is superfluous.

Pretrial motions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Appellant asserts that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to file certain motions before trial. The record bears out Appellant's contention that trial counsel failed to file certain motions on Appellant's behalf prior to trial. When the trial court asked if Appellant was ready for trial, his trial counsel said she was not and requested a brief continuance because \"[she] thought [she] had filed the motions [she] needed to file on [Appellant's] behalf, and [she] did not.\" Appellant's trial counsel then explained to the trial court that she had filed certain pretrial motions in another case against Appellant and mistakenly thought she had filed those motions in the instant proceeding as well. But because of a fortuitous delay in the proceedings after the jury was selected, Appellant's counsel was able to file several motions, including a motion to suppress and a motion for discovery of evidence in possession of the State.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court ruled on all of these motions and granted some, including the motion to\n   suppress. Thus, we fail to see how the delay in filing these motions caused harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Appellant seems to imply that his trial counsel's mistake proved that she had not adequately prepared for trial. He argues in particular that her motions related to discovery reveal that she did not attempt to examine evidence in preparation of trial. However, we note that prior to Appellant's counsel filing her belated motions, the State had already filed a rule 404(b) disclosure of extraneous offenses it intended to use,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tex. R. Evid. 404(b), and a notice of expert witnesses it intended to call. The parties also stipulated that the State timely produced a number of items of discovery during the case, including a witness statement (presumably Exhibit 2), a video recording, a 911 call recording, 19 photographs, and \"witness contact notes\" regarding Ruiz.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   We decline Appellant's invitation to speculate as to his trial counsel's degree of preparedness for the case, and we do not find that the record before us supports a conclusion that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance in this respect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Menefield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316448\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/363/591/#p592\">\n    363 S.W.3d at 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Appellant's trial counsel objected to the recording on the basis that it was not authenticated but did not object to it as inadmissible hearsay. Appellant also argues that the record shows his trial counsel had not adequately prepared for trial because it is obvious (to him) that she had not reviewed the tape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   We again decline to speculate regarding Appellant's trial counsel's preparation for trial without permitting her an opportunity to explain her actions. And, even assuming that the 911 call constituted inadmissible hearsay, there is no indication that admission of the 911 recording deprived Appellant of a fair trial.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Reyes v.

The portion of the 911 call played for the jury largely echoed the testimony Ruiz had already given-that Lam arrived at her house, bleeding from the head, and told Ruiz that Appellant had beaten her up.

I don't know if I should.' \" Appellant argues that it is inadmissible evidence of extraneous offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Exhibit 2 was admitted just prior to a lunch break in the trial. When the parties returned from their lunch break, Appellant's trial counsel attempted to lodge a belated objection to the excerpted statement and asked that it be redacted from the exhibit. The trial court denied her objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Even if we assume, without deciding, that this is an example of deficient performance, Appellant cannot show that it rose to such a level as to change the\n   outcome of the trial. The statement itself is vague-it does not provide information about why Lam was \"always ... calling the cops\" or otherwise connect prior calls to Appellant's behavior. Additionally, the State did not emphasize that particular statement or otherwise highlight it to the jury. And, as pointed out above, the trial court, through the jury charge, instructed the jury to disregard any evidence of extraneous offenses. Finally, the jury was presented with evidence during the guilt phase of Appellant's previous conviction for family-violence assault because it was an enhancement to the charge against him. Viewing the record as a whole, we do not find that there was a reasonable probability that, if trial counsel had successfully objected to the statement in Exhibit 2, the result would have been different.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. at 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. at 2068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Officer McCraw testified that sometime between February 22, 2013, and the time of trial, \"an incident occurred\" and Oak Point terminated his employment. Officer McCraw placed the blame on his supervisor and alleged that his supervisor had retaliated against him after Officer McCraw informed the supervisor he intended to retain an attorney. He was subsequently hired by another police department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Later, Appellant's trial counsel requested a hearing outside the presence of the jury regarding the circumstances of Officer McCraw's termination. The jury was excused and Officer McCraw provided a fairly in-depth description of the events that led to his termination. At the end of the hearing, the trial court asked trial counsel if she intended to address the matter in front of the jury. Trial counsel declined to do so. As the reviewing court, we decline the opportunity to second-guess trial counsel's tactical decision as, in view of the record before us, it does not fall below the objective standard of reasonableness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Young v.

Appellant's complaint again asks us to speculate as to trial counsel's preparation for the case.
