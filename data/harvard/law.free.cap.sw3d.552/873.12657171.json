In nine issues, Appellants H.E. and P.E. challenge the probate court's denial of their application to be appointed guardians of the person of their intellectually-disabled adult daughter, A.E. Because we hold the probate court abused its discretion in denying the guardianship, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.E. has a moderate intellectual disability and moderate encephalopathies. She has an IQ between 50 and 55, and she lives with her mother, H.E., and her father, P.E. Shortly before her eighteenth birthday, A.E.'s parents filed an application for guardianship of her person.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%201103.001\">\n    Tex.

A.E. turned eighteen two weeks before the hearing on the application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The guardianship was not contested by A.E.'s court-appointed attorney ad litem. At the hearing, A.E.'s parents testified about the need for a guardianship and introduced a certificate of medical examination from A.E.'s treating physician stating that she may decline to treat A.E. in the future due to A.E.'s inability to give informed consent. The court investigator testified that she did not believe a guardianship was necessary because supports and services and alternatives to guardianship were sufficient, but she conceded that she would change her mind on that point if A.E.'s doctor refused to treat A.E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the conclusion of the hearing, the probate court denied the guardianship application, finding that A.E.'s parents had not shown by clear and convincing evidence that supports and services and alternatives to guardianship were not feasible. The probate court subsequently filed findings of fact and conclusions of law, including findings that A.E. had not experienced any problems in receiving medical treatment since becoming an adult (that is, in the two weeks between her eighteenth birthday and the hearing) and that A.E. is agreeable to allowing her parents to assist her in making medical treatment decisions. The probate court further concluded that it is not in A.E.'s best interest to take away her rights and appoint a guardian; that A.E.'s rights do not need to be protected by the appointment of a guardian; and that all of A.E.'s needs are being met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Parents, H.E. and P.E., now appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We review a probate court's guardianship determinations for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    In re Guardianship of Alabraba\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7319610\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/341/577/#p579\">\n    341 S.W.3d 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 579 (Tex.

H.E. stated that A.E. is not capable of making medical decisions even with help, A.E. does not have the capacity to execute a power of attorney or supported decision-making agreement, and A.E. would not understand such a document even if it were explained to her. Also, A.E. would not be able to understand a consent form given to her by a doctor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   H.E. further testified that A.E.'s school has a program for special needs children, that she can empty the dishwasher, and that she is learning to fold towels at a volunteer job.

According to her doctor, A.E. is unable to initiate and make responsible decisions regarding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \u2022 complex business, managerial, or financial decisions;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \u2022 a personal bank account;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \u2022 safely operating a motor vehicle;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \u2022 voting in a public election;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \u2022 determining her own residence;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \u2022 administering her own medication;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \u2022 attending to basic activities of daily living without supports and services;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \u2022 marriage;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \u2022 attending to instrumental activities of daily living (like shopping, cooking, and cleaning); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \u2022 consenting to medical, dental, or psychological treatment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The doctor indicated that A.E. would not be able to understand the guardianship hearing. While the doctor found that, with supports and services, A.E. can make responsible decisions about basic daily activities like bathing, grooming, dressing, walking, and toileting, she further stated that she believed A.E. is unable to handle making any other decisions. The doctor concluded that A.E. is totally incapacitated.

Nevertheless, the investigator concluded in the report that supports and services were sufficient and that alternatives to guardianship were feasible, and the investigator recommended that A.E. did not need a guardian.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Court Investigator's Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   At the hearing, the court investigator testified that despite A.E.'s doctor's statement that A.E. cannot handle decisions even with assistance, she believed A.E. could make decisions with her parents' support; \"[s]he lives at home with her parents who assist her with decision-making and with that assistance, she's able to function and make decisions in her life.\" The investigator acknowledged, however, that A.E. does not understand the consequences of her decisions and does not have the capacity to sign a power of attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The investigator further acknowledged that A.E. cannot provide informed consent to a doctor. When asked how A.E. could get treatment from a doctor without a guardian or the ability to consent to treatment, the investigator stated, \"[t]hat would be between the doctor and the family and [A.E.].\" The investigator agreed, however, that in light of A.E.'s doctor's statement that she may withhold treatment from A.E., a guardianship would probably be necessary \"if the doctor would not be able to see her with her parents accompanying her.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The investigator answered \"possibly\" when asked if someone with a tendency to answer \"yes\" to please people could be subject to abuse or exploitation, given that her parents were not with her all the time. The investigator asked A.E. questions when they met but testified that she did not believe A.E. understood the questions. The investigator believed that A.E. would not be able to give an opinion about her care situation, about voting, or about her ability to get married. Although the investigator stated in her report that A.E. could make decisions about voting, driving, and marriage with her parents' support and assistance, she testified at trial that she did not believe A.E. would understand how to make those decisions and essentially acknowledged that A.E.'s parents would be making those decisions for her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The investigator explained why she believed that supports and services were sufficient\n   and that alternatives to guardianship were feasible. She testified,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Because when I met with the family, we talked about what kind of problems they were running into. She's only been 18 for two weeks and there weren't any problems that they had run into the day I was out there and met with them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   And so there was nothing I could indicate was a reason that they needed to be the legal guardian. As her parents, they were able to take care of getting her to the doctor, they provide food clothing and shelter, they're interacting with the school.

She gave the same response to all of the questions asked of her, including if she remembered talking to the attorney ad litem about driving\n   a car, if she thought she would be able to drive a car, if she needed a lot of help, if she would like to vote in an election, and if she liked her doctor and would be sad if she had to go to a different doctor. The attorney ad litem informed the court that she did not oppose the guardianship because, while A.E. did not understand guardianships, A.E. \"was able to tell [the attorney ad litem] that she thinks she likes the help, she wants the help to continue.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The investigator's report indicated that A.E. does not know who her doctor is or what medications she takes and did not understand the questions the investigator asked her.

Even under this deferential standard, clear and convincing evidence established as a matter of law that (1) A.E. is totally incapacitated because of a mental condition; (2) A.E. does not have the capacity to operate a motor vehicle, make personal decisions regarding residence, and vote in a public election; (3) supports and services and alternatives that would avoid the need for guardianship are not feasible; (4) it is in A.E.'s best interest to have the probate court appoint H.E. and P.E.-who are eligible to act as A.E.'s guardians and are entitled to appointment-as guardians of A.E.'s person; and (5) A.E.'s rights will be protected by the appointment of a guardian. No evidence supported the probate court's findings to the contrary. We therefore hold that the probate court abused its discretion in denying H.E. and P.E.'s guardianship application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ford Motor Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316403\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/363/573/#p578\">\n    363 S.W.3d at 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Having sustained H.E. and P.E.'s first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh issues, we reverse the probate court's denial of H.E. and P.E.'s guardianship application.
