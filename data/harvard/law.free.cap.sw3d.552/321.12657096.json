HEALTH &amp; SAFETY CODE ANN. \u00a7 481.117(b) (West, Westlaw through 2017 1st C.S.), and sentencing her to thirty days' service in the SPURS work-release program. In three issues, which we construe as two, Amberson complains that (1) the trial court erred in admitting hearsay evidence of drug identity based upon drugs.com and the Drug Identification Bible 2014 to 2015 (Drug Bible) and that such error obligates us to render an acquittal; and (2) even if such evidence is admissible, the evidence of drug identity is legally insufficient to support the jury's verdict.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We reverse and remand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The criminal complaint charges Amberson with one count of driving while intoxicated and one count of intentionally or knowingly possessing a controlled substance, specifically clonazepam, in an\n   amount of less than 28 grams. Amberson pleaded not guilty. The relevant testimony elicited during the guilt/innocence phase of the case came from Allen McCollum, a patrol officer with the Corpus Christi Police Department (CCPD) and Pablo Hernandez, a CCPD patrol officer at the time of Amberson's arrest, who had been promoted to detective in the narcotics/vice division three months before trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. McCollum\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   McCollum testified that on the evening of March 27, 2014, he witnessed a vehicle driven by Amberson commit a rolling stop. McCollum followed Amberson's vehicle to the next intersection, where Amberson and McCollum came to a stop at a red light. When the traffic light turned green, McCollum observed that Amberson's vehicle \"stayed there for an extended amount of time and then proceeded to cross through the intersection.\" McCollum initiated a traffic stop and radioed for an additional officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Upon approaching the vehicle, McCollum noticed an open case of beer in the front and individual beer cans in the center console. McCollum recalled that Amberson's speech was somewhat slurred. After two other police officers arrived, McCollum asked Amberson to exit her vehicle so that he could administer field sobriety tests. McCollum determined that Amberson was driving while intoxicated based on her performance of the field sobriety tests, and he arrested her. Amberson refused to provide McCollum with a breath specimen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Hernandez\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Hernandez assisted McCollum by conducting an inventory of Amberson's vehicle. The State's questioning of Hernandez prompted several objections by defense:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Q. And tell me more about the inventory of the vehicle?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   A. During the inventory of the vehicle there was a purse on the front passenger floorboard, and in fact, there was a pill bottle, and I looked in the pill bottle. You know, normally just to make sure it's the actual pills inside there, and there was two different types of pills.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Q. Okay. Can you describe the pills?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   A. There was a couple of pills that were white, rectangular, and two that were just kind of circular and green.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Q. So what did you do after you discovered them?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   A. With the markings on the pills I used the Drugs.com.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [ DEFENSE ]: I'd object at this point, Your Honor, to anything that an outside reference source said is hearsay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   STATE : The officer used the source to identify the drugs, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [ DEFENSE ]: Which is hearsay, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   STATE : The officer used the source to identify the drug. Drugs.com is a recognizable site to identify drugs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [ DEFENSE ]: It's also hearsay, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   COURT : Well, it would be an exception if it's a learned treatise. Is there anything that recognizes Drugs.com as a learned treatise?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [ DEFENSE ]: I have some information on that, Your Honor. If you'd like to conduct a bench conference, or if you'd like me to voir dire the witness, or if you'd like the prosecutor to further lay the predicate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   COURT : Well, unless there-were there any other sources used?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   STATE : We can use the source now, Your Honor. We have the Drug Bible as well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   COURT : Your response?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [ DEFENSE ]: My response to that is if the State seeks to attempt to lay the predicate for a learned treatise that has to be through a recognized expert according to Rule of Evidence 803.18, Your Honor, which is the exception for a learned treatise. There's been no such offer or proffer or predicate for this witness's expertise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The trial court then excused the jury, and the State and Amberson took Hernandez on voir dire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Voir Dire Examination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   During voir dire examination, Hernandez testified that at the time of trial he was a detective in the narcotics/vice division.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Hernandez, the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) will not test drugs unless requested by the district attorney's office. Therefore, Hernandez relies on the website drugs.com and the Drug Bible to identify drugs. Hernandez characterized his training as \"hands-on experience.\" According to Hernandez, he worked in the property room identifying and processing evidence for about six weeks. The State asked, \"And prior to [working in the property room] did you have any other kind of training for drugs or narcotics?\" to which Hernandez answered, \"Not as in depth as I did now.\" When pressed by the State for additional training, Hernandez testified that \"It's really difficult to remember every type of pill markings on our own. Sometimes we'll make cheat sheets, but it's still really hard to remember thousands of pills and the markings that come from it.\" Hernandez estimated that he used the Drug Bible \"[m]aybe a 100 times\" to identify drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On cross examination, Hernandez acknowledged that drugs.com contains a disclaimer and that it is not necessarily a reliable source. Specifically regarding drugs.com, Amberson asked and Hernandez answered:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Q. Okay. Have you ever looked at the-what are they called, Disclaimers and Limits that they include in Drugs.com?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Q. Okay. And basically it says in there that this information is provided as is, and they're not responsible for any errors, problems or other limitations from the information that's in there, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Q. Okay. So they, themselves, are saying that it's not necessarily a reliable source, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Hernandez also acknowledged that he has no medical training and no experience administering drugs. As for the Drug Bible, Hernandez testified that it is \"strictly for law enforcement professional use only.\" But, when pressed on whether there is something that restricts the purchase of the Drug Bible from someone who is not in law enforcement, Hernandez answered, \"I couldn't tell you if it-if there is or isn't.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   After questioning Hernandez, Amberson objected to his testimony and reliance on drugs.com and the Drug Bible. Amberson argued that Hernandez was not an expert because Hernandez acknowledged that anyone can look up a code and that he lacked any scientific or medical training that would enable him to identify a drug without resorting to a book. Therefore, according to Amberson, Hernandez could not rely on a learned treatise, assuming\n   drugs.com and the Drug Bible constituted such.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The trial court overruled Amberson's objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Testimony Before the Jury\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   When the jury returned to the courtroom, Hernandez testified that in his eight and a half years as a police officer he had \"come in contact with all types of drugs.\" While examining Hernandez, the State offered and the trial court admitted the pill bottle that Hernandez found during his inventory. The patient referenced on the pill bottle's label was \"Alma Saldana,\" and the prescription was for hydrocodoneacetaminophen. Hernandez stated that he has used the Drug Bible \"[m]aybe 20, 30 times\" to identify drugs and that, over the course of his career, he has identified drugs over a 100 times. By comparing each pill's alpha and numeric markings, color, and shape with the information in the Drug Bible and on drugs.com, Hernandez testified that the pill bottle contained hydrocodone and two clonazepam pills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On cross examination, Hernandez acknowledged that drugs.com disclaimed any errors or misinformation. Hernandez recounted that DPS lab policy is that if a police department can identify a drug using two independent sources, then, unless authorized by the district attorney, it will not test a sample. Generally, DPS, according to Hernandez, will test felony amounts of cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, crack cocaine, THC oils, wax, and synthetic marijuana. Hernandez acknowledged that in some circumstances there can be counterfeit pills and that the CCPD does not employ an identification technician.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Verdict and Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The jury was charged with one count of driving or operating a motor vehicle in a public place while intoxicated and one count of possession of a controlled substance, namely clonazepam, in an amount of less than 28 grams. It returned a not guilty finding as to the first count and a guilty finding as to the second count. Amberson elected to have the trial court assess punishment. The trial court signed a judgment of conviction as to the possession of a controlled substance count and sentenced Amberson to thirty-days' service in the SPURS work-release program. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL SUFFICIENCY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In Amberson's second issue, she contends that even if it was not error for the trial court to allow Hernandez to testify as to the steps he took to identify the pills, the evidence of drug identity is legally insufficient to support the jury's verdict. In an unpublished opinion, we have already rejected a substantially similar argument. In\n   <em>\n    Pineda v. State\n   </em>\n   , the appellant argued that the evidence was legally insufficient to support a finding that he possessed hydrocodone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   No. 13-13-00574-CR,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205311237\">\n    2015 WL 5311237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4 (Tex. App.-Corpus Christi Sep. 10, 2015, no pet.) (mem. op., not designated for publication). We recounted that the drug-evidence custodian determined the chemical composition and weight of the pill by using drugs.com and the steps that the custodian took in making the determination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4-5. The custodian's testimony differed from Hernandez's testimony in that he testified that in six years of using drugs.com the website had not misidentified a drug and the custodian found it to be a reliable source.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. We concluded that the jury was free to judge the custodian's credibility as well as the strength of the evidence and overruled the appellant's legal sufficiency challenge. The same is true in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Amberson's second issue is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In Amberson's first issue, she asserts that the trial court erred in admitting hearsay evidence of drug identity based upon drugs.com and the Drug Bible. Amberson further argues that Hernandez was not qualified as an expert, and therefore, he could not rely on the learned treatise exception. The State responds by arguing that: (1) drugs.com and the Drug Bible do not constitute hearsay; (2) Hernandez's description of the steps he took to identify the pills constitutes lay witness testimony; and (3) even if the statements in drugs.com and the Drug Bible constitute hearsay, they fall within exceptions to the hearsay rule regarding (1) learned treatises and (2) market reports and similar commercial publications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. EVID. 803(17), (18). The State's first and second responsive arguments present threshold questions that we must address before returning to Hernandez's qualifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   An appellate court reviewing a trial court's ruling on the admissibility of evidence must utilize an abuse-of-discretion standard of review.\n   <em>\n    Weatherred v.

App. 1997). Among the nonexclusive factors that a trial court could consider in determining scientific reliability is the qualifications of the testifying expert.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kelly v.

Hernandez's Sources and Hearsay\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   From Amberson's objection in the trial court, she characterized drugs.com and the Drug Bible as hearsay and possibly a learned treatise. Therefore, a threshold matter is determining whether Amberson's characterization holds true. If Amberson was correct, the burden then shifted to the State to establish an applicable exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8198379\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/268/571/#p578\">\n    268 S.W.3d at 578-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The State opposes Amberson's characterization on the ground that in order to constitute hearsay, the statement must be uttered by a person, and as support, it references Texas Rule of Evidence 801(a), which provides that a \"statement\" means \"a person's oral or written verbal expression, or nonverbal conduct that a person intended as a substitute for verbal expression.\" TEX. R. EVID. 801(a). The State also references\n   <em>\n    Davis v. State\n   </em>\n   .

App.-Dallas Jun. 26, 2013, pet. ref'd) (op., not\n   designated for publication). In\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   , the trial court permitted a forensic fingerprint expert to testify that she received the fingerprint and conducted computer analysis to find potential subjects for comparison.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. Over the appellant's hearsay objection, the forensic fingerprint expert stated that the computer system linked the fingerprint to appellant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On appeal, the appellant argued that the computer's identification of appellant as the source of the fingerprint amounted to hearsay testimony.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. In overruling the appellant's issue, the court wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   ... Here, [the forensic fingerprint expert] received the analysis from a computer, not a person. By definition, therefore, the computer was not a declarant and the information was not hearsay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   This is not a situation where the information provided by the computer was merely feedback of computer-stored data, which would be hearsay. The information reflected on the computer readout is the result of the computer's internal operations.

If we come across any kind of pills the markings on them go through Drugs.com, identify them through there. They show you a picture of the exact pill that you're looking at, and it tells you what it is right there, how many milligrams, the dosage it is.

Further, Det. Paporello testified that the pills were hydrocodone, the controlled substance with which Youmans was charged with possessing, and that the manner in which he identified the pills was consistent with the practice of other officers. Finally, using such a database does not require scientific, technical, or specialized knowledge. Det. Paporello did not speak to the chemical nature of the controlled substance; rather, only to its classification, which could be determined by comparison of observable characteristics, including shape, color, and numeric identifiers. The probative value of this testimony\n   would have been greater if the database was named and there was consistency in the online sources used by officers in the field to identify prescription pills.

Rule 701 covers the more traditional witness-one who \"witnessed\" or participated in the events about which he or she is testifying-while Rule 702 allows for a witness who was brought in as an expert to testify. A witness can testify in the form of an opinion under Rule 701 if the opinions or inferences are (a) rationally based on his or her perceptions and (b) helpful to the clear understanding of the testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.\n   <em>\n    Fairow v.

App. 1997). Perceptions refer to a witness's interpretation of information acquired through his or her own senses or experiences at the time of the event (i.e., things the witness saw, heard, smelled, touched, felt, or tasted). Since Rule 701 requires the testimony to be based on the witness's perception, it is necessary that the witness personally observed or experienced the events about which he or she is testifying.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11920691\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/943/895/#p898\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11920691\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/943/895/#p898\">\n    at 898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the witness's testimony can include opinions, beliefs, or inferences as long as they are drawn from his or her own experiences or observations. This also incorporates the personal knowledge requirement of Rule 602 which states that a witness may not testify to a matter unless he or she has personal knowledge of the matter.\n   <em>\n    Bigby v.

App. 1994). There is, however, a provision in Rule 602 for opinion testimony by expert witnesses which allows a person testifying as an expert under Rule 703 to base his or her opinion on facts and data that are of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the field. TEX. R. CRIM. EVID. 703. Thus, expert testimony serves the purpose of allowing certain types of relevant, helpful testimony by a witness who does not possess personal knowledge of the events about which he or she is testifying.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9379160\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/92/531/#p535\">\n    92 S.W.3d 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 535-36 (Tex.

First, the State argues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   Though Appellant contends that Drugs.com does not constitute a reliable authority due to a disclaimer pertaining to the clinical information contained in the site, Appellant's Brief at 6, law enforcement officers that use the site are not dealing with patients or attempting to diagnose symptoms. Instead, the law enforcement officers that use the site are simply attempting to identify substances based on their code imprints and appearance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   This argument suggests that the information on drugs.com may be inadequate for treatment but adequate to support a conviction and the incarceration that may potentially follow. Second, the State implies that the clause \"by persons in particular occupations\" of rule 803(17) is rooted in the record. Specifically, the State argues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   Moreover, to establish the foundation for Rule 803(17), it need only be shown that the sources are generally relied upon by the persons in the particular occupation, i.e., law enforcement officers.

Amberson's reliability argument, presented on page six of her brief, was before the trial court in relation to the rule 803(18) hearsay exception regarding a learned treatise, not the rule 803(17) hearsay exception. Lastly, Amberson did not have an opportunity to present responsive arguments and evidence regarding the State's implicit contention that the information on drugs.com may be inadequate for treatment but adequate to support a conviction and the incarceration that may potentially follow as it related to the rule 803(17) exception.

Merits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Even if we addressed the merits of the State's alternative theory, the record is still lacking. One court has observed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   As with other hearsay exceptions, the admissibility of market reports and commercial publications under Rule 803(17) is predicated on the two factors of necessity and reliability. Necessity lies in the fact that if this evidence is to be obtained, it must come from the compilation, since the task of finding every person who had a hand in making the report would be impossible.
