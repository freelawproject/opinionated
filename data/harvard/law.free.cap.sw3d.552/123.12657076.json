The trial court sentenced Hooper to life imprisonment without parole for the first-degree murder conviction, and seven years' imprisonment for the armed criminal action conviction, with the sentences to run concurrently. Hooper challenges her convictions in seven points on appeal.

Around a month before the shooting at issue in this appeal, Hooper had \"run off [Victim and] a couple of other people from her house[,] and ... she had taken her gun and shot at [Victim]'s tailgate as they were leaving.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Around noon on May 9, 2016, Victim was driving Hooper, Brandon Hamm (\"Hamm\"), and K.H., to a restaurant in a nearby town. En route, Victim and Hooper got into an argument. When the four arrived, Hamm and K.H. got out of the truck to go into the restaurant. Hooper remained in the truck, \"throwing a fit.\" Victim got out, directed Hamm and K.H. to get back in the truck, and the four departed without eating. They drove to Hooper's house. Hamm and K.H. stayed there, while Hooper and Victim left in Victim's truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   K.H. went home. A short time later, Victim and Hooper returned and picked up Hamm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Victim was driving, Hooper was in the front passenger seat, and Hamm was in the rear passenger seat. Hooper and Victim began arguing about Hooper sending naked pictures of herself to another man. Victim broke up with Hooper, and the conversation went silent. Victim pulled up to a stop sign, paused, and then proceeded. At that time, Hooper shot Victim in the head with her pistol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Hamm heard a loud \"boom,\" and saw an \"orange flash\" near the truck's rearview mirror, around eye level for Hamm. Hamm was \"certain\" he had seen and heard a gunshot. Realizing that Hooper had shot Victim, Hamm jumped out of the truck and ran to his mother's house, which was a short distance down the street. He told his parents that Hooper had shot Victim, and his mother called authorities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Hooper called 911 on her cell phone. She exited the vehicle, pistol in hand, and paced in front of the truck. Hooper insisted at least six times that the shooting was \"an accident.\" Hooper turned and saw Hamm's mother, who was standing outside her home down the street. While still on the phone with 911 dispatch, Hooper went back in the truck, wedged her gun between the console and the front passenger seat, and came back out again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When authorities arrived, Hooper made numerous self-serving statements. She insisted that: she did not mean to shoot Victim; the gun fell out of her \"pocket\" \"when it went and misfired\"; the gun \"evidently\" fell out of her \"pouch\" without her realizing; she did not know it would \"misfire\"; she did not know the gun fell out when she was reaching for her cigarettes in the console; the gun was on her side; and she did not know the safety was off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Jennifer Hedgepath (\"Hedgepath\"), the 911 dispatcher, took Hooper's call. Hedgepath had been a dispatcher for 12 years and had taken thousands of 911 calls. Hedgepath would later testify that when Hooper first called, \"it was as calm as me sitting here talking to you now. It was like oh, nonchalant.\" Then as more people arrived, Hooper's \"voice escalated into I need to be panicked or I should change for this. It wasn't a natural response as far as any other 911 call I've ever taken.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Officer Michael Sanders (\"Officer Sanders\") was the first officer to arrive. He observed Hooper standing outside the driver's side door of Victim's truck applying pressure to Victim's\n   <em>\n    neck\n   </em>\n   with a T-shirt (Hooper shot Victim in the\n   <em>\n    head\n   </em>\n   ). Officer Sanders later testified that Hooper was speaking \"louder and louder. The more people got there the louder she got.\" From Hooper, he observed \"no tears, no emotions whatsoever.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Officer Sanders found a \"38 bodyguard\" gun in the front of the truck, between the passenger seat and the center console. There were three rounds left in the six-round magazine, and there was one round in the chamber. The safety was off. No other firearms were found at the scene. Officer Sanders located a bullet wound to the back of Victim's head. The slug in Victim's head would later be determined to match the shell casing found in Victim's truck, as well as the bullets found in the magazine of Hooper's gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Sergeant David Maclin arrived at the scene, and performed an initial investigation. Hamm then approached him and said that Hooper shot Victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Victim was transported to the hospital by ambulance. His family made the decision to remove life-support shortly thereafter, and Victim died. Dr. Russell Deidiker, a pathologist, performed Victim's autopsy. He determined that Victim's death was\n   caused by a single gunshot wound to the head, and classified the death as a homicide. Dr. Deidiker found the entrance wound to be in the back of Victim's head just to the left of the mid-line, about the level of the ears. The path of the bullet was from Victim's back to front-from Victim's right to left, and slightly downward. The bullet path indicated that the fatal shot had not been fired from a position lower than the entry point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Hooper was charged by amended information with the class A felony of first-degree murder (Count I), pursuant to section 565.020;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and armed criminal action (Count II), pursuant to section 571.015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   While awaiting trial on those charges, Hooper was held at the Pemiscot County Jail. The jail had a policy to record all incoming and outgoing calls, and utilized a third-party contractor-IC Solutions-to implement and maintain the recording system. A voice at the beginning of these calls warned that the call was being recorded. If an attorney called the jail, or IC solutions, and provided phone numbers the attorney did not want recorded for purposes of attorney-client privilege, those phone numbers would then be entered into the system, and the calls to or from those phone numbers were not recorded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   There were three phone calls Hooper either made or received, wherein a voice stated \"this is an attorney-client privilege call\" at the beginning of the call. These calls were recorded, as no one had requested that such phone numbers be excluded from the recording system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   These recordings (along with the other recordings of Hooper's prison communications) subsequently came into the possession of both defense counsel and the prosecutor. An investigator at the prosecutor's office, upon noticing the initial recitation at the beginnings of the calls that they were attorney-client communications, stopped listening, and segregated those calls such that their substance would not be reviewed or revealed. Defense counsel sent the prosecutor a text message saying that the prosecutor's office had received some CDs containing conversations between Hooper and her attorney. The prosecutor promptly acknowledged defense counsel's message, and instructed staff to maintain the recordings, but not to review them until the prosecutor's office received instructions from the trial court on what was to be done with them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On April 13, 2017, Hooper filed a \"Motion to Dismiss for State's Violation of Defendant's 6\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Amendment Rights and Defendant's Right to a Fair Trial\" asserting that: (1) three confidential and privileged telephone conversations Hooper had with her attorney were recorded by the Pemiscot County Jail staff; (2) the conversations were confidential/privileged communications between Hooper and her attorney; (3) the recorded conversations contained Hooper's version of the events that transpired; and (4) a CD containing the recorded conversations was delivered to the prosecuting attorney's office. Hooper requested dismissal of all charges then pending against her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A hearing was held April 21, 2017, on Hooper's motion to dismiss. The challenged recordings were not admitted into evidence, and not submitted for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review. Hooper's counsel made various unsworn arguments as to the contents of the recordings, but there was no evidence adduced thereto. The trial court overruled Hooper's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Trial commenced on April 27, 2017. Hooper did not testify. The jury found Hooper guilty of first-degree murder and armed criminal action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Hooper filed a \"Renewed Motion for Judgment of Acquittal Pursuant to Missouri Supreme Court Rule 27.07(C),\" and a \"Motion for New Trial.\" After hearing argument, the trial court took the motions under advisement. The trial court subsequently overruled both motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Thereafter, the trial court sentenced Hooper to life imprisonment without the eligibility for probation or parole for her conviction of first-degree murder, and a term of seven years' imprisonment for her conviction of armed criminal action, with the sentences to run concurrently. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Hooper challenges her convictions in seven points relied on. Summarily, these points challenge the trial court's denial of her motion to dismiss the charges against her on the basis of her \"Motion to Dismiss for State's Violation of Defendant's Sixth Amendment Rights and Defendant's Right to a Fair Trial\" due to the prosecutor's possession of certain recordings of attorney-client communications; insufficient evidence to support her convictions; and various plain errors alleged to have been committed by the State.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Point I: Hooper's \"Motion to Dismiss\"\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In her first point, Hooper alleges that the trial court erred in denying her \"Motion to Dismiss for State's Violation of Defendant's Sixth Amendment Rights and Defendant's Right to a Fair Trial.\" Hooper argues that three recordings of phone conversations she had with pre-trial counsel came into the possession of the prosecutor's office before trial. As best as we can track Hooper's reasoning, we discern the thrust of her argument to be: (1) the content of the three calls were subject to attorney-client privilege; (2) the State's possession of the recordings was-by itself-sufficient to demonstrate prejudice; and (3) the appropriate remedy was dismissal of all charges then pending against Hooper, and the trial court erred in denying that relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As applicable here, we defer to the trial court's fact findings (explicit and implicit) relevant to its challenged ruling; our review is\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   as to the trial court's application of the law to those facts (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the existence or non-existence of attorney-client privilege).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     State v.

Quite simply, Hooper points to no evidence in the record-offered, admitted, submitted\n   for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review, credited, uncredited, or otherwise-whereby the trial court, or this Court, could determine the contents of the recordings, such as to discern whether privilege attached thereto.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Koster\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7085560\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/383/105/#p117\">\n    383 S.W.3d at 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, the inferences available from the evidence relevant to Hooper's mental state also lend significant support to the inference that Hooper was the cause of Victim's gunshot wound. The evidence at trial permitted the jury to find that Hooper had-before the shooting of which she was convicted-shot her gun at Victim when she was angry with him. Hooper described to a gun shop clerk that around a month before Victim was shot in the head, she had to \"run off [Victim and] a couple of other people from her house, and ... she had taken her gun and shot at [Victim's] tailgate as they were leaving.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     State v.

Immediately before the shooting, Victim broke up with Hooper because Hooper had been \"sending naked pictures\" to another man, and Victim told her he \"didn't feel the same way about her any more [sic].\" The conversation went silent. Victim pulled up to a stop sign, paused, and proceeded. Then Hamm heard a \"boom\" and saw an orange flash from a gun at his eye level (approximately the height of the rearview mirror).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The evidence of Hooper's conduct after the shooting also gives rise to the inference that she was the cause of Victim's gunshot wound. Hooper made numerous (and unprompted) false statements\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   to authorities aimed at defraying her culpability for Victim's gunshot wound.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     State v.

App. S.D. 2013) (\"Consciousness\n   of guilt can be inferred from false statements made in an attempt to deceive the police.\"). The 911 operator testified at trial. She indicated that she had taken \"[p]robably thousands[ ]\" of calls, and \"that one was different than any other I've ever taken.\" The 911 operator indicated that \"[w]hen [Hooper] first called it was as calm as me sitting here talking to you now. It was like oh, nonchalant. And then as more people get there it is like her voice escalated into I need to be panicked or I should change for this. It wasn't a natural response as far any other 911 call I've ever taken.\" Officer Sanders, a responding officer, also testified at trial. He indicated that Hooper did not cry at the scene: \"There was no emotions, no tears, no puffy eyes, no anything.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Hooper called 911 on her cell phone, and in response to questions such as \"Where at?\" and \"Okay, what's your name?\" stated, \"16\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   and 7th, I think,\n   <em>\n    my firearm accidentally went off\n   </em>\n   ,\" and\n   <strong>\n    \"\n   </strong>\n   Lisa Hooper. My,\n   <em>\n    it accidentally went off.\n   </em>\n   \" While she was on the phone with 911 dispatch, Hooper was observed pacing in front of the truck with the gun in her hand. The jury could infer from this that Hooper had the gun in her hand when Victim was shot, and maintained possession of it thereafter. When Hooper realized she was being observed, Hooper immediately stowed the gun away \"between the passenger seat and [the] console[.]\" From this, the jury could infer that Hooper was trying to hide the gun, or hide the fact that she had been holding the gun during and after the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Police found Hooper's gun where she had left it-wedged between the passenger seat and the console, loaded, with the safety off, and its barrel facing the front windshield. Police also found a .380 bullet casing under the backseat of the truck, which matched Hooper's gun, and the slug found in Victim's head. The gun's magazine could hold six bullets, but only had four in it at the time police found it. The absence of two bullets from the magazine was consistent with the other evidence at trial, and warranted the inference that Hooper had fired one round at Victim's vehicle about a month prior, and another round into Victim's head at the time of the crimes charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Hooper also makes the argument that Victim's family was the cause of Victim's death, because they made the decision to remove Victim from life support after the shooting. Dr. Deidiker testified that Victim died because of \"the actions of another person,\" which is what he wrote in the autopsy report. He testified that the removal of life support did not change that opinion, because \"[t]he proximate cause of death was the gunshot wound to the head. If not for the gunshot wound to the head[,] [Victim] would never have been in the position of not being able to breathe on his own.\" This was sufficient evidence for the jury to infer that the Victim's gunshot wound was the cause of his death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   This Court's recent opinion in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State v.

Any societal distrust of circumstantial evidence has long been abandoned. We no longer need to hold circumstantial evidence cases to a higher standard than direct evidence cases. If a jury is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, so long as the evidence meets the minimal appellate standard required by due process, we need not disturb the result simply because the case depended wholly, mostly, or partially upon circumstantial proof.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10001076\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/854/403/#p405\">\n     854 S.W.2d at 406\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    To be clear, motive is not an element that the State was required to prove pursuant to section 565.020.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    The jury was free to believe Hooper's \"explanation, but it did not have to do so.\"\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      State v.

Here, the jury disbelieved Hooper's explanation that the shooting was an \"accident\" or a \"misfire,\" and instead believed other evidence presented at trial that the shooting was knowingly and made after deliberation. Dr. Deidiker testified that the shooting was not accidental based on the location of Victim's wound-Hooper's gun was not fired from a position lower than the entry point (Victim's head). Further, as Sgt. Maclin testified, \"a gun that accidentally went off [would not hit Victim] in the back of his head, it would be lower torso somewhere.\" A firearms expert testified that he was unaware of \"any accidental discharges\" associated with the kind of gun Hooper had, and that the design of Hooper's gun made it extremely unlikely that it would fire just by being dropped-rather, the gun would need the trigger pulled to fire.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    See n.5 of this opinion,\n    <em>\n     supra.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
