Defendant-appellant Carolann Hessemann, as executrix of the Estate of Joseph Volpe, (\u201cVolpe\u201d) challenges the district court\u2019s grant of Restivo and Halstead\u2019s motion for a new trial; several evidentiary rulings at second trial; the district court\u2019s holding that Volpe was not deprived of a fair trial because his counsel was allegedly operating under a conflict of interest; the district court\u2019s denial of Volpe\u2019s motion for remitti-tur and a setoff of damages; and the district court\u2019s grant of attorneys\u2019 fees to counsel for Restivo and Halstead. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-18\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b574-19\">In 1984, sixteen-year-old Theresa Fusco was raped and murdered in Nassau County. As will be described in greater detail below, then-21-year-old John Kogut confessed to the Nassau County Police, stating that he, John Restivo, and Dennis Hal-stead had participated in the rape of Ms. Fusco, and then murdered her. All three men were charged with the rape and murder. Restivo and Halstead were tried jointly, and in 1986, a jury found both men guilty of rape and second degree murder; they were sentenced to 33-and-one-third years to life. Kogut was tried separately, and was convicted by jury; he was sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 37-and-one-half years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>But in 2003, DNA testing was conducted on a slide containing cells taken from a swab of the victim\u2019s vagina after her body was found. The testing revealed the presence of DNA from two individuals: Ms. Fusco and an unknown man. The testing excluded Kogut, Halstead, and Restivo from having contributed that DNA. The DNA also did not match that of 86 other individuals known to Ms. Fusco. Based on this evidence, Halstead, Restivo, and Ko-gut\u2019s convictions were vacated. The State went to trial again against Kogut, primarily based on his confession, but, when he was acquitted, the State dropped the charges against Restivo and Halstead. Ultimately, Halstead and Restivo spent eighteen years in prison\u2014two pretrial and sixteen following conviction\u2014for these crimes. This civil suit, alleging malicious prosecution and denial of fair trial claims, among other claims, followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">1. The Crime, Investigation, and Criminal Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">In 1984, sixteen-year-old Theresa Fusco went missing. She was last seen on November 10, 1984 at 9:47 PM, when she clocked out of her job at Hot Skates, a roller rink, in Lynbrook, New York. A missing persons investigation began the next day, with then-Nassau County Homicide Detective Joseph Volpe acting as lead detective.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Several weeks after Ms. Fusco went missing, on December 6, 1984, her body was found, naked, near the Lynbrook railroad tracks. As the medical examiner testified, the autopsy showed that she had been raped and that the cause of death was ligature strangulation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The medical examiner also determined that Ms. Fusco was most likely strangled with a rope, approximately one inch thick. On cross-examination, the medical examiner testified, based on the injuries to Ms. Fusco, that she believed that Ms. Fusco was strangled with pressure applied to the front of her neck with \u201crope or ligature, going from the back toward the neck, possibly crisscrossing with a lot of movement, and then both hands extending in the back of the neck.\u201d Trial Tr. at 719.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She further testified that the rope \u201cshould be less than six feet, depending on how it was applied\u201d because \u201cboth ends of the rope never touched the skin in the back,\u201d and that she would expect that there would be blood on the rope visible to the naked eye. Trial Tr. at 720-22. On redirect, she testified that, considering that thickness of the rope, it would have been easier to strangle Ms. Fusco if the rope were shorter, but clarified, \u201cI don\u2019t know the length of the rope. I have no idea.\u201d Trial Tr. at 726.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">In late January 1985, Volpe heard that a man named Harry Smyle had been making suspicious statements about the murder. After an eleven hour interrogation and being told that he was a suspect, Smyle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>told police that Restivo had made a suspicious statement to him about the murder. Volpe then picked up Restivo. Volpe and Robert Dempsey, another Nassau County detective, interrogated Restivo for approximately eight hours over March 5, 1985 and March 6,1985 and allegedly physically assaulted him, Restivo then signed a statement, which stated that he heard Halstead make admissions about the Fusco murder but that did not implicate Restivo. Specifically, the statement said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-4\">I would like to say that sometime back possibly November, December 1984, I stopped by my friend Dennis Halstead\u2019s apartment. He lives above the store on Atlantic Avenue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAfO\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-5\">When I saw him, I realized that he was also high. We were talking about 10 to 15 minutes and at this point and kind of out of the blue Dennis started to talk strange.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">He started talking about a broad. Dennis said he was with a broad, a girl, and that he was either by a cemet[e]ry, in a cemet[e]ry, across from the cemet[e]ry. He said he tried to fuck her. Then he had to fuck her up. But when he said that, he didn\u2019t tell me how he fucked her up. He then told me that he strangled her and killed her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Appellees\u2019 Supp. App\u2019x at 270. After Resti-vo was released, he contacted his attorney, Theodore Robinson, who called the homicide bureau and informed them he was representing Restivo and Halstead, and objected to the interrogation as coercive. On March 21, 1985, police officers came to the home of John Kogut, who worked with Restivo and Halstead, and asked him to come to the police station for questioning in relation to Ms. Fusco\u2019s murder. Kogut complied; he denied knowledge of the crime, but agreed to come back on March 25. He returned on March 25, and was interrogated through the night. Kogut testified that Volpe and Dempsey screamed at him, threatened him, and told him that they had scientific evidence, witnesses, and statements demonstrating that he committed the crime. According to Ko-gut, Volpe stated to him, \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you how you did it because I already know how it happened.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Supp. App\u2019x at 197. Volpe then told various stories, until Kogut finally gave in and agreed; Volpe wrote out a confession, which Kogut signed at approximately 9:00 AM on March 26. The written statement said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-9\">My name is John Kogut[.] I am 21 years of age, being born on 11-29-63. I live with my girlfriend Lisa Price and her father at 161 Traymore BLVD, Island Park. I am currently employed by Frank Bertini Landscaping, 2988 Bay View Court, Oceanside, phone RO-4-7483.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-10\">I have been told by the detective that I have the right to remain silent and that any statements I make may be used against me in court. I have been told that I have the right to talk with a lawyer before answering any questions or to have the lawyer present at any time. Further, I have been advised that if I cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be furnished [to] me and I have the right to keep silent until I have had the chance to talk with a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-11\">I understand my rights and make the following statement freely and voluntarily. I am willing to give this statement without talking with a lawyer or having one present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-12\">I would like to say that sometime back in Nov 1984, about a week or two before my birthday I was with these two guys. One was John Restivo, who I worked for[,] and the other was Dennis Hal-stead, a guy from Lynbrook I know, who also worked for Restivo. On this night, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>was between 8:00 pm and 10 pm, I was with John Restivo and Dennis Halstead in John\u2019s van. It\u2019s a blue [Fjord step van, with a side door that opens. This door is located back from the right front passenger door. I seem to remember that we were coming down from a moving job, possibly Hempstead, and we were drinking beer and smoking pot. John was driving, Dennis was in the right front passenger seat, and I was sitting on a cushion seat right behind the passenger seat. We were coming from East Rockaway where John keeps his trucks up Ocean Ave. [A]t the intersection of Merrick Road John turned left. We were heading west on Merrick Road and the cemet[e]ry was on our right side. At this point there\u2019s a girl walking on Merrick Road by the cem-et[e]ry and heading towards McDonalds. John pulls up and stops along side her. John and Dennis were saying let[\u2019]s see if she wants to party, meaning maybe smoke or have some beers. I felt that one of them knew her by the way they were talking, but I can\u2019t remember her or their exact words. When I heard this conversation, I moved up in the seat to see the girl and hear what[\u2019]s happening. Either John or Dennis invited her in, not to party, but for a ride home. I then opened the side door and I see this girl. She was about 15 or 16 years old, dark hair, medium long. She had on a blue denim dungaree jacket, I think a dark top, dark pants and white high top sneakers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-4\">She knelt down in between Dennis and John. I was sitting behind her. Dennis, as John\u2019s driving around, says to the girl \u201cYou want to party,\u201d \u201cforget about getting fired,\u201d \u201cdo you want to do the right thing.\u201d Do the right thing on the street means to get laid. With that she said, \u201cstop the fucking van,\u201d let me out. Dennis then jumped out of his seat and grabbed her. The girl started screaming \u201cleave me alone, let me out.\u201d She was fighting Dennis, but he was to[o] big for her and had a good grip on her. As I moved up to where she and Dennis were, she turned on me and smacked me in the face. With this I freaked out, I got crazy and I punched her with my left fist, hit her on the right side of her face. She falls out of Dennis\u2019[s] grip to the floor of the van. I would like to say that I hit her with a left and a right before she fell from Dennis[\u2019s] grip. I jumped on her upper body and she was trying to throw punches and kicks. At this point Dennis started taking off her pants and underpants, and I was taking her jacket shirt and bra. I\u2019m telling her to shut up, calm down, and I realize that Dennis had put his penis inside of her. While Dennis fucked her I held her upper body down. At this point she wasn\u2019t fighting to[o] much. By this time, I mean after Dennis fucked her, we were already in the cemet[e]ry. John had stopped the van and yelled back to me and Dennis, \u201clet me get a piece.\u201d I looked down at her and she was almost unconscious, I mean, she was fainting. Dennis pulled his pants up and was sitting in a seat by the passenger seat, John was now fucking her while she was unconscious, and I got out the side door and I took a blanket out that was in the van. I spread it out on the ground. This blanket was quilted with a different col- or border. Dennis and John then carried her out of the van and laid her face up on the blanket. I remember she had some jewelry on. I recall seeing a gold colored chain with what looked like a double heart on it with a piece broken off of it. I think there were other charms on the chain but I don\u2019t remember what they looked like. I then ripped the heart and chain off and I put it in my pocket. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>John was in the van pulling his pants up and putting his shoes on, and Dennis was taking the rest of her jewelry and rings off. Now she starts to regain consciousness. She was a little dazed, but she was saying \u201cI gotta tell,\u201d \u201cI gotta tell,\u201d and she was crying. She was still laying on the blanket with no clothes on. Dennis, John and I decided she had to be killed. We were afraid she would tell on us. She started to come to and she was getting frantic. I got on top of her, put my knees on her shoulder, and covered her mouth. My back was to John and Dennis and one of them threw me a rope. One of them said \u201cDo what you gotta do,\u201d but first, before the rope was thrown to me Dennis, while standing over her told her, \u201cYou have to die.\u201d They both went back to the van. I took the rope, which was a hard nylon type. I wrapped it double around her neck, then I twisted it like a cork screw. I twisted it for a few minutes until her body went limp, and I felt she was dead. I rolled her body up in the quilt and I threw her over my shoulder and to the van. I threw the rope into the van and then I dropped the body into the floor of the van. I got into the van, closed the door, and John took off out of the cemet[e]ry. Dennis was sitting up front. As we were leaving the cemet[e]ry we discussed that we had to get rid of the body. While we were driving and talking, I was putting the clothing into a plastic garbage bag. In addition to her clothing, I took her pocketbook and put it into the bag. It was maroon or black with a strap. I don\u2019t remember what I did with the rope, and I left the plastic bag with her clothing in it behind the driver[\u2019]s seat. I told John he had better get rid of the clothing and he said he\u2019d take care of it. We then went down a street across from the cemet[e]ry that dead ends by the railroad tracks. I don\u2019t remember who picked out the street but it was dark there. John [and] Dennis took her body out the side door and still wrapped in the quilt, they walked into the wooded area along the tracks and I was behind them. It was very dark and very heavy brush. John was carrying her by her head and walking backwards and Dennis had her feet. It seemed like 5 or 10 minutes to walk in before we got to an opening. At this opening we saw some wooden [pallets]. When they put her down, they both pulled the blanket and she rolled out. She ended up face down. We all started kicking leaves on her and I suggested we cover her with the [pallets], which we did. At this point I told Dennis and John I was leaving. As I started out from where her body was, I threw the jewelry I had by the tracks. I walked along the tracks until I came to a street. I turned right and I was on Sunrise [Highway].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">I walked down Sunrise to Union Ave. I crossed over Sunrise on Union to Oakland. At this time I was living with my friend Brian Skellington at 66 Oakland Ave, Lynbrook. The front door was open, I went and went to sleep.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">I am presently at the Homicide Squad, I have given this statement to Det. Volpe who has written it for me, I\u2019ve read it and it is the truth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">App\u2019x at 314-20; <em>see also </em>First Trial Tr. at 1383-1413. Kogut also gave a videotaped confession, confirming that he had been advised of and understood his constitutional rights and repeating the above story in material part. Kogut was then arrested and indicted on three counts: first-degree rape; second-degree murder in the course of rape; and intentional second-degree murder. Following a jury trial, Kogut was convicted on all counts and was sentenced to serve 37-and-one-half years to life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">However, even with Kogut\u2019s confession, police recognized that they would have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>very weak case against Restivo and Hal-stead unless Kogut were ultimately to testify against them at trial (which he did not). <em>See </em>Appellees\u2019 Supp. App\u2019x at 225-26 (Detective Spillane, Volpe\u2019s supervisor, testifying that, as of March 26, after Kogut confessed and was arrested, the case against Halstead and Restivo was \u201cvery weak if not nonexistent\u201d). Restivo\u2019s van was seized pursuant to a warrant soon thereafter. Certain hairs were allegedly found in Restivo\u2019s van pursuant to this search. Several of these hairs, the \u201cquestioned hairs\u201d or \u201cQ hairs,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> were determined to be consistent with Ms. Fusco\u2019s hairs.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> These hairs provided the only forensic evidence linking Restivo and Hal-stead to the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">Restivo and Halstead were then also arrested and indicted with counts of first-degree rape, second-degree murder in the course of rape, and intentional second-degree murder. Restivo and Halstead were tried jointly. As will be discussed below, Kogut\u2019s confession was inadmissible against Halstead and Restivo at their criminal trial, because Kogut did not testify. Nor was Restivo\u2019s statement implicating Halstead introduced at trial. Instead, the State introduced the Q hair evidence and evidence of statements allegedly made by Restivo or Halstead to third parties. Restivo and Halstead were convicted of all counts, and each was sentenced to 33-and-one-third years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">II. The DNA Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Beginning in 1993, samples of semen obtained from Ms. Fusco\u2019s body were subjected to DNA testing. Initial tests excluded Halstead, Restivo, and Kogut as the source of the semen, but plaintiffs\u2019 motions to vacate their convictions were denied. A new round of DNA testing was conducted in 2003, which again demonstrated that neither Halstead, nor Restivo, nor Kogut was the source of the semen found in Ms. Fusco\u2019s body. Thereafter, on June 11, 2003, all three men\u2019s convictions were vacated. The Nassau County District Attorney retried Kogut, based on his confession and, in December 2003, Kogut was acquitted. The District Attorney then moved to dismiss the indictment against Restivo and Kogut, on the ground that the DNA evidence disproved the state\u2019s theory of the case. The indictments were dismissed on December 29,2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">III. Civil Suit</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">Kogut filed suit on December 19, 2006, and Restivo and Halstead filed suit on December 21, 2006. The district court consolidated the suits, which alleged numerous constitutional claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Section 1983, as well as state law claims related to the Fusco investigation and their prosecution.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">A. First Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">Following an extensive <em>Daubert </em>hearing, which will be discussed below, and motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>practice, the case proceeded to trial on claims that defendants Joseph Volpe, Robert Dempsey, Frank Sirianni, Thomas Allen, Wayne Birdsall, and Charles Fraas maliciously prosecuted Restivo, Halstead, and Kogut and deprived them of their constitutional right to a fair trial, as well as a failure to supervise claim against defendant Shaun Spillane<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and a municipal liability claim against Nassau County. The jury found for defendants on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Thereafter, all three plaintiffs moved for a new trial on various grounds. The district court granted Restivo and Halstead\u2019s new trial motion, but denied Kogut\u2019s.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In particular, the district court ruled that it had erred in its treatment of Kogut\u2019s confession as to Restivo and Halstead. At trial, the confession was admitted without any limiting instruction to establish probable cause for the prosecution of Restivo and Halstead. The district court concluded that it was error to allow the jury to consider the confession to establish probable cause for Restivo and Halstead\u2019s prosecution because the confession was inadmissible against them in their criminal trials, relying on <em>Boyd v. City of New York, </em>336 F.3d 72 (2d Cir. 2003). The district court read <em>Boyd </em>as holding that defendants cannot use evidence that was inadmissible in a criminal case to establish probable cause to prosecute. The court concluded that its error affected Restivo and Halstead\u2019s substantial rights, given that the confession \u201cwas arguably one of the central pieces of evidence in this case.\u201d Special App\u2019x at 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">B. Second Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The case then proceeded to a second trial, at which Restivo and Halstead greatly narrowed their claims. At the second trial, plaintiffs claimed that Volpe and Fraas, the hair evidence technician who worked on the Fusco investigation, unconstitutionally deprived them of a fair trial under Section 1983 and that Volpe and Fraas maliciously prosecuted them under Section 1983 and New York state law. Both claims were based on the same two factual theories: that Volpe suppressed exculpatory evidence and/or that Volpe, either independently or with the assistance of Fraas, planted the hairs allegedly found in Restivo\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">Pursuant to its ruling that \u201cin attempting to show probable cause, Defendants [are] limited to evidence that was both included in their interrogatory responses and admissible in Halstead and Restivo\u2019s criminal proceedings,\u201d Special App\u2019x at 61, and finding the confession irrelevant to the fair trial claims, the court excluded Ko-gut\u2019s confession from coming into evidence at the second trial. The court also excluded Restivo\u2019s statement to police regarding in-culpatory statements allegedly made by Halstead on the ground that the statement was inadmissible in the criminal trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">Ultimately, the jury found that Volpe, but not Fraas, maliciously prosecuted plaintiffs and deprived them of them right to a fair trial. A special verdict was not requested, and the jury therefore did not specify whether it found against Volpe on the theory that he suppressed exculpatory evidence, planted the hair evidence, or both. Following a separate damages trial, the jury awarded each plaintiff a damages award of $18 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-12\">1. Evidence at Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b580-13\">We turn now to the evidence presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>a. Plaintiffs\u2019 Claims of Innocence</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Plaintiffs were not required to prove their innocence to win on their claims at trial. However, the evidence of their innocence provides an important backdrop for their claims at trial. As noted, the DNA testing in 2003 demonstrated that neither Restivo, nor Halstead, nor Kogut contributed the semen found in Ms. Fusco after her death. Volpe asserts that this does not establish plaintiffs\u2019 innocence, and speculates that plaintiffs raped the victim without ejaculating or while wearing condoms and that the sperm came from a consensual sexual partner. Volpe baselessly speculates that, although there was no evidence that Ms. Fusco was sexually active, she may have been having sex with her boyfriend, who was black, and she may not have told her friends because \u201cit was socially unacceptable for white girls to date black guys on Long Island in the 1980s.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 4. However, not only does this speculation lack any basis in record evidence, it is also rendered implausible by testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">First, plaintiffs\u2019 expert witness, Dr. Charlotte Word, testified about the DNA evidence in this case. She testified that vaginal swabs and smears taken from Ms. Fusco at her autopsy and later put on slides showed DNA from two sources. First, there was Ms. Fusco\u2019s DNA, demonstrating that these slides were taken from her and were not mislabeled or misplaced. Second, there was semen from only one male donor. As noted, the testing on the semen definitively excluded Restivo, Ko-gut, and Halstead as a source. The semen was also tested against DNA profiles of 86 individuals known to Ms. Fusco, including various people she had dated, and there were no matches. Nor was there a match when the semen was tested against the Combined DNA Index System database kept by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Further, Dr. Word testified that there was a large quantity of sperm present and that the DNA in the sperm head was well preserved. The quantity of sperm indicated that the \u201cmurder occurred very soon after the deposition of the sperm.\u201d Trial Tr. at 435. Additionally, Dr. Word testified that the Nassau County medical examiner\u2019s office records indicate that a very large number of sperm were collected from the vaginal cavity on the swabs and, \u201cwhen looked at microscopically, two different individuals were able to see that the tail portion of the sperm was also still attached to the sperm head.\u201d Trial Tr. at 436. Dr. Word testified that \u201cthe presence of tails on the sperm means that the sperm had not been in the vaginal cavity for a very long time[,] [b]ecause normally, in a normal healthy female, probably within six hours or less, maybe at the outside ten to twelve hours, those sperm tails are lost.\u201d Trial Tr. at 436. In sum, she testified that the sperm was deposited \u201c[p]robably no more than eight to twelve hours, but more likely less than six\u201d hours of the time of her death. Trial Tr. at 443. Furthermore, the physical evidence rebutted defendants\u2019 hypothesis that plaintiffs raped Ms. Fusco while wearing condoms after a consensual sexual partner deposited the semen. In particular, Dr. Word gave the following explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">[T]he physical act of two [or] more, or whatever more of vaginal penetration and sexual intercourse with her [even with condoms] would ... contribute to the loss of sperm from the vaginal cavity. So under that scenario, my expectation would be that we would have a much smaller number of sperm present on the samples collected. It wouldn\u2019t be consistent with that hypothesis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">Trial Tr. at 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">Nor is there any evidence that Ms. Fus-co was sexually active. The undisputed ev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>idence, based on notes from the investigating detectives, Ms. Fusco\u2019s diary, Ms. Fusco\u2019s mother, and Ms. Fusco\u2019s best friend, was that Ms. Fusco was a virgin prior to the rape. Moreover, as noted, DNA testing done on 86 individuals, including various boyfriends and ex-boyfriends of Ms. Fusco, did not reveal a match.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Further, defendants introduced only limited evidence at trial to establish Restivo and Halstead\u2019s guilt. Indeed, the primary evidence they sought to introduce to establish plaintiffs\u2019 guilt was Kogut\u2019s confession and Restivo\u2019s statement implicating Hal-stead; as discussed in detail below, both of these statements were hearsay that the jury could not consider for the truth of the matters asserted, that is, for the truth of whether Halstead and Restivo committed the crimes. The only other evidence introduced at trial tending to show their guilt was the testimony of Restivo\u2019s friend Michael Cockerel, who testified that, before Ms. Fusco\u2019s body was found, Restivo commented to him that the body would probably be found at Lynbrook Cemetery; that Restivo\u2019s brother assaulted him, and was then charged with witness tampering; that, when he asked Restivo if he committed the crime, Restivo responded, \u201cDidn\u2019t matter who did it. She was a black person lover,\u201d Trial Tr. at 2430; and that, the day after Ms. Fusco\u2019s disappearance, Restivo told him that he \u201cgot his dick wet\u201d the prior night, Trial Tr. at 2431. But on cross-examination, Cockerel admitted that he gave various statements to police that had contradictory information, that he lied to the grand jury, and that he was interviewed by police for more than ten hours, during which time poliee accused him of being involved in the crime.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">b. Suppression of Exculpatory Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">We now turn to the theories underpinning plaintiffs\u2019 malicious prosecution and denial of fair trial claims. First, plaintiffs claim that Volpe suppressed exculpatory evidence regarding a lead that Volpe developed\u2014the \u201cFrench lead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">Volpe testified at his deposition that, when she went missing, Ms. Fusco was wearing dark and light striped blue jeans with stripes two to three inches apart, and that the jeans were tapered at the ankles with cuffs. Accordingly, a missing person flier, which stated that the victim was wearing striped blue jeans when she went missing, was posted around town.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">Shortly after Ms. Fusco\u2019s body was found, a man named John French called to alert the police that his car had been stolen near Hot Skates around the same time of Ms. Fusco\u2019s disappearance.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Speciflcal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>ly, the report, which was made on December 6, 1984, stated that French\u2019s car had been stolen between 9:30 PM and 11:05 PM on November 10,1984 less than a mile away from Hot Skates.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> French found his car about a week later, before Ms. Fusco\u2019s body was discovered. He found the car near railroad tracks in Lakeview, near Woodfield Road, approximately one and one-half to two miles away from where it had been stolen. When he found the car, the license plates had been changed. Additionally, his sister, Lori French Gabberty, found a pair of women\u2019s or girls\u2019 jeans with stripes under the right passenger seat; at least one leg of the pants was inside out. These jeans were not in French\u2019s car before it was stolen. The jeans were discarded inadvertently by the Lynbrook Police<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> before Ms. Fusco\u2019s body was found. French also stated that, when he found his car, a rope that had previously been there was missing. The car was taken for processing, and was combed for forensic evidence. Volpe\u2019s handwritten notes indicate that he got hair samples from people who may have had access to French\u2019s car, and that investigators found a hair that was \u201cmore than 50% similar to deceased <em>&amp; </em>less than 100% similar\u201d to Ms. Fusco\u2019s in the car. Appellees\u2019 Supp. App\u2019x at 1569.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Two documents were created as a result of Volpe\u2019s investigation, Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibits 161 and 163. Exhibit 161 is a report providing information about the location and time of the theft of French\u2019s car, where the car was found, and the discovery of women\u2019s blue jeans with stripes, inside out under the seat. Exhibit 163 is a statement from French, wherein he describes being shown a length of rope and a brown felt pouch, which he identified as belonging to him. <em>See </em>App\u2019x at 375 (photograph of rope).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">At his deposition, Volpe testified that he thought that the French lead was <em>Brady </em>material, but that he turned it over to the District Attorney. There is evidence, however, that Volpe in fact did not turn over the French lead material. This evidence included testimony from Restivo that he did not know about this evidence at the time of his trial, testimony from Restivo\u2019s criminal trial counsel that he did not know about this evidence at the time of trial, evidence that Volpe did not disclose that striped jeans were found in French\u2019s car or that a rope was missing when he informed his supervisor, Lieutenant Spillane, that he was closing the French lead, testimony from the Assistant District Attorney on the case that he did not remember whether Volpe had told him about the French lead, and testimony from Judge Edward W. McCarty, who was the Assistant District Attorney on the case, that he did not remember being told about the French lead at the time of the investigation and that he never saw Exhibits 161 or 163 or learned the information contained therein before the civil trial. The parties also stipulated that Nassau County District Attorney\u2019s Office Chief of Appeals Bureau Peter Weinstein, who oversaw the State\u2019s response to Halstead and Restivo\u2019s requests for post-conviction relief would testify that \u201c[t]o the best of [his] knowledge, th[e] information about the French car/striped jeans lead was never disclosed by police to the prosecutors.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Supp. App\u2019x at 1736. And the county attorney previously representing defendants in the civil suit testified that when she received the DA\u2019s files and reviewed them, she did not recall seeing Exhibits 161 or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>163 or other evidence about the French lead.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Further, although Volpe admitted at his deposition that he knew the French lead was exculpatory, his attorney now argues that it was not, relying on the following evidence. First, at the civil trial, Gabberty testified that the jeans she found in 1984 had stitching, and she could not remember if there were stripes. But in 1984 she told police that the jeans were striped, and she testified at the civil trial that her memory was much fresher at the time she first spoke to detectives than at the civil trial decades later. Volpe also argues that the rope could not have been used in the murder because it had no blood on it and the medical examiner testified that the rope was too long, relying apparently on the image of the rope in evidence. But at trial, as noted, the medical examiner testified that although using a shorter rope would have been more efficient at killing Ms. Fusco, she \u201c[doesn\u2019t] know the length of the rope; [she] [has] no idea.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Supp. App\u2019x at 568. Further, the rope went missing at some point and was not tested for blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The materiality of the French lead was also reinforced by testimony from plaintiffs\u2019 police practices expert, Russell Fischer. Fischer worked in law enforcement for 33 years, ultimately achieving the rank of chief of criminal investigations in the Miami-Dade Police Department, one of the seven largest police departments nationwide. Fischer now works as an expert witness and assists in training law enforcement officers. At trial, Fischer testified to minimally accepted police practices, \u201ca baseline type of behavior or protocols that law enforcement officers follow,\u201d which differ from best practices. Trial Tr. at 1776. He testified that these minimally accepted police practices derive from a number of sources including court decisions, articles written by police practitioners, model policies produced by the International Association of Chiefs of Police as well as other groups, as well as practices from major police departments.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Fischer testified that, based on the evidence he had, the French lead was clearly exculpatory, and should have been documented and sent to a prosecutor, based on minimally accepted police practices in the 1980s. In particular, Fischer concluded that based on the time and location of the theft, the fact that the car\u2019s license plates were removed, the fact that a rope was in the back seat at the time of the theft and a rope was used as a ligature to strangle Ms. Fusco, and the fact that a pair of women\u2019s or girls\u2019 striped jeans were found in the back seat of the vehicle, with at least one leg turned inside out, this lead was clearly exculpatory. Fischer testified that under minimally accepted practices, exculpatory evidence does not need to definitively prove innocence in order for it to have to be documented and disclosed, and that the combination of all of these factors meant that the evidence should have been disclosed under minimally accepted police practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">c. Planting of Hair Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">The second theory underlying plaintiffs\u2019 malicious prosecution and fair trial claims was that Volpe, either alone or with the assistance of Fraas, planted the Q hairs belonging to Ms. Fusco that were allegedly found in Restivo\u2019s van. According to plaintiffs\u2019 theory of the case, Volpe removed several hairs from an envelope containing hairs removed at Ms. Fusco\u2019s autopsy and planted them in an envelope containing hairs collected from Restivo\u2019s van. By contrast, Volpe contends that Restivo and Halstead are actually guilty of the crime, and Ms. Fusco\u2019s hairs fell out in Restivo\u2019s van during the commission of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>Several pieces of evidence support plaintiffs\u2019 theory of the case. When Ms. Fusco\u2019s body was brought to the Medical Examiner\u2019s office, after photographs were taken, her hair was washed with water and the debris and leaves were removed. One of plaintiffs\u2019 experts testified that there was no significant mechanical damage to the Q8 or Q4 hairs or any debris on the hairs. Ms. Fusco\u2019s known hairs removed at the autopsy were in the same condition, basically without debris or mechanical damage. By contrast, the other hairs removed from Restivo\u2019s van, which were not consistent with Ms. Fusco\u2019s hair, \u201chad some mechanical damage, which is typical[ly] what happens to hair when it is laying around in an area where people work or walk or travel through, etcetera,\u201d and \u201calso had some debris on it.\u201d Trial Tr. at 921.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Additionally, extensive expgrt testimony was given regarding the presence of postmortem root banding (\u201cPMRB\u201d) in the Q hairs, which testimony was the subject of a five-day <em>Daubert </em>hearing. PMRB is a type of decomposition that occurs in hairs that are attached to dead bodies. Plaintiffs sought to introduce expert evidence that the Q hairs displayed PMRB and that PMRB takes days, if not weeks, to develop. This evidence would tend to show that the Q hairs were planted autopsy hairs; because the medical examiner testified that Ms. Fusco was placed where she was found within an hour of her death, even if Ms. Fusco was in Restivo\u2019s van after she had been killed, according to plaintiffs\u2019 experts, the Q hairs still must have been planted because PMRB could not develop in her hair within an hour of her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Plaintiffs proffered three experts in the field of PMRB: Dr. Max Houck, a forensic anthropologist and trace evidence analyst; Nicholas Petraco, a former trace evidence analyst with the New York Police Department (\u201cNYPD\u201d) and a consultant for the NYPD\u2019s Forensic Investigation Division; and Dr. Peter DeForest, who taught crimi-nalistics at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice for nearly forty years. Following a five-day <em>Daubert </em>hearing, the district court ruled on the admissibility of these experts and their testimony. The district court found that Dr. Houck, Petraco, and Dr. DeForest qualified as experts, rulings not challenged on appeal by Volpe.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">The district court summarized the evidence presented by plaintiffs\u2019 experts at the <em>Daubert </em>hearing as follows. Dr. Houck defined PMRB as \u201can opaque ellipsoidal band which appears to be composed of a collection of parallel elongated air spaces near the root of a hair, appearing as a dark or blackened band in the hair shaft.\u201d <em>Kogut v. County of Nassau, </em>894 F.Supp.2d 230, 235 (E.D.N.Y. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). He explained that PMRB is an artifact of decomposition: hairs in the active growing stage when in the time of death \u201cgo through changes in their root ends related to the decomposition of the surrounding skin and follicle.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-11\">According to Houck, the transformation of the putrid root <em>only </em>occurs in roots that remain in the scalp of a decomposing body; the changes do not occur if the hair is plucked (or shed) prior to death and allowed to deteriorate. He asserts that, according to the literature on the topic, for a hair to exhibit PMRB three conditions must be met: the hair must have been (1) in the active growing phase prior to an individual\u2019s death; (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>in the skin while the body was decomposing; and (3) in the decomposing skin for a minimum of 7 days. Based on Houck\u2019s understanding of the prosecution\u2019s theory of the Fusco Homicide, according to which Fusco was in Restivo\u2019s van for perhaps less than an hour, the Q hairs could not have come from Fusco on the night she disappeared. Houck concludes: Based on the known and documented scientific clinical studies on postmortem root banding relating to its timing, description, appearance, and conditions for existence, there is no known mechanism or reasonable explanation for PMRB to appear in Ms. Fusco\u2019s hairs that were allegedly left in the blue van.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-4\"><em>Id. </em>(alterations, citations, and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Next, Petraco also believed that the Q8 hairs could not have come from Ms. Fusco before she died or during the time between her death and when her body was left in the woods. He \u201copined that PMRB only develops in hairs while they are attached to a decomposing body and that the banding takes at least 8 hours after death to appear,\u201d citing \u201ctwo instances in which PMRB was observed in hairs 8-10 and 10-12 hours after death, respectively,\u201d the shortest intervals before which PMRB has been observed. <em>Id. </em>at 236. Petraco also \u201cobserved that the Q8 hairs exhibited banding patterns that are consistent with the patterns on \u2018known\u2019 hairs collected during Fusco\u2019s autopsy,\u201d and \u201cbecause hairs do not continue to develop PMRB once they are removed from the scalp, it is extremely unlikely, and probably impossible that the Q8 hairs\u2014if they really came from Fusco either before or shortly after she died\u2014would exhibit PMRB consistent with [the] degree of banding seen on the autopsy hairs taken weeks after Fusco was murdered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Finally, Dr. DeForest stated that PMRB is a recognized phenomenon in the scientific community of hair examiners, although scientists do not fully understand the mechanisms that cause it. <em>See id. </em>at 237. He concluded that, based on the degree of PMRB of the Q8 hairs, and the fact that it was \u201csimilar to the greatest degree\u201d of PMRB of Ms. Fus-co\u2019s known hairs from the autopsy\u2014the \u201cK hairs\u201d\u2014that \u201cto a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that the Q8 hairs exhibiting PMRB came from the sample of known hairs taken at the autopsy of the homicide victim, Theresa Fusco.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration omitted). He also concluded that the Q4 hair exhibited PMRB beyond a reasonable scientific certainty. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Considering Federal Rule of Evidence 702, <em>Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, </em>526 U.S. 137, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999), and <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), the district court concluded that \u201c[t]he idea that PMRB takes several days to develop (and thus that it could not have developed in the short time Ms. Fusco was alleged to be in Restivo\u2019s van) has not yet been established by scientific standards of proof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 240. The court reached this conclusion because although this theory was falsifiable, it had not been tested. Further, although the experts agreed that PMRB takes days, not hours, to develop, this hypothesis was not firmly grounded in the sparse academic literature or scientific studies on the topic. Additionally, there were two cases in the 1980s where PMRB was observed between 8-12 and 10-12 hours after death respectively, which would contradict the theory that it takes days for PMRB to develop, assuming those reports were accurate. The court concluded therefore that the experts could not testify that their conclusions regarding the timing of PMRB or the ultimate issue of whether Ms. Fusco\u2019s hairs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>were planted were sound to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">However, although the evidence did not pass muster as \u201cscientific\u201d evidence under <em>Daubert, </em>the court held that the witnesses could testify based on their \u201ctechnical or other specialized knowledge\u201d under Federal Rule of Evidence 702. <em>Id. </em>at 242-43. That is, the court reasoned, \u201cmuch of what Plaintiffs\u2019 Experts have to say is grounded in sound science, and the last leap\u2014the timing\u2014is justified by their training and experience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 243. The court found that, aside from the timing issue, the testimony on PMRB is supported by many of Daubert\u2019s indicia of reliability. The district court found that there was evidence that PMRB can be distinguished from other types of environmentally caused banding within an acceptable rate of error\u201499.5% accuracy when one person worked alone, or 100% when two examiners double checked each other\u2019s work. This was reinforced by graduate student Alison Domzal-ski\u2019s thesis, which stated that although environmental factors can cause changes to scalp hair roots, environmental banding is visually different, occurring at a different place on the hair than PMRB. Additionally, the experts\u2019 opinions were consistent with the academic literature on the topic, and PMRB, as plaintiffs\u2019 experts described it, is a generally accepted phenomenon within the forensic science community. In sum, the court concluded that \u201calthough these facts do not add up to <em>scientific </em>proof, they supply a reasonable basis for forensic experts to conclude that PMRB is an artifact of decomposition and that, consistent with the speed at which other effects of decomposition appear on a corpse, it does not appear immediately after death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Before the second trial, plaintiffs moved for reconsideration on the ground that a new peer reviewed study on PMRB, the Koch study, addressed many of the deficiencies in the literature that previously troubled the district court. In that study, FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives criminalists working at the University of Tennessee\u2019s \u201cbody farm\u201d tested approximately 24,000 hair roots from 23 human cadavers permitted to decompose in varying environmental conditions. In cadavers outside on the ground, PMRB generally did not develop until 6-10 days after death. The earliest development of PMRB in the study, which occurred in a cadaver placed in the trunk of a car in August, occurred after 4 days. Upon reconsideration, the district court found that this new evidence addressed some of its concerns about PMRB evidence, but ultimately held, \u201cYou can bring it in and testify to it, but they can\u2019t use the magical words \u2018to a degree of scientific certainty.\u2019 \u201d Appellees\u2019 Supp. App\u2019x at 440. Volpe challenges this decision on the grounds that the Koch report stated that it was unable to draw any conclusions as to the onset of PMRB. Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 44. But the Koch study merely stated that the <em>rate </em>of putrefaction versus time and temperature could not be calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">At trial, plaintiffs\u2019 experts testified regarding PMRB. Defendants raise issue with Dr. Houck\u2019s and Petraco\u2019s testimony, claiming that they violated the court\u2019s ruling that they were not to testify that their opinion was to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty. In particular, Dr. Houck, in response to a series of hypothetical questions, stated that he did not think it was possible for Ms. Fusco\u2019s hairs to have been left in Restivo\u2019s van during the rape and murder because of the presence of PMRB, and because the best evidence shows that PMRB takes on the order of days to develop. In response to defendants\u2019 concerns about Dr. Houck\u2019s testimony, the district court charged the jury, \u201cLadies and gentlemen, certain witnesses are per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>mitted to testify as experts. The Court has ruled that such expert testimony, however you deem it or however you consider it, cannot be a substitute for your own independent evaluation of the facts in this case. Moreover, the witness is not testifying to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Supp. App\u2019x at 632. Volpe also takes issue with Petraco\u2019s testimony that the presence of PMRB meant that the Q hairs could not have come from Ms. Fusco on the night she died, as well as his statement that he would testify about PMRB to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, if he were permitted to. However, he later clarified on cross-examination that he was not testifying about the timing of PMRB to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Volpe also sought to introduce evidence from an expert witness\u2014Dr. Joseph B. Kadane. Dr. Kadane, a statistician, sought to testify that (1) postmortem root banding could not be distinguished from various types of ante-mortem root banding and that (2) the academic research that had been done to that point was insufficient to establish how long it took after death for PMRB to appear. With respect to the first question, he referred to the study by Dom-zalski, referenced above. Domzalski\u2019s study cautioned that various environmental conditions can cause a type of root banding, which \u201ccould be confused\u201d with PMRB, but she noted that environmental banding appears at a different location than PMRB. <em>Kogut, </em>894 F.Supp.2d at 237. Based on Domzalski\u2019s study, Dr. Kadane sought to testify: \u201c[I]t is not unreasonable to suppose that the Q-hairs were also exposed to dirt in the van in which they were found. Since the mechanism(s) that lead to root banding is unknown, we are not in a position to determine whether the Q-hairs are pre- or post-mortem. Neither of these can be excluded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 238. On the second issue, Dr. Kadane sought to testify that plaintiffs\u2019 experts\u2019 data fails to account for crime scene and autopsy delays, and that there is no statistical evidence to support plaintiffs\u2019 experts conclusions on the timing of the development of PMRB. <em>Id. </em>With respect to Dr. Kadane, the court found that he \u201cdoes not have the relevant expertise to offer a helpful opinion at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244. Specifically, the court found that although he was an accomplished statistician, he does not have more than a passing familiarity with hair microscopy and forensic science, and he had not conducted his own statistical analysis of PMRB. <em>Id. </em>at 244-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Next, defendants contend that there was no evidence that Volpe had the ability to plant the evidence. But there was evidence that he did have such an ability. The known hairs, or K hams, taken from the autopsy were kept in a set of clearly marked envelopes labeled \u201cK\u201d and with Ms. Fusco\u2019s name, and the Q8 hairs were kept in an envelope stating \u201cvan\u201d and \u201cright front seat floor.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Supp. App\u2019x at 1659-60. There was nothing on the envelopes stating how many K hairs were in each envelope, and therefore there was no way of knowing whether any of Ms. Fusco\u2019s K hairs from the autopsy were removed from the envelope.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">The envelopes containing the K hairs and the Q hairs were unsealed, and were kept by Fraas in the same unlocked cabinet above the table in the microscope room in the Scientific Investigation Bureau (\u201cSIB\u201d). The cabinet had a sliding glass door to close it, and did not have a lock. The envelopes were neither logged in and out nor resealed every time they were taken out. Further, although there was a log where Fraas and other technicians signed in and out when they arrived and left the lab, there was no log for visitors who had to be buzzed in to the lab; thus, if someone was buzzed in there was no docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>mentation of that fact. Fraas testified that he could not recall specifically if Volpe came to the lab on March 26, but he may have- come then, or on March 27 or 28. Further, there was testimony that the door to the hair room was not always locked, so those who had access to the lab also had access to the hair room; accordingly those with access to the lab could have access to the unlocked cabinets where the Q and K hairs were kept. If a homicide detective, such as Volpe, buzzed to enter the lab, and if the person he asked for was in the lab, he would be let in without having to sign in. Depending on who greeted the homicide detective at the door, the detective would sometimes be escorted to where he was going, and sometimes would not be. According to testimony from Bird-sail, who worked in the lab as a serologist, homicide detectives were treated as trusted colleagues and were therefore generally not escorted in the lab. Further, when a homicide detective was in the lab and left, in 1984 and 1985, he would leave on his own, unescorted. And Volpe, himself, testified that he could visit the SIB at his leisure.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Finally, evidence regarding an affidavit sworn by Volpe supports the inference that Volpe may have planted the hams. On March 29, three days after the search of Restivo\u2019s van, and two days after Fraas began examining the 80 hairs recovered from Restivo\u2019s van, Volpe swore an affidavit in support of a search warrant stating, \u201cA search of [Restivo\u2019s] van has produced hair consistent with THERESA FUSCO\u2019S and possible human blood.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Supp. App\u2019x at 1556. Volpe testified that when he said \u201cpossible blood\u201d he was \u201cjust a messenger from what [he] had heard from the lab,\u201d which was that \u201cit looked like it was blood.\u201d Trial Tr. at 2573. When questioned about his statement that there was hair consistent with Ms. Fusco\u2019s, Volpe stated that the source of that information was the lab, specifically, an oral conversation with Fraas. But when asked whether the microscopic examination had been finished when they had this conversation, Volpe testified, \u201cI don\u2019t believe it was even started. I think it was just a visual, you know, look-see.\u201d Trial Tr. at 2574. Indeed, Fraas later testified that it took \u201ca significant amount of time, days to weeks, to generate a conclusion\u201d regarding the hairs.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Appellees\u2019 Supp. App\u2019x at 714. In addition, Birdsall testified that he never told Volpe that he found possible human blood and that by midnight on March 26 he had made a preliminary determination that there was no blood in the van.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">Fischer testified it would not be appropriate pursuant to minimally accepted practices for a homicide detective to swear an affidavit claiming possible human blood based on a stain, and rather that minimal practices require presumptive testing for blood, and that it would not be appropriate based on minimally accepted practices to swear out an affidavit saying \u201cpossible human blood\u201d without talking to the person who did the testing. Similarly, Fischer testified that it would not be appropriate pursuant to minimally accepted practices to report that hairs were consistent without a report from a hair examiner that compared the hairs and found them similar, and that it would not be appropriate to report hair as consistent from merely looking at the hairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">2. Verdict and Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">On April 11, 2014, following the presentation of evidence and being charged, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>jury found that Volpe, but not Fraas, unconstitutionally deprived Restivo and Hal-stead of their right to a fair trial and maliciously prosecuted them. A separate damages trial was then held, where extensive testimony was given about the effects of the incarceration on the men. The jury was instructed to determine an award that fairly compensates each plaintiff for the damages they suffered. The jury was instructed to award only compensatory damages, and only for the injuries that plaintiffs proved were proximately caused by Volpe's wrongful conduct. Further, the court instructed: \u201cAlthough defendant Volpe was found liable for two causes of action, each plaintiff is entitled to one recovery. The damages that you award must be fair compensation for all of the plaintiffs damages, no more and no less.\u201d Damages Trial Tr. at 579. On April 17, 2014, the jury awarded $18 million each to Resti-vo and Halstead.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">C. Post-Trial Issues</p>\n<p id=\"AAs\">1. Motions to Reduce the Jury Award</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Following the trial, Volpe moved to reduce the jury\u2019s damages award on several grounds, each of which was rejected by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Volpe first claimed that he was entitled to relief based on a prior settlement between plaintiffs and New York State. Before bringing suit in federal court, plaintiffs brought suit against New York State in the New York State Court of Claims pursuant to the Unjust Conviction and Imprisonment Act, New York Court of Claims Act Section 8-b. Under this law, individuals who can demonstrate that they were wrongly convicted of state crimes are entitled to compensation, regardless of whether there was any wrongdoing by a government official. Accordingly, plaintiffs sought compensation for the sixteen years they spent in jail following their convictions. Plaintiffs settled with the State for $2.2 million each. As is relevant on appeal, Volpe argued that allowing each plaintiff to keep the $18 million awarded by the jury, while also keeping the $2.2 million awarded in the State settlement, violates the rule against double recovery, and that the $18 million awards should be reduced by the amount of the settlements. The district court rejected this argument, concluding that a setoff in this case would violate federal policies underlying Section 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Volpe also argued that the damage award was excessive and moved for remit-titur. The district court considered both the federal and state standards for exces-siveness, and concluded that the award was not excessive under either standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">2. Attorneys\u2019 Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">Following the second trial and motion practice on this issue, the district court awarded plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys at the law firm Neufeld Scheck &amp; Brustin, LLP (\u201cNSB\u201d) $4,997,914.55 in fees. In assessing the reasonableness of NSB\u2019s fee application, the district court emphasized that this case has been litigated for eight years, with twenty-three separate discovery requests and fifty-four days of depositions. The first trial lasted thirty-one trial days over eleven weeks, and included the presentation of forty-two witnesses. The second trial, which both followed and was followed by extensive and complicated post-trial motions, lasted seventeen trial days, and included the presentation of forty witnesses. There was extensive expert testimony, as well as litigation over the admissibility of expert testimony, culminating in a five-day <em>Daubert </em>hearing. Based on these eight years of work, NSB requested compensation for 11,222.6 hours <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>of work.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> NSB requested that attorneys be compensated at the rates prevailing in the Southern District of New York; specifically, NSB requested attorney rates ranging from $250 an hour to $700 an hour, and paralegal rates of $125 an hour, NSB requested that, if the district court applied Eastern District rates, the court apply rates ranging from $200 to $600 an hour for attorneys, and paralegal rates of $100 an hour. Ultimately, the district court granted NSB\u2019s fee application, reimbursing NSB for 11,222.6 hours of attorney and paralegal work at the Southern District of New York rates it had proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">3. Indemnification</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Before passing away, Volpe agreed to have the County Attorney represent him. Initially, the Nassau County Police Indemnification Board determined that Volpe and all other officer-defendants were acting within the scope of their employment during the Fusco investigation and therefore were fully indemnified, and attorneys from the law firm Freeman Nooter &amp; Ginsberg were hired by the County to represent all defendants. At a March 2015 hearing, long after the second trial and the jury verdict against Volpe, the district court was alerted that Nassau County might take the position that it was not obligated to indemnify Volpe\u2019s estate. At the hearing, the district court held that \u201c[bjecause the estate and the County\u2019s interests] were aligned at trial, it was appropriate for the County and the estate to put on a joint defense. However, it appears that the interests of the County and the estate have now diverged.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Supp. App\u2019x at 1819. The district court therefore disqualified Freeman Nooter <em>&amp; </em>Ginsberg from representing Volpe\u2019s estate, based on the \u201cunwaivable direct conflict\u201d due to the law firm representing Volpe while at the same time contending that the County did not need to indemnify the estate. Appellees\u2019 Supp. App\u2019x at 1810. Thereafter, plaintiffs, the conflict counsel for the estate, and counsel for the County of Nassau entered into a binding agreement, so ordered by the district court on July 1, 2015, that the County would fully indemnify the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">I. Ruling on Rule 59(a) Motion for a New Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b591-12\">Volpe first challenges the district court\u2019s grant of Restivo and Halstead\u2019s motion for a new trial under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(a) following the defense verdict at the first trial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-13\">In general we review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 59, but where the basis of the Rule 59 motion is an erroneous jury instruction, we review the jury instructions de novo. A jury instruction is erroneous if it misleads the jury as to the correct legal standard or does not adequately inform the jury on the law. An erroneous jury instruction requires a new trial, unless the error is harmless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-14\"><em>Velez v. City of New York, </em>730 F.3d 128, 134 (2d Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-15\">Because a malicious prosecution plaintiff must show the absence of probable cause for prosecution, <em>see Torres v. Jones, </em>26 N.Y.3d 742, 47 N.E.3d 747, 760 (2016), whether the police defendants had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>probable cause to proceed with the prosecution of Restivo and Halstead was of central importance at both the first and second trials in this case. The district court\u2019s decision to grant the Rule 59(a) motion turned precisely on this point. It first held that, because Kogut\u2019s confession was inadmissible at the criminal trial against Res-tivo and Halstead, pursuant to <em>Boyd v. City of New York, </em>336 F.3d 72 (2d Cir. 2003), Volpe could not use that confession to defend against Restivo and Halstead\u2019s assertion that probable cause for the prosecution was lacking. The district court concluded that it had erred in framing the jury instructions so broadly as to imply that Kogut\u2019s confession, even if admissible at the first trial for other reasons, could, in fact, be used for this purpose. It therefore granted Restivo and Halstead\u2019s Rule 59(a) motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">We conclude that the district court\u2019s reading of our limited holding in <em>Boyd </em>was incorrect. Nevertheless, the court was correct in concluding that, in the context of this case, the instruction on probable cause at the first trial was inadequate, and in a manner implicating the fairness of that proceeding. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s ruling on an alternative ground. <em>Standard Inv. Chartered, Inc. v. Nat\u2019l. Ass\u2019n of Sec. Dealers, Inc., </em>560 F.3d 118, 126 (2d Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">As to <em>Boyd, </em>we held only that in the particular circumstances that case presented, a statement that constituted the sole evidence of probable cause and that would be inadmissible in the criminal case (from an <em>ex ante </em>perspective) did not warrant the grant of summary judgment to the civil defendants. This holding turned on an unusual set of facts in which \u201cthe only evidence the police had that could reasonably indicate that Boyd knew the [car] was stolen was his statement\u201d to the police. <em>Id, </em>at 77. Moreover, not only was the evidence tying Boyd to the crime limited, Boyd had also produced evidence to establish that his statement was inadmissible under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966)\u2014evidence which, if credited by the jury, would have shown that police understood at the time that this statement could not be used to prove a criminal case. We concluded that in these unusual circumstances, the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the defendants. In other words, <em>Boyd </em>did not hold that inadmissible evidence cannot be used in evaluating probable cause for a prosecution, but only that where the sole evidence of a defendant\u2019s guilt is a single statement that police would have understood at the time could not be used in a criminal case (a circumstance largely limited to the facts of <em>Boyd </em>itself) such evidence is not alone sufficient to defeat a malicious prosecution claim.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Kogut\u2019s confession, in contrast, was only one of several pieces of evidence that police officers, including Volpe, had before them in deciding whether the totality of the evidence was indicative of Restivo and Halstead\u2019s guilt and that a prosecution against them would succeed. <em>Cf. Walczyk v. Rio, </em>496 F.3d 139, 156 (2d Cir. 2007) (\u201c[P]robable cause ... is demonstrated ... [by] the totality of circumstances\u201d). Even if ultimately deemed inadmissible, a confession such as Kogut\u2019s, looked at <em>ex ante, </em>appeared to support the determination that Restivo and Halstead were complicit in Fusco\u2019s rape. \u201cProbable cause does not require proof sufficient to warrant a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt but merely information sufficient to support a reasonable belief that an offense has been ... committed by the suspectf ].\u201d <em>Torres, </em>47 N.E.3d at 760 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Moreover, at the time members of the police, including Volpe, made the decision to refer Restivo and Halstead for prosecution, it was not yet clear whether Kogut\u2019s confession would be admissible at their criminal ti\u00f1\u00e1is. Kogut ultimately refused to testify against Restivo and Hal-stead, and, as a result, his confession was inadmissible under <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), because to admit it would have violated Restivo and Halstead\u2019s Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause rights. <em>Id. </em>at 135-36, 88 S.Ct. 1620. If, however, Kogut had cooperated against Restivo and Halstead and testified at their trial, there would have been no Confrontation Clause problem. Thus, there is a temporal component to the analysis as well: The fact that evidence ultimately proves inadmissible does not make it irrelevant to the evaluation of probable cause at the time police are presented with it. Put differently, the fact that Kogut\u2019s confession was eventually deemed inadmissible does not undercut probable cause at the time the decision to prosecute Restivo and Hal-stead was made. <em>See Lowth v. Town of Cheektowaga, </em>82 F.3d 563, 571 (2d Cir. 1996) (holding that where the probable cause determination was made before an intervening fact came to light the analysis of a malicious prosecution claim looks back to the facts as they were known at the time the determination was made).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">The district court\u2019s erroneous interpretation of <em>Boyd </em>notwithstanding; the determination that its instructions were inadequate at the first trial was correct. In the context of that trial, Kogut\u2019s confession was not just any piece of evidence. As the district court observed, \u201cthe Kogut confession was arguably one of the central pieces of evidence in this case,\u201d'Special App\u2019x at 62, arid, as this Court recognized, due to its \u201cdevastating detail,\u201d the confession \u201cposed a clear[] danger of unfair prejudice\u201d to Restivo and Halstead. <em>Kogut, </em>789 F.3d at 44. The confession played a central role in evidentiary hearings leading up to both trials, and whether it should be admitted, with respect to whom, and for what purpose was sharply contested. Indeed, Volpe explicitly presses this point, asserting that the jury\u2019s judgment was swayed by the district judge\u2019s <em>failure </em>to admit Kogut\u2019s confession at the second trial. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 60-61 (arguing that admitting the confession \u201cwould have resulted in a defense verdict, as it did at the first trial\u201d and that the confession was \u201cvitally important to rebut Restivo and Halstead\u2019s testimonies that they were actually innocent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Given the specific and unusual context of this civil case, we can discern no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s underlying determination that its failure properly to instruct the jury as to how it should consider the Kogut confession deprived the plaintiffs here of a fair trial in the first proceeding. The district court failed to make clear, by direct instruction, that, while the jury could permissibly apply the confession directly against Kogut, it could only take Kogut\u2019s confession against Resti-vo and Halstead into account to the extent that the confession undermined specific elements of Restivo and Halstead\u2019s malicious prosecution claim.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In the absence of a clear instruction on these issues, the jury was faced with evidence of a confession indicting Restivo and Halstead whose proper use\u2014despite Restivo and Hal-stead\u2019s initial objection, <em>see Rosenfeld v. Basquiat, 78 </em>F.3d 84, 90 (2d Cir. 1996)\u2014 was never explained.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> As we have said in the past, a new trial is properly granted where \u201ctaken as a whole, the jury instructions gave a misleading impression or inadequate understanding of the law,\u201d <em>BAII Banking Corp. v. UPG, Inc., </em>985 F.2d 685, 696 (2d Cir. 1993), especially where the \u201clack of instruction undoubtedly left the jury confused\u201d about a \u201cpotentially disposi-tive\u201d issue in the case, <em>Pitasi v. Stratton Corp., </em>968 F.2d 1558, 1563 (2d Cir. 1992). In this case, and given these unusual circumstances, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in determining that a new trial was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">II. Evidentiary Rulings at the Second Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Next, Volpe challenges a number of evi-dentiary rulings at the second trial, and contends that a third trial is required. In particular, Volpe challenges (1) the district court\u2019s exclusion of several inculpatory statements by Kogut, Restivo and Hal-stead; (2) the district court\u2019s admission of plaintiffs\u2019 expert testimony on PMRB analysis; (3) the district court\u2019s exclusion of Volpe\u2019s expert Kadane who sought to testify about PMRB analysis; and (4) the district court\u2019s admission of testimony from plaintiffs\u2019 police practices expert, Fischer.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">In assessing these challenges, it is important to note that the jury found against Volpe and for Restivo and Halstead on the malicious prosecution claim and the deprivation of a fair trial claim, and that each of these claims is independently sufficient to sustain the damages award against Volpe because there was a single injury: the wrongful imprisonment.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">A. Exclusion of Inculpatory Statements by Kogut, Restivo, and Hal-stead</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">Volpe first argues that the district court denied him a fair trial by refusing to admit Kogut\u2019s confession and certain admissions allegedly made by Restivo and Halstead. To be admissible, evidence must be relevant, under Federal Rules of Evidence 401 and 402, and even relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>evidence may be excluded under Rule 408 if \u201cits probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more of the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.\u201d We apply \u201cabuse-of-discretion review to a trial court\u2019s eviden-tiary rulings.\u201d <em>Lore v. City of Syracuse, </em>670 F.3d 127, 155 (2d Cir. 2012). \u201cThe hallmark of abuse-of-discretion review is deference_\u201d <em>Id. </em>In particular, when assessing claims of relevance and undue prejudice, our review \u201cis highly deferential in recognition of the district court\u2019s superi- or position to assess relevancy and to weigh the probative value of evidence against its potential for unfair prejudice.\u201d <em>United States v. Coppola, </em>671 F.3d 220, 244 (2d Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). We will therefore only hold that the district court abused its discretion in making an evidentiary ruling where \u201cthe ruling was arbitrary and irrational.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, as noted, \u201can erroneous evidentiary ruling warrants a new trial only when a substantial right of a party is affected, as when a jury\u2019s judgment would be swayed in a material fashion by the error.\u201d <em>Lore, </em>670 F.3d at 155 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">First, Volpe challenges the fact that eight alleged statements that tend to show that Restivo and Halstead were guilty of the crimes were not admitted at the second trial. However, as Volpe himself admits, he never sought to introduce these pieces of evidence. Volpe claims that he did not offer the alleged statements or call the relevant witnesses at the second trial because the district court precluded all but the evidence admitted at the criminal trial. But Volpe misstates the court\u2019s ruling. The district court did not rule that only evidence actually admitted at the criminal trial could be admitted in this civil case; rather, the district court clearly ruled that only evidence that would have been admissible at the criminal trial, regardless whether it was actually admitted, could be admitted in the civil trial in order to prove probable cause. <em>See </em>Special App\u2019x at 60-61 (agreeing with plaintiffs\u2019 arguments that <em>\u201cBoyd </em>... assert[s] that probable cause to commence proceedings means the belief that the prosecution would succeed <em>based on admissible </em>evidence,\u201d and holding, therefore, that \u201cDefendants were limited to evidence that was both included in their interrogatory responses and admissible in Halstead and Restivo\u2019s criminal proceedings\u201d). If Volpe failed to offer evidence based on his misinterpretation of the district court\u2019s clear ruling, he has only himself to blame.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">Volpe next challenges two evidentiary rulings actually made by the district court: its exclusion of the Kogut confession and of the statement signed by Restivo, which implicated Halstead in the crime. Because the jury found for plaintiffs and against Volpe on the malicious prosecution claim and the fair trial claim, each of which is sufficient independently to sustain the jury award, we consider only whether the \u201cjury\u2019s judgment would be swayed in a material fashion by the error.\u201d <em>Arlio v. Lively, </em>474 F.3d 46, 51 (2d Cir. 2007).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">First, the district court did not err in excluding the Kogut confession from consideration with respect to the fair trial claim because the confession was not relevant to plaintiffs\u2019 claims that Volpe planted evidence and suppressed <em>Brady </em>material. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Volpe argues that the confession is relevant to the fair trial claim for two reasons. First, he contends, the confession explains how the victim\u2019s hair came to be found in Restivo\u2019s van, rebutting plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the hair was planted. But this is only the case if the confession was admitted for its truth, and it was not shown to be admissible for this purpose. Second, Volpe claims that the confession established the reasonableness of Volpe\u2019s belief that the French lead was not <em>Brady </em>material. But whether Volpe had an honestly held and even an objectively reasonable belief that plaintiffs were guilty is not relevant to the question of whether evidence was exculpatory. Moreover, Volpe himself admitted in a deposition that he believed that the French lead was <em>Brady </em>material, but he claimed that he turned it over to the district attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Finally, we consider Volpe\u2019s challenge to the exclusion of Restivo\u2019s statements made on March 5 and 6, 1985, following an overnight interrogation. At some point during the eight-hour interrogation, Restivo signed the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">I would like to say that sometime back possibly November, December 1984, I stopped by my friend Dennis Halstead\u2019s apartment. He lives above the store on Atlantic Avenue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pApZ\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">When I saw him, I realized that he was also high. We were talking about 10 to 15 minutes and at this point and kind of out of the blue Dennis started to talk strange.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">He started talking about a broad. Dennis said he was with a broad, a girl, and that he was either by a cemet[e]ry, in a cemet[e]ry, across from the cemet[e]ry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Afe\">He said he tried to fuck her. Then he had to fuck her up. But when he said that, he didn\u2019t tell me how he fucked her up. He then told me that he strangled her and killed her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">Appellees\u2019 Supp. App\u2019x at 270. As with the Kogut confession, this statement might have some relevance to the hair-planting claim if the jury were permitted to consider the statement by Restivo for its truth. That is, if the jury were to consider this statement for the truth of whether Hal-stead committed the crime, the statement might be relevant in determining whether the hairs allegedly found in Restivo\u2019s van were planted. However, the jury was not permitted to consider the statement for the truth of whether Halstead was guilty. The fact that Restivo made this statement was admissible against him, as a statement by a party opponent under Rule 801(d)(2)(A). But there is a second level of hearsay incorporated into this statement\u2014 the statements that Restivo attributed to Halstead.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> No exception to the hearsay rule was shown to apply that would permit admitting this evidence for its truth against Restivo, and the jury could therefore not consider the statements attributed to Halstead for this purpose.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The same applies for Halstead himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">B. Expert Witness Rulings</p>\n<p id=\"b596-12\">Volpe next challenges several rulings by the district court on testimony of expert witnesses, specifically (1) the district court\u2019s admission of plaintiffs\u2019 expert testimony on post-mortem root banding (\u201cPMRB\u201d) analysis, (2) its exclusion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>proposed PMRB defense expert, and (3) its admission of testimony from plaintiffs\u2019 police practices expert, Fischer.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">1. Admission of Plaintiffs\u2019 Expert Testimony on PMRB Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">As noted, the only physical evidence linking plaintiffs to the crime were the Q hairs that were allegedly recovered during a search of Restivo\u2019s blue van on March 26,1986, almost five months after the murder. At trial, plaintiffs\u2019 experts testified that the presence of PMRB, as well as the extent of the PMRB in the hairs, indicated that the Q hairs were hairs taken from Ms. Fusco during her autopsy and then placed in an envelope containing hairs found in Restivo\u2019s van. Volpe raises two challenges with respect to plaintiffs\u2019 experts\u2019 PMRB testimony. First, he argues, because the court found that the timing of PMRB had not been established to a degree of scientific certainty, the court was not permitted to compromise and allow the evidence to come in so long as the experts did not testify to a degree of scientific certainty. Second, Volpe claims that two of the experts\u2014Dr. Houck and Petraco\u2014did not comply with the limitation set by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">The same abuse-of-discretion standard of review applies to rulings on \u201cthe admissibility of expert testimony.\u201d Lore, 670 F.3d at 165. Again, this is a highly deferential standard, and \u201ca ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony \u2018is to be sustained unless manifestly erroneous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Salem v.

We disagree. Rule 702 \u201cmakes no relevant distinction between \u2018scientific\u2019 knowledge and \u2018technical\u2019 or \u2018other specialized\u2019 knowledge,\u201d and \u201cmakes clear that any such knowledge might become the subject of expert testimony.\u201d <em>Kumho Tire Co., </em>526 U.S. at 147, 119 S.Ct. 1167. There is no basis in the rule or in our case law to suggest that a scientist whose testimony could not pass muster under <em>Daubert </em>as \u201cscientific knowledge\u201d could not testify to their technical or other specialized knowledge, so long as that testimony was reliable under Rule 702 and <em>Kumho. </em>\u201cExperts of all kinds tie observations to conclusions through the use of what Judge Learned Hand called \u2018general truths derived from ... specialized experience.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 148, 119 S.Ct. 1167 (quoting Learned Hand, <em>Historical and Practical Considerations Regarding Expert Testimony, </em>15 Harv. L. Rev. 40, 54 (1901)). And, just as non-scientist experts can testify about their opinions, so too can scientists, when their opinions are based on reliable technical or specialized knowledge, though not scientific fact. As explained in <em>In re Ephedra Products Liability Litigation, </em>393 F.Supp.2d 181 (S.D.N.Y. 2005), \u201c[t]he Court in <em>Kumho Tire </em>rejected the view that Rule 702 sets a <em>lower </em>standard for witnesses with \u2018technical or other specialized knowledge\u2019 than for scientists. But its reasoning cuts both ways: if art appraisers, handwriting experts or economists may express professional opinions that fall short of definitive proof, so may scientists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 188; <em>see also id. </em>at 190 (reasoning that <em>Daubert </em>was \u201cnever intended to keep from the jury the kind of evidence scientists regularly rely on in forming opinions of causality simply because such evidence is not definitive,\u201d and holding that \u201cRule 702, a rule of threshold admissibility, should not be transformed into a rule for imposing a more exacting standard of causality than more-probable-than-not simply because scientific issues are involved\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Thus, if a scientist wants to testify to an opinion or conclusion that has not been established to a degree of scientific certainty under <em>Daubert, </em>the court may admit the testimony as non-scientific expert testimony under Rule 702 and <em>Kumho Tire. </em>That is, the court must still assess whether the expert employs \u201cthe same level of intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert in the relevant field,\u201d <em>Kumho Tire Co., </em>526 U.S. at 152, 119 S.Ct. 1167, and may consider the <em>Dau-bert </em>factors in making this determination or other relevant factors, <em>id. </em>at 141-42,119 S.Ct. 1167. In particular, we have held that a \u201ctrial judge should exclude expert testimony if it is speculative or conjectural or based on assumptions that are so unrealistic and contradictory as to suggest bad faith or to be in essence an apples and oranges comparison.\u201d <em>Zerega Ave. Realty Carp. v. Hornbeck Offshore Transp., LLC, </em>571 F.3d 206, 214 (2d Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).

U.S. Suzuki Motor Carp., </em>73 F.3d 18, 21 (2d Cir. 1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). Additionally, the district court may consider the gap between the data and the conclusion drawn by the expert from that data, and exclude opinion evidence where the court \u201cconcludefs] that there is simply too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion proffered.\u201d <em>Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, </em>522 U.S. 136, 146, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997). Frequently, though, \u201cgaps or inconsistencies in the reasoning leading to [the expert\u2019s] opinion ... go to the weight of the evidence, not to its admissibility.\u201d <em>Campbell ex rel. Campbell v. Metro. Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>239 F.3d 179, 186 (2d Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">With that background, we turn to the question whether the district court abused its discretion in admitting plaintiffs\u2019 experts\u2019 testimony, while prohibiting those experts from testifying to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty. The district court, having found that the timing of PMRB was not scientifically established, applied the <em>Daubert </em>factors and found that they overall supported the admissibility of plaintiffs\u2019 experts\u2019 testimony. The district court found that there was evidence that PMRB can be distinguished from other types of environmentally caused banding within an acceptable rate of error\u201499.5% accuracy when one person worked alone, or 100% when two examiners double checked each other\u2019s work. <em>See Kogut, </em>894 F.Supp.2d at 235. This was reinforced by Domzalski\u2019s thesis, which stated that although environmental factors can cause changes to scalp hair roots, environmental banding is visually different, occurring at a different place on the hair than PMRB. <em>Id. </em>Additionally, the experts\u2019 opinions were consistent with the academic literature on the topic, and PMRB, as plaintiffs\u2019 experts described it, is a generally accepted phenomenon within the forensic science community. <em>Id. </em>In sum, the court concluded that \u201calthough these facts do not add up to <em>scientific </em>proof, they supply a reasonable basis for forensic experts to conclude that PMRB is an artifact of decomposition and that, consistent with the speed at which other effects of decomposition appear on a corpse, it does not appear immediately after death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244. The district court, before the second trial, also considered the Koch study, which, as noted, involved a test of roughly 24,000 hair roots from 23 human cadavers permitted to decompose in varying environmental conditions. In cadavers outside on the ground, PMRB generally did not develop until 6-10 days after death. The earliest development of PMRB in the study, which occurred in a cadaver placed in the trunk of a car in August, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>occurred after 4 days. Based on this evidence, we find no abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion in holding that this evidence was sufficiently reliable to be admitted, and the analytical gaps in the reasoning of Plaintiffs\u2019 experts were not too great.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Finally, we find no reversible error with respect to Volpe\u2019s claims that Dr. Houck and Petraco violated the court\u2019s instruction not to state that their testimony was to a degree of scientific certainty. To the extent that Dr. Houck or Petraco violated this instruction, any error was harmless. With respect to Dr. Houck, the district court gave an instruction that he was not testifying to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, and Petraco testified on cross-examination that he was not testifying to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty. Finally, to the extent that Volpe\u2019s argument on appeal turns on the fact that these experts testified to their opinion on an ultimate issue, that is, whether the hairs were planted, Federal Rule of Evidence 704(a) instructs that \u201c[a]n opinion is not objectionable just because it embraces an ultimate issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">2. Exclusion of Defense Expert on PMRB</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Volpe next claims that the district court incorrectly precluded him from introducing testimony from his proposed expert, Dr. Joseph B. Kadane. Dr. Kadane, a statistician, sought to testify that (1) post-mortem root banding could not be distinguished from various types of ante-mortem root banding and that (2) the academic research that had been done to that point was insufficient to establish how long it took after death for PMRB to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">With respect to the first point, Dr. Kadane referred to the Domzalski study, which found that various environmental conditions could cause root banding that \u201ccould be confused\u201d with PMRB, although environmental banding appeared nearer to the root of the hair than PMRB. Kogut, 894 F.Supp.2d at 287. Based on this study, Kadane sought to testify that it cannot be determined whether the Q hairs were removed post-mortem or ante-mortem. <em>Id. </em>at 237-38. The district court correctly excluded this line of testimony. Reasoning that \u201c[a]lthough there is no dispute that Ka-dane is an accomplished statistician, it is equally beyond debate that he lacks more than a passing familiarity with hair microscopy and forensic science,\u201d the court found him not equipped to testify about this matter. <em>Id. </em>at 244. The question whether experts can distinguish between ante- and post-mortem root banding is a topic clearly outside Dr. Kadane\u2019s area of expertise. <em>See Kmnho Tire Co., </em>526 U.S. at 149, 119 S.Ct. 1167 (requiring the district court to determine \u201cwhether the testimony has a reliable basis in the knowledge and experience of the relevant discipline\u201d (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted)). Further, this opinion was not based on \u201csufficient facts or data,\u201d Fed. R, Evid. 702(b), as it was based only on an article that stated that the existence of post-mortem root banding is well-documented in the literature and found that ante- and postmortem root banding were visibly different, indicating that trained experts could distinguish the different types of banding. Motion to Strike, <em>Kogut v. Cty. Of Nassau, </em>No. 06-CV-6695 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 30, 2012), EOF No. 205, Ex. G\u201e at 16 (discussing PMRB); <em>id. </em>at 49 (\u201c[S]ome of the patterns that arose from environmental exposure appeared similar to those encountered in postmortem samples, which has very important forensic implications for interpretation of hair evidence. While these patterns, arising from environmental exposure, could be confused for postmortem root bands, it is important to point out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>that the root bands that appeared in this study were very proximal to the anagen root end. This is not an accepted criterion for postmortem root banding.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 54-55 (\u201cIn this study, some hairs produced patterns that could have been construed as postmortem root changes. One should bear in mind that banding patterns in postmortem hair roots appear more distal to the anagen root end as opposed to the banding patterns in the environmentally exposed hairs, which appeared proximal to the ana-gen root end.\u201d).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">With respect to the second proposed area of testimony, Dr. Kadane sought to testify about experimental flaws in the research relied on by plaintiffs\u2019 experts. In particular, Dr. Kadane listed factors that were not accounted for in the studies relied on by plaintiffs\u2019 experts. The district court again held that Kadane\u2019s \u201cexpertise is simply not useful in attempting to refute Plaintiffs\u2019 Experts\u2019 opinions about PMRB,\u201d reasoning that Dr. Kadane \u201cwas free to conduct his own statistical analysis of PMRB but did not do so.\u201d Special App\u2019x at 40. Even assuming, <em>ar-guendo, that </em>the district court abused its discretion in excluding Dr. Kadane from testifying about experimental flaws and the value of the data on which plaintiffs\u2019 experts relied, any error was harmless. Dr. Kadane sought only to critique the testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 expert witnesses, and Volpe was able to effectively cross-examine plaintiffs\u2019 experts based on the statistical issues raised by Dr. Kadane. <em>See Beck Chevrolet Co. v. Gen. Motors LLC, </em>787 F.3d 663, 680 (2d Cir.) (holding that any error was harmless where an expert report was excluded but counsel cross-examined the opposing expert about the topics contained in the report), <em>certified question on an unrelated issue accepted, </em>25 N.Y.3d 1057, 33 N.E.3d 496 (2015), <em>and certified question answered, </em>27 N.Y.3d 379, 53 N.E.3d 706 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">3. Police Practices Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">Finally, Volpe claims that the district court abused its discretion in admitting certain testimony from plaintiffs\u2019 police practices expert, Russell Fischer. First, Volpe claims that Fischer misinformed the jury about the relevant legal <em>Brady </em>standard that was in place during the time of the investigation.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Second, Volpe argues that Fischer was improperly permitted to define materiality and opine on the materiality of the French lead. Third, Volpe argues that Fischer should not have been permitted to testify about the words \u201cpossible human blood\u201d and \u201chair consistent with\u201d because those terms have no special law enforcement meaning. Finally, Volpe argues that Fischer should not have been permitted to testify about the effects of lengthy police interrogation on reliability because this was a veiled attack on the credibility of Cockerel, which was the province of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">First, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Fischer\u2019s testimony with respect to <em>Brady </em>and the materiality of the French lead. Contrary to Volpe\u2019s assertions, Fischer did not testify to the legal <em>Brady </em>standard or define materiality. Rather, he testified to minimally accepted police practices, \u201ca baseline type <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>of behavior or protocols that law enforcement officers follow.\u201d Trial Tr. at 1776. He testified only about what minimally accepted police practices required and about his opinion that Volpe\u2019s conduct departed from accepted police practices. \u201cWhen an expert offers an opinion relevant to applying a legal standard such as probable cause [or <em>Brady], </em>the expert\u2019s role is limited to describing sound professional standards and identifying departures from them,\u201d <em>Jimenez v. City of Chicago, </em>732 F.3d 710, 721 (7th Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted), which is precisely what Fischer did in this case. This expert testimony on applicable professional standards is relevant because it \u201ccan give a jury a baseline to help evaluate whether a defendant\u2019s deviations from those standards were merely negligent or were so severe or persistent as to support an inference of intentional or reckless conduct that violated a plaintiffs constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 721-22. It is true that Fischer\u2019s \u201copinions had direct implications for applying legal standards,\u201d but that is exactly \u201cwhy his testimony was relevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 721. The court correctly limited Fischer\u2019s testimony to professional practices and departures in this case, and Fischer did not stray from these bounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Volpe\u2019s claim that Fischer should not have been permitted to define \u201cpossible human blood\u201d and \u201chair consistent with\u201d similarly lacks merit. Experts are permitted to testify about \u201ccustom and usage\u201d of terms in particular industries. <em>See SR Int'l Bus. Ins. Co. v. World Trade Ctr. Props., LLC, </em>467 F.3d 107, 134 (2d Cir. 2006). If, as Volpe claims, those terms have no special law enforcement meaning, then Volpe should have introduced testimony to that effect, expert or otherwise. That does not render Fischer\u2019s testimony inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Finally, Fischer testified about potential risks inherent in long interrogations, and testified that if a witness\u2019s story changed over time, under minimally accepted police practices, an officer should record the changes and corroborate the statements. Volpe challenges this testimony as going to witness credibility. But, testimony about appropriate responses to inconsistencies in a witness\u2019s story is permissible where that testimony is introduced to inform the jury \u201cwhat a reasonable police investigator ... [does] when presented with ... conflicting and/or inculpatory statements during [a] murder investigation.\u201d <em>Jimenez, </em>732 F.3d at 723. Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision to admit Fischer\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">III. Conflict of Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">Next, Volpe argues that a conflict of interest deprived him of a fair trial. In particular he claims that because counsel represented both Volpe and Fraas, counsel did not argue that, if anyone planted the hair evidence, it was Fraas. Volpe also claims that there was a second conflict because counsel also represented the county, which had agreed to indemnify both Volpe and Fraas, and thus preferred the argument that no evidence was planted, rather than the argument that Fraas and not Volpe planted evidence. Volpe argues that this prejudiced him at trial and that this prejudice is not remedied by Nassau County indemnifying him because the county could again deny indemnification and because Volpe\u2019s family has an interest in restoring his reputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">Volpe relies primarily on <em>Dunton v. Suffolk County, </em>729 F.2d 903 (2d Cir. 1984), <em>amended on other grounds, </em>748 F.2d 69 (2d Cir. 1984), for this argument. In <em>Dun-ton, </em>a Suffolk County police officer defendant, Officer Pfeiffer, allegedly assaulted the plaintiff, Dunton, after the plaintiff allegedly made improper advances toward Officer Pfeiffer\u2019s wife. <em>See id. </em>at 905. Dun-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>ton brought suit against Officer Pfeiffer, his wife, and Suffolk County. Under local law, Suffolk County provides for representation of employees sued under Section 1983. The county attorney\u2019s answer to Dunton\u2019s complaint raised the affirmative defense that Officer Pfeiffer was \u201cacting in good faith pursuant to his official duties and responsibilities,\u201d but at trial, the county attorney\u2019s theory of the case was that Officer Pfeiffer was acting as an \u201cirate husband rather than a police officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 906 (internal quotation marks omitted). The county attorney\u2019s position at trial was therefore against Officer Pfeiffer\u2019s interest. \u201cSpecifically, Officer Pfeiffer claim[ed] that it was in his interest to assert his immunity from section 1983 liability based on good faith actions within the scope of his employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 907. By contrast, the attorney undermined the good faith immunity defense by repeatedly stating that Pfeiffer acted not as a police officer but as an irate husband, a defense that would help the county escape liability. Thus, at trial a serious conflict actually surfaced \u201cwhen the County Attorney stated that Pfeiffer was not acting under color of state law but rather as an \u2018irate husband.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 907. Our Court reasoned,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Auz9\">As soon as the County Attorney began to undermine Officer Pfeiffer\u2019s good faith immunity defense by stating that Pfeiffer acted as an \u201cirate husband\u201d and not as a police officer, he was not only failing to act as a conscientious advocate for Pfeiffer, but was acting against Pfeif-fer\u2019s interest. The seriousness of this conflict made disqualification appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 908. Further, this conflict was prejudicial because the jury did not consider Officer Pfeiffer\u2019s good faith defense and the county indemnified Officer Pfeiffer only for compensatory damages, not punitive damages, and \u201c[i]f the jury found that Pfeiffer was acting in good faith as a police officer, it might not have awarded punitive damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">We find no actual and serious conflict requiring a new trial here. First, the \u201cparticular conflict cited in <em>Dunton </em>as inherent in Section 1983 actions against municipalities, namely that the municipality can escape liability by arguing that its employees were not acting within the scope of official employment while the employee can escape liability by arguing the opposite, is simply not present here.\u201d <em>Patterson v. Balsamico, </em>440 F.3d 104, 115 (2d Cir. 2006). Unlike in <em>Dunton, </em>in this case the County was not a party at trial facing a <em>Monell </em>claim, and thus would not benefit from the argument that Volpe was acting outside the scope of his employment. Further, prior to trial, Nassau County had taken the position that it was fully indemnifying Volpe, and there was no indication that it might not until after the trial ended. At trial, therefore, the County and Volpe\u2019s interests aligned. Unlike in <em>Dunton </em>where counsel argued a theory that benefited one defendant and harmed another, counsel\u2019s defense theory\u2014that there was no suppression of exculpatory evidence or planting of evidence\u2014was a unified theory of defense benefitting Volpe, Fraas, and the indemnitor, the County. Finally, we find unpersuasive Volpe\u2019s argument that an un-conflicted attorney would have pointed the finger at Fraas and that this necessitates a new trial. Indeed, defense counsel argued that, if someone had planted the hair, it could not have been Volpe, as he lacked the necessary access to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">IV. Setoff</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">We now turn to issues related to the jury\u2019s damages award. Restivo and Hal-stead each received $2.2 million in compensation in a settlement with New York State pursuant to New York Court of Claims Act Section 8-b, which provides for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>compensation by the State upon a showing of wrongful conviction without proof of wrongdoing by any government official. Volpe argues that the jury\u2019s damages award should be set off by the amount received in the State settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">As to Restivo and Halstead\u2019s recovery on Section 1983 claims, we first must decide what law to apply in deciding whether a setoff is available.

Apartments &amp; Homes of N.J., Inc., </em>646 F.2d 101, 110 (3d Cir. 1981) (holding in a Fair Housing Act and Section 1982 case, that, under the federal common law, \u201cwhere one or more defendants have settled with a plaintiff, the damages recoverable by that plaintiff shall be reduced by the amount of the settlement received\u201d), <em>with Dobson, </em>705 F.2d at 768 (holding, in a Section 1983 case, that a settlement by one tortfeasor has no effect on the liability of another, with \u201ceach non-settling tortfeasor\u201d being responsible for a \u201cproportional share of the damages\u201d); <em>see also Dobson, </em>705 F.2d at 762 (finding federal law deficient on this issue); <em>Johnson v. Rogers, </em>621 F.2d 300, 304 n.6 (8th Cir. 1980) (\u201cIn the instant case, as federal law does not answer the question of the effect of a plaintiffs settlement with one defendant on an award of damages against a non-settling defendant, state law should serve as the federal rule of decision unless inconsistent with the policies underlying a [Section] 1983 cause of action.\u201d); <em>Mason v. City of New York, </em>949 F.Supp. 1068, 1077-78 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (finding federal law deficient due to inconsistent pronouncements); <em>Hoffman v. McNamara, </em>688 F.Supp. 830, 833 (D. Conn. 1988) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>The dissent, in contrast, concludes that federal law is not deficient because some federal caselaw suggests that setoff is appropriate in the context of certain Section 1983 actions. We disagree with the dissent, and continue to find federal law is deficient and inapplicable, for three basic reasons: (1) federal caselaw makes clear that the State of New York is not a proper defendant in a Section 1983 action and, therefore, whether and for what amount the State of New York has settled claims with the Section 1983 plaintiffs is irrelevant with respect to other defendants\u2019 liability for plaintiffs\u2019 Section 1983 claims; (2) no federal caselaw suggests that setoff is appropriate where a settling party\u2019s liability is never considered at trial by a jury; and (3) federal caselaw prohibiting double recovery is inapplicable where no total amount of loss can be ascertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">First, it is axiomatic that a state is not a proper defendant in an action brought pursuant to Section 1983. <em>Will v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989) (holding that a \u201cState\u201d is not a \u201cperson under [Section 1983]\u201d). At trial, the jury awarded Restivo and Halstead $18 million each from Volpe pursuant to Section 1983. Supp. App\u2019x at 1528. None of that amount could even theoretically have been attributable to the State of New York, whether or not the State of New York had previously settled, because the State of New York is not a proper party under Section 1983. The dissent\u2019s reliance on cases that address setoff in situations where the settling party could have been held liable under the same theory or theories of liability as those considered at trial are therefore wholly inapposite to the situation here.</p>\n<p id=\"Ant\">Second, none of the cases to which the dissent points address the issue of settlement before trial of a party in a Section 1983 action where the liability of the settling party is then never considered by the jury at trial. This distinction is crucial\u2014 the settling defendant, here the State of New York, was never included in the charge to the jury as a liable defendant. <em>See </em>Supp. App\u2019x at 1332-33. This is in no small part because the State of New York is not a proper defendant in a Section 1983 action. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the State was a proper party vis \u00e1 vis the claims on which the jury rendered its damages award, however, federal law would still be deficient here. This is because New York Court of Claims Act Section 8-b, under which the State of New York settled, has no fault requirement. Plaintiffs\u2019 Section 8-b action did not turn on a wrongful or malicious conviction (as would be required for a finding of liability under Section 1983), but simply on an incorrect one. The State, therefore, never admitted liability and so could not have been found liable by the jury unless it had been included as a defendant, which it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">The absence of the State of New York from the instant action at any phase of the case, as well as the inability of the State to be held liable under plaintiffs\u2019 asserted causes of action, also distinguishes the instant case from <em>McDermott, Inc. v. Am-Clyde, </em>511 U.S. 202, 205-06, 114 S.Ct. 1461, 128 L.Ed.2d 148 (1994) on which the dissent relies. In <em>McDermott, </em>the jury considered the fault of and apportioned damages between all parties to the action, including the petitioner and a group of defendants with which the petitioner had already settled, who had all been sued under the same causes of action. <em>Id. </em>Here, in contrast, the jury never considered what fault, if any, it might have attributed to the State. This is in part because the State could not have been held liable under the causes of action presented to the jury, and in part because the liability-phase jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>verdict sheet in the instant trial shows that <em>only </em>the liability of Volpe and Fraas was considered by the jury, not the liability of either the State of New York or of Nassau County (which would have been a proper defendant). <em>See </em>Supp. App\u2019x at 1332-33. Further, once the jury had found at the liability phase that only Volpe was hable to Restivo and Halstead, then, at the damages phase, all that the jury considered was the amount of damages that <em>Volpe, as an individual, </em>owed to Restivo and Halstead as a result of their eighteen-year incarceration. <em>See </em>Supp. App\u2019x at 1528. Thus, the dissent\u2019s background rule of no double recovery for Section 1983 and state-law claims arising out of the same operative facts, or even the rule that defendants\u2019 share of damages may be reduced by those of settling defendants, has no application to the instant facts where the settling party was not a proper defendant under Section 1983, never admitted liability, and was wholly absent from the trial. On this issue, federal law is deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Third and lastly, the dissent also posits that federal common law barring double recovery in order to ensure that the victim does not receive more than he or she lost is applicable here. <em>See United States v. Nucci, </em>364 F.3d 419, 423 (2d Cir. 2004). We disagree. <em>Nucci, </em>emblematic of this line of cases, based its holding in part on the observation that the \u201ceffect of joint liability in a tort context is to excuse one defendant from paying any portion of the judgment if the plaintiff collects the full amount from the other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). This holding, however, is based on the premise that there is a known \u201cfull amount\u201d of loss to be reimbursed through restitution. There is no known full amount of loss here. The jury\u2019s determination that Volpe owed Restivo and Halstead each $18 million is not the same as finding that the total amount of damages that Restivo and Halstead were owed for the eighteen years each spent in prison was $18 million. Instead, the jury could have determined that that was the amount which <em>Volpe alone </em>owed each man <em>under Section 1983. </em>Since there is no way to know the amount of Restivo and Hal-stead\u2019s \u201closs,\u201d it is inappropriate to apply rules ensuring an individual does not recover in tort or after a criminal case more than he \u201clost\u201d where one defendant is neither included in the trial nor could be held liable under the same cause of action as the one on which the jury based its damages award.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Accordingly, we hold that federal law is deficient with respect to a scenario in which an absent settling party settles a claim distinct from the claim which is sent to the jury, the jury was never asked to consider or determine the liability of the absent settling party, and the full amount of loss is unknowable.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">Finding federal law deficient on this point, we turn to New York state law and the question whether New York law is inconsistent with federal policy underlying Section 1983. <em>See Robertson, </em>436 U.S. at 590, 98 S.Ct. 1991 (\u201cIn resolving questions of inconsistency between state and federal law raised under [Section] 1988, courts must look not only at particular federal statutes and constitutional provisions, but also at \u2018the policies expressed in [them].\u2019 \u201d (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc., </em>396 U.S. 229, 240, 90 S.Ct. 400, 24 L.Ed.2d 386 (1969))). New York General Obligations Law Section 15-108 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">When a release or a covenant not to sue or not to enforce a judgment is given to one of two or more persons liable or claimed to be liable in tort for the same injury, or the same wrongful death, it does not discharge any of the other tort-feasors from liability for the injury or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>wrongful death unless its terms expressly so provide, but it reduces the claim of the releasor against the other tortfea-sors to the extent of any amount stipulated by the release or the covenant, or in the amount of the consideration paid for it, or in the amount of the released tortfeasor\u2019s equitable share of the damages under article fourteen of the civil practice law and rules, whichever is the greatest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">N.Y.

Brenner, </em>40 F.3d 527, 532 (2d Cir. 1994) (\u201cThe goal of [Section] 1983 is to deter public officials from violating citizens\u2019 federal rights and to compensate victims of such official wrongdoing.\u201d); <em>Dobson, </em>705 F.2d at 765 (\u201cSection 1983 ... embodies two policies: compensation of plaintiffs and deterrence of wrongdoers.\u201d). The deterrence goal of Section 1983 is best served by \u201cinternalizing to the violator the costs of violating federal rights.\u201d <em>Dobson, </em>705 F.2d at 765; <em>see also Ciraolo, </em>216 F.3d at 243 (Calabre-si, <em>J., </em>concurring) (discussing the importance of a wrongdoer internalizing the costs of his conduct to effectively deter future conduct). Moreover, \u201c[a] rule that removes the burden of damages from the wrongdoer certainly conflicts with the policy of deterrence.\u201d <em>Dobson, </em>704 F.2d at 766.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">By contrast, New York General Obligation Law Section 15-108(a) has \u201ctwo purposes: first, to encourage settlements, and, second, to ensure that nonsettling tortfeasors are not required to bear more than their equitable share of liability.\u201d <em>Apple v. Jewish Hosp. &amp; Med. Ctr., </em>829 F.2d 326, 331 (2d Cir. 1987) (citation omitted). \u201cAt its most basic level, the driving force embodied in G.O.L. [Section] 15-108 is that of ensuring the compensation of victims while preventing their unjust enrichment.\u201d <em>Banks, </em>177 F.Supp.2d at 260. \u201c[T]he statute, in the interest of minimiz<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>ing the potential for over-compensation, fosters equitable, financial and judicial economy policies that appear to convey more solicitude towards fairness to the nonsettling tortfeasor than to the injured party.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">The New York rule is inconsistent with the deterrent goal of Section 1983, as it allows nonsettling tortfeasors to bear less than the full cost of the harm they inflicted if settling tortfeasors settle for more than their proportional share of liability. \u201cA rule that removes the burden of damages from the wrongdoer certainly conflicts with the policy of deterrence,\u201d and \u201c[w]e must always be conscious that one of the functions of section 1983, if not the primary function, is therapeutic, seeking to eradicate the disease of violations of federal rights under color of state law.\u201d <em>Dobson, </em>705 F,2d at 766. The district court was therefore correct in not applying the New York rule in determining whether Volpe was entitled to a setoff. <em>See id. </em>(holding that a pro tanto setoff provision under state law \u201cwould contravene the deterrence policy of section 1983, and thus is impermissible under section 1988\u201d); <em>Banks, </em>177 F.Supp.2d at 261 (holding that G.O.L. Section 15-108 is inconsistent with federal policy because it \u201callow[s] the nonsettling wrongdoer full credit for the amount others paid, thereby entirely relieving him from any obligation to compensate the extent of the injuries he caused\u201d and \u201ceffectuate[s] a windfall to the defendant\u201d \u201cin the name of avoiding unjust enrichment for the plaintiff\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Having concluded that state law is inconsistent with federal policy, we now assess whether the district court was correct in applying a policy of proportional reduction based on the nonsettling party\u2019s proportionate share of liability. \u201cElemental notions of fairness dictate that one who causes a loss should bear the loss.\u201d <em>Owen v. City of Independence, </em>445 U.S. 622, 654, 100 S.Ct. 1398, 63 L.Ed.2d 673 (1980); <em>see also Dobson, </em>705 F.2d at 769 (\u201cThe fairness of a tortfeasor paying an injured party rests not solely on the fact that the injured party deserves compensation, but also on the fact that the tortfeasor deserves to pay.\u201d). It follows therefore, that a nonsettling party is entitled to a setoff only of a settling tortfeasor\u2019s proportionate fault. <em>See McDermott, </em>511 U.S. at 204,114 S.Ct. 1461 (holding, under federal common law in admiralty suit, that the liability of the nonsettling defendants should be calculated with reference to the jury\u2019s allocation of proportionate responsibility, not a dollar for dollar setoff); <em>Dobson, </em>705 F.2d at 767; <em>Banks, </em>177 F.Supp.2d at 263-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">This then leads to the question whether Volpe is entitled to a proportionate reduction. \u201cUnder the proportionate share approach, the allocation will take place at trial.\u201d <em>McDermott, </em>511 U.S. at 217, 114 S.Ct. 1461. That is, the jury is to decide the relative faults of the tortfeasors. The State has never been found to have been at fault, as it was sued under and settled pursuant to a state law that provided for compensation without any showing of fault by the State. <em>See </em>N.Y. Ct. of Claims Act \u00a7 8-b (providing for compensation by the State upon a showing that the plaintiff was incarcerated for a state crime, was innocent, and did not, through his own conduct, cause the conviction). Further, Volpe did not seek to introduce evidence tending to show that the State bore a share of the responsibility for plaintiffs\u2019 incarceration, nor did he request an instruction that the jury should determine the State\u2019s proportionate share of liability or consider the effect of a prior settlement when determining damages.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> For these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>reasons, there is no basis for applying a setoff to the damages awarded on Restivo and Halstead\u2019s Section 1983 claims. Further, even if a setoff were available as to the state law claims, Restivo and Halstead are entitled to the full jury award, because \u201cwhere only a single award of damages, not segregated into separate components, is made, the ... rule ... is that the successful plaintiff be paid under the theory of liability that provides the most complete recovery.\u201d <em>Magee v. U.S. Lines, Inc., </em>976 F.2d 821, 822 (2d Cir. 1992). The district court therefore correctly denied Volpe\u2019s request for a setoff.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">V. Remittitur Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Volpe next argues that the jury award was excessive. Following the trial, the district court denied Volpe\u2019s motion for remittitur, reasoning that the award was reasonable under either the federal standard or the state standard. The federal standard provides that \u201cwe may set aside a jury\u2019s award only if it is so high as to shock the judicial conscience and constitute a denial of justice.\u201d <em>Zeno v. Pine Plains Cent. Sch. Dist., </em>702 F.3d 655, 671 (2d Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). By contrast, New York state law provides that an appellate court \u201cshall determine that an award is excessive or inadequate if it deviates materially from what would be reasonable compensation.\u201d N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 5501(c). Although a federal district court sitting in diversity considering a jury award for a claim under New York law must apply the state law standard of review, <em>see Gasperini v. Ctr. for Humanities, Inc., </em>518 U.S. 415, 437-38, 116 S.Ct. 2211, 135 L.Ed.2d 659 (1996), district courts within this circuit have differed in their approach for reviewing jury awards based on both state law and federal law claims. <em>Compare, e.g., Abel v. Tomi Sports Int'l, LLC, </em>No. 09 Civ. 10388, 2012 WL 6720919, at *14 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 18, 2012) (\u201cAs the jury in this case made its award under both federal and state law, and as the successful plaintiff should be paid under the theory of liability that provides the most complete recovery, the Court reviews the award under the federal standard.\u201d (citations, alteration, and internal quotation marks omitted)), <em>with Mason v. City of New York, </em>949 F.Supp. 1068, 1075 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (\u201cBecause the jury awarded lump sum damages encompassing both the federal and state claims, the Court must determine excessiveness under both federal and state law.\u201d). Because the result is the same whether we apply the state standard or the federal standard, we need not decide this issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">\u201cWe have long held that, when damages are awarded, calculation of damages is the province of the jury.\u201d <em>Zeno, </em>702 F.3d at 671 (internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, \u201cin reviewing damages awards, we accord considerable deference to the factual findings of both judge and jury. Although a review of comparable cases is appropriate, we need not average the high and low awards; we focus instead on whether the verdict lies within the reasonable range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation, alterations, and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThis Court\u2019s function upon review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>district court\u2019s decision is limited to determining whether the district court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Patterson, </em>440 F.3d at 119-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">The district court here plainly did not abuse its discretion in holding that the amount awarded, $1 million per year of wrongful incarceration per plaintiff, neither shocks the conscience nor materially deviates from reasonable compensation. Indeed, the jury award is in line with other approved awards in wrongful conviction cases. <em>See, e.g., Limome v. United States, </em>579 F.3d 79, 103-07 (1st Cir. 2009) (approving district court award of $1,000,000 per plaintiff per year for wrongful incarcerations of between eighteen and thirty-three years, but noting that this was at the high end of what would be permissible); <em>Smith v. City of Oakland, </em>538 F.Supp.2d 1217, 1242 (N.D. Cal. 2008) (\u201c[A] number of verdicts of approximately $1 million per year have been awarded in cases involving periods of wrongful incarceration which span a significant amount of time.\u201d (collecting cases)); <em>Sital v. City of New York, </em>60 A.D.3d 465, 875 N.Y.S.2d-22, 23 (1st Dep\u2019t 2009) (acknowledging reasonableness of a $150,000 award for a false arrest claim with an associated twenty hours imprisonment and approving a $1.6 million award for a malicious prosecution claim with an associated eleven months imprisonment); <em>Haynes v. City of New York, </em>29 A.D.3d 521, 815 N.Y.S.2d 143, 145 (2d Dep\u2019t 2006) (acknowledging reasonableness of a $1 million award on a malicious prosecution claim where the plaintiff was incarcerated for four months and of a $250,000 award for a false arrest claim). Plaintiffs and the district court cited scores of cases, federal and state, with awards in a similar range. The fact that some state cases, cited by Volpe, yielded lower damage awards does not mean that the district court\u2019s conclusion was an abuse of discretion, as we \u201cneed not average the high and low awards,\u201d and rather focus on \u201cwhether the verdict lies within the reasonable range.\u201d <em>Zeno, </em>702 F.3d at 671; <em>see id. </em>at 673 (rejecting contention that an award shocks the conscience when it was \u201clocated within the range of permissible decisions\u201d). The evidence shows that, as can be expected, plaintiffs suffered grave harm from their 18 years of wrongful incarceration, including adverse psychiatric effects, loss of relationships with family members, and stigma due to the nature of the crimes they were convicted of\u2014and resulting violence against them while incarcerated.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in holding that the jury award did not shock the conscience or materially deviate from what would be reasonable compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">VI. Attorneys\u2019 Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Finally, Volpe argues that the district court\u2019s award of $4,997,914.55 in attorneys\u2019 fees to plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys from the law firm Neufeld Scheck <em>&amp; </em>Brustin, LLP (\u201cNSB\u201d) should be reduced to no more than $3,000,000. As discussed above, the district court compensated NSB attorneys at the Southern District of New York rates they had proposed, ranging from $250 an hour to $700 an hour for attorneys, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>$125 an hour for paralegals, for 11,222.6 hours of attorney and paralegal work.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Section 1988(b) of Title 42 provides that, as is relevant here, in actions brought to enforce Section 1988, \u201cthe court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs.\u201d \u201c[A] \u2018reasonable\u2019 fee is a fee that is sufficient to induce a capable attorney to undertake the representation of a meritorious civil rights case.\u201d <em>Perdue v. Kenny A. ex rel. Winn, </em>559 U.S. 542, 552, 130 S.Ct. 1662, 176 L.Ed.2d 494 (2010). The district court here derived the fee award through application of the lodestar method, multiplying the number of hours the court found that NSB attorneys reasonably spent litigating the ease by hourly rates it found reasonable. The Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe lodestar method yields a fee that is presumptively sufficient to achieve [the] objective\u201d of Section 1988(b). <em>Id.; see also Stanczyk v. City of New York, </em>752 F.3d 273, 284 (2d Cir. 2014). Volpe does not contest the method by which the court calculated attorneys\u2019 fees, but contends that both the hourly rates and the number of hours reimbursed were excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">The Supreme Court has emphasized that \u201cthe determination of fees \u2018should not result in a second major litigation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fox v. Vice, </em>563 U.S. 826, 838, 131 S.Ct. 2205, 180 L.Ed.2d 45 (2011) (quoting <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 437, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983)). Instead, it has instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-7\">The fee applicant ... must, of course, submit appropriate documentation to meet the burden of establishing entitlement to an award. But trial courts need not, and indeed should not, become green-eyeshade accountants. The essential goal in shifting fees ... is to do rough justice, not to achieve auditing perfection. So trial courts may take into account their overall sense of a suit, and may use estimates in calculating and allocating an attorney\u2019s time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-9\"><em>Id. </em>(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">Further, our review of the district court\u2019s fee award is limited and deferential, as we review only for abuse of discretion. <em>See id. </em>(\u201c[AJppellate courts must give substantial deference to these determinations [regarding fee awards], in light of the district court\u2019s superior understanding of the litigation. We can hardly think of a sphere of judicial decisionmaking in which appellate micromanagement has less to recommend it.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)); <em>Merck Eprova AG v. Gnosis S.p.A., </em>760 F.3d 247, 265-66 (2d Cir. 2014) (\u201cGiven the district court\u2019s inherent institutional advantages in this area, our review of a district court\u2019s fee award is highly deferential.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). \u201cIndeed \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019\u2014already one of the most deferential standards of review\u2014takes on special significance when reviewing fee decisions.\u201d <em>Goldberger v. Integrated Res., Inc., </em>209 F.3d 43, 47 (2d Cir. 2000). The district court has presided from the filing of the complaint in 2008 until the appeal was filed at the end of 2014, overseeing two trials, a lengthy <em>Daubert </em>hearing, and numerous pre- and post-trial motions, and clearly has an intimate familiarity with the record and lawyering of this case; as such, we should be especially deferential to the district court\u2019s findings with respect to the reasonableness of attorneys\u2019 fees. Bearing in mind this background, we turn to Volpe\u2019s arguments regarding the district court\u2019s fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">A. Hourly Rates</p>\n<p id=\"b611-12\">First, Volpe contends that the district court erred in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>based on the higher rates typical of the Southern District of New York, where NSB is located, rather than the slightly lower rates awarded in the Eastern District of New York, where the case was tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">When determining attorneys\u2019 fees under the lodestar approach, courts apply the forum rule. \u201cAccording to the forum rule, courts should generally use the hourly rates employed in the district in which the reviewing court sits in calculating the presumptively reasonable fee.\u201d <em>Simmons v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth., </em>575 F.3d 170, 174 (2d Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Gierlinger v. Gleason, </em>160 F.3d 858, 882 (2d Cir. 1998) (providing that, in calculating the lodestar amount, the rates used generally \u201care the market rates prevailing in the community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill, experience, and reputation\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). \u201c[I]n order to receive an attorney\u2019s fee award based on higher out-of-district rates, a litigant must overcome a presumption in favor of the forum rule, by persuasively establishing that a reasonable client would have selected out-of-district counsel because doing so would likely (not just possibly) produce a substantially better net result.\u201d <em>Simmons, </em>575 F.3d at 172; <em>see also id. </em>at 174 (\u201cThe court may apply an out-of-district rate (or some other rate, based on the aforementioned case-specific variables) if, in calculating the presumptively reasonable fee, it is clear that a reasonable, paying client would have paid those higher rates.\u201d (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted)). Indeed, the \u201ctouchstone\u201d of the forum rule doctrine, as well as for awarding attorneys\u2019 fees in civil rights cases, is that \u201cdistrict courts should award fees <em>just high enough </em>to attract competent counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 176 (some internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Arbor Hill Concerned Citizens Neighborhood Ass\u2019n v. County of Albany, </em>493 F.3d 110, 121 (2d Cir. 2007), <em>amended on other grounds, </em>522 F.3d 182 (2d Cir. 2008), <em>and </em>575 F.3d 170 (2d Cir. 2009). Therefore, to rebut the presumption that the forum rule applies, the party seeking higher fees \u201cmust make a particularized showing, not only that the selection of out-of-district counsel was predicated on experience-based, objective factors, but also of the likelihood that use of in-district counsel would produce a substantially inferior result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Relevant factors include whether counsel has \u201cspecial expertise in litigating the particular type of case, if the case is of such nature as to benefit from special expertise,\u201d whether any \u201cin-district counsel possessed such expertise,\u201d and whether \u201clocal counsel possessing requisite experience were unwilling or unable to take the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The district court, in response to NSB\u2019s request for Southern District of New York rates, rather than Eastern District of New York rates, concluded that NSB had made the necessary particularized showing sufficient to overcome the forum rule. The court found that NSB has particular experience litigating wrongful conviction suits and has successfully litigated dozens of these cases nationwide, and that this experience was necessary given that \u201cthis case was exceedingly arduous and complex, involving extensive expert analysis and presentation of DNA evidence, spanning eight years and two trials.\u201d Supp. Special App\u2019x at 7. The district court further noted that defendants \u201cdo not dispute that no lawyers with primary offices in the Eastern District of New York have obtained a successful jury verdict in a [Section] 1983 wrongful conviction suit, as NSB did here.\u201d Supp. Special App\u2019x at 7. Finally, the court found that NSB achieved an excellent result in a particularly complicated case.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Having reviewed this record, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in applying higher out-of-district rates in the lodestar calculation. Volpe argues that the district court, in deciding to apply the higher rates, placed undue weight on the jury award obtained and its conclusion that NSB achieved an excellent result. We disagree. The district court properly considered the relevant factors, which can include litigation results where \u201cthey are a direct result of the quality of the attorney\u2019s performance,\u201d <em>Millea v. Metro-North R.R. Co., </em>658 F.3d 154, 168 (2d Cir. 2011), and where litigation results can inform whether obtaining out-of-district counsel was likely to produce a substantially better net result. Volpe also claims that the case and underlying facts were not complex, and that expert counsel was not required. But the district court was in a better position than we are to assess the complexity of the case and the need for expert counsel, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that this factor, as well as several others, pointed toward application of the forum rule being inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">Volpe also contends that a higher award was not necessary to attract out-of-district counsel because NSB took the case knowing that the forum rule meant that there was a presumption in favor of the lower Eastern District rates. Volpe further suggests that NSB has its own Eastern District rates, based on its fee submission to the district court. Contrary to Volpe\u2019s intimations, NSB does not have a separate set of rates it charges to clients when litigating in the Eastern District of New York. Rather, the law firm provided rates it thought were reasonable if the district court chose to apply the forum rule, in addition to the rates it thought were reasonable if Southern District rates were applied. Further, if the standard were as Volpe claims, no out-of-district attorney would be able to rebut the forum rule\u2019s presumption because of the mere fact that he took the case. The district court properly considered the relevant factors and evidence, and did not abuse its discretion in awarding the higher Southern District of New York rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">B. Number of Hours</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Volpe also challenges the number of hours reimbursed by the district court. Volpe contends that the hours for which NSB was reimbursed should have been reduced by at least 25% due to block billing and failure to keep contemporaneous time records, billing for claims that were dismissed or withdrawn, and excessive hours spent on the fee award application. As noted, NSB requested reimbursement for a total of 11,222.6 hours of attorney time over the eight years this case was litigated in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">First, attorneys are required to keep and submit contemporaneous records with their fee applications, absent unusual circumstances outside the attorney\u2019s control. <em>See Scott v. City of New York, </em>643 F.3d 56, 58 (2d Cir. 2011). But, despite Volpe\u2019s claims, the evidence demonstrates that NSB did keep contemporaneous records. Indeed, NSB did not request reimbursement for attorney time spent where the attorney or paralegal did not keep contemporaneous records or where the contemporaneous records were lost.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar9\">Volpe next asserts that block billing rendered NSB\u2019s records inadequate. Although block billing is not preferred, it is permissible so long as the records allow the court to conduct a meaningful review of the hours requested. <em>See Merck Eprova, </em>760 F.3d at 266 (affirming where the district court rejected defendant\u2019s challenges to the use of block billing, vague descriptions of work, and overabundant staffing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>because \u201ctrial is a time consuming process\u201d and the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding the hours expended were reasonable). The district court did not err in rejecting this challenge. The district court was able to adequately review the hours requested, struck hours of travel time billed as attorney work time, and did not abuse its discretion in finding the hours expended to be reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"> Next, Volpe challenges the district court\u2019s decision to award fees based on claims other than plaintiffs\u2019 prevailing claims against Volpe. \u201c[Pjlaintiffs may receive fees under [Section] 1988 even if they are not victorious on every claim,\u201d as a \u201ccivil rights plaintiff who obtains meaningful relief has corrected a violation of federal law and, in so doing, has vindicated Congress\u2019s statutory purposes.\u201d <em>Fox, </em>563 U.S. at 834,131 S.Ct. 2205.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-5\">A court should compensate the plaintiff for the time his attorney reasonably spent in achieving the favorable outcome, even if \u201cthe plaintiff failed to prevail on every contention.\u201d The fee award, of course, should not reimburse the plaintiff for work performed on claims that bore no relation to the grant of relief: Such work \u201ccannot be deemed to have been expended in pursuit of the ultimate result achieved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-6\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 435, 103 S.Ct. 1933). Although attorneys should not be reimbursed for then- work on claims that \u201cbore no relation to the grant of relief,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u201c[wjhere the district court determines that the successful and unsuccessful claims are inextricably intertwined and involve a common core of facts or are based on related legal theories, it is not an abuse of discretion for the court to award the entire fee,\u201d <em>Reed v. A.W. Lawrence &amp; Co., </em>95 F.3d 1170, 1183 (2d Cir. 1996) (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). The district court determined here that successful claims were inextricably intertwined with the unsuccessful claims, and that the successful and unsuccessful claims involved both a common core of facts and were based on related legal theories. Having reviewed the record, keeping in mind the superior position of the district court, we conclude that this finding was not clearly erroneous, and the district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in awarding the entire fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Finally, Volpe challenges the award of $97,132.50 for the time spent preparing the fee award application. In particular, Volpe contends that if NSB kept better time records, it would not have taken as long to prepare the fee award, and that NSB should not be reimbursed for time spent arguing that the forum rule should not apply. Reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees for preparing the fee application are compensable. <em>See Reed, </em>95 F.3d at 1183. Here, the district court rejected Volpe\u2019s challenge that NSB spent an excessive number of hours preparing the fee application on the ground that the \u201cbrief does not cite to any relevant precedent and makes only conclusory arguments.\u201d Supp. Special App\u2019x at 14 n.6. This determination was not an abuse of discretion, as \u201cwhen, as here, a fee target has failed to offer either countervailing evidence or persuasive argumentation in support of its position, [it is not] the district court\u2019s job either to do the target\u2019s homework or to take heroic measures aimed at salvaging the target from the predictable consequences of self-indulgent lassitude.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Keshner v. Nursing Pers. Home Care, </em>794 F.3d 232, 236 (2d Cir. 2015) (alterations omitted) (quoting <em>Foley v. City of Lowell, </em>948 F.2d 10, 21 (1st Cir. 1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s award of $4,997,914.55 in attorneys\u2019 fees to NSB.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">We have considered all of Volpe\u2019s arguments on this appeal, and have found no basis for reversal.

The district court's reading of <em>Boyd </em>as excluding all evidence that was inadmissible in the criminal trial places too high of a burden on defendants in malicious prosecution cases, as it prohibits them from relying on evidence that only retrospectively was deemed inadmissible, even if, at the time the prosecution was brought, the defendants reasonably believed the evidence would ultimately be ruled admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Plaintiffs assert that our Court affirmed the district court\u2019s reading of <em>Boyd </em>in <em>Kogut v. County of Nassau, </em>789 F.3d 36 (2d Cir. 2015). We disagree. Although our Court assumed in <em>Kogut </em>that the district court\u2019s reading of <em>Boyd </em>was correct, it did not have the opportunity to decide this issue. In that appeal, Kogut challenged the admission of three statements made by Restivo and Halstead, arguing that those statements should not have been admitted at the civil trial as evidence of probable cause. Our Court rejected this challenge, reasoning that Kogut did not establish that the admitted statements caused any actual prejudice, <em>Id. </em>at 44-45. The Court therefore did not assess the district court\u2019s reading of <em>Boyd. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Finally, Volpe's reading of <em>Boyd </em>as excluding evidence that is only inadmissible at the civil trial both cannot be squared with the text of <em>Boyd </em>and renders the holding of <em>Boyd </em>a tautology: evidence that is inadmissible at the civil trial cannot be admitted at that trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b594-4\">.

We easily reject this challenge, and defer to the jury and district court\u2019s determination of the appropriate measure of damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b615-5\">DEBRA ANN LIVINGSTON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ACK\">concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">I concur in the majority of the panel\u2019s opinion, but write to register my dissent on the issue of setoff. The majority holds today that because, in its judgment, the considered damages award made by the jury in this case is insufficient to compensate the plaintiffs for the harm that they suffered, the defendant is not entitled to set that award off against the amount the plaintiffs already received in settling claims arising out of their injuries. Because this result is inconsistent with the familiar rule against double recovery, and therefore with our, and the available Supreme Court, precedent, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">I begin, as the majority does, with the text of the statute. Section 1988 provides that federal jurisdiction over section 1983 cases \u201cshall be exercised and enforced in conformity with the laws of the United States.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. Only where federal law is \u201cnot adapted to\u201d use in these and similar cases, \u201cthe common law, as modified and changed by the ... statutes of the State\u201d where the court sits, applies \u201cso far as the same is not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, in determining the scope of the remedies available in a section 1983 action, the statute requires us to look first to federal law for guidance. The majority holds that we can sidestep application of clear rules of federal law because federal law is not adapted to resolve the questions in this case; I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">First, our precedent is clear that the common law rule against double recovery is applicable in the section 1983 context. We have even reversed jury awards in section 1983 cases where the district court failed to give an instruction on the rule against double recovery on the grounds that such an omission \u201crisk[s], if not in-vit\u00e9is], duplication\u201d of damages. <em>Bender v. City of New York, 78 </em>F.3d 787, 794 (2d Cir. 1996). Cognizant of this concern, we specifically noted that an acceptable jury instruction would inform the jury that \u201c[t]he plaintiff may not recover twice for the same injury. Accordingly, if you find that the plaintiff is entitled to a verdict on both [a federal-law based] excessive force claim and [a state-law based] claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, you may not compensate her twice for any emotional distress she might have suffered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 794 n.5. In other words, <em>Bender </em>confirms as a clear rule of federal law that, where a section 1983 claim lies against two separate defendants, or where a section 1983 claim parallels a state-law tort claim targeting a substantially similar harm, the rule against double recovery limits the recovery available to the plaintiff to a single assessment of damages. <em>See id. </em>at 793-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">Other circuits to weigh in on the question have ruled similarly. Thus, where a section 1983 claim and a state claim \u201carise from the same operative facts, and seek identical relief, an award of damages under both theories will constitute double recovery.\u201d <em>U.S. Indus., Inc. v. Touche Ross &amp; Co., </em>854 F.2d 1223, 1259 (10th Cir. 1988); <em>see also Medina v. District of Columbia, </em>643 F.3d 323, 328 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (same); <em>Bogan v. City of Boston, </em>489 F.3d 417, 426 (1st Cir. 2007) (same); <em>Braley v. City of Pontiac, </em>906 F.2d 220, 224 (6th Cir. 1990) (same). In sum, it is widely accepted as a matter of federal law that a plaintiff may not recover twice on parallel state- and federal-law claims and hence that the plaintiff must generally set off any recovery he or she is awarded in prosecuting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>one claim by the amount attributable to the other. I take it that the majority is in complete agreement with this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">The state action settled by the plaintiffs in this case was brought under New York Court of Claims Act \u00a7 8-b, which was designed to provide a mechanism to compensate those wrongfully convicted who can demonstrate their innocence by clear and convincing evidence for the harm caused by their unjust conviction and imprisonment. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 8-b(l). This law was, in fact, passed with the malicious prosecution tort, one of the predicates for the plaintiffs\u2019 section 1983 action here, in mind, and was designed to offer the wrongfully imprisoned a parallel avenue to recovery in recognition of the substantial legal roadblocks that often exist to the prosecution of tort-based claims. <em>See </em>App\u2019x Rep. of L. Revision Comm\u2019n at 7-11, Bill Jacket, L, 1984, ch. 1009. Thus, the section 8-b action was designed to make it easier for plaintiffs like Restivo and Halstead to recover for some of the very torts and the very harms that are at the center of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">If, as we explained in <em>Bender, </em>two different claims, such as an excessive force claim and an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim, can be parallel actions with respect to which double recovery is barred, a similar rule necessarily applies to a section 8-b action and its related section 1983 action. Absent a clear difference between the two cases, it is just untenable to suggest that the relevant federal rule barring recovery is so unclear that it is not determinative of the issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The majority argues that the fact that the State of New York is not a proper party to a section 1983 suit somehow differentiates this case from all other section 1983 cases. But New York\u2019s immunity from a section 1983 suit is merely a function of the Eleventh Amendment and the latitude our federal system affords to the states under sovereign immunity doctrine. <em>See Will v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 66-67,109 S.Ct. 2304,105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989). To invoke this immunity in the way that the majority has turns it on its head: rather than protecting states from suit, it means that when a state opens up an avenue for recompense to those harmed (even if unintentionally) by the actions of its localities and the police officers who serve in the state, no credit is given for that payment when those same police officers and localities are subject to suit in a section 1983 action. I can only hope that states seeking to clear the path to compensation for the wrongfully convicted do not hesitate to do so as a result of the majority\u2019s decision today.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">In any case, this single difference cannot bear the weight that the majority ascribes to it. The rule against double recovery is designed to prevent a plaintiff from recovering twice for the same harms, and that general rule bars such recovery even in the absence of an explicit statutory command. In <em>United States v. Nucci, </em>364 F.3d 419 (2d Cir. 2004), for instance, we held that the background common law rule against double recovery demanded that the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (\u201cMVRA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A, be read to require the reduction of any award under the MVRA by amounts already paid to the victim, despite the MVRA\u2019s silence on this point. The bare fact that New York is not a proper party to a section 1983 suit similarly does not justify declining to apply this background common law rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-12\">It is, further, generally accepted that the rule against double recovery extends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>across jurisdictional bounds. Where a plaintiff is barred from suit due, for instance, to an arbitration agreement, a different plaintiff with the ability to sue on the first plaintiffs behalf under an alternate legal theory must offset any recovery against amounts obtained by the first plaintiff in the forum available to him. <em>EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., </em>534 U.S. 279, 296-97, 122 S.Ct. 754, 151 L.Ed.2d 755 (2002). As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Waffle House, </em>this rule applies because \u201cit goes without saying that the courts can and should preclude double recovery by an individual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 297,122 S.Ct. 754 (internal quotation marks omitted). In sum, though New York is exposed to liability only in a separate section 8-b proceeding, because that proceeding is focused on the same operative facts and harms as at issue in this case, the basic rule against double recovery should likewise apply. <em>Dionne v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Balt., </em>40 F.3d 677, 685 (4th Cir. 1994) (holding that damages awarded under section 1983 would \u201cbe reduced by the amount of any duplica-tive monetary relief recovered in an earlier administrative proceeding\u201d held before Baltimore\u2019s civil service commission).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Much as it is clear that the background rule in federal law militates against double recovery, it is also not subject to dispute that this background federal rule applies even when, as here, one party from whom the plaintiff might recover settles the potential claim against it. <em>See Waffle House, </em>534 U.S. at 296, 122 S.Ct. 754 (discussing the availability of an offset against amounts the plaintiff recovered by settlement); <em>McDermott, Inc. v. AmClyde, </em>511 U.S. 202, 208-09, 114 S.Ct. 1461, 128 L.Ed.2d 148 (1994) (discussing various methods of calculating the offset appropriate after settlement). This would naturally suggest that the full amount of Restivo and Halstead\u2019s settlements in the section 8-b action, or $2.2 million each, should be set off against each $18 million jury award respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">The majority suggests that this general rule is inapplicable because the jury never had the opportunity to consider what portion of the plaintiffs\u2019 damages should be deemed as paid pursuant to New York\u2019s section 8-b settlement. Significantly, however, it cites no authority to this effect, for this so-called exception is simply not the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">At bottom, the majority\u2019s position effectively transforms the Supreme Court\u2019s effort in <em>McDermott </em>to carefully tailor the rule against double recovery into a rule that no double recovery exists on the facts of this ease at all. To be clear,- if the plaintiffs\u2019 claims in the state section 8-b action and in this section 1983 suit had articulated two entirely different <em>injuries, </em>each of which independently justified recompense, offsetting these two recoveries would not be appropriate. <em>See Bender, </em>78 F.3d at 794 n.5. Thus, if it were the case that the section 8-b proceeding was tailored towards compensating Restivo and Halstead for some harm not considered by the jury at the damages phase of the. section 1983 trial, then the general rule against double recovery would be inapplicable. . But the majority does not even attempt to show how this proposition applies in the present circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">At the damages phase of the trial, the jury heard substantial' testimony from, among others, psychiatric professionals and Restivo and Halstead themselves, describing the effect that nearly eighteen years\u2019 imprisonment had on them psychologically, emotionally, and socially. As Res-tivo and Halstead\u2019s attorney made clear in his opening statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-10\">We will be asking you to deliver a verdict that fully valued John [Restivo] and Dennis [Halstead] as human beings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>for the first time in 30 years.... When you value their 18 years in prison, their 6,566 days of incarceration, I want you to remember a few things. When you value their suffering that continues to-date and will last the rest of their life, keep these things in mind. Remember all the things they missed: 18 years of birthdays and Christmases and Easters and Thanksgivings; all the dance recitals and school plays; all the first base hits; the football games[;] the softball games; all the school dances and proms and first dates; all the graduations, all the weddings, all the funerals, communions, all the grandkids and their birthdays and their first steps.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Damages Trial Tr. at 22; see also Damages Trial Tr. at 581-82 (jury charge describing the range of harms\u2014including \u201cEmotional pain and suffering,\u201d \u201c[l]oss of liberty,\u201d and the \u201closs of family connections and family interactions\u201d\u2014that the jury was to consider in calculating the appropriate award).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">With this, and all the supporting evidence put before the jury over three days of trial, I find it nearly impossible to characterize the jury\u2019s verdict in this case as <em>not </em>targeted at making Restivo and Hal-stead whole for their time in prison\u2014at least to the extent that monetary damages can ever appropriately compensate someone for wrongful incarceration or a similarly pervasive injury. And it is just this sort of injury\u2014the result of \u201cwrongful convict[ion] ... and subsequent^ ] impri-sonfment]\u201d\u2014for which New York\u2019s section 8-b action seeks to compensate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">Because the rule against double recovery is designed to afford a plaintiff full, but only one, recovery for his compensable injury even where brought under distinct causes of action or in different forums, common law principles incorporated into federal law require offsetting Restivo and Halstead\u2019s recovery in this case by the amount each has already received for those harms as a result of the section 8-b proceeding. And because this rule is dictated by specific background principles of federal law, consistently applied, it is, under section 1988, decisive to the outcome in this case. Accordingly, I would vacate and remand to the district court with instructions to enter judgment for the plaintiffs in the amount of the jury\u2019s award, less the amount each received in settling their respective section 8-b claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">As a final note, it is worth distilling the essential difference between my approach and the path the majority takes. The Supreme Court has long explained that a rule adopted under section 1988, even if derived from state law, is always ultimately a federal rule. <em>Robertson v. Wegmann, </em>436 U.S. 584, 588, 98 S.Ct. 1991, 56 L.Ed.2d 554 (1978); <em>see also Valley Disposal, Inc. v. Cent. Vt. Solid Waste Mgmt. Dist., </em>113 F.3d 357, 362 (2d Cir. 1997). The majority chooses to reject a state-law rule in favor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>of a federal rule of its own construction. I would hold that the federal law applicable here is clear, but even if it were not, I would think that the federal rule that we apply should be one consistent with available federal-law principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-7\">. The central case the majority consistently relies on to structure its arguments to the contrary, <em>Dobson v. Camden, </em>705 F.2d 759 (5th Cir. 1983), was later vacated by the full Fifth Circuit, sitting <em>en banc, see id., </em>725 F.2d 1003 (5th Cir. 1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b618-6\">. The holding of New York\u2019s state courts that, because of the \"traditional rule against double recovery,\u201d a plaintiff who has received compensation pursuant to a section 1983 action must offset any compensation he receives in an action under section 8-b by the amount of the section 1983 recovery, is instructive here. <em>See Carter v. State, </em>154 A.D.2d 642, 644, 546 N.Y.S.2d 648 (2d Dep\u2019t 1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b618-7\">. Because I think that the rule against double recoveries clearly applies, I would not attempt to define the \u201cpolicies\u201d of section 1983, but pause here only to note that, in a world in which police officers are, as was the case here, frequently indemnified by the states and localities they serve, it is far from clear that declining to apply the rule against double recovery does anything more than impose higher costs on the ultimate payors\u2014who were, on the facts of this case, insulated from suit under section 1983\u2014beyond the level of liability determined by a jury after a fair trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
