The district court sentenced him to a total of 600 months in prison. Scheels contends that the district court erred in calculating his guideline range by imposing a four-level enhancement under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>\u00a7 2G2.1(b)(4) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1350-4\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s legal interpretations of the Sentencing Guidelines under a de novo standard of review....\u201d United States v. Zaldivar, 615 F.3d 1346, 1350 (11th Cir. 2010). Section 2G2.1(b)(4) requires the imposition of a four-level enhancement where a defendant\u2019s \u201coffense involved material that portrays sadistic or masochistic conduct or other depictions of violence.\u201d Scheels does not argue that the pornography he produced does not depict \u201csadistic or masochistic conduct.\u201d Indeed, he admits that it contains, among other things, images involving whipping and bondage. But Scheels argues that, notwithstanding that content, the \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(4) enhancement should not apply to him, because the \u201csadistic or masochistic conduct\u201d in his pornography was directed at him, not the child victim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-5\">The plain language of \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(4) requires only that an offense \u201cinvolve[ ] ... sadistic or masochistic conduct,\u201d not that that conduct be directed at the victim. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(4) (emphasis added). \u201cThe language of the Sentencing Guidelines, like the language of a statute, must be given its plain and ordinary' meaning\u2014 \u201d United States v. Fulford, 662 F.3d 1174, 1177 (11th Cir. 2011) (quotation marks omitted) (citation omitted). The ordinary meaning of \u201cinvolve,\u201d when used as a verb, is \u201c[t]o have as a necessary feature or consequence; entail,\u201d Involve, The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (5th ed. 2016), or \u201cto have within or as a part of itself,\u201d Involve, Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (11th ed. 2009). Moreover, under the guidelines, a defendant\u2019s \u201coffense\u201d includes \u201call acts and omissions committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused by the defendant.... \u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 1B1.1 cmt. n.l(H), lB1.3(a)(l)(A) (emphasis added). Here, a part of the production offense to which Scheels pleaded guilty was inducing or commanding a minor to participate in sadistic or masochistic conduct during the course of sexual activity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a result, his offense \u201cinvolved\u201d such conduct, regardless of whether the conduct was directed at him or the minor victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-10\">While acknowledging that there are no cases directly on point, Scheels argues that our past decisions and the decisions of our sister circuits cast doubt on our interpretation of \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(4). He cites a number of cases, like United States v. Hall, 312 F.3d 1250, 1261 (11th Cir. 2002) (quotation marks omitted), which contain statements like: \u201c[A] photograph is sadistic within the meaning of Section 2G2.2(b)(3)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> when it depicts the subjection of a young child to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>sexual act that would have to be painful.\u201d But those cases merely stand for the proposition that material depicting sadistic or masochistic conduct directed towards the child is sufficient to warrant the application of a \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(4) enhancement, not that it is necessary. Indeed, because the cases Scheels cites concerned material that contained sadistic or masochistic conduct directed at a minor, any statement by those courts suggesting that the images would not have justified applying the enhancement if they had shown the minor participating in sadistic or masochistic conduct directed towards the defendant is merely dicta. Pretka v. Kolter City Plaza II, Inc., 608 F.3d 744, 762 (11th Cir. 2010) (\u201cStatements in an opinion that are not fitted to the facts, or that extend further than the facts of that case, or that are not necessary to the decision of an appeal given the facts and circumstances of the case are dicta. We are not required to follow dicta in our prior decisions. Nor for that matter is anyone else,\u201d) (quotation marks and citations omitted). Given a choice between what is, at best, dicta from this and other circuits and the obvious meaning of the plain text of the guidelines, we choose the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-5\">The district court did not err by applying a four-level enhancement under \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(4) when calculating Scheels\u2019 guideline range.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1351-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1350-7\">.Based on the last presentence report prepared in this case, it appears that Scheels was sentenced based on the 2014 version of tire guidelines even though, by the time Scheels was sentenced, the 2015 version of the guidelines had become effective. But that has no impact on this appeal because there was no change to \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(4) of the guidelines between the 2014 and 2015 versions of the guidelines and Scheels does not challenge any other aspects of the district court\u2019s guidelines calculation. That said, when we cite to the guidelines in this opinion, we are referring to the 2015 version.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1350-11\">. As directed by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.4, Scheels\u2019 total offense level was calculated based on the production offense because\u2014of the charges to which Scheels pleaded guilty\u2014it had the highest offense level.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1350-12\">. Although Hall concerned \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3), which was subsequently renumbered \u00a7 202.2(b)(4), not \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(4), the language of the provisions is identical. Compare U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(4) (2015), whh id. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4) (2015) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3) (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1351-8\">. Because the application of \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(4) to this case is fully supported by the facts in the record, we need not address the effect of a stipulation in Scheels\u2019 plea agreement that the enhancement was supported by the undisputed facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
